projectzomboid,3dxiu0,formicarium,46,Mon Jul 20 10:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, zombies thumping on constructed walls is my least favorite gameplay mechanic in Project Zomboid. I think almost every complaint users have with the new build's difficulty would go away if the developers just removed this awful, arbitrary mechanic (or at least changed it so zombies don't break down walls while in passive mode). The addition of wandering hordes only exposed how bad an idea it truly is, and also made the entire farming skillset borderline unusable without exploiting AI pathfinding limitations. I don't even build safehouses anymore, I just use existing structures because they don't attract zombies.  There's something seriously wrong if it's safer to live in a house in the suburbs during a zombie apocalypse than in a player-constructed fortress in the middle of nowhere."

projectzomboid,3dxiu0,shantigilbert,4,Mon Jul 20 22:14:52 2015 UTC,Aye.
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,Hrodrik,8,Mon Jul 20 23:05:29 2015 UTC,I think an easy way to fix it would be doing just what you said and making it so they don't break stuff down if they aren't actively going after a player. Maybe just having them 'claw' at it for a short while if they bump into it before wandering off. They should only be actively trying to tear things down if they think there's food inside.
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,Onomous,27,Mon Jul 20 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"The issue is, the current way that zombie AI is setup goes: am I near something I can break? Break it! In a premade house, that means there are only a few points that a zombie will attack, windows and doors. For a player made house, that means they will attack every wall that they run into.  I would very much like to see that zombies will only try to break down a wall/door/window IF there is a indication that the player is behind it, be that by sound or sight or smell. As it stands now though, it really doesn't make sense as to why zombies will attack the walls like they do. You can even place a single wall piece by itself in the middle of a field and zombies will eventually bump into it and start breaking it down, yet they have the ability to preform complex path-finding through multiple windows/doors/stairs to get to the player.  I'm fine with a zombie beating up player made walls, they just need a reason first, that's all I'm asking for."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,Ortorin,4,Mon Jul 20 10:51:52 2015 UTC,"Effectively, right now it's random chance that a zombie may take an interest in an IsoThumpable object (pretty much the same way zombies spot players, just without the ""sneak"" stuff). It's not a guarantee that zombies will always thump a player-built construction.  And, of course, if one does, it may attract others, increasing the risk of simply letting it do its thing. If we really must have a sensible reason for this, think of it like this ""Oh, I ran into a wall. It made a noise! There's something there!"" Zombies aren't very bright, are they?  Probably needs to be balanced a bit now that zombies actually exist where people build their forts."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,EnigmaGrey,5,Tue Jul 21 04:55:58 2015 UTC,"While on the face of it the reason sounds fine, the problem is that members of a horde will visibly swerve towards your walls like guided missiles. Because they don't give a damn about regular walls it feels gimpy and unfair. After that point as a player you start trying to outsmart the AI rather than outsmart zombies, if that makes sense. You no longer trust them to act in a believable way, even though most of the things they do are fine. I'm not someone who's usually like 'Oh no my immersion' but this one does it to me.   That said I love the other changes and in general the game seems to be going in a really good direction."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,Ortorin,2,Tue Jul 21 07:16:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, I get that. I do agree that if they physically run into the wall then they should swing at it for a bit. Without any other reason than running into it, the zombie should lose interest after a dozen or two swings though. You still have all the base mechanics that are built-up so far: zombies like to thump on things they can, zombies can be lured to the area because of thumping, zombies will make hordes around a player built structure because of the mechanics before, but in order to balance that, IMO, they should lose interest quickly if they have no other input.  Edit* to add to that, though it might not make the most sense for how a zombie's brain might work, the creation of a short timer for after the zombie loses interest would stop any repeating wave patterns. That way, a zombie can run into a wall and thump it for a minute, a few other nearby zombies come over and thump it, and as each one loses interest the continuous thumping of the newer ones won't bring it right back to the wall. That is with the idea there there is no further input, of course."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,tehflambo,-7,Tue Jul 21 05:07:19 2015 UTC,"It'd be cool if what you describe is the default behavior, but either some zombies have different ""personalities"" that might predispose them to random acts of violence, some zombies maybe have some ""memory"" or something a la Walking Dead pilot (""hey, this was my house. I should break in"" or ""hey, this wall doesn't belong in this neighborhood! Grr.""), or, as a simplest resort, zombies sometimes do something random, eg. one zombie randomly punches wall, makes noise, cascades nearby zombies into thinking something interesting is going on."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,plasticslug,4,Mon Jul 20 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to randomly point out that in the remake and original night of the living dead, the reason why the zombie stormed the house was because of lights, gunshots and the constant hammering as they boarded up windows.  The jerk character in the movie wanted everyone boarded up downstairs and if they would would have done that the zombies would have simply passed the house and survived the night.   Anyway, I do agree, zombies should test everything meaning they could hit trees, walls, garage doors, regular doors and if nothing interest them, they should move on. I dont like the random magnet they are attracted to that includes windows, doors and player made objects.   They should be completely cut off from the rest of the world in terms what they are doing (until they see or hear something).  The mini hords have to end, last more than a month and you cant even walk 5 feet."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,12gabriel3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:53 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this yesterday, maybe the zombies should be much harder to fight. In this build the only real threats are enourmous hordes, so they have to make unrealistic amounts of zombies and this ridiculous spawn system. If they were tougher and in smaller numbers it would lead to much more fun situations in game and would go very well with the new stealth system they want to implement."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,12gabriel3,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting idea but I'm not sure that I agree.

projectzomboid,3dxiu0,NoxiousNick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"Well, if I have an axe or spiked bat, i can handle up to 10 or 12 zombies without TOO much trouble- spread em out to hit the fast ones a bit, then make sure you downswing to knock them out. Then the fact you can drop 2 at a time makes dealing with the group OK. A group that large is really the top end of what I feel comfortable dealing with all at once.   With merely a bat or lesser weapon, I'm much more cautious. It takes too many swings to kill them, so groups of 6 is really all I want to handle at once, though I would probably attack 8 if I felt so inclined and was not already exerted. I would again try to lead off one or two to their death before beginning.  Anything larger than that, I generally don't stick around long enough to methodically cut through them all at once. I try to peel them off or lead them away."

A random horde showing up on your doorstep is a challenge, multiple hordes a day becomes rote and annoying and takes a lot of the enjoyment out of long term survival.  Actually, that's a good way of describing the problems with the current build. They tried to make the game harder, but did so by making it more frustrating to play instead of adding a real difficulty curve."

projectzomboid,3dxiu0,Hrodrik,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"Various places in the outskirts of West Point, and zombies always find them sooner or later (especially once population ramps up). The best existing structure for a safehouse so far seems to be the picnic area south of the warehouse. It's separated from the town by a small forest and has multiple routes back to civilization. I rarely see zombies there, but every other spot I've picked in WP has been overrun within days.  I'm also playing with a two hour timescale, so zombies have more time to wander between metagame events. I believe respawning/migration is based on the in-game clock so it should be the same for other players."

projectzomboid,3dxiu0,StrictlyShane,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"Difference in terminology. I call those groups of ten to fifteen a horde, and their merged form a mega-horde (or just swear quietly to myself for a while). Wandering zombies are hardly rare even in the wilderness; my current survivalist character is less than a week in and already has 187 kills.  Regardless, the only difference between one group of fifty and five groups of ten on screen is that the latter is harder to avoid.  Edit: I should stress that I have no problem with hordes driving me out of my safehouse. It's just how common it is, combined with the fact that they destroy any player construction they stumble upon (and only player-built items). Being overrun when you're not even present is awful, especially since it doesn't happen if you use an existing structure.  Losing my safehouse after a few weeks is a tragedy and makes for a good story. I've had time to grow attached to it, so it makes an impact when I'm driven away. Losing every safehouse within days removes that impact and quickly becomes predictable and unfun."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,StrictlyShane,8,Tue Jul 21 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"Not really fun for me, and I love incredibly hard games, but it's an inappropriate frustrating kind of difficulty, rather than a believable and fun kind of difficulty.   It is fun if they are attracted to your base because you are in it and they can smell you, or smell something you are cooking, or they can see smoke from a fire, or lights inside when it is dark outside, or you are making too much noise, but it is not fun for them to randomly attack sections of wall just because they are there. If the walls completely obstruct their path finding (with a few AI caveats, e.g. hard to find gaps in a fence), and you have attracted them to your base for one reason or another, then sure, have them attack it, but don't make them randomly hit stuff that has no relevance to them - that detracts from the enjoyment of the game and harms the believability. I want to feel like I'm struggling to survive in a real zombie apocalypse!"
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,StrictlyShane,-4,Mon Jul 20 17:20:34 2015 UTC,"You people make me laugh. You talk about realism and believability yet in the same sentence, talk about wanting to singlehandedly construct huge forts and bases. In an actual zombie apocalypse, are you telling me you'd attempt to build a flimsy wooden fort, rather than selecting an already existing structure and fortifying the shit out of it? You'd rather hike into the middle of the woods, leaving yourself horrendously exposed, and build something from scratch? The amount of noise you'd create by chopping down trees, sawing logs and hammering nails, I'm not surprised zombies are destroying your bases."
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,StrictlyShane,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:24 2015 UTC,"Dude I'm not talking about a mega fort here, I'm talking a small wall around a yard, such as anyone might build in a zombie apocalypse if they had time and skills. I made a carpenter character - haven't played since last build and didn't realise this skillset was almost useless now.  The fact that a base is less rather than more safe after fortification doesn't seem annoying to you?"
projectzomboid,3dxiu0,J0hnm13,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:04:17 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I haven't come across the issue, or if I have, I haven't recognised it as one. After all, it's a zombie survival simulator and you're the only human currently. Who else are the zombies going to harass? I like the way the zombies are now, they're more of an actual threat. A few builds ago, I'd fortify a base, scavenge a few supplies and then just sit there, farming, without any disturbance even if I was located in the centre of town. 3 or 4 months would go by in a leisurely breeze. Now, I'm happy to get past a month. I live more nomadically. Get a sledgehammer, put a few sheet ropes up in several houses across town and destroy the stairs. Sure, the zombies come linger around, banging and breaking down the barricaded windows but that's to be expected.  People complain the zombies are lame. They change them. People still complain. Do you want the game to be easy or a challenge?"

This isn't me bitching about difficulty. What the changes + this old mechanic means is that one of my favourite parts of the old game, fortifying a safehouse, is basically no longer a viable option. I don't give a shit about living nomadically, so I'm glad you enjoy it but it's not my idea of fun. I want to improve my lot in life, like most people in a zombie apocalypse would probably want to.

Zombies will sneak and crawl around natural houses, and will plough through player made houses like a charging bull. Basically, you can NEVER build anything reliably on ground level anymore or hordes will roll through it... To be fair, it was the same problem before this update, it just happens much more often now.  In a controlled environment, if you build a full sized single story house identical to the prefab houses, plastered and everything, and then stick it along the road like a normal house, the zombies will still smash a straight line through the walls as they wander aimlessly, whereas the 'normal' houses they will wander around and through windows and doorways. Forget the ""zombies hear you building."" ANY clueless zombie will still smash through all the same if it's a homemade house.  This completely destroys any use of carpentry for long term survival. I agree with the others, I prefer base building survival over nomadic survival. No hate to those who prefer nomadic, it's everyone's game to play however they want, but I don't like to be forced into making a floating fortress with sheet ropes everywhere as the only viable base..."

projectzomboid,3dwhaj,ProbeOne,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:15 2015 UTC,holy hell that's a mean solution to crawlers.
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,terrordrone_nl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"The developers would have to make these items only spawn in specific places, like the bowling pins in a bowling alley, or craft-able through menu's, like the table leg when the player is next to a table and has the tools/strength to break a leg off of the table. Otherwise you'd end up with too much clutter in the game. Hydrocraft already feels like too much stuff, and half of it is useless. Weapons such as street signs and plungers aren't effective weapons, and become nothing more than bloat later on in the game, when you have a supply of decent tools. I do agree that this game could use more objects to murderize zombies with, but I'd like it if TIS kept the game clean of useless bloat items that are just there for the sake of being there as much as they can."
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,LandMineHare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:17 2015 UTC,street sign shields would be cool
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,Ortorin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:08 2015 UTC,Taser probably wouldn't do much to zombies as they're not really alive. It might make this muscles involuntarily twitch while being zapped but they won't become incapacitated. /nerd
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,Lyndan,3,Mon Jul 20 15:47:37 2015 UTC,I was just thinking it would be a quick and effective knockdown... you know... like a taser is.

projectzomboid,3dwhaj,InformativeHobo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:23:19 2015 UTC,"There definitely needs to be some variety in combat as well as weapons available. Right now knives function differently to other weapons, but you really have no need to use them in combat since they're just more dangerous."
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,Cazdon,2,Mon Jul 20 10:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see some more of the ""flavor"" stuff they're adding next build. I'm really looking forward to the more immersive gameplay.  also, i'd really enjoy it if they made it so when you climb a sheet rope, you can control your character, like when you climb a ladder in half life 2. i've lost two characters because i've climbed down sheet rope straight into a horde of zed."
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,rhou17,3,Tue Jul 21 01:09:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, first goal is always ""Must have Axe."" And while I'm in multiplayer everyone in melee has an Axe, no exception.  And while having a best tool is fine, I several tools to be the best in different categories too. Axe shouldn't be the best weapon for both base building and nomad play style and everything in between.  I don't even know how I would fix this either is the sad part. :/ If I don't get an Axe by the first week I generally consider the play through a failure, which I don't really enjoy. Hopefully with more weapon variety axes won't be such a necessity and I can be satisfied without one."
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,12gabriel3,5,Mon Jul 20 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"And while having a best tool is fine   Axes are definitely versatile, but I don't think they should be the end all be all on opening a door. Crowbar's should have a right click option called ""pry lock"" for doors that should be pretty damn effective."
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,patentmedicine,2,Mon Jul 20 06:06:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with the crowbar. Make it so you can almost always pry open windows, can pry open doors with some effort, and crowbars are now my weapon of choice."
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,Bobboy5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:25:22 2015 UTC,"Having similar weapons (bat/stick/branch/table leg or revolver/pistol/magnum) will surely add variety to the game, but I think they should add uniqueness to each weapon to solve this kind of problem.    If I have a strong character I might want to use a big weapon, capable of fending off zombies but with a lower speed, such as the axe. If my character is not as strong, maybe a hatchet is a good alternative, because it has faster attacks, but I got to be careful as I need to get closer and can't block attacks as easily. Now if I want to be real stealthy I might choose the kitchen knife, because I don't have to swing it, so it does much less noise.       I think this is the approach they should have to see different kinds of weapons being used."
projectzomboid,3dwhaj,Bobboy5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:33 2015 UTC,"Machetes. They sell machetes at Home Depot, and they'd be killer for the zombie apocalypse. Scythes at farms (tho these should take skill, or you'd hurt yourself). Chainsaws, which would require two-stroke fuel."

Also look into Hydrocraft, which extends the gameplay massively with new tools and weapons, big game hunting, animal breeding, and metallurgy.

projectzomboid,3dvp49,VolterTube,4,Mon Jul 20 15:01:50 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, direct confrontation is a last resort. Always try to escape first, and never start a fight with the undead unless you are more than 100% sure you can win. Even then, have an escape plan. That second floor jump might be worth it if you can get to safety... Or it could be a death sentence."
projectzomboid,3dvp49,MrBleach,2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"Well, one addition, smacking around zombies with your axe does directly improve the associated skills, so it can help you survive, but with the danger of infection on default settings, this isn't the type of game where one should be fighting for no reason other than fighting. At least if they want to live for long."

I find myself seeing things like a big duffle bag or a survival multi tool irl and it brings me back to the game mentally, like, ooh, I could really use that right now.  If you really let yourself get into the game it starts seeking into all parts of your life.  I've been watching real survival videos on youtube and honestly, it helps a lot with the game.  Oh, and its a great fix until Walking Dead is back in October..."

projectzomboid,3dwd4i,Ortorin,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:24 2015 UTC,Oh I saw your post!  I definitely agree it would help.  Lots of these Alphas/Early Access/Beta games in subreddits really need to post the build numbers as close as they guess.    I sure would help out a lot.  There's quite a bit changes always coming through and it makes quite a bit of difference.  Project Zomboid is definitely a game that needs that.  Keep spreading the word good man!

projectzomboid,3dw7ji,Gmodmadness,7,Mon Jul 20 01:20:57 2015 UTC,"I posted this back awhile ago:  ""Reality Sandbox Mode""  Zombie Count - High (For fun!)  Water Shutoff - 2-6 Months (With less people using water, it should take a bit for the pressure to die)  Locked Doors - Some (People will not be locking their doors when running away from the horde)  Zombie Re-spawn - 2 Months (Slow migrations from other areas instead of zombies asexually reproducing at a crazy rate)  Food - Normal OR Common/ Weapons - Rare OR Normal/ Other - Common (These item settings seem more like what is actually in an American household. If you play with more zombies then increase the number of items)  Zombie Lore  Speed - Fast Shambler (Slower than a human because of uncoordinated movements, but not laughably slower)  Toughness - Tough (The undead are relentless. Only a lucky or well placed shot will take them down quickly)  Memory - No (Zombies run off instinct, not any cognitive abilities)  Smell - Poor (The zombies are rotting, food is rotting, and the human nose isn't that great anyways)  All other settings are default, though for my own use I made the days an hour long."
