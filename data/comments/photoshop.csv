Those processes are probably proprietary information that was developed by the artist.  I think if you're really interested in learning how to do this, you'd want to start by becoming a very advanced user of Illustrator and Photoshop. But the amazing creativity is something the artist was probably born with. I mean, I've been using Photoshop for most of my life and am technically extremely advanced. I couldn't even come close to creating something like that. There really aren't any filters or anything that could give you that look. These illustrations were developed bit by bit.

And clipping blank layers to the shapes and filling in new colors use a textured brush. Depending on the effect you need...  Another way to add texture worth exploring (that was not used in the examples posted by OP, but worth mentioning) is to find a photo/scan of the texture you want and place it on top of your image (and adjust the color/brightness/contrast as needed), then experiment with the blending (depends a bit on the texture/effect you want).

Just play with the sliders a bit. Keep the sun clipping to white (and not light gray as in the edited version). :)  Still, you might want to adjust the child slightly separately from the background, and for that I recommend you move over to Photoshop. Try the Quick Selection Tool and Refine Edge (paint in the radius to get a soft selection for the hair and dress). Then add a Curves Adjustment Layer – the selection will turn into a layer mask (limiting the adjustment to just the girl).  Curves Adjustment Layers is what you should be using for 99% of your adjustments in Photoshop (it will give you fine control over brightness/contrast/white balance/color tint).

photoshop,3e20b9,chain83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:41:45 2015 UTC,"Are you absolutely sure that DOF is not done in-engine? Are you sure it is done afterwards in post? It would be 100x faster, easier, and better if you were able to get DOF rendered in-game (through mods or whatever)... Thinking about it, I'm guessing Source Filmmaker is probably the best solution. It will allow you to set up the scene the way you want, and you can import the cs:go models you need. And you have adjustable DOF.  If you have to do it in post, there are then two similar ways to go about it.  Modify how the scene renders to output three different screenshots. Just the foreground with weapon on a solid background (to put on top), normal screenshot (preferrably without the hands/weapon), and depth map of the normal screenshot. Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5cwNvYlSDw (just first thing i found on google)  If you find that too problematic, you will have to manually cut out the foreground (hands/weapons) in Photoshop. I still recommend getting two screenshots though. One with the weapon, and one without. Makes it easier for the blur later. Then manually draw paint a rough depth map for the scene. The point of a depth map is so that you can have a varying amount of blur depending on distance. However if you just want to give the entire background the same amount of blur you can skip it (and just separate the foreground/background on two layers, then blur background).  Use the lens blur filter to blur the background (if you copy your depth map into a channel you can tell the lens blur filter to use it). Another option (that renders faster) is the Blur Gallery but it doesn't allow a custom depth map (at best it gives you a smooth gradient by using the ""tilt-shift"" blur).  For lens flares you should never use the horrible, horrible, built-in ones in Photoshop as you might agree. You could create it manually (a simple version might be putting multiple copies of the highlights on new layers - screen or linear dodge blend mode - then give them varying amounts of blur/motion blur/opacity), or use a plugin like Knoll Light Factory."

Set it to Local Adaptation and tweak the settings until happy.  Should give you a starting point at least. You can also run a sharpening filter when done (like Unsharp Mask).  If you don't like the HDR Toning adjustment, you can do it more manually by first evening out the lighting (duplicate, desaturate, invert, blur, overlay blend mode or similar) and then increase local contrast (large radius sharpening with low strength).

photoshop,3dyyx0,ameoch,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a 3D model of the joker for starters. And some bats. So you need to know how to do 3D modeling. There are many programs that can do this, like 3DstudioMAX, Cinema4d, Blender, Maya, Zbrush (for the head), etc. You then need to create the textures for the model - here Photoshop could be used. You then set up the lighting the way you want and Render it to an image file (in this case I assume the bats and the joker were rendered as separate images).  Since you rendered the bats yourself they are already on transparent background and you simply place them on top of the joker image and position it as you want. Add a background behind the joker (e.g. a radial gradient or similar). Darken the joker's shadow side using Curves Adjustment layers or similar. Same goes for some of the bats (to make them ""disappear"" into shadow). It appears some texture might have been placed on top of joker's face in Photoshop, if so it's just a layer with some texture image (blended e.g. using soft light, and a layer mask limits the texture to the areas you want).  The floating particles/dust/things in the air is also just a separate layer on top (some image of dust etc.). Perhaps Screen blend mode (if the original particles background was black). Layer mask to hide parts you don't like/want.  Some overall color grading for the image using a Curves Adjustment Layer (or similar)."

You can see the vector points and handles that let you adjust and clean up the shape as necessary.  All I did was paste your image into Illustrator, click Image Trace (the default settings are fine) and then Expand (to convert it into editable shapes). Then you can remove the white parts with the direct select tool, and only have the black shape, in a fully vectorized object.

photoshop,3dvnv6,lilithness,4,Mon Jul 20 01:19:45 2015 UTC,"Most importantly I would say to get a copy of the Miller Lite graphic standards guide if you don't already have it. There are probably some rules you need to abide by and some of your work might already be done for you (e.g. font selection, color palettes). Show someone else your work if you can. Other people can pick up things you might not catch after working on a project for so long. Someone else might catch a misspelled word or something that moved out of place. I would suggest at some point looking into vector graphics and the pen tool in Photoshop. If you happen to have Illustrator, that is even better for vector work. I imagine you will run into some projects that will require vector work. If you don't already know, look at the difference between vector and raster images. Knowing how to work in vectors can make your job a whole lot easier when performing certain tasks. Finally, I'll just point out a few things I notice from new designers that are best avoided:   -too many fonts  -too many graphic effects. It's best not to over-complicate your designs  -designing for yourself and not your purpose. You might think a font or color is great but it might be a weird fit for what you're supposed to communicate.  Anyway, those are just a few things I thought were worth mentioning. Also, don't be afraid to experiment a little if you have the time. And if someone is negative toward your work, it doesn't always mean there is something wrong with the quality of your work. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes. Finally, enjoy your new position and best of luck! And sorry for the wall of text. :)"

Double-check that your image is actually sRGB. Go to Edit > Convert to Profile... to convert it.

photoshop,3dszhx,chain83,2,Sun Jul 19 05:52:35 2015 UTC,"So you're stuck with a rectangle...  You can't get rid of those edge pixels, an image is rectangular. you could code an image format to make it non rectangular, but you'd be the only person who'd understand the image format - I imagine you could code the start offset in pixels of where the data in this row starts, and then code the length of pixels for this row.... then code the ARGB values. Then repeat for the next row. The problem with this approach is circular - your program would crash reading the large image in before you could process it into your format.   but the problem is that my picture contains so many pixels that the program crashes.   Hm, this shouldn't happen. How are you loading the picture? How many megabytes is it?  What programming platform are you using?  If you ensure your TIFF file ISN'T compressed, then your solution is quite easy.....  Using a stream - open the tiff file and read in several rows, do what you want with them, calculate running averages, or filters, or whatever... just check before each pixel that it's not one of those white ones! ARGB(255,255,255,255) ?  Why are you using white? That sounds like it could be confused with a very bright specular of the leaf, and screw up your calculations on the leaf specular.  Usually for masks, Fuchsia is used. (R=255, G=0, B=255) - and for a leaf, you aren't ever going to see that color in the wild. Eample: http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Mewi/Modification/spritesheetpreview1.png  Then if you need to keep the altered image, stream those rows out to another new file you've made or just forget them, and keep the running totals in memory.  Next loop back around and read in the next few rows.  Remember, don't close the streams until all the data has been read!...  With TIFF you don't need to read the whole thing at once. If it where JPG you could still do this, but dealing with the 8x8 blocks of pixels the discrete fourier transforms produce would be a pain in the ass.

If 32-bit color mode in Photoshop worked like 16-bit mode it would be kinda pointless. However, it does not.  32-bit is meant for when you need HDR (high dynamic range). And indeed, switching to 32-bit in Photoshop will change it to a HDR document (so it's conceptually different than going between 8/16 bit).  Here is an illustration I made that shows what I mean: http://i.imgur.com/C5udfOy.jpg  Think of HDR as it allowing pixels to be brighter than 100% white, and darker than pure black. Retaining all that information, allowing you to adjust exposure. This is vital when doing e.g. 3D compositing. It is also always using a linear gamma for more realistic blending.    This is also good to demonstrate by doing two adjustments, first one that brightnes/darkens things until they go white/black, then with a 2nd adjustment you can still bring the information back into the visible range (if we have HDR). http://i.imgur.com/VhvOkvC.png"

photoshop,3ds9bh,Viking84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"Often when rendering 3D images or video it gets rendered as several passes. For example things like diffuse, shadows, reflections, specular highlights, effects, etc. will be separate files. They are then combined in software like Photoshop or AfterEffects to create the final image (or merge it with actual photos or video). This gives you a lot of flexibility and allows you to adjust the different elements separately without having to re-render (a time-consuming process). E.g. perhaps you want to reduce or increase the strength of the reflections, etc.  In this situation HDR/32-bit (and linear gamma) is important when you are going for realism as it is much more physically correct."

photoshop,3ds9bh,Reniva,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:08:32 2015 UTC,eh I find in some hues I can tell the difference between just one value difference. But the real purpose of 16 bit is for the editing versatility.
photoshop,3ds9bh,Thykka,2,Sun Jul 19 05:25:01 2015 UTC,"purpose of 16 bit is for the editing versatility   This is even more true for 32bpc. In areas such as video compositing, RAW-photography and HDR-graphics, it is essential to have more data than what is seen by the eye. Otherwise it'll be too easy to introduce artifacts, such as banding.  And as /u/siege72a mentioned, 32bpc can also be a floating point format, which means the brightness of a pixel can exceed the maximum white of the display. A practical example of this would be a photograph backlit by the sun; you don't want the sun to burn through, but you don't want the foreground to be underexposed. With floating point 32bpc you can have both. Your display (probably) can't show the full range of such an image, but that's what the view exposure value is for."
photoshop,3ds9bh,Reniva,2,Sun Jul 19 11:46:26 2015 UTC,"Is it me or I'm feeling disappointed on the fact that working on 32bpc in Photoshop feels really limited.  Like I can't save as .png, unable to use certain basic filters or even I can't convert them into Smart Object.  Not hating on 32bpc but I feel Photoshop doesn't really care about 32bpc, favours more on 8bpc. Only way to effectively use the 32bpc image is by using AE.  Correct me if I'm wrong."
photoshop,3ds9bh,Thykka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:33:42 2015 UTC,"It's limited, because 32bpc support is a relatively recent feature, and Adobe hasn't bothered to update all the tools to support such color modes. It's just laziness on their part.  As for 32bpc PNGs, the standard doesn't support it, so neither does Photoshop. You should probably be using EXR instead.  And with Photoshop it's not just the incomplete 32bpc support, there are some serious issues too, such as the lack of proper gamma correction controls etc."

If you map 0 to ""total darkness"" and 65535 to ""the sun"", what will happen? Except for specular highlights, ""normal"" levels of brightness will fall into the darker range and suffer from posterization. Try this with a camera -- spot meter for a specular highlight, and then try to restore the rest of the picture in post.   So that's where higher precision formats (floating point and exponents) come into play. Brightness is independent of color level, and there's enough granularity for full color data at all levels of brightness."

As you can see, the sun is completely burnt out at EV0, but at the lower EVs, everything else is underlit. This is incredibly important for realistic 3D rendering, else the specular highlights will be washed out and the lighting difference is way too small to have a proper sense of lighting."

It happens when saving PDF files with transparency flattening (PDF 1.3). This is a very old PDF version that is unlikely to ever be fixed. The only scenario where this should ever be used is if you are generating PDF files for print and the printing company don't want PDFs with transparency (due to old RIPs). The lines become apparent when rasterizing the PDF for use on screen (anti-aliasing issue I assume). The resolution you rasterize to can affect how and if the lines become visible.  In CS6, Adobe changed the rasterization engine in Photoshop, so all vector Smart Objects (and PDF files) get rasterized slightly differently than before. This had the side effect of making the lines more visible. This is why you noticed a difference from CS5.    The solution is to save PDF files as version 1.4 or newer, and stop using PDF 1.3.  If all you have is a PDF 1.3 file that has this problem, and it is for some reason impossible to get the original file, it sucks. I have not found any good workaround for the problem that suits all documents. If it's on a transparent background you could stack multiple copies of the problem areas to make the lines opaque again. You could also fix lines with the Healing Brush. Try rasterizing at different resolutions to see if the lines go away at some resolutions. Perhaps the PDF could also be rasterized at very high resolution without anti-aliasing (from Acrobat) and then downsampled in Photoshop afterwards (to remove the aliasing).

Say you import Image A at 200 ppi, Image B at 100 PPI, and Image C at 600 PPI then export to PDF at 300 PPI. In the PDF Image A will be 200 PPI, Image B will be 100 PPi, and Image C will be 300 PPI,"

Flickr seems to have some temporary issues?  Without having seen them though, I can try to guess what you want...   Do as much as possible in CameraRAW/Lightroom on the original RAW when starting out. Overall brightness/exposure/contrast and conversion to B&W. You can also add grain and vignetting here if you don't intend to do much further editing in Photoshop. It is super easy and quick!  In Photoshop, use Adjustment Layers. To make it Black and White, add the Black & White adjustment layer. To reduce the contrast (e.g. lift the black point and lower the white point - so popular these days) use a Curves Adjustment Layer. For vignetting, use another Curves layer, but use a radial gradient (or similar) for the mask. Grain (slightly blurry noise) you can add on a new layer on top. One quite flexible method is to make a 50% gray layer, convert it to a smart object, change blending mode to Overlay (or one of the other contrast blending modes - experiment!) and add first the Add Noise filter, and then a slight Gaussian Blur. Modify until happy."

So search google for something like this and download an actual film grain still and put it on top of your photo and use the overlay blending mode. Then Adjust the transparency to the desired effect. Then I would get into your levels and increase the slider to raise the blacks to a but higher so it's not so crushed. Then it would be just a matter of brightness and contrast to fine tune. Maybe use the ""shadows/highlights"" function as well."

photoshop,3dhrid,southafricannon,6,Thu Jul 16 11:16:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you can't make a raster image both larger and clearer. You always lose detail when enlarging.   A small print like this should be printed at 300ppi to be nice and clear. That's why it looked fuzzy when printed at 110ppi. The problem is that this image is only about 24x33mm @ 300ppi, so it needs to be stretched by nearly 300% and that's going to make it blurry.   There's really no magic bullet. You either stretch it before you print it, which will make it blurry, or print it at a less than ideal resolution, which, as you saw, will also make it blurry. You can try a combination of both methods and stretch it to, say, 63x93 @ 200ppi, but I'm not sure it'll look any better than your 110ppi print. You can also try different resampling algorithms to do the stretching, which will result in different types of blurry, one of which you may be able to live with, but in the end, I don't think you're going to get a sharp 63x93mm print of this image. By hey, there are people around here a lot smarter than I am and maybe one of them will see this and offer up a solution. :)"
photoshop,3dhrid,keithj5000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:27:25 2015 UTC,"As /u/keithj5000 said, you want to get this image up to 300 ppi for good sharpness when printing something for viewing up close. 200 ppi is the lowest I'd accept, but your card is currently only ~100 ppi. So let's upsample it as best we can (knowing that it will obviously not be as good as having it in high resolution to begin with).  When upsampling sharpness/details will suffer, but I think the ""illustration"" style of the contents of this card should make this somewhat acceptable by using some of the more intelligent resampling algorithms. I don't have any software here at the moment to try, but if you have Photoshop CC try the ""Preserve Details"" resampling method, and also test Perfect Resize 9 that you downloaded (I have never tried it). See what gives you the ""best"" result for your card.  The text (most important aspect of the card) will likely be a problem (it will look a bit wonky with ""smart"" resampling, or blurry with traditional bicubic resampling). To solve this (and focus on getting optimal resampling for the rest of the card) you should probably recreate the text. Use Clone Stamp Tool and Healing Brush to remove it, or if this is made from screenshots of a website, see if it's possible that the text and card image can be extracted as separate elements. Then text-tool to type it back in after resampling. This will ensure your text looks is perfect (although if you have many cards it will be a bit of work...)! :)"
photoshop,3dh249,thinkbk,7,Thu Jul 16 05:25:45 2015 UTC,"Thats a bit of retouching. The car is obviously been masked from the surroundings so the blurring does not affect it. After that the ground has probably been blurred with motion blur in 2-3 segments to follow the curvature of the road. Closer to camera = more motion blur and vice versa.   About the lighting, thats just a lot of curves adjustments, probably some sharpening, dodging and burning. Also stamp tool/heal brush to remove elements which are not necessary.  :)"

photoshop,3dh249,APurrSun,10,Thu Jul 16 07:55:25 2015 UTC,"I hope I'm not being a Captain Obvious here, but since you asked, the easiest way to understand masking in Photoshop is to relate it to a real world example. When you paint a room or a car, you use masking tape to cover up the areas you don't want painted. Then, when you're done painting, you remove the tape and you have nicely defined lines and everything looks awesome. This is the same type of idea in Photoshop, but just the ""digital"" version."
photoshop,3dh249,pgymjp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:29:09 2015 UTC,"Basically means isolating.  Say you put a gaussian blur filter layer, you could mask it so that it doesnt affect certain objects, like the car."

photoshop,3dh249,Arsky,3,Thu Jul 16 09:12:57 2015 UTC,"The button is located somewhere next to the button which you use to create a new layer. It is a circle in a rectangle.  Basically when you have a layer selected when you press the button, it creates a so called mask. By default it is white. Basic masking rule: white reveals black conceals. So if you want to hide something on your image, just paint it black instead of erasing it so you dont lose any of that precious image data!  When you want to reveal the image completely or temporrily disable the mask, SHIFT click the mask. When you want to enable it again, repeat.  When doing everything mentioned above make sure you have the mask selected :)"

Beyond that just paying attention to the sort of desaturated colors being used, and you should be able to recreate that sort of feel yourself I'd think without having to drop 99 buckaroos on it.

Proper lens flares, motion trails, creating halftones and raster patterns, FFT, frequency separations, etc... but enough about that!    Paper texture  Find a photo/scan of the paper/texture you want. Place it at the top with Multiply Blending Mode (or place it below your artwork and set the artwork to Multiply).  Poorly aligned colors  The colors being offset in relation to eachother can be done by converting to CMYK and moving the channels separately (either destructively in the channels panel, or non-destructively by using 4 Smart Objects and chaning the blending options to C, M and Y respectively).    If you have each color as a seprate layer/group and want to simulate not regular 4-color print but  that each color was essentially a spot color, just set all the layers to ""Multiply"" and move them around slightly.  Halfone pattern  Go to Filter > Pixellate > Color Halftone.  Consider converting to CMYK first to have more realistic colors and proper separation (important if you intend to also mess with the alignment!)    There's many more things going on in those examples on the webpage for the plugin (e.g. embossing, sharp corners getting rounded off, ""ink"" coverage being thicker near the edge of shapes, etc.), but the above should get you started."

So if it's grayscale, everything you paste will also be grayscale. If it is a color mode that supports colors (RGB, CMYK, Lab) then it will retain colors (withing gamut) when pasting.  However, 99.99 % of the time you should be working in RGB and things you paste will remain in color. If you want to remove the color from one (or more) layers, you should use Adjustment Layers (as it is nondestructive). The best one for you is likely ""Black & White"".

However, it depends a bit on your usage and skill level/interest how useful those features are to you personally.  It's a simple tradeoff (price vs. functionality), and we can't really answer what is best for you.  Are you willing to pay $10/month to get access to all the latest features? Will those features allow you to do new things, give you better results, or improve/ speed up your workflow? It's up to you. :) Since it's all on a hobby basis, I'd recommend you perhaps hold off until you upgrade your computer. Then the new hardware (especially if you get a retina/hidpi display) will make upgrading essentially reqiured imo.  Some new features you are currently missing out on (some could be great for website mockups):   Improved Camera RAW (including merge to HDR and panorama). Liquify as a Smart Filter (non-destructive). Linked Smart Objects (can link to external files, not only embed) HiPPI/Retina display support. Improved shape layers (now with ""proper"" stroke/fill similar to vector objects in Ai). GPU acceleration of several features/filters now speed them up considerably. New blur filters (Blur Gallery). Background save (you can keep working while it is saving) and auto-recover (might recover your document if Ps crashes). Pragraph and Character Styles (useful for website mockups among other things) Artboards (not fully developed yet imo., but soon...) A new resampling algorithm for upsampling images. Camera RAW can be used as a Filter/ Smart Filter. Object Libraries Multiple copies of the same type of layer style for one layer (e.g. a layer can have three drop shadows if you wish).

It costs a lot and you might want to upgrade the next time you update your computer (CS6 doesn't have proper hidpi/retina support for instance). If so, it might have been cheaper to go straight to CC (unless you wait a very long time between upgrades). Easy to calculate.

Should the outline be smooth (anti-aliased) or jagged (aliased)?  Here's three options (remember to save the original PSD/Ai files):   Save as PNG-24 with Transparency toggled on. That's your only good option to get smooth anti-aliased edges and ""proper"" transparency. If you use PNG-8 you only get 1-bit transparency so any partially transparent pixels become opaque. If so choose a matte color that is either black (like your outline) or a color that matches the background that the sprite will be on (only really works if it will be on the same background color all the time). If you have to use PNG-8 or for some other reason cannot have proper transparency or smooth edges, you could also make partially transparent pixels opaque in Photoshop by going Duplicate+Merge down (cmd/ctr-j + cmd/ctrl-e), 11 times. That will ensure that even a 1% transparent pixel will become opaque."

photoshop,3dgei3,gerroff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:44:48 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on the image. There are about a hundred ways you can go about doing this. Some of them are great on some images but useless on others. A screenshot would help as instead of giving general advice and mentioning several different methods we could give you one that is guaranteed to work great for your image.  Anyway, no matter what method you used you should be doing this using a mask. If someone asks you to delete or use the eraser, don't listen to them – that is the destructive way of doing it.  Selection Tools like the Quick Selection Tool and Magic Wand might be good here judging by your description of ""cartoon"". They are fast, and if you have nice contrast along your edges it should be fairly accurate as well. Once a selection has been made, add a layer mask (the selection will be used as a mask). The edges are likely to be a bit rough so use Refine Mask (probably called ""mask edge"" in the properties panel) to fine-tune the edges.  Another quite different method that will help you create perfect sharp edges and smooth curves is the Pen Tool. It will be slower however. Use the resulting path as a vector mask."

Although for 'flat' images like a map you should always choose the 'realign' mode instead of one of the other modes (spherical and stuff), so the source images aren't getting skewed or transformed in any way. The Auto mode will probably recognise that already, but that's just in case something goes wrong. Also, at the bottom you can disable auto-blending: this will still align all your images in different layers for you, but without the layer masks. That's in case you still want to blend the images manually, which might be useful in some cases."
photoshop,3ddeff,spiritscalling,2,Wed Jul 15 11:53:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're asking exactly but I'll just tell you my work flow.   I tend to work back and forth between illustrator and Photoshop...eventually ending with textures in Photoshop. So I scan a sketch into photoshop, then decide if I want the organic drawn edge or to recreate in illustrator. Either way, I then paint in photoshop. I also create any other elements I need to and typically bring them into photoshop as smart vectors.  Each item is then individually painted in three layers(I typically group these into a folder for each element and name it to help keep it organized)...a blocking layer(basic color), sketch layer, and detail layer. The blocking goes under, the detail goes over. If I'm particularly nervous about maintaining optimal editability, I break the detail layer into three layers: lights, mediums, and darks. On the top layers, I push into the sketch from inside....covering bits of it like one would if it was real paint. It integrates the drawing better. I also like to make the sketch a layer style (multiply) onto the blocking layer...it takes all the white out and seamlessly merges it with the background of the painting.   After painting all the details, I erase bits of the drawing from the outside with a textured brush on low flow and opacity in a layer mask (I always erase in layer masks....it keeps the image editable and I can maintain the smart vectors) in order to help merge it further into the background.   To bring all the elements on the page together at the end, I usually layer a top texture over it all...like a paper texture or canvas set to medium opacity and multiply, in order to create a unified feeling between elements.   Does that help? If not...clarify a bit what you are trying to accomplish and I'll work from there."
photoshop,3ddeff,toxicpretty,2,Wed Jul 15 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"Layering a top top texture is a good idea. It'll greatly help the contrast between the graphic art and the charcoal scan - completely eliminating that ""cheesy"" look.  To add to that idea.

It was fairly easy to clean up any lines that weren't scanned perfectly.  To be honest, I think you're making it too complicated. The cards print job will be small enough where vector files are overkill. I'd save your vector images in a format that's comparable with photoshop like a transparent png. You'll get great results without messing around with formatting.  Also, I'd check your scanner settings. Sometimes a scanner will have some defaults that'll mess with your ideal scan.  Test out a few settings with a couple scans to gauge the results."

From the looks of those lines, a Tolerance level of 200 or more should allow the bucket to fill and expand just under the lines so you don't leave any white space (play around with raising the tolerance if you find white space after filling). It's important to make sure you have a plain white layer as the very bottom layer, otherwise the Tolerance settings will not work to expand the fill under the lines.

Flip the rotated one back to normal in Ps and put it on a layer above the first scan. Then you can fiddle with blend modes and/or opacity of the top layer to lessen the texture appearance.

I say that because Affinity has pro features that Pixelmator and the others do not (CMYK, frequency separation, etc.), that is what sets Affinity apart and makes it possible to forget Photoshop.  For an app that you can literally keep in your back pocket, I think Snapseed is the best photo editing app on mobile right now if you don't need to composite. It beats anything by Adobe on mobile.

photoshop,3d1zc2,maxose,2,Sun Jul 12 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"So, if you're trying to draw something and want perfect thin lines, I would actually use Illustrator rather than Photoshop. Illustrator is meant for drawing, whereas Photoshop is more for photo manipulation...some of the abilities overlap of course :) For instance, in each program, if you want ""perfect"" lines, you need to learn how to use anchors, which are the little boxes you see along a line you draw wherever there's a curve. They're highly annoying at first, but once you learn how to use them, you'll make lines so perfect it will bring a tear to your eye. I learned how to use anchors by drawing clouds. Anyway - Illustrator makes drawing and tweaking your drawings a LOT easier than Photoshop. If you don't have Illustrator, maybe see if you can get a trial version of it to test out, because you can not only easily change the weight of your lines, but you change the weight in interesting ways, like tapering your lines, which give is a more paint-brushed looked."

So I'm going to go ahead and post a more in-depth explanation with a few screenshots to make this super easy.   Use the Shapes tool.  While there are a few ways to do a triangle, we'll just do the super duper easy one. The shapes tool should be selected.  Now make sure it has the Polygon shape selected.  It's next to the oval and is a hexagon (6-sides yo). Put '3' in the sides input box.  This photo shows the other settings that should be selected. http://imgur.com/OizokyH Draw your triangle.  You should have something like this now: http://imgur.com/pmIIo2y Double-click the Shape layer.  You should see this: http://imgur.com/Qc43jNo So now you're going to adjust a bunch of effects for this shape.  Remember it's a vector so you'll be able to keep the scalability.  If you just use a stroke on a path, it's raster based and if you ever need to do an enlargement you're fucked. Now you want a transparent 'inside' and a stroke on the outside.  Think of the shape as already having a fill.  In my image that fill is black.  So let's take the 'Fill Opacity' down to 0% in this pop-up box.  It's under the Advanced Blending section in the screenshot.  Like everything else in Photoshop -- there are other ways of doing it.  In this screenshot, you can see the two spots you could drag the fill to 0%: http://imgur.com/U55Nq1s Almost there!  Photoshop crashed so now my triangle might look a little different than before because I'm not exactly saving my work here. Okay -- now at the very bottom of that pop-up box you should see 'Stroke'.  Click the checkbox next to it and it will enable the stroke on the triangle shape.  Make sure you click the text next to the checkbox too so that you can see the options for the Stroke.  At this point you just need to decide what options you want.  The pixel size is how big you want the stroke to be -- I'm going to make mine 16px just because.  The position means where the stroke is on the triangle shape that already exists.  Do you want the stroke to start from the outside of the triangle and build outwards?  Cool -- if you do that you will have a curve shape on the outside.  Picking inside will build the strokes inward instead of outward.  This will give you pointy ends.  The center option will balance between the two -- so in this case it's 8px on the inside and 8px on the outside.  I'm going to choose inside for this demo.  The opacity is just the opacity of the stroke itself and not the whole shape.  Im going to change the colour here to some yellowish thing. Okay at this point I got a photo from a band I like (Devin Townsend Project ..check him out!)  Plopped the image into the background to demonstrate the transparency.  I toyed with the settings of the triangle a little bit: http://imgur.com/mYrEb8U Here is the finished product: http://imgur.com/TDHbtgq   Hope this helps you a lot!  There are times where you may want to rasterize the layer -- but those are few and far between.  And you'll know it when you need to."

It's the go-to tool for magazine covers and fashion photos, they all use it to do digital plastic surgery on faces and bodies.

When zooming out it ends up looking differently depending on the application and if it's flattened as different applications handle the downsampling/subsampling differently.   Zoom to 100% (or more) and compare before/after. It should be unchanged. And you will also notice how horrible unrealistic and digital those ""stars"" look and you really should recreate them properly... ;)   Flattening an image does not alter an image.

That's the only way to get a proper authentic effect.  Other than that it's a lot of work, and this is video so you need to look to AfterEffects or similar to simulate this. But here's a few things to pay attention to:   It is very low resolution. VHS tapes are quite bad, it's actually less than SD TV signals. Check wikipedia for some approximate pixel numbers.  The color information has extremely low horizontal resolution. This causes the color to ""bleed"" sideways. Look how horizontal edges have colorful halos due to this. There is often a thin strip at the bottom of the image that gets distorted sideways. There is some low frequency color noise constantly everywhere. It's quite weak, but noticeable in some scenes. There appears to be some additional color damage in the same of soft lines near the top in some scenes."

If you dont want to shoot the clotch, then grab a blank one from shutterstock or just google if you are not going to use it for a commercial purpose or as a product to make money and do the same thing.

To get the design to become slightly distorted by the wrinkles on the cloth, a Displacement map (made from the cloth image) could be used. One could also manually distort it using Liquify if manual control was needed."

I found myself getting very frustrated when trying to learn from them.   You best bet (as some other comments have mentioned) is learning by doing. There are a vast many tutorial sites, some of which are even free. There's even photoshop.com and a learn photoshop subreddit.   The tutorials you take should reflect what your creative agency does. Photoshop is a fairly hefty tool and has many different uses. Are you making websites? retouching photos? or creating illustrations? Your need should guide the kind of tutorials you look at. A general 'learn photoshop' tutorial (or even book) will likely be too broad or will try and cover too much at once.   Those tutorial sites again are;   http://tutsplus.com http://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/ https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshoptutorials http://www.photoshop.com/learn https://www.adobeknowhow.com/courselanding/beginners-adobe-photoshop   These are just the sites I am familiar with, however it's been a long time since I 'learnt' photoshop.

Apply a gradient with those two colors. Change the Image Mode to Indexed Color; set the number of colors, Adaptive or Selective, set Forced to None, no Transparency.  That will reduce the gradient to the few colors you want. You can then convert it back to RGB for further editing.  But the Illustrator object blend mentioned earlier will probably be faster."

Then the head. Below the head, a layer with the ""back"" of the vizor. Mask like the front. But maybe also test Multiply blending mode.  Then start to refine as needed.

Keep your hand on the eyedropper hot key (alt) and use a medium hard brush to blend. Given the way that your areas of colour just stop at their edges, I think you're not blending by colour sampling? That's what you have to do. Constantly pick up colours in between and lay down strokes with them.  No blur/smudge brush until you've mastered that technique. You can get some good use out of it but it's generally massively overused by people learning to paint digitally and becomes a horrible crutch.   Given where you're at I think Ctrl+Paint may help you out. Specifically look at the videos on lighting, he explains how to blend in those."

Other than that, some PC's come with pre-installed 'performance management software', make sure it's tuned to deliver highest performance.

photoshop,3ck7jb,Toysoldier34,4,Wed Jul 8 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"OK!!!! So I figured out what the problem was. It's windows 8.1's default power settings.   So after I booted up in Safe mode and got a time of 22 seconds I realised that the problem was OS related.   For anyone who's interested here's how I figured it out.  So I used msconfig.exe to do a selective startup and then disabled all services and startup applications. Rebooted and got 22 seconds again.   Then I did a binary elimination of the startup applications (select half the applications, reboot, check speed, if speed is ~22 seconds select other half, if not select half of current selection until the culprit is identified)   So it wasn't the startup applications so I tried the non-microsoft services, that wasn't it either. Confusingly I would get great results the first time I ran the test immediately after reboot but the second time I ran the test it was back to the bad results.   That didn't pan out either so I included the microsoft services. Eventually I figured out the problem was the Power service. When I realised it was the power service I checked the control panel and the default setting is ""balanced"" I changed this to ""high performance"" and immediately got great results :D  Anyway. Hope this helps someone in the future (I've got a feeling this will happen to a lot of people since it's the default setting for windows 8.1 it seems)  My current test time is 20,83 seconds.

photoshop,3ck7jb,chain83,3,Wed Jul 8 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"Generally yes that is the case, but there are exceptions and ways around it.  Most laptops especially for gaming will actively switch between integrated and dedicated graphics depending on if it is just at the desktop and browsing the web, or if it is gaming. This helps to keep it running cooler if it isn't needed.  So having the GPU in should override the integrated, but there is a possibility that can have an error and not work as intended.  In your case it may be because it didn't realize the GPU died so it still tried to use it. Had you changed the settings prior to it dying you could have worked around it."

Were both systems using the exact same version of photoshop?  Also what is the hardware acceleration set to for photohsop?  Other than that, be sure to run a few benchmarks, make sure the SSD's are performing properly and not have misaligned partitions which cuts their performance in half.  If you have a copy of aida64, it offers a number of synthetic CPU benchmarks and comparisons. http://www.aida64.com/downloads    Edit, I ran the benchmark on photoshop cc 2015 and ended up with a time of 49 seconds (clock for clock, the 4790k should be more than 2.2 times as fast, thus you should be at less than 20 seconds. (I will try to see if I can revery back to the older version of photoshop CC since on my system it was definitely more responsive).  edit 2: Ran the test again and got 44 seconds  My specs are CPU: AMD Phenom II x6 1075t at 4GHz (NB at 2.6GHz)( HT at 2.2GHz) RAM: 12GB DDR3 1866 (9-9-9-24 2T) GPU: GTX 970 (hardware acceleration enabled) Drive photoshop is installed to: Samsung 850 pro 256GB    Edit again: okay WTF, I disable the GPU acceleration and got 45 seconds. Some of the actions were causing some GPU usage. Why does the GPU provide so little benefit?  It seems what slowed me down before, was I had chrome and firefox opened, and the memory usage was at the full 12GB and pagefile was beginning to be used."
photoshop,3ck7jb,HVPhoto,2,Thu Jul 9 07:55:46 2015 UTC,CPU is way more important than GPU for Photoshop. It's mainly some filters as well as the rendering 3D and the canvas that uses the GPU. I don't think the action focuses on that.
photoshop,3ck7jb,HVPhoto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"yep, but I was expecting a little more of a benefit than what was present in the benchmark, especially since some some of the filters, the GPU usage would jump to around 6% while the GPU was at 1200MHz. Overall, it seems to have only a 1 second improvement with GPU acceleration on VS off. Overall, for the OP, something is massively wrong for his system to be getting results like that.  Sadly, many of the filters in photoshop are still single threaded.  Here is the resource usage while running the benchmark on my system  http://i.imgur.com/wV88cB7.jpg  Edit: tried increasing the amount of memory photoshop can use from 8GB, to 11GB after a fresh boot, and got the time down to 41 seconds GPU acceleration on, and 42 seconds with acceleration off. This benchmark is memory capacity intensive and hits the cache pretty hard. Moving the photoshop cache to my 1TB WD black, drive, increases the time to nearly 2 minutes. (from my previous test with process explorer, photoshop was hammering the cache at over 300MB/s sustained in many cases.  Edit 2: Just tried lowering the RAM speed from 1866, to 1600 and the results were about the same. Photoshop likes a lot of RAM for the benchmark, but doesn't care too much for the speed (within reason).  Anyway, adobe needs to revise their stance on the benefits of GPU acceleration in photoshop CC.  This is their claim    ""New GPU-accelerated features include an expanded Blur Gallery, adding even more options for stylish image blurring; Focus Mask for automatically selecting the in-focus area of a photo; and upsampling, which enables high-quality up-scaling of images like those extracted from video frames. Other key GPU features include Smart Sharpen, Liquify, and more than 30 others."""

Both layers contain color, and the edges of the spots would show up on the low frequency layer as they are sharp.  But I agree. A frequency separation is worth trying as a tool here when cleaning up the hands.

photoshop,3chtz0,chain83,2,Wed Jul 8 11:14:29 2015 UTC,"This is my attempt on his left hand. No simple technique; I used a combination of the lasso to make selections (1: entire hand, 2: lighter parts, 3: darker parts) and then used Levels and Exposure tweaking to get them semi-close in visual. Tip on that: I made new layers and filled them with my selections to easily re-grab them for further tweaking.  Then took the stamp tool to try and blend out the even darker areas.  It's not perfect, but only took around five minutes or so. To me, now they simply look like ""older man"" hands."

I always joke that my Wacom has 2048 levels of sensitivity, but my hand doesnt.  When I first got mine, I just opened up an empty image and practiced drawing squares and circles.

If you do have something similar, The best trick is to set up the buttons on the left to things you often use on the keyboard.  I like having Shift, Ctrl, and Ctrl-Z set up on mine.

To convey that the skin is stretched, you will have to lighten and darken regions of the skin in appropriate places. You can do this by brushing on lighter and darker paint, or use dodge and burn to create ridges and valleys. You might try a displacement map of the skin layer against the insect layer, so that the skin conforms to the shape of the insect, but I think painting is the way to go. That's how it's usually done."

There are some methods of using the channels to get a selection (which can sometimes work great and sometimes not) but essentially the idea is the same.   You need to make an accurate selection of the tower, or the background and then use that a a a guide for painting in the layer mask.

With the selection active, create a layer mask.   Depending on the order you did it, you may need to invert the mask but that should get you most of the way.

When you zoom to different percentages, photoshop tries to recalculate the displayed image for the screen pixels, that is why it shows up on some magnifications and not others.  A moire pattern happens when you scan something that was printed with a half tone. The little colored dots are printed at certain angles. When you scan it tries to interpolate those dots and it winds up creating a pattern.  As far as fixing it. You will probably want to try a few thing to see what comes out the best. My experience is that you will loose a bit of detail as this pattern is covering your entire image.  1) You can try the Bicubic Resampling found here http://graphicssoft.about.com/cs/photoshop/ht/apsremovemoire.htm.   2) have had some success with smart blur and gausian blurs (with masking)  3) Dust and scratches and despecle sometimes works.  4) and actually resizing the image to certain sizes sometimes does the trick. Just kind of have to eyeball that one.  5) sometimes you can even add noise or photo grain to certain places to remove it.  Good luck to you. I dont think there is a perfect fix-all for that.

According to the support guy I spoke to they are hoping to have it fixed in the next update which could be at the end of the month but until then the only way is to not use droplets but just use the actions instead directly in photoshop
photoshop,3cav2w,IllBePhrank,3,Mon Jul 6 13:48:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, not really.   You could try the photo merge tool in Photoshop (to auto-align the layers) but it's not really designed for that kind of compositing and I don't think you'll get anywhere. but it's not going to auto-blend the frames in a way that you still wont have to mask things out.  You MIGHT also play with later blending modes but I suspect that'll just make things look mushy.   This is definitely a job that needs to be done by hand.   Honestly though, anything you find that might do it automatically is probably a tool you should avoid. Good masking and selections will make or break a composite.   EDIT Edited for clarity regarding photo-merge."
photoshop,3cav2w,brianmerwinphoto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"Well. Assuming the camera is fairly static, photoshop will align the layers for you then the masking should be really strait forward  In bridge select the photos you want, then toto tools->open as layers.   Then in Photoshop goto edit->align all layers. Then the masking is really straight forward and you don't have to be too accurate with it as the backgrounds should match up perfectly. Just mask the whole layer, and paint in solid white with the brush crappily over the people. Should take about 10 seconds per layer/person."
photoshop,3cav2w,honestFeedback,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"Yep - and that's basically exactly what he's doing. There's just not really a way to go faster than that in the context of what OP is shooting. Not complex, but not something you really want to try and automate."
photoshop,3cav2w,brianmerwinphoto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"Fair.  The way i'm doing it (throwing all the pictures into separate layers, then deleted the spots I want revealed) is pretty sloppy. Is there a neater option I'm over looking?thanks!"
photoshop,3cav2w,brianmerwinphoto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"Nah. For what you're working on, your process is pretty much the best way.  Provided the light stays consistent from shot to shot there isn't really a reason to be less sloppy about it.  Now if you were trying to composite shots from different backgrounds, or vastly different lighting then your technique would need to change.   What's saving you here is that the lighting is consistent. Aside from just doing a bad job masking/selecting, mismatched lighting is the best way to fuck up a photo composite :)"
photoshop,3cav2w,kavien,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:07:39 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Sometimes you just gotta put in the hours. I'm sure if some dude with a daguerreotype could hear what I'm bitching about he'd slap me.
photoshop,3cav2w,brianmerwinphoto,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, photo merge is exactly what he needs. Just be sure to turn off merging layers. If you take the shot from a tripod, you'll only have to mask out the parts of the layer you don't need. Use a brush with 25% edge and just mask the subject. You could easily do 50+ people composite in less than an hour with maybe another hour on clean up.   I did a similar technique for this photo. It is a combined 16 images with varying light and hand held shots. All in RAW.   Good luck, OP! Contact me if you'd like a walk-through."
photoshop,3cav2w,kavien,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:16:25 2015 UTC,I think you're missing a little bit about what OP is saying. I agree that photomerge is awesome for aligning the layers. He was just feeling that his approach to masking things out is kind of slow and sloppy - but it's really the easiest approach given how he's shooting :)

I'm assuming tripod and all camera settings locked to manual and triggered remotely (or on timer).  If there is no stack blending mode that solves it, then perhaps masking can be semi-automated by automatically generating a difference mask using Actions. You'd still need to manually fix up the masks for best results (at least where the people overlap), but might speed it up by giving you a starting point. I will have to test to know for sure..."

You can fill (shift+f5) a layer with a pattern instead of painting it and possibly missing a section.  Instead of applying the posterize adjustment, make a posterize adjustment layer to be able to make changes later.  Here's an apple."

Looks to me you could do this way faster without having to manually go around the edges of the object... Color Range or loading a channel as selection should give you a great starting point for a mask in seconds.  Ps: You say the logo is PNG, but it has clearly been badly damaged by JPEG-compression...

photoshop,3caxjs,chain83,3,Mon Jul 6 14:49:52 2015 UTC,"""layer mask"", not ""layered mask"". It is a mask for a layer. :)  A mask is essentially a grayscale image that hides parts of the layer. White = opaque, black = transparent, and grays cover the range inbetween.  If you could link the actual image file you have to work with, I could tell you a good way to remove the background (it will depend on the image).  Here is an overview of masking in Photoshop that covers pretty much everything (and saves me an evening of typing): http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/12/17/unveiling-photoshop-masks/ ;-)    Yes, you could definitely remake the logo yourself in Illustrator if need be (preferrably, but Photoshop works as well - just make sure you only use shape layers).

There's a threshold you can adjust, and there's the three options for the way in which it erases. You can erase all of the color within your brush -discontinuous-, you can erase within your brush only until you reach a border -contiguous-, and find edges is like contiguous, but it prevents transparency issues. Use the regular erase tool if you are set on erasing. Even the magic erase tool might work better.  You could also start with selections and go from there. Select>color range might help you with this. Select the green, invert the selection and delete or mask the selection, depending on your output."

The brush is too small and you are not completely covering the pixels with your brush (if a brush covers half a pixel, then that pixel only gets ~50% of the color). Use a larger brush.  You should increase your image size as well to compensate. I'd say at least double it. Depends on how large you want your artwork to be.  Ps: You are swapping the terms aliasing and anti-aliasing.

Over 8 years if you get Extended version. No guarantee it will work with future operating systems.    I don't think there are any good alternatives to Photoshop at the moment. It is way better than the competition. The most powerful free solution would be GIMP."

photoshop,3ca0fr,dillonmitchler,3,Mon Jul 6 07:09:22 2015 UTC,"Something isn't right. There is no way that any sort of professional contest will want a 36"" poster in something like 35 dpi. It's literally impossible to have a dpi of 240-300 with those pixel size limits (dpi=pixels per inch). It's possible that they want a low resolution so that they can easily view and judge them and will get a higher resolution from the winner for print. You need to reconfirm with someone that the 1280 x 1024 pixel limit is correct. Assuming that it is, the solution is as follows.  Option one is to change the pixel size to the desired pixel resolution and apply that, then open the dialogue again, uncheck the box that says Resample Image, and then change the physical dimensions to whatever you want.  Option two is to change the pixel size to the desired size and then type in numbers in the Resolution box until the physical dimensions match. This is more useful when you know what resolution you want to have."

The only cost they control is the printing/packaging and shipping cost.  Also it depends on the quality of your design. Don't expect people to go crazy on a t-shirt with text quote.  The reason why you made a lot on teespring is because of niche audience. To get a lot of sales on teespring you need to rely on latest event/fad. For example ""gay marriage"" I see tons of rainbow shirts being sold.  If you're a good designer RB is the way to go. If not do a lot of google searching for the latest event, design and sell on teespring. Or do both."

In November (just before Christmas, mind you) I brought in $1800 in a month. However now it has slown down a bit and is averaging around $400/month. I think a big factor in determining how much you make there and how successful you are depends on what medium people are going to buy your designs. For example, stickers pay around $0.20, and apparel and phone cases $4-5+.   I also sell on Zazzle, and while I do like it, I enjoy the Redbubble interface much more. I also feel like the audience on Zazzle differs a bit to that of Redbubble. So I think the key to being successful on any of these sites, is targeting your audience. And hashtags.

photoshop,3c9ubx,chain83,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:05:25 2015 UTC,This is correctly done. You have just chosen slightly different (more saturated) colors than the linked example.  If you want to fine-tune the mix you could use a Curves Adjustment Layer below the Gradient Map (or you could edit the gradient itself).
photoshop,3c9ubx,liabach,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"Grayscale, then Duotone with the darker color, back to rgb or cmyk, create a layer underneath this layer and fill with the lighter color with paintcan tool, adjust top layers mixing to darken."
photoshop,3c9ubx,chain83,2,Mon Jul 6 06:09:05 2015 UTC,That is a very convoluted and destructive way to do it...  Simply add a Gradient Map Adjustment Layer instead.
photoshop,3c9ubx,liabach,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:31:40 2015 UTC,"been doing it since version 3, so like 20 years. Or if you want to challenge yourself, just do it with just duotone/tritones and adjust the curves. like version 2 before layers were implemented."

photoshop,3c9ubx,chain83,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you had three needless color space conversions (quality loss and dithering is there, although usually not a problem). You have also discarded all color information permanently, flattened the image, and can no longer adjust the two colors that make up the image. This is what I refer to when I say it is terribly destructive and not flexible at all (especially if other parts of the image isn't supposed to be duotone).  THIS literally took 10 seconds (half the time) - a lot fewer steps. And I have none of the disadvantages mentioned above (layers intact if I had any, technically less information/quality loss, no data discarded, everything I did remains easily editable). And a lot more room to be creative and experiment; I can add a Curves Adjustment Layer below the Gradient to fine-tune the mix, or I can click on the gradient itself to change the colors at any time. Use layer masks, or change the blending mode for other effects (like just altering color tint while retaining Luminosity).   Adjustment Layers has been around since version 4. You should really use them. It makes Photoshop 100x more powerful."

So you should be doing this in Illustrator using vectors (and color the shapes using Pantone/spot colors). No part of the image should be made up of pixels.  However, it might be that they can print it even if it's raster, but you'd have to check this with them. It also complicates creating the file a bit if you insist on doing it in Photoshop. Each spot color for the print will have to be a separate channel in the image. Image should be CMYK, and you could use those four channels for up to 4 separate colors, and tell the printer what Pantone colors those should be, or you can create new separate channels instead that you name with the Pantone colors you want. But it's vital that you ask your printer about this, and if this is possible for them to print (note, if you're just talking to some dedicated sales person they sometimes don't have much technical knowledge)."

There's no good way around it.  If you already know the concepts in Photoshop, the basics of AE should be very manageable (once you figure out the UI). Your layers panel is replaced by a timeline, but it works in a similar way and you have all the same blending modes and layer styles you are used to. The difference is that everything you do is non-destructive; think of it like all your layers now being linked smart objects and adjustment layers, and all your filters (effects) behaving like smart filters.

For Photoshop's print settings I found this info:     Photoshop saves the print settings with the document when you save the document. Photoshop also saves the last successfully used print settings in the application preferences, and these are used by default with documents which do not already have print settings saved within them. So that's why you're seeing it with new documents. If you switch to a different printer in Photoshop's print dialog, the system defaults for that printer are used as the initial print settings. These can be changed by selecting the printer in the control panel, right-clicking on it, and selecting ""Printing Preferences"". If the Photoshop preferences have no saved print settings (just after you've zapped preferences, or the first time you're running, for example), the defaults for the default system printer (the one checked in the control panel) are used.

photoshop,3bx0x8,doedskalle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:05:46 2015 UTC,"The trick is to create them properly in the first place. Not draw them jagged and bad and then try to fix it. The simplest fix is to redraw them.  Use the Poygon Tool (set to 6 sided, and Shape) to create the polygons. It will create a vector-based ""Shape Layer"" and you can choose a black stroke. Since it's a vector shape you can freely transform it without quality loss.    Clip the sharp leaf layer to the poygon layer.  http://i.imgur.com/ZCuGlD5.png"

If you want to preserve the luminosity of your image and just add color, simply set the blending mode to Color.  It could be that you are having troubles getting the same overall feel of the image though due to your image being very different to begin with. This iamge is quite dark (besides the watch pretty much everything is in the bottom half), with increased local contrast (notice the glowing halos around the plants), and a low depth of field.

Made a circle with no fill and a thick orange stroke. Then just a long rectangle with the pen tool so i could make the sides then cut it apart with the scissors. Made 2 squares to get the 3d effect back to the side pieces. Cut the circle into 2 so the top could be tranparent and the bottom could be black. Threw some text in there. Used photoshop to cut the center picture and give it a transparent background since it doesnt' save as a circle. Saved it as png since that saves transparencies then pulled it into Illustrator and put it behind everything and lined it up."

For the skewed rectangle that makes up the front of the banner, make a rectangle on top, then skew it (transform > skew, or manually move two end points). Choose a gradient fill and no stroke. For the small pieces of the banner that go behind the circle, draw them with the pen tool as new shapes behind the circle (the end parts of the banner could also be made from copies of the front part to ensure the same width and then add the cut at the end). Give them a gradient fill and no stroke. For the text, use the text tool. How to skew the text I will let you figure out... ;) For the small hard drop shadow select all your layers and put them in a group (cmd/ctrl-G). Add the Drop Shadow layer style to the group.

The green channel controls green/magenta, the red channel controls red/cyan, and the blue channel controls blue/yellow. You can either use the Distort effects (Shear in particular) or, what they most likely did here which is Edit -> Transform -> Warp  Quick example  In this particular case it seems like the channels go (left to right) blue-green-red"

Unfortunately, you cannot tell Align Layers what to pay attention to. Once you try it, it's either gonna work or it's not.  A similar alternative is to use File/Scripts/Load Files Into Stack, and enable the ""Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images"" option."

It's also almost pure cyan. No other details in that area - it's completely flat (the landscape on top is just to make it less boring). Save as 24-bit PNG. Then they use a filter (Crema) that appears to severely darken the cyan tones that as a side-effect also increases contrast between the tones that they used as thee foreground/background of the text so it becomes clearly visible.   It will take a bit of trial and error, but try making a bright cyan picture with almost invisible text (probably just a couple of color values difference) and see how it turns out when adding filters in the app. Then dial in the color values to make the text as invisible as possible in the before-image.

Program-wise, you're more than fine with Photoshop. It's the industry standard for a reason! Painter is nice, but its only real strength over PS is emulation of traditional media, which isn't really necessary unless you're needing it specifically.  For getting started, I'd heartily recommend the tutorials at http://www.ctrlpaint.com/library - it'll do a great job of familiarizing you with the program and getting you started with the basic concepts of digital painting.  Beyond that, there are a million books and tutorials out there that should help you with all the little things. Absolutely take a class, if you can find one. Otherwise, just draw draw draw, whether on your tablet or with paper and pencil. That's the most important thing!  Good luck. I'm rooting for you!"

I wish I could recommend you a textbook or something of the sort, but there really isn't any definitive digital painting book like there is for drawing (though there are many - mostly PDFs on the internet).

photoshop,3bh0od,liabach,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"I have a similar background in art as you, more contemporary media that is. For digital Art as in Painting or drawing, Corel Painter 12 is what you are looking for. Photoshop is more for digital manipulation than raw painting and drawing, though it can be done. I use both depending on my needs.  To do it right, get a Wacom Intuos Tablet, I have an Intuous 4 medium. Although you will find that many of your drawing,painting skills dont carry over well as the tablet has a much different feel, as well as you are looking at a screen and drawing on the tablet rather than directly on the image.   With painter 12 it allows for many different digital media and brushes, including things like watercolors, oils, acrylics, textured canvas etc. You can smear the paints together and even do impasto and glazes. Or open an original scan or photo and make it look like a painting.  Hardware: dont know if you need this info, but youl need a decent video card, as much ram as affordable and a good hard drive to store the files and to use for scratch disks.  As far as books, havent really used any for Painter 12, just taught myself through trial and error. Adobe Photoshop used to come with a real good tutorial book and it eventually made it to the web. Trying to see if i can find a link to that for you. Will post in links when i do."

photoshop,3bidn6,chain83,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"Save for Web. Choose PNG-24. If you can survive with a limited color palette, PNG-8 will give smaller files.  PNG will give you lossless (perfect) quality (only JPEG will degrade the image). For photographic content however, JPEG can give you a lot smaller file sizes for a tiny loss in quality (you choose how much when saving).    If you really want to use PNG optimize further for the smallest file sizes possible there are a couple of things you can do to squeeze a few more bytes of out it:    Use PNGGauntlet or similar to optimize the compression. It can process many files at the same time so you can run this last as a batch operation. This is easy and convenient to do after you have exported all your assets. :) Posterize the image (for PNG-24). Choose just enough levels so that the posterization isn't visible. It will give you smaller files due to more adjacent pixels having the same color. Replace the color of 100% transparent pixels with one flat color (because the color information of those pixels are actually preserved with PNG-24). This can help on photographic content, but on some illustration-type images it may increase size slightly instead. Anything that ""simplifies"" the content of the image by making more adjacent pixels the same color will also help reduce file size. This could be things like keeping gradients to straight angles, turning off dithering, etc.   I consider point 2-4 to be overkill in most cases. I've only needed it in a couple scenarios where I had to squeeze PNG files under specific size limitations.  I wrote a detailed guide in Norwegian - it shows examples of different types of images and how much the different things affects the size: http://adobe.rognemedia.no/?pg=article&id=180 (Google translate should work well on it)."

photoshop,3bglhc,ChalkyTannins,2,Mon Jun 29 01:19:43 2015 UTC,"The Windows Photo app is utter crap and does not support color management. It displays the image wrong. Do not use it. Chrome and Photoshop on the other hand will display the colors correctly (as long as the profile is embedded).  For best results accross multiple platforms/computers/displays/software:     Make sure the images are sRGB. Embed the profile.     Now, to understand what happens and why, you need a basic understanding of color management. I will try to keep it simple:  The same RGB-values turn out differently on different devices (or even on the same device over time). Therefore when an image has e.g. the color value 230,90,30, we also embed a ""color profile"" that defines what this color actually looks like. Any monitor that will display the color also needs to be calibrated; when calibrating you measure what colors the monitor actually displays when it gets sent a color value and generate a color profile for that specific monitor.  Since we know how the colors of the image should look, and also have a profile detailing how the monitor displays colors, the software can display colors accurately. When diplaying an image the RGB color values of the image gets converted to LAB using the embedded color profile, and then that LAB-color gets converted to a new RGB value using the monitor profile and sent to the monitor.    So that works very well, but here comes your problem: What happens if an image doesn't have a profile? And what happens in applications that ignore color management? It varies from application to application, but often it appears it just passes on the uncalibrated color values directly to the monitor. This causes it to look very differently from one monitor to the next. You have no control over this. Now, as a rule of thumb we say that the average monitor displays colors roughly like sRGB. Therefore, if we ensure our images are in the sRGB color space the colors will look as consistent as possible accross devices/software without color management. Still, monitors can obviously deviate quite far from this."

You would be able to change it at any time (besides opacity) and do split toning with multiple colors.  Edit: the texture layers(s) set to hard/soft light also clipped to the referenced photo."

An easy but meticulous way to do this (that's a shortcut/cheat to creating an actual vector portrait) is adjusting your photo's levels and using the pen tool to create those gradient levels. Ideally you'd use illustrator, but it can be done with Photoshop. Here's a tutorial: http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-create-a-beautiful-vector-portrait-in-illustrator  You can also take the easy way out by playing around with filters (levels, artistic cutout, artistic sketch) until you get close to your result."

First, isolate your image, then make a posterize filter layer on it (I used lvl 3). Then Apply a blur to round out the edges (I used Gaussian blur at 2px). Drag this into Illustrator and image trace it (I used colour 50% paths, 75% corners and 25% noise). You can change all the above value to get different levels of detail. You can then blend with original or just stick on your chosen background to your taste."

Higher density of pixels will result in a clearer, less pixellated final document.  Photoshop has a default resolution of 72ppi, which is acceptable for some screen or web (though out of date with so many new higher res screens) projects.  For a print file you'd want to go with 300ppi. You didn't set the ppi high enough, but if you go to Image -> Image Size... you can set it to 300ppi.   After you change the ppi you would want to copy the photos and logo back in from the original source. The text and boxes will scale because they're vector."

photoshop,3bbkrt,RazorLeafAttack,2,Sat Jun 27 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"One simple way to create evenly spaced lines is to first draw one line (line tool or brush & hold shift) on a new layer. Then hold alt+shift and click & drag your mouse a few times (depending on how many lines you want) to create new parallel lines, with no regards to spacing.  Select all layers with lines and with the move tool active select the 'distribute along horizontal/vertical centers' button in the option bar or go to Layers > Distibute for the same options. This will space out the the lines evenly among your canvas. Now just merge the line layers and duplicate & rotate (preferably turn the layer into a smart object for non-90° roatations first) the result for your other orientations. This is a quick and dirty solution, and you will not give you diagonal lines that fit perfectly into a grid with the other lines.  Another, more finetuned option would be to create a grid of guides to place your lines. A plugin like GuideGuide would be recommended for that.  Or you could just create a pattern of one part of your grid - which would pretty much just have to be this (for one diagonal orientation) or this (for both diagonal orientations) - and fill a layer with that.  In any case, to be most flexible and keep the best quality you should create these grids on a seperate large canvas and add the results as smart objects to your artwork."

photoshop,3b8mce,AwwwSnack,3,Mon Jun 29 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"This should be done exactly the same way you do all other color adjustments in Photoshop. Use Adjustment Layer(s) and use Layer Masks to limit the effect to only parts of an image.  The adjustments you need are fairly minor, meaning that you can probably get away with slightly less accurate masking.     First make a selection of the background (Quick Selection Tool + Refine Edge should get you 90% of the way there). Add your adjustment layer and adjust the colors. Here I would recommend - as always - the Curves Adjustment Layer. It will give you fine control over brightness and contrast (and color tint if you change curves per channel). Just from a quick glance I'd say you should start by darkening the background of the middle photo. One thing Curves doesn't give you good control over is Saturation, so clip a Hue/Saturation or Vibrance layer to the Curves layer to adjust the Saturation. To me it looks like the rightmost image has a slightly less saturated background.    Fine-tune until happy. :)"

Also bear in mind the reflective light from the packaging on the backdrop. Try to get that back in there to make it more interesting space.  Another thing you could try rather than substituting the background is masking off the subject matter and adjusting the current photos background with hue/saturation to see if you can get a good match. Then use a soft subtle opacity burn tool to adjust any irregularities.  Photoshop can do a lot, but a great original photo is better."

It's worth your money to invest now rather than buy another monitor yet again later. Unless you buy the argument that everyone sees everything on sRGB anyway. I don't buy it, but some people are ok with it, which is fine. Personally I'd rather have all the wiggle room I can get, and compress after I've made an educated decision.  NEC is one of the industry standards. Any monitor you see with this icon listed under it will be color critical. They have some solid monitors starting around $1k, but most of them are 24"" and not high DPI. Most high DPI displays readily available for lower cost (Apple Retina iMacs, etc) aren't AdobeRGB.   The high DPI monitors are great for two reasons: You'll see more of your image when working at 100% (working with sharpening, noise etc) and text will be sharper and easier to read in the right scenario. EG: the os handles it properly. Above a certain DPI it's also much healthier for your eyes as they don't have to attempt to make sense of the pixels.   If AdobeRGB isn't mission critical and text is a bigger deal, honestly  a Retina iMac might not be a bad idea. You'll get a Retina 27"" display for the cost of a 24"" NEC Color Correct monitor that will handle your text great, and be able to use your UltraSharp Dell as a secondary monitor. It's actually the exact setup I have for retouching. (I'm getting a NEC as soon as I can afford it)."

The closest thing I can find is the 31"" CinemaHD display from LG for about $1050.

I see two (similar) approaches here:   The basic one that people suggest is essentially to create a new layer, then grab the Clone Stamp Tool (set to sample current and below), zoom in and start covering up the fence. If you cover up a bit too much, erase or use a layer mask. Take your time to ensure a smooth result without obvious ""blotchyness"" from working with such a small brush. http://i.imgur.com/8atGL9A.png The way I would do it to ensure as smooth a sky as possible would be to first roughly clone/heal over the entire area until the entire fence is completely covered (and yeah, the people too, and maybe bits of the grass). This allows me to use a large brush to make it nice and smooth - takes just a few seconds... Then add a layer mask, invert it, and paint with a regular white brush on the mask where I want to cover up the fence. Press X to switch between adding/removing (white/black). http://i.imgur.com/Al42we6.png   Method #2 it is slightly faster and it's easier to get a good result imo. (and allows for combinations of more tools/techniques if you want). :)"

In Ps, it sets the resolution to 72, but it doesn't resample, so the 8.5x11 stays at 2550x3300. To get around this, you just have to set the image size to 2550x3300 in the SFW window in Illustrator.

photoshop,3b6ff0,smokedjackrel,6,Fri Jun 26 10:17:44 2015 UTC,"In print, can a super high DPI make up for designing in raster/PS?   Short answer; No. There is nothing to gain by making a raster image at a higher resolution than the printer can reproduce. If your printer can print 300 ppi, then you will have to make your document at 300 ppi for optimal sharpness (anything higher won't make a difference besides increasing file size).    I HIGHLY recommend you put a little time into learning InDesign. And maybe some Illustrator. You can get really far by just These are the correct/optimal applications for this (just like I would recommend Premiere for video editing and AfterEffects for video effects – even if you have some basic video functions in Photoshop). I do not think it would be much hassle for you to pick up the basics.    Any images you still do in Photoshop (in RGB as always), just place it into InDesign, add text and other vector elements, export the appropriate PDF.     If you have to do it in Photoshop, you should work in CMYK to get control over the separations (mainly to optimize sharpness of black text at small font sizes - 100K and overprint...). If bleed is needed, add it to your total dimensions and use Guides to remind yourself where it will be trimmed. When preparing to export the PDF, flatten everything that should be raster, but keep text layers and shape layers you want to remain vector. After exporting the PDF you should manually check any shapes to see if they turned out ok. Now if you want the trim box (bleed) to be defined properly you will have to manually change it in Acrobat Professional, or place the PDF into InDesign and export a new nice PDF from there (with properly defined trim/bleed and crop marks and whatever you want)."
photoshop,3b6ff0,chain83,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:16:23 2015 UTC,"Excellent reply, I will just chip in with some details:  Many offset printers, and some consumer printers, actually accept dpi up to 1200-2400. For text in the 6-24 pt sizes, 600 or 1200 dpi is actually a visible improvement over 300 - but only for completely black text! The reason being that for a printer to actually deliver sharp results with light colors (low coverage) you actually need dots of ink to be placed at a higher dpi than 300, if that makes sense. You can exploit this by working at 1200 dpi in PS, if your computer can handle 9000x14000px documents :-)  I know that PS can save as PDF. Have you tested if text remains vector (not raster) and if it affects file size, if you save as PDF? And what happens when you re-open the PDF in PS? I don't know but it is worth a shot for, I think."
photoshop,3b6ff0,grimgnaver,2,Fri Jun 26 14:15:42 2015 UTC,"DPI ((printer) dots per inch) and PPI (pixels per inch) are different things and when talking about this subject it's important to separate the two to avoid confusion!  E.g. a printer could be 1200 DPI yet not being able to reproduce more than 300 PPI (for a regular full-color raster image).  Anyway, when saving a PDF from Photoshop text will remain as text, and shape layers will remain vector (actually a raster image for the fill + a clipping path). Unless you check ""preserve photoshop editing capabilities"" (essentially embedding the PSD data) the PDF will be rasterized when opening up in Photoshop (like any other PDF)."
photoshop,3b6ff0,chain83,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"Great points. For my own vanity's sake I must state that I do know the difference between DPI and PPI, and that was why I emphasized that the high resolution only works for completely black text. For raster where K=100 you could say that DPI = PPI. Maybe not exactly, but close. I may have failed in communicating it clearly. But that is a side note. Most importantly, I'd say that you answer OP's question quite nicely; He can work in PS as long as he knows the pitfalls and as far as I can tell he can limit his work to 300 dpi as long as he preserves photoshop editing capabilities. I would definitely recommend going the ID or AI route, just like you, but that really wasn't what OP asked, and I think that is important to respect in a technical forum. Great posts!  Note 1: Just did some research and it seems that most laser printer actually go to 1200 dpi.  Note 2: OP, remember to keep text layers on top, even if there is no overlap because it can cause rasterizing of the text, resulting in loss of sharpness/detail."

I am currently working with Photoshop CS5 but this should be standard on any version that isn't old as dirt.  Download this sample rar folder I made and extract the contents.   Locate the file titled portrait1.jpg and open it in Photoshop. In the toolbar select Window -> Actions Make a new Action folder and name it Instagram Template With the Instagram Template folder selected, Make a new Action and name it Portrait. (Note: This will begin recording any action you make such as saving, resizing, closing...etc until you hit the stop button. If you make a mistake in the following steps, delete the Action layer named portrait and start over.) In the toolbar select Select -> All or (Ctrl+A) In the toolbar select Edit - > Copy or (Ctrl+C) Close portrait1.jpg Open banner-portrait-sample.png from the base folder In the toolbar select Edit -> Paste or (Ctrl+V). This should paste the portrait1.jpg image in the center of my example In the toolbar select File -> Save As Let's save the file in the folder titled Portrait+Banner as example.jpg In the toolbar select File -> Close or (Ctrl+W) If photoshop asks if you'd like to save changes to the Photoshop document, select No. In the actions box select Stop. Your action list should look precisely like mine in the image.   At this point you have created an action and you are now ready to run a batch of it. To test this out you will need to do the following.   File -> Automate -> Batch Set: Instagram Template and Action: Portrait Source should be Folder and choose the Portrait folder I included. Destination should also be Folder and select the Portrait+Banner folder Check the Override Action ""Save As"" Commands box. and use these settings Hit Ok   The batch process will begin and you should now see the newly created files in the folder Portrait+Banner as well as our example.jpg.  You can now repeat the entire process on your own with the Landscape folder and images to see if you have the same outcome. If you have any questions please feel free to send me a pm. Their is probably and easier way of doing all of this and I am in no way a professional at batching or actions. Once you get this down you can play around with the settings and create more actions. Good luck  Edit: Beware that this will only work with a Batch process.

photoshop,3b0rq4,leftnotracks,2,Thu Jun 25 03:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what memory space is, but I guess it's how much RAM is assigned to your applications. RAM is Random Access Memory. Think of a computer as a desk in a library. You have storage, which is the hard drive. That is like shelves of books. Lots of storage means room for lots of books. RAM is like desk space. Your books are useless unless you have a place to open them and read them. More desk space means you can open more books, open larger books, and have more work accessible as you read those books.  Nobody should buy a computer with less than 4 GB of RAM. If you intend to use Photoshop a lot you should get at least 8 GB. With less memory, you have less room on your desk. This makes your computer swap memory between the fast RAM and the slow hard drive. Imagine trying to study five encyclopedia volumes. On a big desk you can keep all five volumes open plus a few pages for notes. On a small desk you can only keep one or two open, plus only one page for notes. If you still need to refer to all five volumes y have to constantly shelve an unshelve the books and find your place again. This is what working with little RAM means: applications and files are constantly swapping between the hard drive and the memory, slowing you down.   You get more RAM by buying it. Some computers are easy to upgrade, some are hard, and some are impossible because the RAM is soldered to the motherboard.  If you have a Mac, go to About This Mac is the Apple menu. If you have a Windows computer I don’t know how to find out how much RAM y have, but Googling How Much RAM does my Windows computer have should get you there."
photoshop,3b0rq4,alllmossttherrre,2,Thu Jun 25 04:10:09 2015 UTC,"it RAM any different from memory space? And if so, how much of it do I need to be able to use this software, and what's the best way to get it?   RAM = Random Access Memory, or the memory needed for the computer to think and work things out. It's like the size of your work table. If your work table is too small, you have no room to spread out and things take longer because you have to shuffle your things around all the time.  Disk space = storage memory. It's like the amount of space on your shelves or cabinets. It's where you store the files.  Generally, they work separately. If you don't have enough RAM, it won't help to add a bigger disk. And if you need more disk space, adding RAM definitely will never help that. But sometimes your system will use disk space to help compensate for lack of RAM, this can cause free disk space to go down even if you aren't saving more files. And when the system has to substitute disk space for RAM, things run a lot slower because disk space is much slower than RAM.  Another factor is that and many graphics programs create ""temporary files"" as a sort of digital ""scratch paper"" while working. Those take up disk space too. If you are working on many files or big files, your temporary files may be growing and eating up disk space until you close the programs. Your OS needs free space for temporary files too, though they're usually not as big as the ones graphics apps create.  Neither of your ""data banks"" is RAM. Both are storage. For Adobe use I would recommend whatever size of disk leaves you with at least 50GB free at all times, and that's just a minimal rough guideline. It's better to have hundreds of GB free, so that the programs and the system have lots of room to create temporary files as needed.  For RAM, I would recommend 8GB minimum. 16GB or up is better for Photoshop/other Adobe work. (Consumers/office workers can get away with 4-8GB). A good place to get RAM is crucial.com. If it is a Mac, macsales.com is also good."

These are just some possibilities.  I actually have partitioned a dedicated sata 3 hard-drive, one partition for the windows paging file and one partition for the photshop scratch disc.

This will help you preserve text/vector elements, and will let your export print-ready PDFs with proper bleed and crop marks (Photoshop can't do that). If you want to create the whole thing in Photoshop create your document at the final dimensions+bleed @ 300 PPI. Use guides to tell where your bleed is (so you don't put your content too close to the edge). Create the document with the CMYK profile specified by your printer (Ask them. This can be critical for accurate color reproduction). Black text (at smaller font sizes) should be defined as 100K for optimal sarpness (four-color text will be darker, but slightly fuzzy in comparison). Do not flatten your document as you want to keep your shape and text layers as vector. Save As... PDF, and choose the PDF settings that the printer wants (again, it's best to ask them, they might even have a preset you can use). Now, if you intend to send this PDF as-is you MUST inform the print company how much bleed there is (so they know how much to crop off). To avoid this pitfall I would recommend placing the PDF into an InDesign document and exporting a proper PDF from there with correctly defined bleed box and crop marks."

Generally who ever is printing a job does that. When choosing your vendor you discuss the color needs of the project before assigning the work, and getting an estimate. The printer should ask to see the digital files before estimating the cost of your job that way they know what works needs to be done to the digital files you are handing over.  Once the job is assigned it's the job of the prepress department and the press operator to create an accurately color printed piece.

If you're working with small files it won't make a large impact, but if you're working with large files this can be a significant difference.  There may also be filters that rely on single core performance, though I can't think of any off the top of my head.  Ultimately, Intel is going to be the better choice, but it's also going to cost you more.  If you have the money, then it's a no brainer, but if you're strapped for cash and want decent performance then AMD will suffice.  Personally I run an FX-8320e and I get decent performance, though sometimes I do wish I'd gotten an i5 instead."
photoshop,3at62u,Mentalpopcorn,2,Tue Jun 23 20:35:32 2015 UTC,Should've posted this on /r/hardware I built a six core AMD rig and it performed almost the same as my core2quad. i7 hyperthreading makes a huge difference.  Most programs are compiled with Intel software. By compiling with this software it gives Intel cpus an even greater leg up.

This is what I would do:  1) Make a new photoshop document, make sure it is as big as you need it to be (for when you print the page).  With the painting on the bottom layer, create a layer above where you trace the painting's main shapes, creating an outline like those in children's colouring books. 2) For the patterns on the inside, you could A) draw them yourself B) Copy and paste them from images found online.  Rather than tracing over the patterns, you might be able to select them using the wand tool, paste them onto another layer, then erase what doesn't fit inside the outline.  Other people might have easier solutions, but this is how I would do it."

Design Space is an experimental feature that reskins the entirety of the application, and while it has a long way to go it does show promise for optimizing some users workflows v. the standard user interface. If it's not your thing, don't sweat having to use it.  The larger potential benefit of Design Space is actually the technology it is build upon. The entire user interface is being driven by the Chromium Embedded Framework, which means any user could completely reskin Photoshop using well-known technologies such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the technologies and frameworks built upon them (e.g., React.)"

photoshop,3asceb,08230911,2,Tue Jun 23 02:59:02 2015 UTC,"It's a very niche career. Yeah, you can make a decent living at it. Most major advertising agencies have a retouching department. But people get way more stuck in retouching than in graphic design. If you start out as a graphic designer, you can move into so many other agency positions, Art Director, Creative Director, Design Director, and on and on. As retoucher you can move up to senior retoucher and then retouching manager and then if you want you can open your own studio. But then you just handle managing a studio instead of retouching.  I don't know. If it's your passion, go for it. I make a decent living at it.  But I get a little frustrated that there isn't much room for growth.  I think at this point if you want it to be your primary career focus, you should also learn a 3D program or two as well, maybe Zbrush or Modo or something like that. And if you come from an illustration background and you want to become an expert at retouching, I'd suggest you take some photography classes to augment your education.   The other thing I would suggest is actually studying what career positions are available for people who move up the design chain at agencies. That might help give you another perspective as well so you kind of have an idea of where you're heading after you reach a senior level in your field. I wish I had done that. But I still love what I do."
photoshop,3asceb,ferrets_indeed,2,Tue Jun 23 06:53:32 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with this for the most part.  Just want to add that making a living retouching also is pretty dependent on where you live.  Certain cities have much bigger retouching markets than others.  If you do live in one of those cities, my advice is to skip the classes and go get a Jr. Retoucher position.  You'll learn way more and get paid to do it.  If you're at a good place, you can advance as fast as you absorb.  Also, you'll look back and realize that no one who teaches those classes has any idea what they're talking about when it comes to being skilled enough to actually work as a retoucher."

Once you've done this, go into channels and you'll find red, green and blue. Click them individually without clicking the eye so they show as each channel in black and white. When you find the right amount of contrast in whichever channel you prefer over another, you can duplicate the selected channel and apply levels or curves directly to the layer to refine the contrast between the black and white space. Click down on the thumbnail of the channel while holding command on mac or control on a pc. This will highlight the channel in marching ants. From there you can go back to your layer palette and apply this as a mask onto whatever other image you like. Remember you can save your selections and name them specifically so you don't have to keep going back to sample them. It's also worth mentioning to remember that these selections look really effective when you combine them with blending modes and different opacities. I hope this helps/makes sense!"

Then we could see what you are getting versus what you are missing. You can use a mask to increase and decrease the effects your textures have on different areas of your image.  The rich color and contrast can be achieved just by adjusting the overall colors of your image, generally.  If your image doesn't have enough contrast for your taste, add a filter above your topmost layer that increase the contrast.  Then you can adjust the contrast without messing up your base image.

photoshop,3apz1a,rrandomCraft,2,Mon Jun 22 15:45:46 2015 UTC,That goes a bit out of the realm of PS so I think you have to do it manually: free transform them to match.  If you're dealing with a lot of images you could use/try After Effects to track & motion stabilize it and export the frames.

photoshop,3an8hn,mrvimes,2,Sun Jun 21 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Quick Export (set as jpeg) has awful compression compared to export as -> jpeg (100% quality)  It forgets where I last saved or exported a jpeg to and instead reverts to the folder the raw file came from  Export as doesn't remember my last settings. It reverts back to 'png' evert time, which means I have to wait for it to 'process' every time before I can set it back to jpeg.   These might be controllable in File/Export/Export Preferences. There's a preference for Format (defaults to PNG), Quality (if you changed the preference to JPEG, defaults to 85 not 100 so change it), and Location (file path).   No 'convert to srgb' option in export as -> jpeg (though I don't fully understand the mechanics of whether it should or shouldn't be used - it does seem to give richer colours and deeper blacks)   This is a pain, I wish they would add that back. On the question as to whether or not it should be used, this is a color management question which means ""it depends."" If your output is always to web/mobile then you should always be converting to sRGB. But whether you need to depends on where the content is coming from. If the Photoshop file is already in sRGB there is no need to convert again and the lack of the option does not matter. If the Photoshop file is in another color space then it will need to be converted to sRGB if it is to look OK on a common device or web site. If it is necessary to convert but there is no Convert to sRGB option, then before exporting, the conversion should be done with Edit/Convert to Profile.  There are other color spaces that can achieve better color than sRGB, and you can see the difference if viewing/printing on devices that also are capable of a bigger gamut than sRGB. But since web/mobile devices are close to sRGB, you must convert to sRGB for them. The point of this paragraph is that ""richer colors and deeper blacks"" is not a direct result of converting to sRGB. The actual results and color quality of a conversion depend on which two color spaces are being converted between."

It doesn't stop the 'export as' defaulting to png (and taking ages to become responsive/usable compared to the old 'save for web') And quick export's '100' for quality does not match 'export as' s '100%'.    Edit: When I said 'awful' I meant it doesn't compress to a small file size. A typical example - a photo saved with quick export ended up about 3.5mb.  The same photo saved with 'export as' (quality set at 100%) was about 500kb.  Save for web (at 100% quality) is somewhere inbetween.

Do you want to shrink the physical dimensions (inches), the pixel count, the file size, some combination of the above, all of the above, or what?  If you're talking about shrinking physical dimensions only, without changing the pixel count, then you use Image Size to resize without resampling.  If you want to shrink the pixel count, you use Image Size to resize with resampling on, and the resampling option like Bicubic Sharper.  If it is the file size you want to shrink, you can do any combination of these, depending on what is acceptable to you: - If it's above 8 bits/channel but 8bpc is acceptable, downsample the bit depth to 8 bpc. - If it's multi-layered and/or with extra channels, flatten the image to one layer with no channels. - If you need to preserve 100% image quality, Save As to TIFF and use Zip compression. - If it is OK to lose a little image quality, Save As to JPEG and lower the quality a little.  Images are usually blurry because you either applied too much compression or downsampled the pixel count too far."

For the former, do nothing. Simply reduce the size of the pixels by changing the effective resolution. Do this in Image > Image Size and turn resampling off, or place the image in another program like Illustrator or InDesign and scale it.  For the latter, use Image > Image Size and resample to the desired resolution. When resample, experiment with the different option to find what works best. Set the view to actual size. You will probably be most satisfied with Automatic or Bicubic Sharper. After resampling run a Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask. Again, experiment with the settings or search for unsharp mask tutorials. Results will vary depending on the image and the quality of the image."

Think about what that means: Every individual pixel in the 300x250 version is roughly an average of 36 of the original pixels...of course that's gonna look blurry.

Plus, it will not provide the cell-shaded line-work, which is the most ""cartoonish"" thing about this image.  OP: the truth is, this kind of work is meticulous. In Illustrator I would use the pen tool. In Photoshop, I might use the lasso and paint bucket, or even just a paint brush and eraser (with a tablet). In either instance, you are looking at an image and breaking it down into colors and shapes. There is no deeper, technical function of the software at play here. The most useful thing here is some art training. This is essentially a digital painting, and the same principles apply."

First, isolate your image, then make a posterize filter layer on it (I used lvl 3). Then Apply a blur to round out the edges (I used Gaussian blur at 2px). Drag this into Illustrator and image trace it (I used colour 50% paths, 75% corners and 25% noise). You can change all the above value to get different levels of detail.  You can then blend with original or just stick on your chosen background to your taste."

If they used a higher shutter speed during capture the image would be a bit new crisp but it starts to feel crunchy, and interestingly, audiences don't like how it feels when watching the movie.   Anyway - the point is, it was captured that way so other than trying some high pass sharpening there's not much you can do other than try to find an actual photo rather than a video still."
photoshop,3ak61g,brianmerwinphoto,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"No.   There is no way to turn a low quality and low resolution image into a larger image that magically contains more information than the original. Only on CSI. :/  Video is essentially just a series of still images; but low resolution (compared to still shots), and normally also have heavy lossy compression to make the file size manageable (similar to JPEG). If you had the original video file from the camera that would be as good as it gets. If it has been recompressed, uploaded to youtube, etc. then the quality will be lower.  For best results you would take a still from the video when displayed at the native resolution of the video (e.g. if the video file is 1280x720, make sure you view it at 1280x720 when taking a screenshot). Scaling it up to e.g. 1920x1080 will not add more detail, just resample what's already there. There may be a built-in function in your video player to take stills for you (so you don't have to use the screenshot workaround)."

You're lucky it's not on his face!  In some areas, like the grass, this is easy as you have plenty of other areas to copy from (clone stamp tool + healing brush). Still, make sure you work using layers.   Then comes the slightly harder parts, like his left side, where you have to reconstruct the edge. Luckily you can see enough to roughly know what it should look like, and you have similar edges to copy from (again, clone stamp + healing, but perhaps also some copy/paste+transform). At this point, I see you are struggling getting it looking realistic - but you should be able to get it looking decent with some more practice, so keep doing it!  Sometimes you need to take short breaks then look back at an area and ask yourself ""does this look realistic?"". Does it look weird? Can I spot that it has been reconstructed (wobbly lines, blotchy shading, repeating areas, inconsistent sharpness or texture)? Then refine it. You might have to go over the same area several times before it looks good enough (but it gets easier with each pass).  Then finally comes the major problem with this image. What should be saved for last once you've ""warmed up"" fixing everything else. The gun and his hands. Here we suddenly can't tell what everything is supposed to look like as it's too far gone and a lot of important details are missing (and can't be copied from elsewhere in the image). Colors we can sample from other parts of the image, but not much else. This ""reconstruction"" will require expert skills and a lot of time to make it look perfect. I think it's a bit beyond your skill at the moment, and frankly even I would prefer to avoid having to do this as it can be a lot of hard work (and just doing it half-good will make the image look weird). You have to create something out of nothing. You can still use a lot of cloning and healing, but essentially it's a lot of manual painting. You have to imagine how the hand is positioned, and then paint a hand with the correct positioning. The same for the gun. I would fix the grass and his arm first, then add a new layer on top to draw a new front for the gun. I would try to look up images of this model of gun to find out what it's supposed to look like. The ""texture"" of the photo we can extract from other areas (using high pass) and apply on top as a pattern on areas where it becomes too smooth after reconstruction.

I'll tell you that, like the pen tool, the key to learning effective use of the clone tool is practice, so here's your chance to get better. Personally, I'd rather just use the paint brush. I'd take the opacity of a soft brush down to 40 or 50%, and taking frequent color samples from different areas of the blue, I'd paint the face out. Much easier and faster, IMHO."

If you save this as a pattern you can fill any size document with the tessellation. This will take a bit of playing around with to ensure that the grid is smooth.

There's a more time consuming way of doing this by masking the layer and selecting it as well, but I don't use that unless it needs to be printed big.  For the thumbnails for youtube, it seems they just quickly cut out the subject/person, pasted him on a second layer and then just bluring the background.

The way I'm doing things, it seems I have to draw seperate beams... that are straight ... because if they're not straight, the directionality messes up. I.e., a horizontal line will look sideways.  The slow and obvious solution is to make the beam... rasterize, and then turn sideways. It's slow and obvious, but at least it works.  For non-straight beams though, this just doesn't work. Imagine a snake-shaped beam... this approach just doesn't work. What do you think a possible solution is for those instances?"

I would avoid rasterizing and instead, make the beam vertical (or horizontal) apply the style, then rotate as necessary. Rotating after apply the style should keep the gradient where you want it. This will also allow you to use the pen tool to adjust the shape layer to a point or other shape.  For curves, I see how that could be an issue. I'd suggest Illustrator as it has more control over gradients on a path. Not sure if Photoshop can do this. Looking at the last screenshot in your post, all of that should be attainable this way."

It looks to me like what you want is just to fill the text with a light wood texture?    If so, the easiest would be to use adjustment layers to lighten the wood, then clip it to the text. Nice and clear way of doing it in my opinion.   Have the white text without black background in your layer groups. Then at the bottom you can place a black layer if you want a black background. Then on top, add the wood texture and clip it to the text group. The text now has a wood fill. To adjust the color of the wood I would recommend just using a couple of adjustment layers to get it the way you want (e.g. Curves + Vibrance; it can also be clipped to the group).   If you want to keep your layer setup for some reason instead of my way, then try setting the text layers to Multiply instead of Soft Light. The wood now shows clearly. Then use one or more adjustment layers to adjust the color of the wood base (e.g. Curves + Vibrance)."

PSD files have minimal/no compression, but if you are desperate for space you could use TIFF instead. It supports more compression (like LZW) that can reduce the file size some.

Find a brush dab it, mask/filter it blend it on top of the clouds/below the player layers.  Good Luck :D"

A simple workaround fix could be to have a layer dump PSD of the same dimensions as the original where you can temporarily store unneeded layers then close to free up resources. I've done this before when files have become unwieldy and it works pretty well although it obviously only works if you don't need everything available at all times.

Be sure you're working on a solid state hard drive, that drive had at least 50% space free AND Photoshop has plenty of disk space available for its cache file (ideally on a separate dedicated solid state drive). Those are the biggest things to work out generally.   Once those issues are addressed, it's time to consider the bus speed on your motherboard.

photoshop,3a3ajv,PROUD_HUFFLEPUFF,2,Tue Jun 16 22:25:57 2015 UTC,"I'm confused about your process but I would like to point out there is a pen tool in Photoshop. You can use it to draw lines and make selections instead of the magic wand tool. If you right click you can ""stroke"" the line which will create a line of pixels using whichever brush you have selected in your brush tools.   Compression between photoshop and illustrator and the use of the magic wand tool are likely your culprits. Another thing that might help would be to separate each color to its own layer and use the mask tool with the magic wand to reveal where you want the color. You can then use ""add mask to selection"" to make a selection you can stroke. you can also edit the mask properties to move the lines where the Color stops in or out if they aren't matching up the way you want."
photoshop,3a3ajv,TasteTheRainbowHead,2,Wed Jun 17 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're talking about the pixels where your linework and fill color meet. That's because you're just using the wand tool to select that area. PS doesn't ""think"" in shapes, but individual pixels, and selecting an area like that with the wand isn't going the select the shape you're perceiving, but the pixels that match the settings of the tools. So there simply will be none or only partially selected pixels between your linework and your selection. Even with a high tolerance setting this will rarely be as clean as you want.  What you want to do is use the wand tool, then expand your selection (select > modify > expand) by X pixels, so that the selection outline is clearly overlaping with your linework, then fill."

photoshop,3a2eeh,keithj5000,4,Tue Jun 16 18:46:20 2015 UTC,The S4W claw is alive and well. There are additional export options we made available in the Photoshop CC 2015 release that we hope will augment (if not supplant) the features present in Save for Web.
photoshop,3a2eeh,phostershop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:49:29 2015 UTC,Good deal!
photoshop,3a2eeh,keithj5000,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"If ""Save For Web"" isn't the primary method they're recommending...what's the new way?   They seem to be pushing us to the ""Export As"" command. That's nice for screen designers, seems to be an improvement to them, but for a lot of other things good old Save for Web is better. At least the Save for Web keyboard shortcut is the same, if I hadn't looked at the menus I probably wouldn't have even noticed the change!"
photoshop,3a2eeh,alllmossttherrre,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"It's weird. I use shortcuts for a zillion many things. But Save For Web, for some reason, I only use the menu. I never realized it until it was gone. Seems like a weird thing to do in the interest of streamlining, since it seems to be such a commonly used feature. Especially for photogrampaphers like me."
photoshop,3a2eeh,alllmossttherrre,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"I never realized it until it was gone.   It is not gone, it moved to the Export submenu. It can still be chosen as a menu command."

photoshop,3a2eeh,rioter,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"I totally understand, it's annoying when they move commands I haven't memorized the shortcuts for. In the case of Save for Web I got lucky because the shortcut's already burned into my memory. (But if they change the shortcut later, then I'll be screwed)"
photoshop,3a2eeh,TheHeavyTheory,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"I'm all for new export options and the dialogue is slick. Haven't spent much time on it but one thing I'm noticing is the export seems to disregard color space. The preview, and resulting file both are noticeably desaturated. Haven't seen any options in the preferences addressing this. Anyone else?"
photoshop,3a2eeh,rioter,2,Wed Jun 17 18:50:57 2015 UTC,"For this release we set out to improve the workflow for screen designers. We found out during our pre releases that this made other types of users jealous of the new improved experience. Unfortunately, we had to make the call to optimise the experience for screen designers this release. Stay tuned, things like colour space are high on our todo list."

photoshop,3a045p,irsic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:24:29 2015 UTC,"Probably is only in the RAW file, once you convert. I'd be wary about going into JPEG to get what you wanted, but ultimately I'd go with what was said about a levels adjustment and save as flattened TIFFs, going up incrementally until the offending area is clipped (devoid of information). It helps to remember where your midpoint is in the levels adjustment (you can manually enter) and gradually crush your blacks (move left most slider to the right)"
photoshop,3a045p,asdfmatt,0,Tue Jun 16 05:36:51 2015 UTC,Compression. Here's a video that explains how JPEG works for instance.
photoshop,3a0ui3,flipdark95,3,Tue Jun 16 10:09:05 2015 UTC,"You could make one side and flip it...?  Now, if the problem is that you want some sort of ""live"" result of what you're doing, you'd have use two copies of a Smart Object (one of them flipped). When editing the Smart Object the main document will update whenever you press save (cmd/ctrl-s). Keep the two windows next to eachother."
photoshop,3a0ui3,chain83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:48:24 2015 UTC,"That... honestly sounds exactly like a convoluted series of steps.  I've made one side and flipped it before, but I was just wondering if there was a program I could get or a addon I could download that has a symmetry mode that draws one half of the line shape you're trying in real-time."
photoshop,3a0ui3,chain83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:16:30 2015 UTC,"A bit convoluted to set up yeah, but at least it's possible. So you can get a preview of how it will look more-or-less live just using regular Photoshop functionality...  If you don't need it live, then just flipping a copy at the end is not really slow or complicated. And if you do it often, record an action and assign a shortcut for it. :)  Why do you need this live preview often for textures btw? I've never needed it myself when making textures, so I wonder."
photoshop,3a0ui3,chain83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:58:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just think it's quicker and helps me make sense of the shape I'm making. It's mainly for patterns, engravings and stuff like that.  ...so how do I record a action and assign a shortcut?"
photoshop,3a0ui3,TheHeavyTheory,2,Tue Jun 16 13:28:40 2015 UTC,"Window > Actions  Create a new action called ""mirror"" or something. Press record. Perform the steps you need to automate (the steps will be recorded). Press stop when done.  To play the action again, press play. Boom! Automation! :D     You can edit the settings for the action (sorry, don't remember exactly the wording of the menu - on mobile right now), and give it a shortcut.  You can also remove steps from an action or add steps by pressing record again.  Actions are awesome. :). Ps: Using ""batch"" or ""image processor"" you can also run an action on an arbitrary number of images in one go! :D"
photoshop,39z4o4,REBER7388,3,Mon Jun 15 23:31:49 2015 UTC,"Posterize filter or colour halftone will give you two different but relevant results, basically you want to simulate it being screen printed with a limited set of colours, so you can't have smooth gradients like you have in the picture. Both of these filters will do this, in different ways."

photoshop,39x9il,wojo1086,5,Mon Jun 15 15:31:18 2015 UTC,Are you viewing the image at 100%?
photoshop,39x9il,keithj5000,3,Mon Jun 15 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"This is a key question. Because of the way it renders, anything with sharpening or noise needs to be viewed at 100% preferably, if not then 50% 200% etc. Interval levels that don't match the 2x / .5 formal render oddly and can't bet trusted."

photoshop,39y4rp,Kriptex,3,Mon Jun 15 19:13:02 2015 UTC,Paint over the lenses in Screen mode. Add some glow. Render layer style. Copy layer and then use a radial blur with the center point on the glasses. Adjust opacity.
photoshop,39y4rp,GuitarWisdom,2,Mon Jun 15 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is a good effect, I decided to use an image masked into the goggles then made a copy of that and blurred that with a zoom blur to make it look like its shooting out."
photoshop,39y4rp,littlegreendanny,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"I messed around with this image and was fairly happy with how it turned out for my own skill level. To summarize, what was most useful was mentally mapping the existing contours highlights when adding the new ones, and adding a tint without white mixed in to keep it from going foggy. The things I did might give you some ideas to try:    You could use hue and saturation on a feathered selection, combining feathered elliptical selections of both goggles, and erase what doesn't belong. You can also adjust Lightness there. If you wanted to fine tune that, you could create a grayscale layer and isolate the highlights existing in the image by using the curves layer, and mask making everything else transparent. (Tutorial I use to remember how to do that) You could then colorize this isolated white/transparent layer of highlights with Hue & Saturation.  After erasing some areas that don't seem like they should be lit up, adjust the opacity with the layer slider, or duplicate if it needs to be more opaque than 100%. Airbrushing the color of the glow on certain highlights like you already described with the paint brush. Rather than drawing actual rays, paint over the real raised shirt wrinkles where the light would reach the brightest, following the contours of the shirt, keeping in mind the radial fade as you go further from the light source. If you noticed that painting on the same color that the goggles glow makes the glow look ghostly or ""too white"" you try double clicking that color and dragging all the way or nearly all the way to the top left corner of the color box, to get the pure-pigment equivalent. Then you could airbrush paint with that on a layer in Multiply blending mode. That will give those areas the appropriate tint without looking like there is white fog. Finally, faintly drawing in a few glowing hairs in his bangs closest to the goggles might be effective.   This is what I got from a combination of these techniques.  If you wanna chat about any of these techniques or if you think I could help you feel free to ask me."
photoshop,39y4rp,sooka,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"This is what I got, I started out for the goggles and ended up..well, it was cool to work on it. For the goggles I added up some reflections, some green smudges and green flames. A very gentle outerglow (from layer styles) - basically making 2 round selections filled with whatever color you have and killing the Fill opacity to 0.   Cables are 50% bogus, after the image was resized is very little noticeable.    Images used from Google Image Search:     cables; background panorama; not so rusty thing for power."
photoshop,39yf7k,jur5ey,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"Does the ""Scale Effects"" option do the job? Right click on the fx symbol on the layer and change the percent depending on how much you've scaled the layer by."

photoshop,39x4s3,blackanddex,2,Mon Jun 15 14:54:56 2015 UTC,Find Some PNG images of water bubbles and water splashes then create a new layer paint it with blue color or add an photo filter (use: underwater). That's the easiest way

photoshop,39wuzi,UU_Bunnyman,3,Mon Jun 15 13:31:26 2015 UTC,I think that example is just a photo of a white card.  Put your design on a new layer on top. Multiply blending mode (if the paper isn't 100 % white and you want to retain the lighting/texture).
photoshop,39wuzi,chain83,2,Mon Jun 15 13:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yup. You can do this with your own picture or some stock photography, and it works for cards, picture frames, shirts, and pretty much anything else."
photoshop,39wuzi,DrewNumberTwo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"This is a weird question, but do you have a tutorial or anything of what all the different blending modes do/how to use them? There is a lot on google, and I have a basic knowledge of how to get around in shit like Photoshop, but small intricacies like tool options or blending modes, I never quite got them.  I'm kind of self-taught from the classroom in a book type stuff which doesn't really cover everything, just the main functions of each tool. I know people kind of shit on that situation but..."
photoshop,39wuzi,radioheads_creep,3,Mon Jun 15 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"It helps to notice that the blending modes are grouped into sections; (The one in parenthesis are the one's I'd focus on first)   First it's the ""plain"" blending modes (Normal). Then you have darkening blending modes (Multiply, Linear Burn, etc.) Then you have brightening blending modes (Screen, Linear Dodge, etc.) Then you have contrast blending modes (Overlay, Linear Light, etc.) Then you have some special ones (Difference, etc.) And finally image components (Color, Luminosity, etc.)   Group 2-4 are all very similar. The brightening/darkening ones do pretty much the opposite of each other, and the contrast blending modes work like the brightening ones for colors lighter than 50%, and darkening for those darker than 50%.    So if you were to blend in an image of a flame or lens flare in an image, you'd use a brightening blending mode. If you are adding a shadow, you'd use a darkening blending mode. Another example. The contrast ones, well, lots of creative fun there, but also useful when doing things like dodge/burn, high pass or frequency separations (it's ok if you don't know what that is). Example of two images contrast blended.  For the special ones (group 5), the one called Difference can be useful to find the difference between two layers (either to align them, to compare them, or to create difference masks). Example of two images almost aligned.  The last group is super useful as well; it allows you to just affect certain ""components"" of the color. Let's say you are applying a Curves adjustment layer, and you only want it to change the brightness of the image without affecting the hue/saturation (color) in any way - then you change the blending mode to Color. If you wanted to alter the color without affecting the brightness, you'd use the Color blending mode (or Hue for just the hue, or Saturation for just the saturation). Example of recoloring before, after.    Google it if you want more detailed descriptions of how they work (saves me some typing). :)"
photoshop,39wuzi,chain83,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! I wasn't expecting you to WRITE me a guide, hahaha, I thought you might just have a generic link or book that goes into more depth than the ""Classroom in a Book"" deals.  But thanks! This explains it very well and is really helpful!"

photoshop,39wuzi,Aeri73,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think that is just a photo of anything and they photoshopped a card and some shadows/reflections onto it.  I think they just threw their image down, created a shadow with some gradients and smoothing, blurring, etc - then created another layer of a reflection by flipping it vertically and creating another gradient layer out of it. This type of stuff probably won't work if your card is too complex, so those other guys' ideas are probably better, haha."
photoshop,39x992,AegonVandelay,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"I tried experimenting with the ""stop"" command. It almost provides the desired result  if you disable the pop-up window, but I haven't managed find a way to make the same button press continue playing the action from where it stopped. It starts over instead.   Also, in case you don't know, you can cycle through the brush presets with the < and > keys. I'm not sure what exactly you are trying to acheive, but maybe you can use that."
photoshop,39x992,Alphyn_dp,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"I wanted to do that, but it doesn't cycle through the brushes in my tool presets palette. It cycles through the default brushes I think.   Is there a way to cycle through the tools instead?"

photoshop,39w8by,photoshopshopshop,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:34:37 2015 UTC,You take a flat image. You use the freeform tool and rotate/scale it like you want to. You can use a fake-horizon if you want. http://www.martin-missfeldt.de/perspektive-zeichnen-tutorial/ You add another layer below and give the flat image a sort of fake-height. You create a background layer and fill it with any color.  Ontop of the background layer you add your shadow gradient. You can use the mask layer for further editings on the shadow.  The second image you linked is really cool because it faked the glass effect and used a drop-shadow from the font and ring layer. Loos pretty neat.

In the case that it doesn't snap to a corner, just create guides, one for each of the edges of the canvas. If you want it pixel perfect: select all then transform selection.

photoshop,39t5p7,travisboatner,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:20:23 2015 UTC,I am trying to get this to work with no success. The issue may be that I have been up since 3:30AM and so I'm a bit bleary eyed and muddle headed. Here's a bit more information and what I have tried:  The pano is a merge of 18 images. A skyline. Lightroom spat back errors trying to merge it so I used Photoshop. It created a ribbon like image that goes up and down using 18 layers and 18 layer masks. The layered psd file is huge.  View->snap to has everything checked but when I select all layers and edit->free transform to drag the corners it selects an area the size of the entire canvas. I tried creating a new guide (horizontal @ 0 inches) but that does not help.  Puppet Warp is greyed in the edit menu.  Holding Option while in free transform creates a point but when I drag it down nothing moves with it. Also true with transform->distort and transform->skew.  I think that the issue may be related to the layer mask on each layer and am tempted to delete them. May just flatten the image and see what happens.

photoshop,39rzye,Axa2000,7,Sun Jun 14 06:56:10 2015 UTC,I don't know what you're getting at? They wanted to know how to do a particular style. To my knowledge you wouldn't really be able to pull off turning a photo into a vintage illustration through the use of photoshop (correct me if I'm wrong). There maybe ways to make a photo look cartoony but it's never going to be the same as an actual drawing and will probably be very obvious that it's been done on photoshop (don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing in this case but usually you want things to not look too processed).   Your comment is basically saying you cannot mention any techniques that aren't photoshop related because this is a strictly photoshop sub? If that's so I'm sorry and won't attempt to suggest anything to anyone unless my answer is relevant to the particular sub.  Just don't assume that photoshop can magically create ANY style/kind of image by a pressing a button and adjusting some levels.
photoshop,39rzye,edakit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:11:32 2015 UTC,"/u/edakit /u/Axa2000 You guys shouldn't argue over such silly things.  To be honest, the only reason I asked was because I couldn't find the right words to google to find my own tutorial and also because I know this subreddit always tends to help point people in another direction if there isn't an answer to their question. I wasn't sure if it could be done or not, so here I am.  While I don't think u/edakit comment is wrong, it's also not helpful. Sure I can attempt to draw it on photoshop or even paper, but I'm not the best at drawing and I wouldn't know how to give it that vintage look.   Anyways, thanks for commenting."
photoshop,39rzye,Axa2000,-6,Mon Jun 15 04:48:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're trying to achieve.. There is already filters you can use to get similar results, like brush filters and such, I don't think it's impossible to do it, I'm not an expert on photoshop to fortunately provide an answer, but you could then go around in every thread here and suggest people draw it.. I see it might be useful to just draw something if it's just not really possibly to do or they don't end up with a good solution, but that doesn't help someone who's bad at drawing or doesn't have the capability.. That's what I'm getting at, I just felt your answer wasn't helpful."
photoshop,39rzye,keithj5000,5,Sun Jun 14 08:41:00 2015 UTC,I think his answer was spot on. That's exactly how you turn a photo into an illustration. There seems to be an epidemic of people assuming that you can simply turn photos into drawings or illustrations with Photoshop.

If you have layers or extra channels, then PS will use the last format used that support these features like psd, tif, or psb.  The quick solution is to flatten the image, save, then undo the last step. Another solution is to make a script that saves a png to the current file location and overwrite existing files.   There is an existing script that comes with PS called ""Save Extra JPEG.jsx"" that lives under ""Presets\Scripts\Event Scripts Only"" in PS's folder.

I have all my regular tools, blend modes, shortcuts etc accesible without leaving the tablet. Some people (including me) work with a hand on the tablet and one on the keyboard. But since setting up the radial menu for tools, and hotkeys on the tablet for modifiers (cmd/ctrl, opt/alt, shift, etc) I don't even leave the tablet.  2) Glove: - I had my GF knit me a custom glove minus the thumb and forefinger. Many people just use a ""one size fits all"" cotton glove with those fingers cut off. Those work just fine, but I have slightly larger hands so they don't work for me. - It will keep your tablet pristine (not polished with hand oils) and keep your hand from rubbing raw on the tablet if you have sensitive skin.  3) Save your setup: - Nothing is worse when learning to use a tablet than all the settings being reset. Wacom utility lets you save and load versions of your current setup. I use that and keep the file on my Adobe cloud space/usb drive for portability.  4) Play, Play, Play: - Try different setups: There is no one perfect set of settings. Many of my programs have setups just for them. My tablet has different settings when Photoshop is open vs Finder for example. - Play with practice files: Just scribble over and over while watching Netflix etc to get used to the pressure sensitivity of brush sizes etc."

I often use the right hand to move the stylus around while using my left hand to use keyboard shortcuts and modifier keys. My Wacom is small so I use it with my laptop a lot, and sometimes, with precision work, I do this crazy thing where my right hand is positioning the stylus while the left hand is doing the clicking, with the trackpad.

photoshop,39nu98,tonylinde,3,Sat Jun 13 08:05:15 2015 UTC,"If you want to give 'just drawing' in Illustrator a go, here's how I do it:  Double click on the paintbrush tool and use it with these settings: http://i.imgur.com/QaFhHIa.png  (The important part here is unchecking 'keep selected', you can play with the fidelity slider to your liking)  Go here to make a new calligraphic brush: http://i.imgur.com/q8eV4gQ.png  With these settings: http://i.imgur.com/7OJUvrj.png  (The important part here is that the size and the variation have the same values. The size value is the largest you possibly want your stroke to be. The variation is how much the stroke varies based on pressure - with this setting, the minimum size will be 1pt, giving you a lot of sensitivity. Adjust the brush size depending on your document size. You may want multiple brushes of different sizes for finer control.   Obviously the pressure setting is important as well or all of that is moot.)  This will give you something similar to the hard round paintbrush in PS. You'll then be able to doodle away without the stroke being automatically selected and they'll vary nicely with pen pressure. Every stroke will still be its own vector based path - so you can select and modify them later. It gives you flexibility - if a line isn't perfect you can adjust it instead of undoing and starting over.  You may end up liking drawing in PS more anyway - I do, as my style is more sketchy than bold - but sometimes a change is nice! I sometimes sketch in PS, do linework like this (I am a bad, bad person as I still really struggle with the pen tool...) and paint/colour in either app, depending on how the piece feels."

Open it up via Windows -> Info. Then drag your mouse around the image and you will see the information concerning CMYK and RGB. As you get more used to dealing with this, you'll understand what CMYK will look like before you print just due to their numbers.  Find specific drivers for your printer AND the paper you are using.

What you need to do is calibrate the monitor to the print basically by holding the print out next to the printed page and adjusting it till it looks close. Make sure you keep any ambient room light at a constant when you do this.

But for minilabs, desktop inkjet printers, print-on-demand publishers, etc, which are now the majority of printers people use, RGB is the correct color mode and the printer driver software is optimized to receive RGB data. In fact, since CMYK generally reproduces a much smaller color range than RGB, if you submit CMYK to an RGB workflow you will probably be limiting colors unnecessarily and wasting the larger color gamut that the printer is capable of.  The real correct answer is to use the color mode that fits the workflow. RGB image into RGB workflow is correct, CMYK image to CMYK workflow is correct.

I just thought it would be good to know since while the majority of printed pieces people see come from CMYK presses, the majority of printers that regular individuals directly send jobs to use RGB-based printer drivers even if the inks are CMYK.  In the big picture my comment is not so much aimed at you, but more to those who might think all printing is the same, and not be aware that ""printing"" on a press isn't the same as the ""printing"" they might know from their home inkjet. Which is something you already know."
photoshop,39lezc,CakieCakes,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:03:46 2015 UTC,"Something else to consider is the substrate you are printing on. Each type of paper accepts ink differently and also has a slightly different hue of white and different level of brightness. Calibration of your monitor would help the most as doopdoopderp mentioned. If you have a laptop make sure that you calibrate it where you will be using it. If you calibrate it somewhere with different lighting and even different colored walls it can make subtle differences in how the color reaches your eyes.   I would always recommend clicking on the info section and seeing the number values for what your RGB and CMY values are. Curves work really well for color management and setting your white and black points.   There is a large number of variables that factor in to color you see in one medium and how it converts to another. This starts from what you see in front of you, goes to how your camera captures it, then how your computer displays it, then how it translates to a print or web medium.   These are all things to look into and consider depending on how accurate you want your color and what your purposes are. First step is definitely calibrating your monitor or paying attention to the numbers/learning how the translate to vision."

What does Photoshop let you do, considering this is text and tables? A better tool would be InDesign. You can place the Word file, but it probably won’t look quite the same. You can easily edit it, work with column and linked text frames and tables (which you can’t in Photoshop). You can place images from Photoshop and scale everything independently.

Make sure the scratch disk is set to a drive with lots of free space.  What are the image specifications that make them so big? (dimensions, bit depth, extra channels?). What do you need to do to these images? Could it be sliced up and processed in smaller chucks?  Ps: Some parts of Photoshop has a limitation of 30.000x30.000 px. If you go over that, some options will be disabled, and you can no longer save as PSD, but have to save as PSB (""large document format"").

This has some great explanations to resolution and several other good to know items you should read.   Do remember there is a nuance between DPI for resolution and DPI for printing (inkjet), as they both seem like the same but are different. Even though your 8""x12"" image has a 300 ppi/dpi resolution, it can be printed on inkjet printer on several settings ranging from draft to high quality (720 dpi to 2880 dpi, or lower/higher depending on the inkjet device); note that the inkjet printer is spraying dot patterns (shading of colors) close together, and needs to reference the resolution (density) to fill it in correctly.   I usually refer to PPI, as the inkjet market using DPI causes confusion when referring to image resolution vs print output settings; Pixels are points btw, and the device/output determines their shape."

photoshop,39e4u7,chain83,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:52:55 2015 UTC,"I can't reallybe very specifc; I don't know what software you are using to view it, and I don't know what the image data looks like.  But generally the issue here is that when you zoom out the appliation that display the image to you will have to somehow show you a reduced number of pixels. It might do downsampling of the full image, or some sort of subsampling. For performance reasons, accuracy may be sacrificed (this quite clearly happens in Photoshop at least, and I think display of raw files might be a bit special as well). Anyway; different resampling/subsampling algorithms can cause fine details (details smaller than what can be accurately reproduced) to appear quite different between applications. Depending on the image, there might also be moiré issues.  Zoom to 100 % when working on fine details such as input sharpening or grain/noise to accurately view it."

When you want to save out the image to the size you want go to Save For Web, and type in a size you need it at ~20% and set interpolation to Bicubic Sharper.  Boom you have your image.  (I like working large and downrezzing so things  come out a little crisper. )   If you want a spray effect, make a grayscale shape in a document that is again larger than you need it (black will become 100% color and white 0% and everything in between).

I have been using pen and shape tools to trace outlines of some bad quality logos to recreate them in good quality.

It can be done on the right side of the anchor point by alt clicking the point with convert point tool and dragging - what I'm asking is is similar thing possible on the left side.  Perhaps it is as you say that all the handles point the same way.

As far as learning curve goes, it's easy to use, but like anything with Photoshop that doesn't mean it's easy to use well. It will just take practice.   That said, if you're worried about the learning curve of a plug-in I'd suggest avoiding it entirely.

photoshop,39e1dy,JUST_MY_OPINION_YO,2,Thu Jun 11 03:02:54 2015 UTC,"You need to understand the very basics of digital images.   A digital raster image (what Photoshop works with) is made up of something called ""pixels"". Basically a grid of small squares. The size of an image is measured in pixels (NOT inches). A pixel has no physical size. http://adobe.rognemedia.no/images/157-3.png  When you are zoomed to 100% zoom, one pixel in the image = one pixel on your monitor and you see everything. If you zoom in, the pixels gets enlarged and you can see them clearly.  Thats it... Just zooming in/out does not change the image in any way...    If you are creating an image for use on the web or something, create the document at the exact pixel dimensjons you need. If creating an image for printing however, we need to introduce one more term.  Since on print the image will have a specific size in inches, and pixels have no physical size, we need to tell it how large the pixels should be. For this we introduce the term ""PPI"" (Pixels per inch), also called ""resolution"". It's self-explanatory; it's a number saying how many pixels you want to squeeze into one inch when printing. At 1 PPI every pixel would be 1x1 inch (and look horrible). For prints that are to be studied up close, you need 300 PPI.  You can change the PPI (and the resulting size in inches) in the Image Size dialog, or when creating your document."

What i learned is editing the ini files is a time consuming trial and error endeavor and be ready to adjust your images a pixel at a time. learn to make non aliased lines (snap to pixel grid) and keep at it. take one (a skin) that someone else did and dissect it and change it. good luck. it takes a very devoted person to build rainmeter skins."

Write out the word you want in the font you want and set it to black.  Duplicate the layer (right click the layer in the layer widget, and select 'duplicate layer), then set the layer in the back to a purple shade. Move it about 5-7 pixels down, and about 5-7 pixels out to the right, depending on the width of your font. It should look somewhat like this.  On the toolbar, rightclick the tool that looks like a grey-filled shape. Select eclipse, and make a oval where you want the lighter detail to be. Make it big, and don't be afraid to have most of it be outside of the canvas. Set this to white by clicking the colour over on the layer widget. Something like this is good.  Select both of the layers with text on them, right click, and select 'rasterize type'. After this you cannot change your word, font or size without it looking bad and pixellated, so be sure the text itself is how you want it. Then, while you still have both selected, right click and chose 'merge layers'.   Now go to the layer above, right click, and select 'create clipping mask'. Then fiddle with the opacity of the layer until you like the look. I think about 20% looks good.  Now, for the final part, go back to the layer the text is on, and click the 'fx' button down on the bottom of the layers widget. Select 'drop shadow.' I set the distance and size to 3 instead of 5, but adjust as you think best. Now your text is finished.  You may want to delete the background layer so it'll be on a transparent background, as well as crop it a bit closer before you save it."

One image of a pin-up painting, and one image closeup of some paint strokes on canvas (perhaps a crop from a larger painting, or just a stock texture). It has not been manually painted in the software.  Place the image of the pin-up as a layer on top of the texture, then add a layer mask to the pin-up layer (a layer mask can hide parts of the layer). Now grab a large soft brush and paint in the mask to hide the parts you don't want (left and right side of the pin-up to reveal the background and make a soft transition)."

photoshop,394ldp,chain83,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""fill them in""? Are you creating a plain path (instead of a shape layer) and then filling it on a regular raster layer?  Then your result is not vector, but raster/pixels. That means it will become a mess if you start transforming/warping it or want to change it.  Instead of ""path"" set the pen tool to ""shape"". Optionally, create your path first, then with the path selected, add a Solid Color Fill layer (the path will be used for the mask automatically and suddenly you have a ""shape layer"").    With a shape layer you can freely edit the path (allowing you to edit the shape and curves of your ribbon), as well as choosing a stroke... Same way you would work with shapes in Illustrator pretty much."

The thing is, how do you get it to understand that it's a 90 degree turn angle, so for example the ribbon goes around an object, like a globe.  See example below:  http://i.imgur.com/CViRiX4.png  I can't seem to connect the nods together to close up the whole thing. With paths I can do that, though, with merging it both copies."

A great advantage as keeping it as vector shapes is that you can freely resize/transform/edit those shapes without quality loss.  If you want shading, brush that in on one or more separate layers clipped to the shape layer in question; or use some gradients (gradient fill layers or layer styles).    Front and back of ribbon will have to be separate layers. The shapes are 2D, not 3D...    Here's a demonstration of a good way to do it: http://i.imgur.com/2W8qjXz.png"

Then add the scanlines.  You're much better off just finding a texture honestly, analogue static / fuzz is special."

Save as ""scan lines"" or whatever you'd like to call it. Now with a photo open, chose the bucket tool and switch the setting from fill to pattern in the top left.

Add Noise + Motion Blur (horizontal) Curves Adjustment Layer, move in the black and white points until you only have a few spread-out lines. Vibrance layer if you need to decrease saturation afterwards (you probably also need to crop off the ends). Pattern Fill layer with the pattern you created. Try something like 10-15% opacity. Another black smart object with a noise filter on it. Set to Screen. On top add a final Curves adjustment to give it the slight cyan tint (reduce red) and perhaps lift the black point slightly.

photoshop,391ffl,chain83,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:48:56 2015 UTC,Hmmm.   Can anyone confirm this.  If I downsample from the largest size bitmap image rasterized from a vector I don't see where the quality is going to take a hit.
photoshop,391ffl,MyLazyEye,2,Tue Jun 9 11:42:29 2015 UTC,"Resampling a raster image should give lower quality compared to resizing a vector image. Even if downsampling. So if you have the option, stick with vectors. It's the safest choice.  Easy to test:   Create a shape layer (or place a vector smart object) into a blank document. Preferrably the actual thing you are working on and need this for; or at least an image with similar qualities. Duplicate it and rasterize the duplicate. Resize document (use Bicubic resampling) to the size you need.   Using the optimal scenario of perfect quality and exactly 50% size reduction, the quality difference was negligible in some images, while a problem with others.    Example:  http://i.imgur.com/E3CxPIF.png The left part of the image was vector shapes, the right part of the image was flattened/rasterized. Both scaled to 50%. Notice the ""halo"" inside the drop-shape – that is from the resampling and not part of the original image."

Then highlight the bottom layer, right click, color range, click black, ctrl+J to put it on a layer too. Highlight the white layer, ctrl+E to merge it with the black layer.

Almost every third party PS filter collection is just using the built-in filters in a certain order or with certain settings.   For example a blueprint effect filter might just use the canned photoshop glowing lines effect, along with blue colorization and then a grid overlay.   As for prepping a photo to use a filter, the best policy is to just capture as much as possible in the photo... as much dynamic range as possible, as much sharpness as possible, and so on... so if the filter removes some of those things, the photo can survive it."

I've been reading a book which explains the process, but there's no language that explains specific color values, tones, grain size that I can carry over into PS/LR.    I've been looking at the settings for each of the filters I apply in LR, which helps my understanding, but I'm looking for more. For example, I was reading about a Kodak IR film recently. It said something to the effect that the film cut the green wavelength by 35% and increased the red by 10%. That was useful. I know a little bit more about how to adjust lighting for that particular kind of film.    Do you, or does anyone else, know where I can get that kind of info? To achieve X effect, use a, b, c, d? Or tutorials/books on how to create specific filters/actions from scratch?"

Digital is nice because you can stuff a ton of dynamic range into a single file, by merging brackets, and you can shoot with several different lighting arrangements and exposures at no extra cost. Not trying to push you away from film, just saying... it's nice to be able to experiment for free.  I do know of several tutorials on how to manually create some of the effects that photoshop filters replicate... what I find useful is, I google a specific effect followed by the word tutorial (infrared effect tutorial) and then I click the images tab to only get image results. Then I look for the images that look really good and view the page where they were found, and avoid the images that look cheesy and clearly photoshopped. Doing this has let me come across some really nice, involved tutorials.  Sometimes the ""tutorial"" is just ""step 1. Open your image, step 2: buy this FilterForge filter, step 3: use it."" ...but even then you might find some interesting new filters.

They often guide you to a specific end result, which is both satisfying and inspiring to create your own things.  So yeah, I pulled the ""google it""-card, but with good reason: you'll see a lot of tutorials, and you can simply choose one of which you think ""hey, I want to recreate that"". Your specification is simply too broad: video-editing isn't typically done in photoshop, and ""graphics working"" isn't very specific.

photoshop,38tmvq,spdorsey,3,Sat Jun 6 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"When converting from 32-bit and down to 16-bit (use exposure/gamma 0/1 as /u/PhaseNone suggested), your document will end up with the color profile specified in your Color Settings.    If the profile specified is a profile with a linear gamma, then that is what you will get. If the profile specified has gamma 2.2 (as it is by default), then your document now has gamma 2.2. If you don't have a profile with linear gamma to choose from, just choose ""custom"" and you can manually input the gamma (base the profile on sRGB or AdobeRGB)   If you don't want to change your color settings, you could convert to 16-bit first (ending up with gamma 2.2), and then immediately go to Edit > Convert to Profile... and choose your linear color profile there (again, just choose ""custom"" if you don't have one saved, and input gamma 1.0). The extra conversion should not be a problem quality-wise as with 16-bit data you have plenty to go on. :)  Remember, when you want to go to 8-bit at some point, convert to a gamma 2.2 profile first to avoid potential banding issues (and you probably want to flatten/merge layers first as well).    Working in linear should give you more realistic blending, and in a 3D/compositing workflow I believe it can be an advantage.    Interesting fact: Working in gamma 1.0 should also give more accurate resampling/scaling as Photoshop doesn't perform gamma-correction when resampling (so if you have a black/white checkerboard and scale it down so it becomes just a gray surface, if you work in gamma 2.2 it will appear to become darker while in gamma 1.0 the apparent brightness will remain unchanged). Might make an impact on areas with high contrast high-frequency details or noise. Link with some sample images.

Learn to label your layers and how to determine what colors look good for web, vs video, vs print.   Learning Photoshop is like learning to cook. You need to be as intimate with your ingredient knowledge as you need to be with your actual cooking. This is analogous to learning your tools as well as learning the process for creation of specific effects and intentions.   You learn basic procedurals and over time you combine them together into complexity.   Knowing when something looks vs when it is incomplete is a big part.   I favor written tutorials with screenshots to video for Photoshop. You force yourself to invent as you go rather than mimic what someone else has done.

photoshop,38scud,rmweiss,3,Sat Jun 6 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"For it to look realistic, here's a list of important things that needs to match:   Perspective. This cannot be changed (much) in Photoshop. The source images must be shot from matching angles. When combining the position and scale of the objects will have to be carefully considered. Lighting. Again, can only be changed to some degree in Photoshop. The lighting on the two images should match as closely as possible (light coming from the same general directions at the very minimum). Sharpness should match. If one image is sharper than the other you will have to blur it slightly until they match. Color/Brightness/Contrast should match. Use mainly Curves Adjustment Layers for this. Start by getting similar black/white points, and then adjust the midtones until it looks like it matches. Use a vibrance layer to adjust vibrance/saturation if needed. Adjust just one of the images to match the other. Shadows. Can be tricky as you will have to manually paint in (on a new layer ofc.) shadows cast from (or onto) any inserted objects. Look at other shadows in the image to get a good idea of the shadow color and sharpness. Use the Multiply blending mode (or possibly linear burn).  While thinking of how light is interacting with your objects and casting shadows, you need to also look at reflections. Especially if there are any glossy/shiny objects. You might need to edit in a reflection. Remember; colors will bounce/reflect off matte surfaces too! Noise should match. If one image has more noise than the other, add extra noise to the one with the least noise (if possible, extract noise from the other image using the High Pass filter and save it as a pattern for easy reuse). Perform global adjustments on the entire image afterwards (not on the two elements separately). Overall contrast, creative color tints, perhaps some vignetting, sharpening, etc. - whatever you want. This will help in bringing it all together.   It's usually also important that you make a very accurate mask (and possibly decontaminate/defringe) when cutting out objects so there's no leftovers of the original background around the edges."

To sample the whiteness *(or color, for that matter), use the eye dropper.  Simply click on the desired area or color of interest.  From there, simply select your brush tool, and paint.   This is different from sampling a pattern, or an area with the clone tool.   Each technique is good for different uses.  The clone tool you can use, but you have to know, whatever sample you take, is going to clone that sample on every click, texture and all.  Where as sampling the color with the eye dropper will simply brush on a flat color that you selected.   I hope this helps."

It was something very foolish that everyone in the world has been suffering from ever since.”   That said, square pixels are not the only game in town these days and never were. There are numerous layouts and shapes that the little colored dots take in different technologies through the history of displays. Heck, back in the days of CRTs it wasn't uncommon to see the color phosphors laid out like this. Fast forward to today, there are numerous smart phones and high density surfaces out on the market that make use of unique subpixel layouts. Here's a close up of the Galaxy S4's strange arrangement for instance. You can read more about that screen here along with some nice close ups of other competing subpixel arrangements."

You don't really need these actions. Learn how to use Photoshop's Adjustment Layers instead. It is one of the first things you should learn if you are to adjust photos in Photoshop anyway, so might as well do it right away before wasting money on photoshop actions that you can soon create yourself...  The most important one to learn (although perhaps the most confusing at first) is the Curves Adjustment Layer. It will give you fine manual control over brightness/contrast/white balance/color tint/etc. of the image in a single adjustment. It does not let you directly control Saturation though (how ""strong"" a color is), so for that you can use the Vibrance adjustment layer (or Hue/Saturation if you want to target specific hues).  Some of the effect here might also be partially from using a Solid Color layer set to pink/blue with low opacity and a blending mode like Soft Light."

If you want to create a line with a vector, you specify a couple of points (with X,Y coordinates) and then whatever mathematical expression would draw the line between them. The nice thing about vectors is that they are always smooth.  Sometimes I tell people that pixels are like making pictures with mosaics, while vectors are like making pictures with wires held down by pins.  If someone were to ask ""Ok so where are these vectors in Photoshop"" the answer is in the Shape and Path tools. Those don't paint pixels, they create vectors. Which in some cases is a lot faster and more useful than painting the same shape.

TO ME the way the vectors work is easier in photoshop - instead of having to make compound paths in what is to me the very weird & uncomfortable way you do in illustrator, you just draw your shapes & carve out your details with the subtract function. Like carving a pumpkin.  But you don't have the offset path function which really comes in handy.  Photoshop & illustrator are both great tools in their own way - Illustrator is just mainly vector-based, whereas photoshop has the function, but that's not ""what it's there for"".  But you can make do in either.  Mainly, raster/pixel work (using a paintbrush or whatever) is stuck whatever size you make it at forever and will never have that sharp clean look that vectors have.

photoshop,38aajf,Iamanentrepreneur,2,Tue Jun 2 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Photoshop is filled with little annoying bugs. Many have been there for years. (Is that bug that zooms out your comp if you have a vector in your clipboard still around?)  Many can be fixed by switching from PS to another app and back again (command-tab). They tend to go away. Some hang around and wait for a quit and relaunch, but those are rare.  Yours looks like a redraw issue. Photoshop stores an image of what you're working on a different zoom level so that I can zoom in and out smoothly. Sometimes those stored images don't get purged, and they can interfere with each other and create funny square tiles. I have no idea what causes it.  Make sure autosave is turned on, and save your file manually as often as possible. Quit Photoshop and see if it goes away when you relaunch."

As long as it just corrupts the preview of the image at different zoom levels it might be ""ok"", but be on the lookout if it starts to corrupt the image data itself!  I would look for ways to run a full test of the video memory just in case (look for software that will test to read/write to the entire memory and look for areas where it gets corrupted). Memtest should check regular memory, but I'm not familiar with any software for dedicated video memory (last time I used that was like 9 years ago on a Windows computer with a faulty video card).

If you want to recreate roughly similar distortion just in Photoshop (with the color shifts) I would create three layers and give them slightly different distortion (using distortion filters or liquify); then in the blending options of the layers set one to affect Red, one to Green, and one to Blue (you don't need to do it for the bottom of the tree layers though). I would recommend using Smart Objects so the filtering is non-destructive and easy to adjust and copy between layers. :)"

You will have to ask a photographer for more info on the light setup, but it's a nice soft light. Perhaps somewhat cloudy day, and a fill light from the front? Just guessing.  Color of the background and color of the people have been adjusted separately. Can't tell exactly what's been done (we don't have the starting point to compare to), but generally the backgrounds are given fairly green-cyan tones (use a masked Curves Adjustment Layer and a Vibrance Layer).

photoshop,388d4s,elhoozn,3,Wed Jun 3 09:50:31 2015 UTC,"If by ""matte"" you mean they don't look over-contrasty and shiny, that is a matter of contrast control. It probably means he shoots raw, not JPEG (since JPEG out of camera is usually programmed for snapshot-friendly snappy contrast), and when processing the raw he is careful to impart a subtle, film-like contrast instead of a contrasty look.  One quick way to get there is, in Lightroom or Camera Raw, reduce the Highlights slider and increase the Shadows slider, go easy on Clarity and Contrast, and watch your clipping indicators to avoid blown highlights and plugged shadows. I'm sure he does more than that, but that would be the general direction.  It would probably be harder to get that look with the tone curve alone, but the principles would be the same: Only add contrast where it is actually needed, and achieve a film-like rolloff in the highlights and shadows.  Also you might use the Radial Filter to keep contrast on the face and lower contrast and exposure even further in the rest of the image."
photoshop,388d4s,photojacker,3,Tue Jun 2 17:45:03 2015 UTC,Quick but not so educated guess: Levels (to get rid of the pure blacks) + Curves (for extra control over the contrast at different brightness levels) + color balance and/or split toning (to change the colours just enough so they arent pure anymore) + noise

photoshop,386wts,00zim00,5,Tue Jun 2 07:46:49 2015 UTC,"Pixels in the original image on edges will have a mix of foreground and backgorund color. If masked perfectly, these pixels will also be partially transparent in the layer mask.  Now, you need to remove the background component from those pixels; basically replace them with only ""foreground"" color. This is usually called defringe or decontamination.  You can attempt to do this using the decontamination-option in Refine Edge, or manually paint over those pixels (e.g. with the clone stamp tool or brush tool) on a new layer clipped to your masked layer.   I have written a simple tutorial for masking hair, where I also perform some basic decontamination using the Decontamination option built into Refine Edge:  http://www.rognemedia.no/diverse/Masking%20hair/masking%20hair.html   On this specific image however, the character is back-lit with blue light. His hair is somewhat colored blue, and you see blue light on the sides of his head. This may look bad on many backgrounds, and even ""correctly"" decontaminated that hair should look blue in some areas. Some manual work will be needed for good results here. Try and see what works for you.  Having a lossless/high quality original will help a lot. JPEG compressionis REALLY bad when doing these kinds of things. Not a joke. It is terrible. Even almost invisible artefacts really mess up the fine nuances required to nicely extract hair. It will give you reduced quality and likely lots of extra manual work trying to fix things. This is not an easy image to work with.  Ps: The more drastic the intended background change, the harder it is to make it look good. Here we have a fairly bright background, and changing it to black is a bad idea... Putting my masked image on white or other fairly light tones however was a lot more manageable."

photoshop,386e4d,Bang3rachi,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:41:42 2015 UTC,Very very very rarely do you actually want to cut out something from an image.  Masking is the best way to go about 'removing' the subject from the background.  It gives you so much more precision.
photoshop,386e4d,metalmosq,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"sorry I should have phrased what I meant better, yes masks are the way to go and what I use personally but you achieve the same thing in the end."
photoshop,386e4d,Bang3rachi,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:26:28 2015 UTC,"If you are skilled at selection/masking techniques, you could do something like use the Quick Selection tool to spend about 30 seconds creating a selection from the outline of the woman.  Once you have that selection, you can save it as a path, a selection, a mask, or a channel, and then you can go wild.  For example, you could add a Solid Color layer, mask it off with the outline selection (invert if necessary), and then all you have to do is change the color of the layer to whatever you want. Then duplicate it for different colors, and offset each color layer with the Move tool to get the staggered effect. Then try different blending modes to control what happens when the colors overlap each other.  Might take a beginner a while to master the string of techniques required, but those techniques are so fundamental that given just the photo of a woman on a white background, a Photoshop pro could probably kick it out in 5 minutes tops."
photoshop,386e4d,alllmossttherrre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:04:40 2015 UTC,"You'd need to duplicate and position multiple copies of the shadow, so that means you would have to either have a wall with no shadow and create the shadow (base it of the outline of the foreground), or to mask out the foreground and extract the shadow and use it several times with different colors that add up to a dark grey (using Multiply blending mode).  If you want this to look realistic it requires a lot of skill; especially when it comes to masking and blending.  In addition you need to fix the colored highlights and shadows on the model."

photoshop,385t4u,TheBayWeigh,2,Tue Jun 2 01:37:13 2015 UTC,This depends heavily on the details of the image in question. You should upload the image (or at least a 100% crop of the problem area).
photoshop,385t4u,chain83,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:07:32 2015 UTC,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxtdH7wpdv8fZWpLY0NDWUtETjg/view?usp=sharing  It's not cropped. Im not asking for anyone to do this for me btw. I'd just like to get another opinion on whether its possible or not.
photoshop,385t4u,chain83,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:55:56 2015 UTC,"Hi  This is not too bad actually. The red channel is fairly clean; almost instantly fixing the lips. A professional should have no problem restoring this. There's very little important details lost. Just be a bit careful around the eyes. Quick demo - just starting slightly.  Work in 16-bit color depth (a 16-bit scan is also nice). You are likely to stack a lot of adjustments before you are done.  There are a hundred different techniques you could combine here, and they might work for different areas of the image.   Add an adjustment layer that removes the color. You could use a channel mixer set to monochrome and only the red channel; or you could use a Black & White adjustment layer and adjust reds a bit brighter Whatever you prefer and thinks works best for your image. Then, on top of your layer stack there should then be a Gradient Map set to Color that you use to recreate a color tint for the image (if you so wish). Sample colors from the original (at least for shadows, midtones and highlights). Perhaps reduce opacity slightly.   This is very useful because we don't really need any color information for the final image. It makes it much easier to work with as we don't have to worry about matching the color all the time.  Use Curves Adjustment Layers below the Gradient Map to adjust and restore the contrast of the image somewhat.   Below (above works to as we don't intend to change it) the BW adjustments you can add a blank layer and start doing the time-consuming work with the Healing Brush (use a hard brush!). A wacom tablet or similar really helps speed things up. Healing Brush is usually the most important tool to master when restoring damaged images. It let's you cover up damaged areas and blend nearby areas nicely while retaining texture. Avoid the Clone Stamp Tool if possible as it will destroy the nice paper texture (although you can restore texture if you have to).    Some problems might be easy to simply paint over with the brush tool (on a new layer) or blur away. If so you obviously lose the paper texture. To add texture back to an area you should find a large smooth area with texture (e.g. forehead) and copy this to a new document. Run High Pass on it to extract just the high frequency details, check for seams, then save as a pattern. Now use this pattern whenever you need to add paper texture somewhere - either using a masked Pattern Fill layer, or the Pattern Overlay layer style.  Above this healing layer you can use adjustment layers to fix things as needed; usually this will simply be masked Curves Adjustment Layers to selectively darken/brighten different areas.  You will likely go back and forth many times, revisiting and improving areas in many iterations."
photoshop,385t4u,chain83,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Oh my god that already looks a million times better. i GREATLY appreciate all of this. I don't understand the majority of your directions (embarassingly).I know it's a newbie thing to say but I was used to just using the clone stamp and healing brush to ""restore"" images. Do you know of any video that explains any of this? I realize I know much less than I initially thought..."
photoshop,385t4u,chain83,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"A gradient map simply recolors the image. You specify a gradient and it will map the brightness of the image to the colors of the gradient. E.g. If if make a gradient going from blue to red the dark parts of the image will become blue, and the light parts red. Super simple to understand once you just try to add a gradient map adjustment layer.    Here I use it to add brown colors to your image (like it had originally). The reason for the Color blending mode is to just change the color component of the image without changing the luminosity (""brightness"").   The reason why is because I work on the image in black and white (since it's actually a grayscale image - so i removed the brown tint while working). That means I have to add a tint to it again afterwards if I want it to have that.  The most important thing in Photoshop is to work using layers. Look at the layers in my screenshot and you will see most of what I did.  I used many different techniques though; you can use pretty much any tool for something. But the main things to focus on are adjustment layers (especially Curves), layer masks, and the healing brush tool (again, always on new layers)."
photoshop,385t4u,zynthesis1981,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:45:30 2015 UTC,For the damaged areas around the eyes did you just use a mask with a curves adjustment layer? (If that makes sense...)
photoshop,385t4u,spektatorfx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:52:23 2015 UTC,"For that I experimented with a move that was just improvised then and there (and it's kinda complex). It's not something that you're likely to use on a regular basis, but it worked out ok here:   I duplicated the bottom layer (""Scan blurred"" in the screenshot).; with the b&w layer on top it was easy to see that the red damage on the eye was turning out darker than the surroundings.   Therefore I clipped a Hue/Saturation-adjustment to the layer and increased the brightness of those red hues (in the hue/saturation adjustment, you can drag the sliders at the bottom to adjust the range affected - it had to be very narrow).   The result became a bit noisy and ""rough"" so I applied a small Gaussian Blur to cover that up.   Obiously the Gaussian Blur then also destroyed the paper texture, so I added a Pattern Overlay layer style with some paper texture in it (that pattern was created by copying a rectangle from the smooth forehead into a new document, using Filter>Other>High Pass, and saving the result as Edit>Define Pattern...). Finally I added a black layer mask to hide it all, and then used a small white brush to paint in the mask only where I wanted to remove the red damage to the eye.   It gave me a better starting point to work from at least. Afterwards it was just lots of Heal and Clone as usual. It's still a bit rough in the screenshot and could use further work."

I'm just on OSX now so I did a quick test with imagej: http://i.imgur.com/CVJ6O6M.jpg Clearly, the image will be crap no matter what, but this might make it less painful to look at so you can make your measurements?  If you think this made it easier to do your measurements, here are FFT/IFFT-plugins for Photoshop (Windows only).     Run FFT filter. Go to the red channel, and paint over any ""glowing stars"" (do not touch the middle one). Run IFFT filter.   If you need to process many quickly; try MY ACTION that attempts to automate the above. It may or may not do a good enough job. If it fails, you might try to go through the aciton step by step and adjust it so it works on your images..."

For example, if the paper was orangish and the lines were red but the drawing is black or blue ink, then some simple hue/saturation tweaks could kill the colors you don't want and leave the colors you do want.  If all that is left in the available source documents is black and white (no grays), it's going to be hard without something like pattern recognition software that can recognize the right-angled straight lines and filter them out so that you are only left with the organic drawing.

And make it so that each cylinder in each hole overlaps slightly on your part.   Once you've done that, you can do a ""boolean difference"" operation to subtract from your original object all the parts that are in contact with the cylinders (because of the overlap).

Draw the gradient from the exact center of the document (use guides). Make a new layer and fill it with 50% grey. Use the noise filter to add some monochromatic noise to the grey layer. Use the radial blur filter set to spin on the noise layer. Set the blurred noise to overlay and copy it. Set the top one to 20% opacity. Gaussian blur the lower noise layer till it looks right. You can also blur the gradient layer to get rid of the sharp point in the middle. Insert it into a new document as a smart object and mask off a feathered circle.  Copy the object as needed to get a pattern.

Those applications work fine with a modest discrete GPU or newer integrated graphics, especially Iris or Iris Pro.  Older integrated graphics are probably to be avoided.  One thing about integrated graphics is that if you want to use them with graphics programs, since the graphics memory is taken from main system memory, the computer should probably have closer to 16GB of RAM rather than the 8GB in the computer that was linked. Having extra RAM to hand over to the graphics is especially important if you want to run multiple large monitors.  But these days, unless you spend all day with gaming/3D/video editing, the latest integrated graphics are not intrinsically evil. Heck, the latest Intel integrated graphics in those little low-end MacBook Airs can run a 4K monitor now.

That is absolutely, one hundred percent, false. CUDA is a proprietary NVIDIA technology. I don't think Photoshop or Lightroom support CUDA specifically, and also, I don't think CUDA is supported by any MacBook Pro graphics, particularly not integrated graphics, mostly because none of them are by NVIDIA.  If you read the GPU system reqs for Photoshop and Lightroom, the primary methods of GPU acceleration supported by those applications are OpenGL and OpenCL, which are both widely available and also supported on integrated graphics. CUDA is not mentioned in either document.  If we are going to talk about CUDA specifically, the Adobe applications that do the most with CUDA are After Effects (but only for 3D) and I think Premiere Pro.   And they're not 4k they're 2304-by-1440. I own a last gen Macbook Pro.

When it's Iris Pro vs the very few discrete graphics left available in the Mac product line, I believe Iris Pro is not that bad for static graphics at all, even on large monitors, or at least, not bad enough to rule out Macs like the Mac Mini or MacBook Air which have no discrete option whatsoever, and not bad enough to say that the only Mac laptop worth using for photos is $2499. That is simply not the case. Integrated graphics Macs like the Mac mini and MacBook Air work fine with Lightroom and Photoshop, according to many user reports.

photoshop,383753,RazorLeafAttack,3,Mon Jun 1 16:29:45 2015 UTC,what problems are you having with 16 bit mode? if you're using 8 bit color this will happen due to the limited color spectrum.   One solution I use is to highlight the layer with the blur/gradient (assuming it's rasterized and not a layer effect). I then click on the Lock transparent pixels icon in the Layers panel - looks like a checkerboard. Then apply enough of a Gaussian Blur for it to soften those edges. Also try adding a subtle noise to it to further prevent banding.
photoshop,383753,TheHeavyTheory,3,Mon Jun 1 16:45:18 2015 UTC,Is it apparent at 100% view? PS shows 8 bit previews until you hit 66% regardless of color space. Try exporting a TIFF and viewing outside of PS. If banding is still happening the noise trick as others have said works well. Good luck!

Stuff that was already created as raster in 8-bit will have to be recreated in 16-bit or blurred to cover it up. Adding noise or using the (8-bit only) spatter filter can also help. When zoomed out it might look like there's banding while working in 16-bit, but this is just a rendering artifact. Zoom in to 100% to verify. If it's not there, don't worry. :) Keep your 16-bit original. When saving a copy for sharing or whatever, flatten first, then convert to 8-bit and save your copy."

photoshop,380sk4,jg65,5,Mon Jun 1 00:36:32 2015 UTC,"If you have the latest version of Lightroom (CC or LR6) then you can do HDR in LR without having to go to Photoshop. Select the photos you want to use and then if you right click on a photo and select Photo Merge > HDR, it will open a dialog box and you can take it from there.  Some things to note:   The image you get is a much more realistic version than you typically see with HDR. It doesn't give you that HDR look but it gives you much more latitude when editing (you can take the exposure slider much further, for example). You also don't get the HDR editing options you do with Photoshop. So this doesn't replace PS for HDRs entirely.  It outputs the image as a RAW file (DNG). This gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to editing. It also ends up being a much smaller file size. From my 7D Mark II tests, they seem to be around 60MB. Compare this to creating a TIFF from Photoshop which could be hundreds of MB per file. The bizarre thing about Lightroom's HDR is that it seems to work great with only 2 photos. I noticed this and Adobe have since confirmed it. I just use the +2 & -2 images and I can't really tell much of a difference than if I use 3 or 5 images. This greatly speeds things up."
photoshop,380sk4,irich,2,Mon Jun 1 01:59:31 2015 UTC,"The bizarre thing about Lightroom's HDR is that it seems to work great with only 2 photos.   I think this is because, unlike most HDR apps including Photoshop*, Lightroom accepts raw format input. Raw originals have much better tonal information to work with than post-raw images, especially in the highlights. If you have just 2 photos and they are far enough apart that the highlights and midtones of both raw photos cover all the important tones in the scene, more images are just redundant. I also read that in addition to 2 images being faster, there is a lower chance of ghosting, because you only have 2 variations of the image. Every additional image added may have a portion that has moved and will ghost and require more processing time.  *While Photoshop itself has HDR that does not accept raw, the latest Adobe Camera Raw does have the same raw-based HDR and panorama features that Lightroom now has."

Nothing wrong with that, but the new in-Lightroom 6/CC DNG HDR workflow should be strongly considered from here on out.  If you are using the new raw-based HDR workflow that done 100% inside LR, there is no point in making any adjustments before applying the LR HDR merge. Wait until it's done and then apply any adjustments to the merged DNG HDR using the raw controls in LR.

On that layer I use the dodge and burn tool at a super low opacity (like 8%) to draw in the definition.

If you have a large enough room you can get away from the wall shoot this with a single light and the background will naturally go dark. Additionally if you don't have room but do have lighting you can shoot outside after dark and force a background to go dark."

photoshop,37x6jb,PhotoshopperVector,2,Sun May 31 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"For one thing, asking for help editing an Illustrator file in a Photoshop forum. For another, I assume, editing it in Photoshop. Edit in Illustrator. Learn the difference between the Select tool (black arrow) Object Select tool (white arrow with +) and Direct Select tool (White arrow).  Direct Select tool: Selects individual points or segments on a path. You can delete a point or segment, breaking the path. You can edit the control handles on a point or segment to change the direction of the curve. You can move a point or points (shift + click to select multiple points) or use the transform tools like Rotate or Scale to alter part of a path. For example. select the bottom points of a rectangle then scale them to make a trapezoid.  Select tool: Selects entire objects or groups. Once selected you can transform or delete the group. I actually use this tool rarely. My guess is this is the tool you have been using, so all you can do is delete entire objects, shapes, or groups.  Object Select tool: Works much like the Select tool. You can’t select any detail finer than a single object or path, but if you have several objects grouped this tool will let you select individual paths or objects in the group, rather than the entire group.  Other tools that help…  Pen tool: This is Illustrator’s killer feature. Learn the pen tool to draw and edit shapes. Click on an existing point to remove it without breaking the path. Click on a segment to add a point where you clicked. There’s not much more I can say here. Search for Illustrator pen tutorials. Practice.  Anchor Point tool: Hold Option or Alt as you click on a point with the pen tool. You can turn a curve point (control handles are symmetrical) into a corner point by dragging one handle. You can turn any point into a curve point by clicking and dragging on the point to create new control handles.  For more help, make sure you are using Illustrator, post screen captures to better explain your situation, and ask in /r/Illustrator."

Let's say I want to add some anchor points that would affect both the circle & the arrow shapes together. I'd need them merged in order to manipulate the anchors as if they're part of 1 shape.  Or what if I was designing a different icon that used various outline/fill shapes together. Adding anchor points onto separate paths would become agonizing very quickly.

I'll open an AI file and copy the path into Photoshop. So far so good.  Now let's do Layer > New Fill Layer. This doesn't look right because it's supposed to be a line icon. So let's remove the fill and instead give this shape a stroke. Hmm, nope.   So I've got a path that looks great but I can't turn it into a workable shape in Photoshop. AFAIK you cannot convert a shape from AI into a vector shape in PS other than smart objects. Which are okay. But I want to edit the individual anchor points in Photoshop.

However, what matters is what is a GOOD combination of tools to deal with a given situation; and what is good for one image might be useless on another.  There is no one good way to cut out something. It is highly dependent on the image area in question.  However, what can be agreed on is that 99% of the time you should definitely be using a mask. Not something destructive like the background eraser or the delete button (shudders).   Then what we then are reducing it to, is different ways to create layer masks. A general workflow could be to make a selection of the area you want to keep, add layer mask, then refine mask. Or refine edge before adding the mask (doesn't matter, same result). Example tutorial for hair. Optionally, depending on the image, it might be better to create a path and use that as a vector mask (usually something with hard edges and smooth curves).  You may also do lots of manual painting and refining of the mask you have created. Combining both vector and layer masks, etc. Maybe even going ""old-school"" and using channels as a base for your mask. Loads of possibilities - again, it all depends on the situation. :)  Ps: When masking objects, pixels at the edge will contain a mix of the foreground and background color. Then you need to look into decontamination/defringing. This is something you do after you have created your mask if needed."

photoshop,37o5nv,chain83,0,Fri May 29 09:18:08 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you need the color mode to be CMYK while editing? I'm 99% sure you should be working in RGB. CMYK is usually something you convert to when generating the print file at the end, and not something you want to be working in when making your images unless you have a specific need to manually control the color separations. RGB will give you smaller files, larger gamut, more tools, better performance, crappier blend modes, you don't have to worry about ink coverage when working, and you can just turn on Soft Proof (cmd/ctrl-y) if you want a live preview of how it will look when converted to CMYK down the line...  To create the linked image, structure your file like this:    Layer 5: Text. Layer 4: One or more images of torn paper (masked)... Layer 3: Stock photo of wrinkes. Adjust so the paper is medium gray, highlights brighter, and shadows darker. Set blending mode to Overlay (or similar). Adjust opacity to taste. Layer 2: Gradient Map Adjustment Layer, clipped to to Layer 1. From purple to red. Layer 1: Portrait of superman, masked. Bottom layer: Blue color, perhaps a gentle gradient."

I highly recommend trying them out. You can use them standalone or include them as part of your workflow. For me I use a variety of programs but they always end up in photoshop before completion.  That's where everything comes together.  Here are a few programs the piqued my interest lately.   ArtRage.  Great affordable natural media app with easy interface.  And the sticker brush is ridiculous.   Krita. (free)  Great brush engine.  Some really crazy painterly stuff you can come up with.  Mischief (free version) Infinite zoom feature.  It paints like a bitmap app but is actually similar to vector and resolution independent.  Super easy interface.  Very fast and natural, great for concept sketching and early layout.  It’s also cool that you can do something with very painterly tools then export it at crazy high resolutions with no loss of detail.   Verve.  Bizarre Alpha build of a fluid dynamics paint engine.  This is a really cool tool for creating beautiful flowing backgrounds abstract or otherwise.  Though I’ve seen people get tight with it.  Here is the developers youtube channel so you can see what it’s about.

Change the panel to manual by clicking he little square box at the bottom of the panel. Select the blue channel and drag up the bottom left handle to add blue to the shadows. For the highlights: select the red channel and move the top handle to add red. Go back to the blue channel and drag the top handle just a little bit to add some yellow to the highlights.   The process is roughly the same in Photoshop. Just add a curves adjustment layer and follow the same steps.

And like you say, nothing works miracles. With that being said in desperate times I will sometimes use Noise or Film Grain to obscure .jpg compression artifacts. I'm partial to Noise (uniform, monochromatic) for this as the monochromatic option eliminates that artificial rainbow RGB effect you otherwise get. But you can also avoid the RGB rainbow using Film Grain if you apply the filter to a duplicate layer and then change the blending mode to luminosity.   Keep in mind that you are basically obscuring one undesirable digital compression artifact with a less obtrusive and perhaps even artsy/old school film grain look. You will need to put enough in there that you do actually see it, but don't kill it either and live with the fact that this will only go so far. If you get the size and amount right the image will have the appearance of being smoother and slightly sharper. I used to use a Photoshop filter called Super Smooth before adding the noise but I believe that might be one of those old dependable filters that didn't get updated for recent versions of Photoshop and/or 64-bit."

This is typically done to optimize for specific lighting conditions or by very picky users who want to customize the default rendering.  On top of camera profiling, you can adjust an image the way you like it, then click the little menu button thingy at the right side of the tab, and in the menu that drops down, choose Save New Camera Raw Defaults.

photoshop,37jr0u,rrandomCraft,2,Thu May 28 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"It's not actually a problem. Photoshop is just a bit... different... then most applications when it comes to memory management. I would allocate a lot more than 28% btw. Return it to 70% and go up or down from there if you are having problems or attempting to fine-tune performance (see links at the bottom).   That is the correct behavior -- Photoshop reuses the image memory that it allocates (up to the limit you set in preferences). If it didn't do that, things would run much slower. Normally there is no need to quit and restart Photoshop -- all the memory just gets recycled.   -    This is very good memory management - otherwise Photoshop would be significantly slower.  Unfortunately this is more advanced than the techniques typically taught in universities. Photoshop is not leaking RAM, and reuses the RAM it has allocated. Unused memory will be paged out, and if the OS really needs more RAM available Photoshop will free up some of it's RAM. Photoshop's RAM usage should have little to no impact on other applications.   -    After closing a document, the memory from that document gets reused by the next document. The total memory usage will not increase unless you load documents that need more memory (including history states).  The benefit is that it runs MUCH faster than trying to free and reallocate memory. There is no problem, and no need to clear memory.   https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/optimize-performance-photoshop-cs4-cs5.html#main_Memory_Usage  http://feedback.photoshop.com/photoshop_family/topics/free_up_memory_in_photoshop"

Also, the reason I set it so low, is because the memory tends to go a bit overboard when doing memory intensive tasks, then my computer crashed more often. I wouldn't mind it if the application ran slow i I set a low memory allocation."
photoshop,37jr0u,PhaseNone,2,Thu May 28 14:37:26 2015 UTC,Windows (or any OS) memory management is way more complex than that and 100% memory usage is always optimal when the computer doesn't have enough: writing stuff to HD is really slow so why leave 30% free.

I have pushed my computer sometimes to where there wasn't RAM left for anything and it slowed to a crawl until I quit some programs. But rarely does it crash. Under heavy RAM loads a modern OS should be able to deal with it using a combination of RAM compression, swapping to VM, etc. If a computer crashes under these loads I'd start to wonder if there is a bad RAM module in there."

It does indeed scale the display of the image up as well although actual pixel dimensions are unchanged.  For example, using the manifest file method, at 100% zoom a 100x100 pixel image takes up the same area on-screen as a 150x150 pixel image does at the default scaling.  You can look at it as the 66.67% zoom level effectively becomes your new 100% zoom  I'm definitely willing to put up with this to get the 150% interface  Thank you for bringing up that point though.. it's definitely something people should be aware of who want to try this"

You're best bet is to either flatten the image first, selecting the biggest texture rectangle as a whole, copy it to a new layer (ctrl+j) twice, select the top most one and scale it down to 50% with the upper left corner selcted as anchor (you'll find those options in the bar on top after selecting free transform (ctrl+t), use the move tool to slide it to the right (hold shift to stay pefectly horizontally) and it should snap to the side of the larges texture (thanks to second duplicated layer we created, if snap to layers is selected). Now you can repeat the scaling by simply pressing ctrl+j and ctrl+shift+t, then move in position.   Or, if flattening is somehow out of the question, create a new layer and put 4 hard pixels in each corner of the edges of the largest texture with the pencil and either merge the image layer with that layer or have both selected for the scaling/transformation.

Those paths can be used as masks for a layer, they can be a shape layer, or they can be a clipping path for the entire image. You can create text layers. If you save a file as Photoshop PDF then those shapes and text will, if possible, be saved as vectors. The vectors saved will not have fill or stroke attributes as they would if you saved from Illustrator. Instead they will be clipping paths for embedded raster images, even if the shape has a solid colour fill. The only format Photoshop can save vectors to is PDF.  So technically yes.

photoshop,37gyk2,noshj,2,Wed May 27 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"Design in a vector application like InDesign or Illustrator. That file should be CMYK. Your photos from Photoshop can be RGB. Do all type and shapes in the vector program. Images should have an effective resolution of at least 200 PPI. 300 PPI is what everyone says, but 200 PPI is usually enough. More is generally better, but don’t decide an image is useless because it is under 300 PPI.  What is effective resolution? It’s the resolution of a printed image after considering scaling. If an image is 72 PPI in Photoshop that is not an indication it is unprintable. That 72 PPI is just an arbitrary piece of data that defines how large the pixels are by default. What really matters is how many pixels there are. Place that image in InDesign and scale it to 24% and it’s effective resolution is 72 PPI ÷ 0.24 = 300 PPI.  Talk to the printer about what they need."

photoshop,37gyk2,leftnotracks,1 point,Wed May 27 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"If you can do it in Illustrator or InDesign I urge you to do so. Photoshop is not appropriate for delivering a final file for print. InDesign and Illustrator can include bleed. Any text or shapes drawn in those programs is vector, so it will print sharply regardless of the resolution of other images. Even if you do everything, including text, in Photoshop it is a good idea to place the PSD into an InDesign or Illustrator file.  If you have no way to do this, then so be it. Use Photoshop PDF as your supplied file format. This will preserve text as vectors. Be sure to include a bleed if necessary and to make sure the printer knows the bleed size and the printed size. If you don’t do that you risk having your file scaled to fit the page.  Assume nothing, and ask the printer any questions you have, no matter how mundane. The printer wants your file to print without any problems. Answering your questions and ensuring the delivered file is ready to print with minimal setup is in everyone’s best interests."
photoshop,37gyk2,chain83,1 point,Wed May 27 16:08:31 2015 UTC,"Wow I had no idea about all this! Thank you! Unfortunately I only have Photoshop cs6, but what is bleed?"
photoshop,37gyk2,chain83,1 point,Wed May 27 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"""Bleed"" is essentially a safety margin; it's the area around your document that will be trimmed off. Your artwork should continue a bit beyond the trim edge (where the paper will be cut) and into the bleed, so that you don't get a thin white edge if the cutting of the paper is a slightly off (it often will be).  Example: If I was to make a 12x12 cm CD cover (or whatver), I would add 3 mm (1/4"") extra ""bleed"" around the edges. In applications like InDesign/Illustrator you can properly define this in the document setup, but in Photoshop you will have to increase the canvas a bit; so I would make the document 12.6x12.6 cm. Remember that the outer 3 mm will be cut off after printing, so add some guides to avoid placing content too close to the edge.  In Photoshop CC you can super-easily add guides by going to View > New Guide Layout... and choosing ""margin"" and inputting your bleed width.  As /u/leftnotracks said, remember to talk to your printer, as when you create a PDF from Photoshop there is nothing in the document specifying the bleed (!) so they will just see a 12.6x12.6 document and have no way of knowing if you have bleed or how wide it is. Then it is nice if you have told them this, so they know how to handle your document correctly (or they might accidentally resize it or something)."
photoshop,37gyk2,cgiall420,1 point,Wed May 27 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Great thanks! When you account for bleed, do you make the extra 3mm for the image size? Or the canvas size?"
photoshop,37gyk2,leftnotracks,1 point,Fri May 29 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"The image size & canvas size are always identical...  But I assume you are asking if you already have created the document if you should increase image size or canvas size. The answer is, whatever you prefer for the image in question, but probably Canvas Size (just adding 3 mm on all sides instead of scaling everything). Remember to extend the background into the bleed afterwards."

You can then replay those steps later, and even on multiple images at once using Batch/Image Processor. Actions are not very intelligent, but they can often get the job done. It will be easiest if your input images are always the same dimensions (and the only difference is orientation).  You want to make two actions; one for vertical images, and one for horizontal ones. If you have Photoshop CC you can also make a third action that has a conditional step that launches one of the other two actions depending on if the image is horizontal or vertical (so you don't have to think about that before running the action)."

Probably the best answer for this scenario.  Or, you can experiment with resizing to exact pixel widths and heights of multiples of twos i suppose. Anything else will definitely start anti-aliasing.

And then there's your resolution and quality loss....which you're suffering with your audio as well, but it's absolutely more apparent with the image. You simply can't transfer to VHS and back to a computer and expect print worthy resolution Not with your connection flow.  There are plenty of grain overlay options out there and plenty of tutorials on how to use them.

Create a new layer and fill the selection with black.

photoshop,377mgu,PhaseNone,1 point,Mon May 25 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"Scanning at higher resolution will result in more pixels. Pixels are what you are working with, so the more you have, the larger you can reproduce the scan.  But…  You say you are scanning a photobook. Is this a printed book, like from a publisher pretend on a printing press? If so, the photos are not continuous tone images, like a photographic print would be or a scan of a slide or negative. There is a halftone screen in the photos that will greatly limit the effective sharpness of your scans. Enlarging the scans will enlarge the halftone screens. The smaller photos, scanned at higher resolutions, will suffer the most because the halftone will be more pronounced since it will be enlarged more.  You can use filters like Median to reduce the appearance of the halftone screens. The real issue is that the images, despite their size, have limited detail. At poster sizes this will be obvious."

I experimented and did a selection of one of the smaller photos, scanned just that portion at 2200dpi which gave me an image with roughly the same resolution as before, but as expected the result was definitely unusable. I imagine printing even an A3 poster from it would look pretty messy, so I think I'm going to have to settle for scanning those individual small photos at something like 1000-1200dpi and at most get A4 prints out of them.  To be fair, I'll probably end up not even printing them, but it'd be nice to scan them at a resolution that would allow for the largest possible print at a passable quality.  Anyway, thanks for the help."
photoshop,377mgu,PhaseNone,1 point,Mon May 25 17:48:09 2015 UTC,900dpi is more than useful. Offset print maxes out around 200 dpi so scanning it at more then 300 dpi won't bring out more detail.

You may need to make some changes to the original, to ensure that your final will separate from the background properly. eg masking.  3 Once happy, Image > Mode > Bitmap.

photoshop,36vk08,spdorsey,3,Fri May 22 13:40:25 2015 UTC,"Flatten your image before dropping from 16- to 8-bit (or nest it in a Smart Object instead if you want to keep it editable). By default Photoshop will apply dithering during the conversion (unless you turned this off whenever you last used Edit > Convert to Profile... - Yes it's hidden in a weird place). This dithering should be sufficient to avoid banding in the image itself (assuming a flattened image). If zooming out (viewing the image smaller than 100 %) Photoshop will often show banding that isn't actually there. This is actually just a rendering artifact due to Photoshop cutting some corner when displaying the image. Zoom to 100 % or more to verify if the banding is real.   Assuming we start with a file that has no banding, but we suspect later processes may introduce it (print, jpeg-compression, etc), then the only way to help cover it up will be to increase the image noise. At least in the problematic areas.    The simplest method is just to run the Add Noise filter (monochrome/low strength).    Personally I have an action that does the following:     50% gray solid color fill layer. Convert that layer to a Smart Object. Overlay blend mode (Soft Light and Linear Light are options, see what you like). Add Noise filter (turns into a Smart Filter so it's possible to go back and adjust it). Load RGB-channel (Luminosity) as selection. Apply selection as a layer mask. Invert mask. (This is just how I originally made the action; using Blend If instead of the layer mask is an option that would allow you to edit the underlying image without having to recreate the mask).   I now have a very flexible noise layer (with a single click!). My hitting cmd/ctrl-m on the mask I can use Curves to adjust how much noise i want in shadows/midtones/highlights, or I can just paint in the mask with a brush to change the amount of noise somewhere. I can also just disable/delete the mask if I don't need it. And if I want it to be more like ""grain"" instead of fine digital noise I can add a tiny amount of Gaussian Blur. :)    You mentioned the (8-bit only) ""Spatter"" filter. That's a great filter for covering up banding that has already occurred. Since you work in 16-bit you should be able to avoid having to use it. If you do have to use it though, yeah, it can be a bit cumbersome as you have to use masks to limit it to smooth areas of the image, and you might have to have several passes of it as well (small radius close to edges, larger radius on the larger surfaces). Radius would depend on width of bands. I am thinking it could be could possibly be semi-automated if this is something you have to do often. Create an action that duplicates the layer, adds spatter filter (asking for input for the radius), then creates a surface mask."

For that size I would expect an acceptable effective resolution to be 100 PPI (PPI, not DPI) at output size, which means placed images should be 600 PPI. Keeping the design in Illustrator or InDesign means vector elements, lines, and text have infinite resolution and will print sharply.   But above all I would talk to the printer.

photoshop,36tsh5,chokomilk,3,Fri May 22 06:53:58 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it's a combination of composited images with a nice warm glow filter/effect added on top of all the layers, some dodging + burning on the skin tones, the highlights bumped up, and lowering of the contrast. I think a texture was also overplayed on top at low opacity.      This is popular in the ""Pin-Up"" kind of photography. I found  this trailer for a PRO tutorial  that goes over these concepts by PHLEARN (love this Youtube channel/ website, you should subscribe OP) on how to create these Pin Up images in Photoshop.  I might buy this later. Here is a free full tutorial I found that is not as good but goes over the same concepts via another YT channel I love (Howard Pinsky).      I found the original digital artist who made the image OP posted btw. His name is Ankur Patar and here is his Behance profile. Here is the image OP is referencing along with a few in the same collection. I agree with you OP. Looks awesome!!!"

Since Photoshop is at play, you can tell the composite was planned, angles and lighting are thought out, but the sizes of elements are...off. Either larger or smaller to create jarring impact. Pair this with some clever lens choices and you can create some very surreal scenes.   But it'll take some practice and knowledge. You may also be looking at results that only come from using quality photography equipment too.   Tutorials will get you through much of it.

photoshop,36voa0,mewk69,3,Fri May 22 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"/u/PhaseNone is correct. I will just repeat what he said, but with additional details.     This is a color management issue, so understanding the basics of that would really help you understand the issue (and how to avoid such problems). Here is a good read if you find the time.  1. Calibrate your monitor.    This is done using a measuring device that attaches to the front of your monitor. There are several brands. Personally I've only used the really good - and more costly - Eye One Pro (so I cannot comment on the quality of other brands).     Note: If you have a laptop, it is likely your monitor is not very trustworthy for color. They often use cheaper panel types and the color shifts a lot depending on view angle. Many also have a glossy front that may potentially (?) interfere with calibration. So for color critical work, I recommend an external IPS monitor (""IPS"" is the panel type). But this alone should not cause as much color shift as you are experiencing.     What the monitor calibration does is measure how your monitor actually displays the color values given to it. An ICC profile is generated and set as the ""display profile"" in the operating system. Photoshop is now able to display colors correctly (color values sent to the monitor are converted using the ICC profile).  3. If printing yourself: Calibrate your printer.  Just like the monitor is calibrated for the software, printers needs to be calibrated as well. This is essentially done by printing a sheet containing a bunch of small color swatches, and then measuring them. The exact thing you do when calibrating a monitor. It generates an ICC profile, and saves it. This has to be done for every ink/settings/paper combination; as colors will be very different depending on these variables.     Note: Printer drivers usually ship with a few ICC profiles already, that can be used if you are unable to calibrate yourself. They might not be quite as accurate, but good enough for most use; but be aware that they will only work if you use original ink and the paper types the profiles were created for.   It is now possible to print with predictable colors.  In the Photoshop print dialog, set it to ""Photoshop Manages Color"" (2), and then choose the correct profile for this type of paper. In the printer/driver settings (6), disable any color correction or auto adjustments. Print!  2. If external company handles printing: Ask the printer for the correct print profile.  Less work for you! Let someone else worry about printer/press calibration! :)    In this case you simply ask the printer about the specifications they want on the files given to them. This would importantly include what color profile you should be using for your files. They might want it as sRGB or they may want it as a specific CMYK profile; just convert to whatever profile they specify when exporting your PDF (using whatever settings they specify). Often they can even supply you with a PDF preset (convenient!). Or in the case of sending an image file (JPEG or TIFF instead of PSD), manually flatten and Edit>Convert to Profile... to the profile they want and save a copy.  Get the specs confirmed in writing (e-mail) if the information is not clearly listed on their website. That way, if your file follows the specifications and still comes out with bad colors, it is much easier to argue that it is them who need to re-print it or provide compensation. ;)"

Break up them edges where it gets beardy!  Watch your mask edges. The cheeks seem ok, but the handlebar-mustache area is very rapid and solid.  As a blond person, I would say that I'd expect a bit more skin tone showing through in places.  Without that, it can look like the male version of women who draw in their eyebrows.  We should see some more skin color poking through in the mustache area, especially near the edges.  For hair, it's a patchy transition not a blurry one.  The 'soul patch"" extension down to the bottom of the jaw-line is looking a little coppery.  Is that skin showing through? if so, it should match the neutral skin tone.  A little less orange, a little more blue.  I super like the patchy color variance. The symmetrical areas of lighter blond on the left/right sides of the chin really help sell the realism. Us blond folk can have some weird streaks going on and this is a great feature to have."
photoshop,36nk6y,Saddex,18,Wed May 20 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"If you are cutting something out you should be using a layer mask. If not, start using that immediately.  Pixels near an edge will normally contain a mix of both foreground and background color; in your case the original background was white, so you end up with a white ""fringe"".  You then have two options:   Recolor those pixels. Mask them away (make the mask ""tighter"" cutting away a bit of the object).   Now, with the mask selected in the layers panel, go to the properties panel and click ""Mask Edge"" (this is just like Refine Edge, but works directly on the mask). See if adjusting the mask helps; maybe a slight Radius increase, perhaps contracting it slightly. See what works for your image.  Next, look at the ""Decontaminate"" option at the bottom. It will recolor any pixels on the layer made semi-transparent by the mask. It is destructive, but by default it will duplicate your layer (giving you a backup) so don't be scared. :)    If Decontaminate doesn't do a good enough job, do it manually. Clip a new layer to your masked object and paint along the edges with a brush tool or perhaps the clone stamp tool.    Here's a tutorial about masking hair. On step 4. you can see the problematic white ""fringe"", and step-by-step how you can use Decontaminate to fix it. (It doesn't demonstrate manual brushing/cloning)."

photoshop,36qo7n,KhanneaSuntzu,1 point,Thu May 21 10:36:28 2015 UTC,"What exactly is the problem? Give a detailed description (perhaps screenshots) and you might get help here.  To add noise to a layer, use the ""Add Noise"" filter. Set it to monochrome if you don't want color noise.  If the layer is a Smart Object the filters will be non-destructive Smart Filters. If you want the noise to be a separate layer, simply fill the layer with 50 % gray first (and optionally convert to a smart object), and set the blending mode to Overlay (or similar. This also lets you apply further filters like Gaussian Blur to soften it up without damaging the layer.  Another method could be to create the noise/texture as a separate (seamlessly repeating) image and save the noise as a pattern. Then you can apply this pattern as a layer or layer style in your document whenever you need it.  To record an action open the Actions panel, create a new action group to store your actions in, then create a new action and start recording. It will then record exactly the steps you perform to the image so you can play them back later. Note that if you click on specific layers when recording, it will record the name of the layer as part of the action. If you want it to instead record it as ""select layer above/below"" no matter what the name is, then use the below shortcuts:  Targeting Layers via the Keyboard  Option (Mac) / Alt (Win) + ""["" or ""]"" targets the layer above or below the currently targeted layer. Option (Mac) / Alt (Win) +Shift + ""] ""or + ""["" adds the next layer up or down to the targeted layer(s) (note when you get to the top or bottom of the layer stack, Photoshop will ""wrap around"" to continue adding/subtracting layers). Option (Mac) / Alt (Win) + "","" or ""."" targets the bottom/top -most layer.

photoshop,36j97l,Gradikinz,2,Wed May 20 13:48:08 2015 UTC,"I've had very good results in doing this when something like hair is involved.  IMHO, it would be the most natural way to make a selection when fine stray hairs are involved.  Especially the gaps in the inside of hair.  Those areas can be impossible to manual select.    When you using all the methods above, it not only makes these selection for you, but has a way of feathering/separating your selection.  So changing the color should not be an issue.    In the case there are any loose ends, the last step where you check box ""decontaminate colors will automatically create a vector mask for you.  So if you feel the need to further fine tune for whatever reason, that is easily possible.  But cascading all these methods mentioned have given me better and more natural masking than anything else I've tried.  So changing the color of said background should look realistic just as much as the original color.  The quick way to what I've mentioned is to use the magic wand or quick selection tool.  Generally, when solid/single colors are involved it does a great job.  From here, simply right click/feather. Usually a pix radius of 1 or 2 is more than sufficient to prevent unnatural edges.  You can play with it and fine tune till you get the result you are looking for.   My recommendation to you, once you have made your selection (using either or any combo of methods) is copy that layer and make alterations on that.   Doing this provides a way to get back to your original position without reproduction."

photoshop,36j97l,ohisforodd,1 point,Wed May 20 07:35:26 2015 UTC,If it's contrasted enough it should be an easy selection process. Either select your background or select out your subject via whichever selection tool you prefer. You can also try select by color range if the backdrop is the only element that is that color.   Once your background is selected you can add an adjustment layer and mess with the hues or you could find a backdrop online and just add it in.   To make it look real you'll probably have to play around with drop shadows on your subject so it's not just flat looking or play around with curves/levels.  Depends on the lighting of the subject.

photoshop,36ge06,kadintheboss,5,Tue May 19 04:33:39 2015 UTC,"General steps:   The source images must have matching perspective. This you cannot alter (much) in Photoshop. The lighting must match (come from the same directions). This you cannot alter (much) in Photoshop. Match the color (and brightness/contrast). This is mainly achieved by clipping Curves adjustment layers to the objects you are inserting. Use vibrance to adjust saturation. Match sharpness. Add a slight blur to the sharpest objects to match the blurriest objects. Match noise. Normally this means extracting noise from the background image and applying it to the inserted objects, or to generate noise if there's no good way to extract it. Shadows. Add shadows. The inserted objects will cast shadows in the scene, and vice versa. They likely have to be manually painted in. This takes skill. Do global adjutments to the entire image last (e.g. adjust overall brightness/contrast, give it some creative color tint, local contrast adjustments, etc.). This helps bring it all together."

He made a good demonstration of how you could go about doing it (personally I'd opt for the healing brush instead of the patch tool), but as you can tell the result looks quite obviously manipulated (as he did it quite quickly), with a strange wobbly wheel, blotchyness, and a missing edge around the door. If he continued working on it for another hour it would probably look a lot better, but he demonstrates how it's done, and it's neither quick nor easy!    You essentially have to reconstruct the entire area covered by the chair, and assuming you're not a master painter who can paint photorealistic cars, you will have to do this by mostly copying and adapting other parts of the car, and blend it all together. What makes it tricky is that you don't have many good areas to copy from, so some areas you have to recreate from scratch.  Summary; I would leave the chair in the photo unless it was really nesscessary to remove it. It is a lot of work to remove it in a photorealistic way without it looking a bit ""off"". If you're a beginner I'd say it's as good as impossible. :/    EDIT:  Here is my attempt. This took a little over one hour (and I'm a bit late to the party). The wheel is the tricky bit as you are missing vital detailed areas that you end up having to reconstruct from scratch. It's not perfect and could have used a bit more work, but it's getting there. It shows that you can get a good result here with the correct skills and a lot of patience.  Video of the entire process (200 % playback speed)"

photoshop,36bx8q,TheCrimsonJin,2,Tue May 19 06:25:30 2015 UTC,"Try to work non-destructively whenever possible. In other words, use layers and tools that always allow you to go back and change your mind later. So no Eraser tool. :)   Layer Masks. Use them. Don't delete parts of layers, always use a layer mask instead. How to create good masks however is the hard part. It depends entirely on the image in question; and every tool in Photoshop can be combined... Adjustment Layers. Your best friend in the whole world. Especially the ""Curves"" adjustment layer (it can do almost anything once you get the hang of it). Also learn Hue/Saturation and Vibrance to control saturation. Many of the others can be ignored. Adjustment layers + Layer masks to adjust just parts of images. Healing Brush Tool (using a hard brush). A lot of people over-use the Clone Stamp Tool. Sample often to avoid repeated patternes. Do it on a new blank layer and not directly on your image (set the tool to sample ""current and below"").   I dare say the above is >90% of fixing up photos in Photoshop."

A reference shot of the car (or just the same model car) would have been useful. The yellow light. Right now it's too flat; needs an edge on the left and right sides mainly. Front part of the door crack looks a bit fake. Top inside of the wheel should have been darkened a bit (so light comes from above, and it doesn't look so obviously mirrored).   Edit: More like THIS.  I'm quite happy with the roundness of the wheel itself though, even if the center hub isn't quite as round as I would have liked...  Some techniques used:   Focus on one ""object"" at a time; first the body; the ground, the wheel. Copy/paste and free/warp transform. Clone Stamp Tool, Healing Brush Tool, Spot Healing Brush Tool. Always on new layers. Layer/Vector Masks (allowing me to heal/clone/heal a bit into neighboring areas, and use the mask to limit it later). Adjustment Layers (Curves & Vibrance) with layer masks to selectively brighten/darken or adjust colors. Extracting noise/texture (using High Pass) and applying it as a pattern on painted areas that lack texture (I basically just painted in the colors I wanted, then added the extracted texture as a pattern overlay). Quite late in the video, but an awesome technique! Etc...   With these kinds of jobs it's a lot of trial and error sometimes, and multiple ways to achieve the smaller tasks. You might need to redo/improve an area multiple times. A wacom tablet (with a pressure-sensitive pen) really helps a lot when any sort of brush-related tool is used."

File > Place... and choose the logo file (assuming you have the logo as a separate file with transparent background). Duplicate the photo/background layer and place it over your logo layer. Hold down the Alt-key and click between the two layers (to use the logo as a clipping mask). Add a new Solid Color layer set to white and reduce opactiy. Clip it to the logo layer as well (but above the image copy).   Done.  You can replace the Solid Color layers with Curves Adjustment Layers or similar if you prefer.

photoshop,3697rc,MikeyLNG,5,Sun May 17 12:06:51 2015 UTC,Scan it as flat as possible. Perhaps even the left and right page as separate scans if it helps. This makes the problem area smaller. Scan in highest quality available to you (never JPEG; and go 16-bit if possible). Put the two pages on separate layers and convert one or both of them to a smart object (optional) if you need to reposition/transform them to match up/align better. The light gradually changes towards the seam. Adjust this using one or more Curves Adjustment Layers with layer masks consisting mainly of a simple gradient. Spend some time on this before going to the next step. The final remaining thin seam will have to be fixed using the healing brush (or similar). Do it on a new layer (as always).

photoshop,36arm8,zynthesis1981,2,Sun May 17 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"Study images/videos from real VHS tapes and study how it differs from a ""proper"" image.  You want several things:   Low resolution (check the VHS wikipedia page for suggested numbers for PAL and NTSC) Lower resolution for the color information than for the luminosity information. Much lower in the horizontal direction (so the color will ""bleed"" sideways""). http://imgur.com/cDgx0Px If you want those horizontal noise-lines (bad tracking or something) they are essentially just noise (with the same resolution as the resolution of your image after reducing resolution). You could create it yourself, or simply copy it from images/videos from real VHS tapes and blend it with your image. The parts of your image that are behind these lines should be heavily distorted (go nuts with warp transform or something). Looking at a piece of VHS footage I recently digitized, on vertical edges with high contrast between light and dark, where light is on the left and dark on the right, there is a very dark halo on the dark side. I'm not sure if this comes from the low quality camera that was used or the VHS/player. But consider recreating that. There may often be a distorted/noisy/discolored line along the bottom. For writing text (if you need to), use a font similar to THIS (or create your own pixellated fonts/symbols). White, with a black outline. You want to reduce the dynamic range of your footage (move in the black and/or white points). For an adjustment on top, lift blacks slightly, and lower whites. Reduce saturation a bit as needed. Play with curves (per channel) to mess up the colors slightly; use real vhs footage for reference for the colors)."

photoshop,36ahsq,Bloop__,1 point,Sun May 17 19:43:47 2015 UTC,"Turn the color management in Photoshop back to defaults if you have been changing anything in there without knowing exactly what it does. A decent preset would be American or European General Purpose (depending on where you live). If you do color sensitive work, you must calibrate your monitor.   Yes, Photoshop supports color management. This means that when Photoshop displays images it honors the color profile embedded with the image. If there is no color profile embedded, it displays it using the profile set as default in your Color Settings (should be sRGB if you reset to defaults).  A lot of software and websites do not support color management and ignores the color profile. This means that the colors will be displayed wrong. It will simply send the color values directly to the monitor. THIS image shows you how much the colors can differ between common color profiles (as you can see, if the software just goes by the numbers and ignores the profiles the colors will be wrong). This also means it is important to always embed the color profile of an image.    So what to do?   Always convert your image to sRGB before saving a copy for sharing online or viewing outside a professional environment. This is because sRGB is fairly close to how and average monitor displays color, so the colors will be as little wrong as possible in these situations. To avoid this potential pitfall in the future, and simplify the workflow, I recommend you use sRGB for everything all the time, from the very start. This means that if you have a digital camera, set it to sRGB, and if you use Lightroom or Camera RAW, also set those to sRGB. If saving images for web, use Photoshop's ""Save for Web"" function. In addition to smaller file sizes and more control, it has an extra ""convert to sRGB"" checkbox that works as an extra safeguard. ;) Embed the color profile whenever possible. This ensures that software that DO honor color management will display the colors as correct as possible.     Ps: Another scenario to consider here is that the color space of your monitor is very far from the sRGB color space. Perhaps it's a high gamut monitor for professional work, or perhaps a really crappy monitor that just displays color horribly. In these cases all images outside of color managed applications can look very wrong, and this can only be remedied by calibrating the monitor to be more similar to sRGB (if calibrating it exactly to sRGB, then sRGB images will display correctly even in applications that don't support color management)."

photoshop,36ahsq,chain83,1 point,Sun May 17 20:27:58 2015 UTC,"Calibrating ""by eye"" is just a rough way to get your monitor in the right ballpark. It is by no means accurate. Proper calibration requires calibration hardware. Your monitor uses a TN-panel. It is not good for color sensitive work (low gamut, and a lot of color shift depending on view angle). You'd want an IPS-panel for color sensitive work. I can't tell from the screenshot if the imgur-hosted copy of the image still has a color profile embedded. Does it? If not, then no, they will not display exactly the same. Because only Photoshop knows how to display it correctly (assuming your monitor color profile that you created when calibrating is accurate), and your browser simply passes the color values directly to the monitor. Most images you see online is being displayed this way (unfortunately).   So... Hmm... Yeah... Advice still stands I guess... :/ There's not much more I can suggest really...     Convert to sRGB. Embed the profile (although be aware that websites that process the image will likely remove it). The important thing here is that it is displayed as good/correctly as possible for the average viewer, and this ensures that. Calibrate your monitor using proper equipment if possible. This ensures that you see the image correctly when creating it in Photoshop. However, your monitor is likely fairly close to sRGB from the manufacturer, so perhaps it's worth a try to simply set the monitor profile to sRGB instead of the one you hand-made when calibrating (and also check the settings on the monitor itself if it has an sRGB setting). This will eliminate the images looking different in managed/non-managed situations, but ofc. there's no guarantee you are seeing the colors correctly on your monitor this way..."

I'm not going to be able to calibrate the monitor using proper equipment as this is just a hobby. I did set my monitor to sRGB, but this didn't improve anything.

The file itself would come out identical as if you exported it. And the file is correct. Did it look fine on their monitor?  Because to me it sounds like it's just your monitor that displays colors like this (whenever there is no color management). The only way to fix that is to adjust/calibrate your monitor. I cannot see your monitor so I cannot really help much more with that (but be aware that you do have a monitor that is no good for color in the first place). If you cannot borrow equipment for calibration, try resetting the monitor to defaults, and then go through software calibration again veeery carefully. It's probably the best you can get.

If you want to upscale the texture itself as well just open it, increase the size and save it.

Especially relevant for clone stamp or healing brush tools."
photoshop,366gxc,tjtocker,4,Sat May 16 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"So a few things that come to mind immediately.    The source image of the earring appears to be much lower resolution than the ear image, which is causing the earring to appear out of focus compared to the focus on the actual ear photo (or the earring IS actually just out of focus). Either way, they don't match in image quality so there is going to be a limit to how close you'll get them to match in compositing. You need to start with better source material.  The earring has been cut out from a white background and it hasn't been done especially well.  Rather than using magic wand or quick select tool (which is why you've got that weird yellow tone on the edges of the earring) you'll need to do a close cut with the pen tool to make a clipping path. If you're not strong with the pen tool it can suck to get the hand out because it's not very intuitive, but it's THE very best way to cut objects out of photos in terms of accuracy. Spend some time on YouTube looking for pen tool and clipping path tutorials. This is pretty essential if you plan to do compositing in Photoshop, but really anytime you're cutting things out even just to have them on a blank background it's the way to go.  The lighting conditions of the two photos are vastly different (hard specular light on the earring, soft glowy light on the ear). You'll probably need to town down exposure in the earring and possibly even flatten out the contrast a bit.  As /u/LeoFrimTheTribe mentioned... Shadows.  You need to add them to ground the earring and make it seem as though it's actually in physical contact with the ear. You can do this with the drop-shadow tool, but it will take some experimentation and probably multiple layers because there will be a very soft shadow coming from the lower portion of the earring where it's just hanging loose, but another more crisp (and shorter) shadow should be cast on the actual ear lobe where the earring is making physical contact (making what we call a contact shadow). Because of how the drop-shadow tool works you're likely going to need to create the shadow for the entire earring, rasterize the drop-shadow layer and erase the shadow where it doesn't belong. Probably once for the contact shadow and again for the softer shadow.    Good luck!"
photoshop,366gxc,brianmerwinphoto,1 point,Sat May 16 17:37:18 2015 UTC,Wow thanks :D The weird yellow is because I was playing around with the colour of the earring then used perspective warp to try and get it positioned better and never really sorted the colour overlap.    I'll keep at it and try to use all your tips. Thanks
photoshop,366gxc,CaptSquarepants,2,Sat May 16 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"The source image has plenty of detail to work with, you probably just messed it up while warping. Try bringing it down to size fresh from the cut out, it probably works fine from that.  Make sure you get the blacks matching.  I would actually color correct the gem and metal on different layers.  It would also be a good idea to bring the skin texture through the glass, but that's maybe a little out of the scale of your project."

You could also use curves to adjust the color to match the lighting better. To add some highlights / shadows you could use a white / black brush on a clipping mask and soft light.

It can be used on non-RAW images too.  It's really excellent, the correction controls are powerful, and layout is very simple and logical. When I need to go over a ton of photos and check whether to keep or delete them, it's actually easier to do it in camera raw than in windows or bridge.   It's pretty much ""Diet Lightroom"", it feels like its own program and not just a PS plugin. One thing I like too (which most other raw processors screw up) is it's made to be fast and to make your workflow easier. You see changes instantly, in real time, as you move sliders around. Some other programs have a lag when you make or preview these changes. It also has an excellent way of handling file saving, naming, and deleting. You can easily do a batch of pics and rename them from the useless in-camera names (IMG_2849.CR2) to whatever you like (ParkVisit_01.jpg, ParkVisit_02.jpg, etc).   It has pretty good sharpening and noise reduction, and two or three subtle 'artistic' filters that match actual effects you get from a camera... vignetting, film grain, and gradient filters.  I use it in combination with another raw processor, DXO Optics Pro, but I only use that one because it has very powerful noise reduction that's on another level from all other programs. If I could, I would use camera raw all the time."
photoshop,3614z3,CreeDorofl,1 point,Fri May 15 06:11:46 2015 UTC,"Camera Raw comes with Photoshop. It's what you use for developing RAW photos. Whenever you open a RAW image it should be opening with Camera Raw by default (unless you have some other raw converters installed).  Note: It can be used for JPEG/TIFF images or as a filter from within Photoshop CC as well, but then you obviously lose all the benefits of working with RAW data. But the interface is still nice.  If you are a beginner at Photoshop trying to learn, you don't need to get any additional plugins. Learn what Photoshop can do first. It can do almost anything without need for plugins. Learn how to properly work using layers, adjustment layers (especially Curves, Vibrance, Hue/Saturation), and how to create layer masks. Also learn how to work with the Healing Brush (and similar) on a separate layer.  Once you feel that something is missing, or when you have an overview of what Photoshop itself can do, then consider looking for plugins. E.g. there are plugins to help interface designers, or to create better lens flares, improved noise reduction, etc., etc."

photoshop,360t2j,Sol_Espera,3,Fri May 15 03:21:59 2015 UTC,Web safe colours are irrelevant these days.  It looks like a jpg compression issue. I'm guessing that's not vector data?  When saving a PDF you'll want to go in the settings and adjust the compression to none or change the image quality to high.
photoshop,360t2j,slyburger,3,Fri May 15 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"""web safe colors"" can be ignored. It's an outdated concept and completely irrelevant here. If the color itself shifts, that's a color management issue, but it appears fine here. Those artefacts are JPEG compression artefacts. The image in the PDF is getting JPEG-compressed and JPEG destroys image quality to reduce the file size. JPEG compression is intended for photos only and will look horrible on this type of graphics (unless you really max out the quality). This should have been made in Illustrator. Not Photoshop. Everything here could be vector-based. If it was vector-based you would not have this problem, and the poster could have been enlarged to any size and remained top quality, and the file size would just be a fraction of what it is now. If you have to use Photoshop for everything, be aware that you will not be able to generate a proper print-ready PDF with properly defined crop marks and bleed. And you should also keep that artwork as shape layers if possible, and not a raster layer. If you don't want to use vectors and want everything to be raster, then you will need to drastically increase the JPEG quality (this is done under Output when exporting the PDF). Optionally don't use JPEG at all. But beware the file size will be larger."

If you're on a Mac I'd start with running repair disk permissions (let google guide you there), and if that doesn't get you anywhere start digging through the Photoshop preferences screen to find the window that talks about plugin directory and double check that it exists and it's located somewhere you have access to.

The artist simply painted it in a way that gives the illusion of a bright light being emitted from the eye using bright colors surrounded by a dark background and painting on a bit of those same bright blues/whites around the eye to make it appear as if the light was being reflected off the skin.  Some overall general tips when trying to create a kind of neon lighting effect:   Use dark backgrounds. It helps the ""light"" pop out more. Use white (or a color very close to white) in the center of the light source. To give the neon light some color, rather than coloring the white area, surround the white area with a light color of your choice, making sure to soften the edges between the two areas a bit. Don't forget that light bounces off of many surfaces. The closer something is to the light source, the stronger the reflection.   These tips may not work for all lighting effects, but I hope it helps."

photoshop,35ttjt,brianmerwinphoto,1 point,Wed May 13 13:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yep. And being honest, $100 is on the low end of things.   As /u/chain3 has mentioned, there's only so much you can do (which isn't much) without getting a colorimeter for calibrating your display.   What's worse, is that even calibrated, cheap displays will never be perfectly true to life. On top of that, if you're working with a laptop that has a glossy display.... Forget it.   The glossy screen is essentially a polarizer filter over your regular screen witch causes all sorts of problems with colorimeters.   You aren't going to see anyone doing any pro level production work on a laptop screen for that reason.   Aside from color calibration, I recommend you do some research on color management (as a broad term), as well as color gamuts."
photoshop,35ttjt,chain83,1 point,Wed May 13 17:07:28 2015 UTC,"No matter what monitor you use, to have it accurately reproduce colors you will have to calibrate it. This is done using a piece of hardware that you put on the front of the monitor to measure the colors (and generate a color profile). I can't recommend a specific product (the one I use at work is out of your price range, but have a look at ColorMunki or something). Most laptop monitors will be shit for accurate colors (if the colors/brightness/contrast shift when you move your head a bit up/down/sideways then you likely have a TN-panel, and it is impossible to use for anything serious color-wise). What would be best is if you bought an external IPS monitor. They are not that expensive these days. Don't get anything with a glossy front (unless looking at reflections of the room is more important than accurate colors).   Yes, you can try to step-by-step calibrate your monitor by eye (some software will let you do this), but it's far from optimal. Although I guess it's better than nothing if your monitor is way off to begin with.    Other than that, make sure your images are always in the sRGB color space before sharing, and that you embed the profile. This will give you the most predictable color reproduction when the image will be displayed on random devices/monitors."

Looks like a very nice collection of photos of real lens flares etc. that you can overlay onto your images. It also comes with actions you can run that will add some additional layers (like adjustment layers etc.) to help you improve the effect. Some might do slightly more advanced things (like selective blurring of your image). It leaves you with layers to tweak it as you please.  Looking at the tutorial demonstrations, it would appear e.g. the ""light hits""/flare source images provided when you buy the pack are ~5000x3000 px PNGs and available as 16-bit. This collection of photos is the main thing you pay for here (the actions I consider ""added value"" that can make it more convenient to apply the images). It can be hard and time consuming to shoot and process your own collection, or to find good enough images for free online.  The quality looks great imo.

I'd make it much larger, because people can click on your profile picture to see the larger version.  Resolution doesn't matter for web images.  One pixel is going to display as one pixel regardless of the screen.  As for text, either change the font size to be smaller, or scale down the layer using the transform tool."
photoshop,35ux17,Synaxxis,1 point,Wed May 13 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"A (raster) image is made up of pixels. So make it 180x180 px.  At 100% zoom, one pixel in the image = one pixel on your monitor. If you zoom in past that you can see the individual square pixels (think of your image kinda like a chessboard). The squares have no fixed physical size.  The ""pixels per centimeter"" setting (pixels/inch - abbreviated PPI - is the industry standard btw. Yes, even for us metric-users.) is just a measure of how many pixels you want squeezed into a centimeter (or inch) when printing. In other words, how large you want those pixels to be when printing. This has no effect on your on-screen usage, so it can be (mostly) ignored here as your image is not for print. The PPI setting for the image will make absolutely no difference at all in how the image looks on Facebook, etc. - and if the image were to be used for print you would often override that setting anyway when changing the print size of the image in the page layout software.  ""Pt"" is short for ""points"" and is a traditional measurement for font size (there's a little over 28 points in a centimeter). Since ""points"" is a physical size just like centimeters/inches, how many pixels one pt equals depends on the PPI setting (or pixels/cm if you prefer). If you want 1 pt to be 1 px in Photoshop, set your PPI to 72 (yours was likely set to 300). That makes font sizes easier to work with for screen images. Another good solution is simply to use pixels as the measurement for your font size. So if you could type e.g. ""20 px"" into the font size field. :)"

photoshop,35lkyk,IckySpot,3,Mon May 11 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"It depends what you mean and what you need to do with the image. When you reduce an image in Photoshop you resample to a lower resolution. All Photoshop has to display the image are pixels. If you have fewer pixels in the image there will be less detail. This is unavoidable.   Think of a house made from Lego blocks. Now make it smaller, still using Lego blocks. The blocks can’t be smaller too, so some details will not look the same.   If your image is intended for display on a screen, then it doesn’t matter so long as the end resolution is the desired resolution. The area set aside for the image is X pixels by Y pixels. Your image is limited to that resolution by how you use it, so any more pixels in the I age won’t display better because the pixels are not available on the display.  If your image is intended for print then you want to have appropriate resolution. Generally 300 pixels per inch (PPI) is ideal. You can go lower, but there is usually little use in going higher, since the printer technology can’t show more detail. If you have two identical images printed next to each other, one 300 PPI and one 600 PPI it will be very difficult to tell the difference.   If you use Photoshop’s sharpening filters on an image you want to do it with optimal rsolution so you know the size of the sharpening in inches, not in pixels. This means you can get the best results when images are resampled to output size and resolution first. This is something that only really matters when the images are very good to begin with and you know a lot about sharpening.  Tell us more about your images and what you want to do with them. You need to understand that with pixels, you can’t display the same information using fewer pixels, some detail has to go."

photoshop,35lkyk,leftnotracks,1 point,Mon May 11 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"24-bit PNG is usually a good choice. It compresses well and is lossless, unlike JPEG."

It's lossless (so maximum quality) and supports transparency if your texture uses that. They support other formats, but this is the easiest for you. Never use JPEG (it reduces quality). 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 px are valid image width/height dimensions. Upload anything other than that and they will resample your image (and you will lose a bit of quality). Maximum texture resolution is thus 1024x1024 px, but usually this is overkill (except for large objects). They recommend 512x512 px for general usage. For small objects, use smaller textures. This is mostly a video memory issue. :)   Ps: Don't worry about the image file size; the image file will be converted and compressed by their servers to the final texture image format (JPEG2000)."

The photo I edited ended up being warped when placing it into my profile.    So, I did do some looking and found on the forums that the profiles use a 4:3 aspect ratio and my problem was that my image wasn't any where near that ratio nor 1024 size so I tried resizing it down to 1024 bu, the image I resized lost a lot of quality and warped so I did end up cropping out negative space using the 4:3 ratio and it seemed to do the trick.   I didn't resize the image  but it does the trick for what I wanted to begin with.  I guess I was over thinking it a little but with help from a fellow commenter I will be poking around with some other photos to actually learn how to sharpen correctly when and if I need some resizing.    .tga I did read takes out the transparency in the photo if I were looking to get it into a object in world.

Another, easier, non-destructive method suggested by /u/keithj5000/ is to use gray/black/white text and set the blending mode to Color: http://i.imgur.com/JJBQ6sx.jpg  The one downside to this is that you have no manual control of the Black & White conversion, but it might be sufficient for your needs.    Lastly, a method I don't recommend it if you want editable text (you have to redo multiple steps whenever you want to edit the text), but if you are manually painting the text then it works great as you simply paint in the mask.   Cmd/Ctrl-click the Text layer to load it as a selection. Hide the text layer. Add a Black&White adjustment layer. The selection will be used as a mask."

If you are unfamiliar with clipping masks and how to do them, it's a pretty easy search on google with more information than you'll ever need. It's very easy.

Arrange the color markers very close (on top of each other) to create a hard edge. The sample image has a red pin and a blue pin, but you can only see the blue because they are overlapping.  Then, in the dialog, set your preferred angle. You can also reposition the location of the gradient just by clicking and dragging directly in the photo while the layer style is open.   The added benefit of this method is that you can save the layer style. It would then be available to you with a single click if you ever wanted to use it again."

What is the color profile, dimensions and bit depth of your document, and what kind of layers are the layers that render wrong in the PDF? Exactly what settings did you use when exporting?      When exporting to PDF, Photoshop will attempt to keep vector and text layers as vector and text objects in the PDF. I'm guessing something goes wrong at this step. The solution will be to flatten the image (or at least the problematic layers) before saving as PDF. Exact PDF export settings depend on the purpose of the exported PDF. If you tell us that, we can tell you what settings you should use. The ""High Quality Print"" preset is generally a good starting point though. Regarding your edit, do not use 16-bit images in the final exported PDF/image. That is just a waste of file space (and potentially a possible threat to file compatibility depending on usage).

photoshop,354jzp,-Megain-,7,Thu May 7 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"At that size it probably shouldn't be pixelated at all, but instead vector art.  You might know what that is but in case you don't already know I'll explain for you or anyone else interested:  Photoshop works with pixels, while other programs, like Adobe Illustrator, work with vectors. Rather than squares containing different values, vectors are mathematical points, lines, curves, gradients, and shapes. This is why things like fonts can be resized infinitely and still retain their nice smooth curves and sharp points. You'll also notice that zoom works this way normally in a PDF (excluding images inside it) and it's different from zoom on a normal image file.  Example  If your logo has transparency and gradient it can be a bit harder to use a vector image, but it can still be done.  If your logo includes photography, you still might consider using vector art for the rest of it. Illustrator can incorporate photos in the file, but they will still become pixelated as it is enlarged. If you do use pixel imagery in the image for your van, consider that the standard professional printing resolution is 300 pixels per inch (3600 per foot) Because it will typically be viewed at a distance of at least a few feet, I recommend printing out images at different resolutions, (150, 250, and 300 pixels per inch) and testing what suits your needs."

photoshop,34w51m,Caboose127,3,Tue May 5 01:27:33 2015 UTC,"ProPhoto RGB is fine for editing files in Photoshop, but it's overkill (you don't need such a large gamut; your monitor isn't even close to being able to display it). The space is also perhaps a bit large for 8-bit files, so unless you want to go 16-bit then AdobeRGB would be a better choice if you need an increased gamut over sRGB.  Anyway, your problem:  You must ALWAYS convert an image to sRGB before uploading online, sharing with others, and generaly viewing it anywhere outside of a color managed workflow. this is because lots of software (including e-mail clients, microsfot office, windows photo viewer, anything on mobile devices, most web pages, etc.).    The Color Profile describes how the colors should be displayed, but software without color management will simply ignore the profile and send the ""raw"" color numbers directly to the display. Since the ""average"" display is close to sRGB, the sRGB color profile is the safest profile to use as it will cause the least wrong colors in most situations. Due to this, unless you are comfortable with color management and have a specific need to use something else, use sRGB for everything. It will be easier and you have less things that can go wrong."

A print of this is currently on display at a local Texas Tourist Bureau location. It was done as an experiment for an idea and I had no idea someone would actually pay me money for it.  First, shoot multiple shots from an SLR on a tripod with a 50mm or less lens using the same manual setting for each shot.  Try for an 180 degree side to side view from ground to sky.  Shoot in RAW if possible. Take a minimum of 12 shots (3up-four across).  I like to File: Automate: Photomerge then use perspective for minimum distortion & good image correction. Also, do not use blend, and select Vignette Removal and Distortion Correction for maximum gains.  Select your imported images and let it do its thing.

photoshop,34uzk5,chain83,2,Tue May 5 04:38:09 2015 UTC,"It works alright; but you have to understand how it works to apply it correctly. It ""removes"" areas up to the specified radius that differ from the surroundings by a certain amount.  It can do a great job removing/obscuring lots of small dust/scratches (there can be tons of them in scanned photos); but only if it the dust/scratches are small and sharp (more contrasty) compared to other details in the image (if it is scanned at high enough resolution it usually is). It also means that things with specular highlights or fine lines like hair/eyes/jewellery/etc. can easily be destroyed by the filter if not careful – so you usually want to use a layer mask to limit the filter.   Duplicate your image layer, or convert it to a Smart Object. Apply filter. Use a layer mask and a soft brush to paint in where you want (or don't want) the filter.   The history brush method that people suggest is destructive so I don't recommend that. Use a layer mask instead – much safer and more flexible (and you can go back and edit it later).  For larger scratches and other blemishes you will have to remove them manually. There is no magic filter. The Healing Brush (and similar) is your main tool here. Remember to work using layers.  The exact steps and what works best will depend heavily on the specific image in question. So if you are able to upload the image you are struggling with, you can get more targeted responses."

Things get simpler when all you need is a still image. :) I'd say most of it can be done by layering a whole bunch of stock images of chalk/dust/etc. Screen blend mode for the most part. Warp can be nice to get them into specific shapes. Perhaps turn some of them into brushes for some manual brushing of outlines...  Add the color with a gradient map adjustment on top.
photoshop,34s791,chain83,1 point,Mon May 4 13:28:32 2015 UTC,"Nice choice. I love that animation from Far Cry 4. If you want to achieve this effect, you will need to start with good source material. Remove it from the background with masking and copy layer using create new file to place it on a nice blank black canvas. You would likely want to use a wet brush to smear the image a bit to create some texture. I would use HDR on the image to ensure you get details from highlights AND shadows. After updating, use multiple frames of the image with varying degrees of inverse colors for highlights, desaturated images on multiply for tone, and screened originals for main highlights. Adjust opacity to taste. You can also mask in some noise if you want a ""chalkier"" look. If none of this makes sense to you, I'm sorry in advance."

Each layer contributing 1/7th of the final result?  If so there are two ways to go about it.   Select the 7 layers. Convert to Smart Object. Layers > Smart Objects > Stack Mode > Mean   Dithering will be introduced (at least in 8-bit). This should compensate for the rounding errors, so it's nice. :)  The manual method (if you want manual control for some reason):   Change opacity of the layers until they all contribute the same amount. You will have to pull out a calculator if you want it to be accurate (see below)... But usually you want the most pleasing result and this gives you manual control over how much each layer contributes to the result.   With 2 layers, the opacities should be 1, 1/2. With 3 layers, the opacities should be 1, 1/2, 1/3. With 4 layers, the opacities should be 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4. With 5 layers, the opacities should be 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5. With 6 layers, the opacities should be 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6. With 7 layers, the opacities should be 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7 (100%, 50%, ~33%, 25%, 20%, ~17%, ~14%).   I gave you fractions so you can see where my numbers are from (1 = 100%). There will be rounding errors when you input the percentages though.   Cool tip for us nerds: Opacity in Photoshop only operates in whole numbers, but fill+opacity gets combined when Photoshop determines the total transparency, so you can combine them to get more accurate percentages if you need to. Eg. 25 % opacity * 50 % fill = 12,5% total opacity."

photoshop,34mugp,ziggy434,6,Sat May 2 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you want to replace the image on the screen. Short answer: For this you should be using a Layer Mask. Do not delete anything.  I will now tell you how to do the whole thing professionally, and not only the mask. We want some damn realism here for once! I'm going a bit overkill here, but the general steps are mostly the same as you would do when doing any photomanipulation where you insert one image into another (match sharpness, color, noise, etc.), so I go through it all.  If you want to keep it simple, just do point 1-8 to add an image to the screen, and point 18-21 to add a mask for the finger. That is good enough for your needs i bet.   First create the new blank image for the monitor. Let's guess that this is a 13"" MacBook Air, so make the new image 1440 by 900 px (the resolution of the monitor). Your linked image is small and low quality, so we could easily have used a smaller size, but we need the proportions to be correct anyway so might as well pick the correct resolution. Cmd/Ctrl-A to select all (just the white empty canvas). Cmd/Ctrl-C to copy. Cmd/Ctrl-W to close (don't save). Cmd/Ctrl-V to paste (into the photo of the laptop). Right-click your layer and choose ""Convert to Smart Object"". Cmd/Ctrl-T to Free Transform. Scale it down so it's smaller than the screen. Then right-click and choose Distort. Drag the four corners into place. Enter to confirm transformation. Fine-tune as needed. You probably want to leave a ~1px thin black frame around it (or you can add this manually later). Double-click the Smart Object to open it up so you can edit the contents of the monitor. Put whatever you want in there. When happy, save and close the Smart Object and it will update in your main file. This is awesome as it means you can at any time open it back up to replace the monitor contents (in case you want to make more of these)! The next step is normally to apply a tiiiny Gaussian Blur to the layer to match the blur of the background image. However, your background is very sharp already, so it's not really needed here. But keep it in mind for later. You want this to match or it will look really fake. Let's match the color. Usually this is super important to get right, but on your image it's probably not that important, so we don't need to spent to much time on it. Add a Curves Adjustment Layer, clip it to your smart object (by holding down the Alt-key and clicking between the layers, or one of many other ways of doing it). Adjust Curves until happy. Now we need to match the noise. Your screen image is noise free, while the background has noise and visible JPEG artifacts (due to the low quality!). Start by selecting a large rectangle of a smooth surface displaying the noise we want, preferably something of medium brightness. Here the front of the laptop should work great. Copy/paste the selected area into a new document. Filter > Other > High Pass... Set a radius so that you only see the fine details/noise but get rid of the larger frequency info. Let's try 8 px here. Use Filter > Other > Offset... to look for any visible seams. There probably aren't any, but if there is, clean them up. Edit > Define Pattern... to save your noise as a useful pattern. Close/don't save to return to your main document. Add the noise to your Smart Object as a Pattern Overlay Layer Style, or a Pattern Fill Layer (clipped to the layer). Pick your noise, and use Overlay or Linear Light blending mode (adjust opacity to change the strength of the noise). If you want to go advanced here, use the noise as a pattern fill layer, and use a luminosity mask to control how much noise there are in shadows/midtones/highlights. Oh, almost forgot, the finger! The thing you asked about. ;) Hide your Smart Object layer so you see the finger. Make a selection of the finger. Zoom in and use the polygonal lasso tool, or whatever else you might prefer. Make your layer visible again, then click the add layer mask button in the layers panel. Cmd/Ctrl-i to invert the mask. Done. Fine-tune and tweak it as needed. It's a mask, so it doesn't delete anything. Another thing specific for your image would be to add reflections/shading to the display. I won't go into detail as I've written too much already. Just throw a gradient fill on it for now (set to Overlay or similar) and play around with it a bit. Something like this.   Each little step we did doesn't do much, but when it's all done, it's a noticeably more realistic manipulation than the starting point. How much impact each step will have on the realism depends on how much the two images differ when it come to that specific thing (sharpness, color, etc.)."

photoshop,34lgvg,JordanReaps,9,Sat May 2 05:11:41 2015 UTC,"1…  Photos are made of pixels. Think of those pixels as Lego bricks. You can make a photo larger only by making the pixels larger. This is like making a larger Lego model by replacing the Lego blocks with Duplo blocks. It’s larger, but does not contain more detail.  Consider a photo that is 500 pixels by 500 pixels. Those 250,000 pixels contain all the detail available to the viewer. Let’s enlarge it to 400%, or 2,000 x 2,000 pixels. That 4 million pixel image could potentially be much more detailed. Too bad that the only source for that potential detail is still the same 250,000 pixels we started with.   There are programs and plug-ins for Photoshop that are a bit smarter about analyzing the image and producing a sharper image. But there are no miracles. No matter how you cut it, there is not enough detail in th source image to produce anything as good as if y reset the photo at 4 megapixels.  Scaling the photo in Illustrator will not make any difference. What you misunderstand is that artwork created in Illustrator is vectors. That means mathematically defined paths, lines, curves, shapes, and text. Scale an Illustrator file to 400% and you just multiple the numbers you started with.  Curves are still smooth curves, just larger.   2…  If you are working with photos, you should use Photoshop. If you are cropping a photo to then place in another program, like InDesign or Illustrator (such as for a magazine article, book, or advertisement) you can import the full size image then crop it.  The image file is linked and the cropped data is not removed from the linked file.  3…  Both. Each program is a set of tools. The right set of tools for any job depends on the job. Often you would use both."
photoshop,34lgvg,leftnotracks,1 point,Sat May 2 05:39:14 2015 UTC,"The explanation about pixels was perfect, i understand that making it bigger wont add detail. After looking it up some more, there really doesn't seem to be an answer to making photos that are small, much bigger without being blurry. Especially when the quality of the photo is already lacking."
photoshop,34lgvg,chain83,2,Sat May 2 07:16:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If that was possible, we wouldn't need high resolution cameras as we could just shoot really tiny images and enlarge them. Hell, we could toss out microscopes and just enlarge regular images until you could see tiny details! So, yeah, only works on CSI. :)  I think this image explains well what happens when you try to enlarge a raster image. That's why you always want your starting point (original) to be as large as possible (in pixels). You usually don't want to change the pixel size of a photo (it will just become more blurry).  I just want to add that PPI means ""Pixels per inch"". In other words, how many of the pixels will be squeezed into one inch when printing. 1 PPI would mean 1 pixel would be 1 inch wide. A 100x100px image would then be 100x100 inches when printed. If you change the PPI to 100 (without changing the size in pixels) then there is suddenly 100x100 pixels in one square inch, so when printed the image is now just 1 inch wide."
photoshop,34lgvg,chain83,2,Sat May 2 10:09:15 2015 UTC,"leftnotracks covered 1. about enlarging raster images very well, so I won't repeat that.  2 - I think you are using the word ""crop"" in the wrong sense here. ""Cropping"" in Photoshop is simply changing the width/heigth of the rectangular canvas. That is why you might get confusing answers when asking about it. I think what you want is masking (""cutting out"") things. Masking is a skill that takes a long time to master. It can range from super simple easy shapes with hard edges, to complex shapes and hair. ANY tool can be combined when creating masks, so it's no easy fit-all solution here as it depends entirely on the specific thing you need to mask. A general workflow you could try is this:      Make a selection of the object you want to cut out (using any combination of selection tools). Click the Add Layer Mask button in the layers panel (with the object's layer selected). Use ""Mask Edge"" in the Properties Panel to refine your edges (might be the solution to your ""rough edges"" problem). Ps: You could also use ""Refine Edge"" directly on your selection before turning it into a mask - it's exactly the same thing. Here's a similar example of masking hair.   3 - Both Photoshop and Illustrator can create amazing and professional work. They are however, different tools and are better at different things (as they work in two fundamentally different ways). They can also be combined. Photoshop is a ""raster editor"". It works on raster images; images made up of pixels. This would typically be Photos, paintings, etc. Zoom in, and you will see that the image is made up of a giant grid of colored squares. At 100% zoom 1 pixel in the image = 1 pixel on your screen. Illustrator is a ""vector editor"". It works not with pixels (and so you cannot really edit photos with it), but with mathematical shapes (paths/vectors). Try the ""Pen Tool"" to get a good idea. A vector object can be transformed (scaled/rotated/etc.) without losing quality. Zoom in, and you will see the lines stay sharp."
photoshop,34lgvg,ddIbb,1 point,Sat May 2 10:47:14 2015 UTC,"This isn't completely correct. Photoshop is no longer strictly a raster editor. There are now many vector tools in Photoshop. These tools are essential for UI design and allow us to create mockups and graphics for all device pixel densities much more efficiently than in the past.  You are correct, however, that when editing vector shapes, illustrator is the better software to use. It's specialized for vector editing.  Edit: grammar"
photoshop,34lgvg,chain83,1 point,Sat May 2 18:37:19 2015 UTC,True. It's primarily a raster editor although it does have vector-based tools (but you can't save directly to vector formats). It can also do video etc. so you could say Photoshop is also a video editor (although a dedicated program would do a better job). I just wanted to keep it simple for the beginner. :)
photoshop,34lgvg,ddIbb,1 point,Sat May 2 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"The difference is, someone like me, doing UI design, is going to use the vector tools within Photoshop every day, in addition to using illustrator.

photoshop,34lgvg,chain83,1 point,Sat May 2 20:08:16 2015 UTC,"I'd still say Photoshop is a ""raster editor"". It is sufficient when trying to generalize what Photoshop and Illustrator do differently. Even if PS has some vector tools (and yes, they are super useful, and many people including you and I use them all the time). You are working on a raster canvas with the goal of creating raster files; even if some of the tools are vector based.    Illustrator also have raster based tools. You can place photos, use raster-based filters, and you can save to raster formats. And I'm sure some people use those features every day. But when trying to explain to a beginner the difference between Ps/Ai, I'd refer to Ai as a program for working with vectors, and Ps for raster graphics. One can get into the details/specifics of what tools are available once we know more about what the user wants to achieve.  OP was also specifically talking about photos.  Eh, what am I trying to argue? We both know this perfectly well. Source: I've been using these programs since the dawn of time like you... :)"
photoshop,34lgvg,riquelmeizpro,3,Sun May 3 01:03:30 2015 UTC,"After using both programs for more than 5 years and some certifications, I can tell this seem to be the most common questions/doubts for new users.   1) Photoshop's main purpose is to retouch photos, enlarging them is just a tool within the program. What happens when you enlarge a photo is (super easy explanation) pixels are being ""guessed"" by Photoshop to make it bigger. More DPI's means it easier for the program to do this agolrythm. The reason to this; it's easy, there's more info to work with. Always try to use pics with better quality, resolution and DPI's.  2) Each program Ps and Ai were meant to be for one reason, just as Word and Excel. Word is for typing essays, Excel is for numbers. Even though in both you can do similar things, you won't use Word to make some numeric charts, and viceversa. The same with Ai and Ps. Photoshop is meant for editing photos (smallest ""info"" are pixels) while Illustrator uses vectors and is used for making logos and things you ""draw"" or create in the program. Which is why if you enlarge a vector, not a pixel in Illustrator it won't ""pixelate"". (also again, a very easy to swallow explanation)  3) Probably the same answer as in number 2. Depending on what you are looking for, drawing Photoshop, but remember to always separate layers. If you are looking for some designs and logos, Illustrator is your thing.  Hope, it helps. Ask me anything if any doubts are still out there."
photoshop,34lgvg,acidYeah,1 point,Sat May 2 05:34:22 2015 UTC,"I think i have a little bit of a better understanding. On your 2nd point though, is there anyway to covert a photo into a vector based image for illustrator, to than make it bigger. Or must that photo be drawn in illustrator? Because like i said, sometimes i find a photo that is say 300x800, and maybe i want it 1200x3200. But obviously that always turns out blurry and i hate it. If you can't convert photos, is it possible to blow a photo up, than recolor over it somehow to un-blur it, or does that sound dumb?"

If you need the photo to be enlarged in a similar ratio, let's use your example: 300x800 times 4, it's 1200 x 3200, in this case I won't enlarge it, was probably the app, phone or program you will use it for, will auto-enlarge it for you.

photoshop,34lgvg,s_o_0_n,1 point,Sat May 2 22:34:28 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, your questions are not dumb. Everyone starts somewhere!   If I understand you correctly, you want your images larger? What you're doing is trying to take something low-quality and turn it hihg-quality; that isn't possible. Only the reverse is. That's why people make fun of silly crime shoes saying ""Enhance the image"" when viewing recordings of suspects and magically zooming in for a clearer image: this doesn't exist in real life. (You CAN zoom in, but you're just looking closer, not changing image quality.) As far as turning images into smart objects: exactly what process are you using? I've never had that happen before, but I think the Smart Objects thing in PS is kinda new and I've been using the same method for years. You can actually resize the canvas and crop edges out in a more easily controlled way than the crop tool, so long as you know exactly how much you want to cut off. I use it sometimes to cut off just 1 pixel-deep off the edges. Yes, absolutely, but to really master the programs takes a good amount of time. You're developing skills, not just adjusting to a new software.    Finally, for image editing, Photoshop is the pro. Illustrator is for vector-based images. Illustrator is used for vector artwork and print design. Raster uses pixels but vector uses points that have lines drawn between them; if you've gone through high school math, just remember your graphing calculator and being able to zoom infinite times and always see finer and finer points.

photoshop,34lgvg,Alphyn_dp,2,Sat May 2 11:39:35 2015 UTC,"A smart object will keep its original resolution through multiple resizes. For example, if you drop a JPEG into the photoshop window, it will import into your document as a smart object. It can now be scaled up and down indefinitely without any loss in quality. If you scaled a raster image up and down like this, you'd lose quality each time and eventually end up with a blurry mess. You can also drop a vector image into photoshop and make it a smart object for the same purpose. In this case, you can scale up to any size. This is good for multi colored vector images. If you have one color vector shape, your better off keeping it as a ""shape layer"" in Photoshop. This way, you retain more control over that shape."

The result will never be as good as something that was shot in the larger size to begin with. If the photo is very small (say, something that's 500-1000 pixels wide) there's almost nothing that can make a convincing enlargement. If you've got a nice, sharp full-res shot from a modern camera, you can blow it up to fill a poster and still get a decent result. Nothing is magic."

If you use the Liquify filter as a Smart Filter (on a Smart Object) the filter can be copied to other layers, or the contents of the smart object replaced. Only in CC.  If you use the Liquify filter (no matter how), you can save/load the mesh to reuse it later on other images.  No matter what method you use though (warp, liquify, puppet warp, etc.) you can also record what you do using a Photoshop Action.

I ask because most still photo lenses ""breath"" when you adjust focus forward or back which causes your perspective on the subject to change ever so slightly. For 3-5 frames this is no big deal but on 20-80 it's a HUGE deal and makes it much more difficult for Photoshop to make a clean merge.   Instead you want a macro rail that moves the entire camera system forward/back without changing the lens and thereby avoiding the lens breathing at all.   Also, look into Helicon Focus. An app dedicated specifically to merging focus stacked shots."

However Photoshop automatically adjusts each picture so I didn't think this could be a problem (These glitch don't always appear) ? I'll look into it anyway (focusing rail + 3d head would be amazing I think). I will check out Helicon as well, if it uses different algorithms it might help me !"
photoshop,34eqtk,brianmerwinphoto,2,Thu Apr 30 17:18:08 2015 UTC,"Photoshop definitely makes those adjustments, but because of the lens breathing each time you adjust focus it changes perspective. And again, 3-5 adjustments isn't a huge deal but when you start doing stacks of 10, 30, and 50 frames the amount of shift from lens breathing is huge which just makes for a ton more work that Photoshop has to do to compensate.   Helicon focus is an amazing tool and I recommend it BUT if you needed to prioritize I would suggest starting with the macro rail.   Have fun!"
photoshop,34dw08,coob,2,Thu Apr 30 10:36:09 2015 UTC,"FFT is the way to go. Unfortunately, as you noticed, the only Photoshop FFT-plugin is for Windows.  However, imagej also has FFT/IFFT filters and works on OSX.  It will be slower to go though a separate app, but for a single image it's worth the hassle. I'd run the FFT filter in imagej, then cover up the stars in Photoshop (although you could do this in imagej, I can probably do it a bit better with Photoshop), then open it back up in imagej to run the IFFT filter to combine it back into a normal image. Then return it to Photoshop to continue working.    Note that FFT/IFFT only works with a grayscale image (it will let you input a color image, but the result after IFFT will be black and white). Two options to solve this: 1. Process all three channels separately. Probably tricky to get right. I haven't properly tested this. 2. Process just the luminosity of the image, then blend it back with the full-color image afterwards (using luminosity blend mode). The pattern might be visible in the color information, but our eyes are most sensitive to the luminosity information so it might not be a problem. If it IS a problem, try blurring the color information to cover it up."

The covering up is a nightmare in ImageJ but I need to figure out how to correctly export it to PS and back in. Tried as a BMP but that was indexed and I had to convert to grayscale, then paint. When I paste it back into ImageJ it appears darker which I'm not sure is messing up the process at all.  Oh, looks like ImageJ takes care of the multiple channel stuff also."

The inside bit appears to be very bright, so you can go with a very bright (almost white) orange as the font's color.   Also, I think by playing with the bevel presets, you may be able to achieve the affect you're looking for without using two layers. If it doesn't appear possible, I'd combine both layers into a smart object instead of merging or flattening them together so it can be edited later on. If you do have to merge them without using a smart object, use CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-E to do so. It should flatten the layers together and prevent the effects from changing. That command stamps everything that you can see into a new layer, so you'll want to probably disable some layers before doign it."

photoshop,34d39f,JordanReaps,9,Thu Apr 30 04:26:02 2015 UTC,"I really doubt people are just warping each individual letter themselves to accomplish this.    It appears that way to me. This looks like a job I would tackle in illustrator. Settle on a typeface you like, write your words out, convert to outlines and start dragging your handles around."
photoshop,34d39f,borktheorc,3,Thu Apr 30 04:31:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm watching an illustrator videi right now, and he is using the direct selection tool to manipulate the letters within an outline to achieve this affect. However he is using a very simple image, i feel like the first picture i posted would have been much more complicated."
photoshop,34d39f,snidesniper,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:56:33 2015 UTC,"I'd also make the shape you want, group lettering and then make a clipping mask. That way, when you direct select the the anchors you just have to drag them out of the viewable area instead of forming perfect shape"
photoshop,34d39f,incindia,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:21:46 2015 UTC,"It might be best to get them in the right spot, print it out and sketch over it and scan it back in with just the sketch then trace it with the pen tool. It would have a more natural feel I think and would be faster"

photoshop,34d39f,incindia,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:21:43 2015 UTC,Now I have something to try
photoshop,34d39f,AbouBenAdhem,3,Thu Apr 30 18:03:30 2015 UTC,Have a look at Illustrator’s envelope distort feature.
photoshop,34d39f,chunnyguatermelon,2,Thu Apr 30 05:07:56 2015 UTC,"I would do a basic outline to mask out some of the letters just so it appears more ""crisp""?"
photoshop,34de4y,FIREATWlLL,2,Thu Apr 30 06:25:35 2015 UTC,Can't you draw the shape with the pen tool? Just click out the points you need and if you need to adjust som points hold ctrl while moving them. Close the path and fill it with whatever.
photoshop,34de4y,sepp0o,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:09:30 2015 UTC,"Outline that image with the pen tool. If you drag your points they will curve, if that happens, you can click on them with the ""Convert Point"" tool (it looks like a black arrow) it will make them a point instead of a curve.  The Convert Point tool is found under the Pen tool, just left click it and hold to see addition options there."
photoshop,34bsgd,Drawen,3,Wed Apr 29 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"Make a brush out of your arrow pointing upward. Set up the brush with a decent amount of spacing, so that they don't overlap when drawing a horizontal line. In the brush settings under Shape Dynamics, turn Angle Jitter to 0% and set the mode for it to Direction. Set the brush size, color, everything to how you want it to appear.  Create a circular path with the ellipse tool centered in your canvas. Make sure you are on an empty layer. Then, with the Direct Selection Tool (A) selected, right click on your path. Click on Stroke Path, and choose Brush. It should fill your path with arrows based on your brush settings. You can then resize your path and repeat. You'll probably need to adjust the spacing and size as you go.  I know there's surely a better way of doing this, but this should at least get you close to what you're describing."
photoshop,34bsgd,RazorLeafAttack,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:56:47 2015 UTC,Thank you! I havent tried yet but I think this method will do what I want pretty darn good.
photoshop,34bsgd,chain83,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:11:58 2015 UTC,"That is a truly clever way of doing it. :)  I can't think of any other smart way of doing it in Photoshop, but if using Illustrator you could create one instance of the arrow and define it as a ""brush"". You can then use that brush as the stroke on a circle (it's kinda awesome). http://i.imgur.com/G49LbdO.png"
photoshop,34bsgd,sepp0o,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:16:29 2015 UTC,You can make an arrow in a seperate file and define it as a pattern. Use a pattern fill to fill your 500x500 square with them. There's also scaling posibilities if you need the arrows smaller/bigger.
photoshop,34bsgd,chain83,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:06:07 2015 UTC,That won't make them all point towards the center though. Just repeat. :)
photoshop,34bsgd,sepp0o,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but how would I make them all point outwards from the center?"
photoshop,34cfrk,Nexus_Cannon,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:04:46 2015 UTC,Snapshot are made to clear out after a document is closed. One thing you can do if you have a few you think you want to keep is to save them as separate documents. This functionality is built in to the history panel.
photoshop,34cfrk,RazorLeafAttack,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:26:05 2015 UTC,that was waht I was reading.  I was kinda hoping that the snapshots were going to be saved but not the history behind them.

You can read for years but unless you pick up that instrument and PLAY you'll never get any better.  In other words, you've got to USE photoshop to truly get better at it.  /r/freedesign /r/picrequests /r/photoshoprequest  Go there, take someones request and try to help.  Look at the solutions that others post.  Even if someone else has solved the problem, try doing it as well.  Just DO something in photoshop every day and don't be afraid to ask questions about how someone else did something.  If you don't USE photoshop you'll never get any better at it."
photoshop,34ap4i,tragluk,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:28:18 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that's pretty much what I thought. I have been taking design courses for almost 3 years now and I have been just copying what I'm reading. I recently have been trying to adapt other lessons onto my current ones (basic things like using layer masks) but It's really not anything to wright home about. Anyways thanks!

photoshop,34ap4i,fogged2,3,Wed Apr 29 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Find some art you like that was made in photoshop and try to recreate it. You might not be able to, but you will learn a ton in the process."
photoshop,34ap4i,rotface,2,Wed Apr 29 20:11:58 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, Photoshop is a tool.  You know this already, I'm just trying to frame my point. Would you ask ""How do I get better at using a screwdriver?"" ""What can I practice my hammering skills on?"" For the most part, no, cause they're means to an end, just like Photoshop. Unless if you plan on being a design producer, (which is totally legit) you should focus on creating something. That way you will learn the relevant skills as you go while applying them in a practical way. My suggestion is to figure out what you want to make and then find a way to use Photoshop to achieve that goal. In other words, be creative."
photoshop,34ap4i,varansl,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"I would take what you have learned in a tutorial, and then create something else using that same technique.  E.G. You just finished a tutorial on how to use the Clone Stamp tool on cleaning up acme on a face, now take an old photo that is damaged and use the Clone Stamp to clean it up.  Hope this helps!  EDIT: i sepll good!"
photoshop,34c7yx,TheLiterary,5,Thu Apr 30 00:02:27 2015 UTC,Since the birds are black and white you should just be able to use hue/saturation to rotate it to the color you want.
photoshop,34c7yx,explodyhead,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:40:09 2015 UTC,I would go with this first^
photoshop,34c7yx,sepp0o,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"An alternative to using a hue adjustment would be to use Select > Color Range. Select the background color and then make a new layer via cut. That way you can make the background a new color (via hue adjustment or color overlay), make it transparent, or replace it with a pattern, texture, or whatever."

Now you can just use File > Scripts > Image Processor to save out all of your files, with the canvas sizes adjusted to your needs. Just indicate the files to process, the destination and the file format. Be sure to add your newly recorded action at the bottom of the window.  edit: revised the process above a bit to make it quicker and easier to follow"
photoshop,34aex0,RazorLeafAttack,2,Wed Apr 29 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! It worked perfectly! I did that, but I also saved the file during the time I recorded the action, so I think it wasn't working because of that. You are a life saver."
