dndmemes,37pja7,natebob,7,Fri May 29 11:37:00 2015 UTC,"Usually ""that guy"" was our dm."
dndmemes,37pja7,monsata,4,Fri May 29 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"What is actually wrong with trying non-standard character ideas? You know only the statblock and decide it's being ""that guy"".  What if I told you the story of an exiled fey, one that uses its racial connection with nature to overcome its limits, a weathered warrior that despite their small stature became a combatant to be reckoned with, only to lose an arm before heroically slaying an enemy in a duel? Now they struggle with the new handicap and try to once again become a formidable fighter.   TRIGGER WARNING: I KNOW MECHANICS Mechanically, a Pixie Whirling Frenzy Spirit Lion Wolf Totem Barbarian with the Confound The Big Folk feat and a Swordsage dip+Shadow Blade feat for Dexterity governing melee damage."
dndmemes,37pja7,Sir_Lith,5,Fri May 29 22:55:20 2015 UTC,"Heck, I made a build. ECL 12 it truly kicks in. D&D 3.5 of course, assuming all official Wizards open.  32pb (After racials): 10/24/16/19/18/9  Pixie (LA+4) Unarmed (heh) Swordsage1/Spirit Lion Wolf Totem Ferocity Barbarian2/Unarmed Swordsage +1/Barbarian+2/Hit-And-Run Exoticist Fighter 2. Then Barbarian all the way  Feats: Racial: Weapon Finesse (yisss!), Dodge  1st: Shadow Blade  3rd: Knock-Down  6th: Knowledge Devotion  7th-Fighter1: Underfoot Combat  8th-Fighter2: Confound the Big Folk  Beyond:  9th: Martial Stance: Assassin's Stance. +2d6 sneak attack 12th: Craven. +Character level in Sneak Attack damage.   At ECL 5 it boasts 19 AC before any items come into play, DR10/Cold Iron, permanent Invisibilty, meaning it probably has the best defenses in the party.  With a +9 to hit before buffs or items, it also gains a +2 to-hit bonus from being Invisible AND denies them Dexterity to armor class, meaning hitting is very easy.  A Short Sword used by the guy deals 1d4+7 damage, which while not high, can be easily boosted by appropriate maneuvers.   Choice maneuvers: Mighty Throw, Wolf Fang Strike, Burning Blade, Shadow Blade Technique, Sapphire Nightmare Blade, Moment of Perfect Mind. Stance: Island of Blades.  That was level 1. Later? It gets just better.  Swordsage2: Mountain Hammer. To deal with that pesky DR. Whatever stance.  Finally, Hit-And-Run Fighter grants a +2 to Initiative and +dex to damage agasint flat-footed enemies. That's right, twice Dex-to-damage. And you'll be flatfooting them regularily. Confound The Big Folk, high Initiative, Sapphire Nightmare Blade - not to mention marbles.  For more evil fun, the Exoticist grants proficiency with exotic weapons. Choose Gnomish Quickrazor to quickly sheathe and unsheathe it. A +1 Aptitude Gnomish Quickrazor, in fact. Now you only need to put some points into Iaijutsu Focus (OA) to grant yourself another fat bonus against flat-footed enemies...  Annd the best way is to take a Flaw (Something to do with that hand, rpobably?) and use the feat to get Cosmopolitan (FRCS) to grant yourself Iaijutsu Focus as a permanent class skill with a +2 to checks on top of it.  Barbarian provides a great chassis AND MOAR ACCURACY CAUSE DEXTERITY from Ferocity. So perfect..."

dndmemes,37pja7,the_federation,2,Sat May 30 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"My roommate wanted to be a half-orc paladin.  He was told that he couldn't be because paladins had to be LG, and half-orcs couldn't be Good.  (I don't remember if that was what the PHB said or we just house-ruled like that.)  My roommate and I show the DM that paladins don't have to be LG anymore in 5e; he ends up house-ruling that paladins have to be LG.  (To be fair, it's weird having a non-LG paladin.)  My roommate and I then show him the first page of Paladin entry in the PHB which shows the exemplar paladin.  Guess what? It's a half-orc paladin.  The DM still says he can't be a half-orc paladin."
dndmemes,37pja7,Morbidmort,2,Fri Jun 5 01:57:10 2015 UTC,"That's different from this. One is making something ridiculous, the other is you DM being a dick about what is and isn't."
dndmemes,37pja7,Crusunik,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:12:50 2015 UTC,I once DMed a campaign in which someone was playing an awakened warpony (because it was lower ecl than a horse) sorcerer... aka horserer... Him dealing with not having hands was amusing though not as amusing as him trying to figure out what a newly sentient horse would do in various situations.

I was working on some upcoming dialog, and it was the first time I had actually thought of the name as being used in a conversation. Prior to that it was .. was kinda just a bunch of letters that I thought looked cool when it came up on a random D&D name generator."
dndmemes,32ctv5,NineBlack,7,Sun Apr 12 18:40:30 2015 UTC,Mmmm...charbroiled. Give that dude a fire resist potion before he goes up and he'll be okay (probably).

dndmemes,31ub2w,Mackncheeze,3,Wed Apr 8 05:14:01 2015 UTC,wow. that sounds like a terrible situation lol
dndmemes,31ub2w,Djpalko18,5,Wed Apr 8 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, DM's been putting it off for a while. He finally drew the line last night. We captured a relatively innocent NPC, who had kidnapped a couple of our mounts. He was doing research on how to destroy this God, and we were trying to get information, and we probably going to help him. She walk right up and cuts his throat for kidnapping her Griffin. So yeah, chaotic evil. I started true neutral, but have kinda shifted to a neutral good, and her and I's characters aren't on speaking terms anymore."
dndmemes,31ub2w,Djpalko18,4,Wed Apr 8 16:09:17 2015 UTC,Is this character just a dick or is the player being a dick?  Very important to make this clear lol
dndmemes,31ub2w,Djpalko18,12,Wed Apr 8 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"The character is a vindictive, emotionally unstable elf princess with a helluva attitude. The player is one of my favorite people in the world."
