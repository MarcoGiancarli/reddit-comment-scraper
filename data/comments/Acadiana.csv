Acadiana,3e3jfv,TheSlothFather,11,Tue Jul 21 18:03:27 2015 UTC,If you have 3 or less moving violations in 5 years you could try delivery driving. Those places are always hiring and you get cash tips daily so you won't have to starve for two weeks until you get paid. Try all the big name pizza places. I usually make about $12/hour with tips.
Acadiana,3e3jfv,sentientfungus,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:56 2015 UTC,Pizza driving's a pretty good idea as long as it's very temporary. The only problem is that you're trying to outrun serious wear and tear on your car.
Acadiana,3e3jfv,LFKhael,6,Wed Jul 22 03:14:14 2015 UTC,Albertson's pays well (unless you're a Courtesy Clerk) and I worked there for the first 2 years of college.  It's a really easy place to work.

Acadiana,3e3jfv,kraaz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:14 2015 UTC,"Since you have construction background, maybe call Lowes, Home Depot and Steins to see if they need help until you can find something more permanent?"
Acadiana,3e3jfv,StephenFish,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"I've already put in apps for those places and I'm still waiting to hear from them, which I probably won't.

Acadiana,3e3jfv,WordsInDm,4,Tue Jul 21 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't wait on them.  Go there and ask to speak to someone in HR.  If it's been a few days since you've applied, go to them.  They have to wade through dozens of applications and you're a name on paper until they get a face to put to that name.  Make yourself stand out.  I was a manager at Lowe's many years ago and when I had 30 applicants to look at and I'd already met three or four of them, well I know which resumes I'm would look at first."

If you want the most consistent coverage (sometimes 4g but never 2g even when on the interstate) then Sprint is for you.  I am constantly on my phone and Spirit has always treated me right.

Acadiana,3e32ec,inkyou,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"I find that it's hard to go wrong with John Folse's Chicken & Sausage Gumbo recipe. It's not mind blowing by any means to anyone who's lived in Louisiana for a while, but I find that it's well balanced for just about anyone when I make it.  I do cheat a bit when I'm making it for people when I travel: I use a rotisserie chicken because it adds good roasted flavor and some fat to the gumbo."
Acadiana,3e32ec,Silound,4,Tue Jul 21 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"This, but do not put in mushrooms, thyme, parsley, or basil, in my opinion.  Use Gumbo File instead.  All a gumbo really needs is cellary, onion, & bell pepper aka the holy trinity, but I like to put garlic in my gumbo too, but not too much.  If you have a place that does BBQ near you, order some smoked hens to use, and order some Andouille from Jacobs in La Place.  I like to put in the smoked chicken andouille instead of sausage because it has a better texture and doesn't put out a lot of greese inito the gumbo.    Also, using pre-made rue and adding a package of lipton onion soup mix, are some quick cheats to speeding up the gumbo.    I posted my family's recipe here last year. https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1xakkt/a_proper_file_gumbo_nice_and_thin_with_a_smoked/"

Acadiana,3e32ec,BrockRockswell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:16 2015 UTC,Bear in mind that there are different types of gumbo and not all would require or benefit from file.
Acadiana,3e32ec,StephenFish,3,Tue Jul 21 20:23:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but chicken and andoulle gumbo needs file.  I only like okra in my seafood gumbo, but if you add that, no file."

Acadiana,3e32ec,cakethrower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:43 2015 UTC,I would highly recommend using John Besh's method for making the roux as well as the components. Cooking chicken thighs is any of his recipes should suffice.
Acadiana,3e32ec,smileslime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, be sure to cook it long enough to cook out the roux taste.  That's my main complaint about restaurant gumbo.  It tends to taste like roux.  Roux tastes like shit in the beginning.  It's got to really cook down to fully enhance the gumbo."
Acadiana,3e32ec,jefuchs,3,Tue Jul 21 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"This, also, I take out all my chicken that I put in raw, and let it sit, and I simmer my broth and roux for 6 hours sometimes, before I add in all of the sausage/andoullie, chicken, and whatever else that is precooked."
Acadiana,3e32ec,BrockRockswell,2,Tue Jul 21 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yes.  You definitely don't want the chicken to stay in the gumbo for six hours.  Take it out, cook the shit out of the gumbo, then return."
Acadiana,3e32ec,jefuchs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:03 2015 UTC,"Well I'll probably get down voted to hell but here is my chicken and sausage gumbo. I have an eccentric recipe but it is amazing.   Ingredients: 2 onions diced, 1 green, 1 red, 1 orange, and 1 yellow bell pepper, 2 bags frozen okra, 1 large can of smashed tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup lemon juice, andouille sausage, 2 packs smoked deer and pork sausage, chicken broth, dark roux, 4 chicken thighs, five chicken legs, bay leaves, Tony Chachere's seasoning, minced garlic, pickled choyote squash (merletons), pickled okra, picked jalape√±os, fresh spinach, rice or potato salad.   Step 1) Smother okra - take the okra, tomatoes, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce and cook down until the acidity in tomatoes breaks down the slime of the okra (probably about 45 minutes) then set aside.   Step 2) Optional - Make roux and set aside. If you are making your own roux, only use peanut oil.   Step 3) Start meat - salt chicken (no pepper. Pepper burns) and start browning the chicken in peanut oil, skin side down. Once chicken is browned, remove chicken and set aside.   Step 4) Start veggies - add half a stick of butter to chicken fat, saut√© peppers and onions in the fat and add sausage and andouille. Do not brown onions and peppers. Just kind of get them ALMOST brown. If you brown them, I find that it makes the gumbo too sweet. Add garlic at the end of this process so garlic doesn't get bitter.   Step 5) Assemble gumbo - add back chicken, okra to onion, pepper, and sausage mix. Add box of chicken broth and 2-4 cups water (depending on size of pot (this is a lot of gumbo we are making)). Add 4 bay leaves, Tony's seasoning, and your roux to taste.   Step 6) Turn ingredients into YUM-BO - cook the gumbo on medium low heat for at least an hour. During this time, you should be skimming the fat from the gumbo.   Step 7) Serve gumbo. This is where it gets tricky. Half my family eats their gumbo over potato salad, the other half eats it over plain old rice. Take rice or potato salad or both, add fresh spinach then completely cover with gumbo, add your pickled merletons, okra, and jalape√±os and hot sauce and eat the shit outta the completely bad ass YUM-BO.   Spinach - look gumbo is ugly. It is just a brown soup. If you add fresh spinach, it adds flavor and much needed color.   Good luck"

Acadiana,3djdl1,TamponFingers,3,Fri Jul 17 04:45:01 2015 UTC,Look up Billeaud's Self and Boat storage.  There's dozens of bands that practice there.  I hope you like shitty doom metal because you'll be hearing plenty of it there.  It has electricity and it's pretty secure but unbearable in the heart of Winter/Summer.
Acadiana,3djdl1,StephenFish,2,Thu Jul 16 21:50:09 2015 UTC,Several of my husbands bands practiced here over the last many years. If you have access to an industrial fan and practice in the evening (in summer) it wasn't completely horrible...and was a hell of a lot cheaper than many other places.

Saturday's, I either do my own thing with my team or I ride at pack n paddle with the ABC team. Sunday, I do the Girard park ride at 8 am.

Acadiana,3d7vhn,MeatHead1313,6,Tue Jul 14 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr: vendors seemed like they were misled and upset  I was excited for this and I went last year but was kind of disappointed. Maybe because I went on the last day, but who knows. Hear me out though.  The tickets were $10-12, which I was ok with because I figured it was to cover sampling all the hot sauces and pay for the entertainment. There was a cover band playing that was very entertaining and I did enjoy sampling the sauces. Also, the $5 all you can drink bloody marys was cool.  So as I was walking around to the different booths and sellers, most of them would give me a sample and then immediately ask if I wanted to purchase. Then I was put in the position of turning them down, which I don't really like doing. Ok, I understand the vendors make money when they sell, but many of the vendors had a bad attitude like they were upset that they had not sold enough and barely made any money.   At a couple of booths (particularly the one that had the Carolina reaper sauce) I felt ignored or like the people working the booth didn't care any more to offer samples. We even tried to ask them questions about their sauces and they didn't really seem interested in talking about it. Maybe it's because they walked into the deal thinking they would sell all kinds of sauce and make money, but after paying $10 for a ticket not very many people are going to want to purchase multiple bottles of hot sauce at $5 a piece.  It was still a good time. I don't want to discourage anyone from going. I just got the feeling that the vendors had no idea what they were getting into and were highly disappointed at the lack of sales."

She is not a linguist (there are some spelling errors in french) but it is always interesting to speak about this. I learnt lot about the diffrences between my French and Louisiana French especially about ameridian words.  Thus I think it is very important for Louisiana French speakers to speak in French.

I hosted some travellers from Quebec last year, they were so happy that in the small towns people addressed them in French.  BTW, my favourite word that I picked up in Quebec was Ameridan, referring to the idigenous peoples, it just fits so much better than Indian."

Acadiana,3d3nzm,atchafalaya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:01:51 2015 UTC,My experience has been that there are several sub-types of Cajun accent. The prairie Cajun accent north of I-10 is very different than the accent of people from down around Delcambre or New Iberia. There's another accent that I think of as the levee accent that I've heard people speak from the area east of St. Martinville.
Acadiana,3d3nzm,Heleade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:12 2015 UTC,I agree. I think there is no Cajun French but there are Cajun Frenchs. This is an ensemble of dialects that explains all those sub-types of accent and vocabulary (piastre/dollars for instance).

Simple as that.   That being said, I also agree that it is absurd to expect this flag to be wiped from all walks of life. I may not personally agree with flying the flag or buying memorabilia with the flag on it, but that's what makes this country great.

Acadiana,3cpy05,PetrockX,17,Fri Jul 10 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with the removal. Down vote me all you want. My point it this, it was the battle flag of the confederate army. An army with a record of 0 - 1. They lost the only war they fought in. Basically we are flying the flag of the losing team. In all honesty though the South collectively has not done anything after the Civil War. If the flag would stand for something we accomplished I would have no problem with it, but sadly it hasn't the south tends to be behind in the social democracy.   Edit: To people saying that the flag represents states rights, if the state decides that the flag no longer represents the views of the state, who are you to question their rights to remove the flag."

More people will associate it with racism. The ISIS flag simply says ""There is no God but Allah. Mohammed is the messenger of Allah"" that statement right there shows no hate only a a representation of Islamic beliefs. When you start chopping people's heads off while flying it, people tend to associate the flag with being a dick. That is what's happening with the battle flag.

We are talking about people that fought a battle 150 years ago, people we never met and do not even know if they were good people, only that they supported the right to secede so that they could continue to enslave people.  To top it off, the ""Confederate Flag"" that everyone is up in arms about does not represent the vast majority of the Confederacy, it was the flag of Robert E Lee's army unit out of Virgina.  The confederate states had 3 flags and this was not one of them, so most of the people who have some vague emotional attachment to it have no connection to it through their ancestors either."

They lived in a much different time than we did. They were slave owners, indian killers, cheaters, beleived women shouldn't have the right to vote, were anti-gay, fought unjust wars, and were immortalized for conquering land illegally & immorally.  Or... maybe we could leave all these statues up because they all represent a part of our history, even if that history isn't always pretty.

It has no place on government buildings.  However, if it's flown as a piece of history, and a reminder of a VERY important part of our history, then it needs to stay. There were some EXTREMELY harsh lessons learned from the American Civil war. I think that everyone needs a reminder as to what happened during that time. Brother literally fighting brother, overstepping of states rights, the importance of a Union of States, and of course human rights spanning all races.

I'm not one to even be proud to be from the South as a general region (if I'm gonna fly any flag for pride, I'll fly this one, thank you) but it's a natural course as to why people who are proud to be from a distinct cultural region took as their own the only recognizable flag of that region. Symbolism changes, and the symbolism of the Confederate flag was getting gradually less about race with every passing year until this whole thing blew up.  If you are really prepared to assume that everyone who flies the confederate flag does so because they are racist, I really can only see you as wearing blinders to the world around you."

The recent demonizing of the Confederate flag is a very unfortunate reaction to the tragic Charleston shooting. We cannot let one 21 year old psychopath represent the CSA. On these ridiculous PC grounds, we should do away with the American flag due to the Native American genocide. It's a disgrace how the media (and lowest common denominator consumers) influences the government to take away our freedom because some people are offended. The Confederate flag does NOT in any way represent slavery or racism, it represents many Americans who died to protect their homes and fight for freedom. It's sickening that Confederate memorials have been vandalized by the reactionary, uneducated masses. The Union brutally burned many great Southern cities to the ground and they had slaves as well.

My brother in law got 20 with 13 mandatory for a dwi manslaughter committed when he was the same age as fontenot. Talk to him about  a judges ""impartiality.""   Also,  fontenot will do 13 months, not 3 years.

Acadiana,3clbu8,pseudoguru,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:34:27 2015 UTC,It goes even deeper when dealing with property.  You can not shoot someone for stealing your property.  You could be standing there while a thief steals your radio out of your car and you can not defend it with lethal force.

I faced more than 5 months for literally weed dust in the corner of a baggie. When I got probation my terms were harsher than a guy who was in for beating his gf and meth possession. This guy shot those kids in cold blood over Bullshit. He wasn't protecting his life or his family's life. He killed them over mere unimportant possessions. Hell not even, he killed them because he thought they were stealing mere unimportant things. If someone is willing to kill another person over that they deserve a lot more than 5 months, 13 months or 3 years."

Acadiana,3cglyp,theregoesanother,4,Wed Jul 8 11:46:39 2015 UTC,"While they say that financial aid will be raised to compensate, it's never enough.  Even with full Pell grants, I still have to pay about $900 out of pocket for tuition.  When I first started going, I used to have money left over from my Pell grants."
Acadiana,3cglyp,StephenFish,10,Tue Jul 7 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"Pell grant amounts are not controlled by the University, but by the State's Dept of Education. When you started going, you probably benefited from Obama's raising Pell grant amounts, and at least index them with inflation; since 2012 (2011? whenever the shutdown was), Congress has cut back Pell Grants, shortened their length, and capped increases."
Acadiana,3cglyp,hegb,5,Tue Jul 7 22:39:39 2015 UTC,So how then can UL promise that financial aid will increase?
Acadiana,3cglyp,StephenFish,5,Wed Jul 8 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"TOPS, and scholarships are types of financial aid that the state and school control."
Acadiana,3cglyp,grumpyolddude,3,Wed Jul 8 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem still remains that now instead of paying $900 out of pocket I'll be paying $1500 out of pocket."
Acadiana,3cglyp,StephenFish,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:06:20 2015 UTC,"No, the schools don't control TOPS (or tuition for that matter.)  Tuition increases at state universities and the corresponding increase in TOPS awards are controlled by the state legislature.   I completely understand it costs students more out of pocket to go to school.   If some types of aid hadn't increased it would cost even more.   I totally agree that it's making college harder to afford.   As long as our elected officials prioritize giving your tax money to corporations to make movies instead of giving it to schools to educate students the problem will continue to get worse."
Acadiana,3cglyp,grumpyolddude,3,Wed Jul 8 13:04:10 2015 UTC,"I feel this is a long overdue increase.  Let's face it, Louisiana's public universities have long been some of the cheapest places to attend for higher education in the country, and they're still mostly excellent schools. For the 2014-15 year, the US National average tuition was just over $9100, while Louisiana's was jut barely creeping over $7300, and that was after Louisiana's average had risen by 54% over the previous 5 years!  This state horribly squanders any possibility of fixing the education system by routinely under-funding or gutting the funding to it's higher education system. Persons not to be named have touted this as a way to bring economic growth into Louisiana, but really most of those people who come for the inexpensive education quickly leave because there aren't enough well-paying jobs in the state to keep them here!  Unfortunately this tuition increase won't be coupled with a resurgence of state funding. Rather, it exists solely to replace state funding that has been taken away and for the next decade, the state will continue to ride these recent tuition changes as ""proof"" that the system doesn't need more state funding.  An education is only as good as you make it, but Louisiana has been a massive bargain for other states' economic bases for years."

Acadiana,3c35tu,OffspringOfTheMaize,2,Sun Jul 5 04:40:04 2015 UTC,Will you accept all music genres? Including not-hip and/or not-local bands?  Says in your policies that We can only pay bands if more than 70 people pay admission. does that mean you are charging a flat fee  (the 10$ from Indiegogo) at the door?

Acadiana,3c35tu,Marcentrix,2,Sat Jul 4 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"I'm predicting that a vast majority of the artist we book will be of the rock/metal genre, being that my target audience is the under 18/21 crowd. But honestly, I'm willing to give any artist a chance and see how the turnout is. I'd love to hear suggestions and will be happy to visit any links/YouTube pages to artist.

Acadiana,3c35tu,i_amnot_anyone,2,Sat Jul 4 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"I'm open to a lot of things, It really just depends on if it's worth opening the place up. Will enough people pay a cover charge to make it worth being there for a few hours, running the lights, PA, air conditioner (cranked up during summer) and if/how a payout would work for whoever participates.   The bread and butter of this place will be having 4 or 5 bands play, each band brings in a bunch of their fans and another handful that came just to to come.   Since there's no alcohol to draw people in, it's all dependent on who's playing. Trying to promote a show that's open mic it basically saying, pay to get for a musical (maybe) surprise! I have a friend who does some comedy stuff around Lafayette and we've talked about how we could make something like that work on the regular. It's just hard to predict how the ""no alcohol"" will affect those types of events."
Acadiana,3c35tu,gdogpwns,2,Sat Jul 4 17:23:37 2015 UTC,Comedy would be cool. We were just talking about the lack of comedy shows in Lafayette the other day. The lack of drunks would probably be nice too :)

Acadiana,3c3oob,waltc97,3,Sat Jul 4 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, if a restaurant offers grilled and fried seafood, you can ask that the gator be grilled instead of fried.   Cafe 329 on Dulles has an alligator sausage po-boy that I heard was pretty good.    Other wise, out of season will probably mean frozen tail meat or if you want fresh it will be farm raised.   Remember that alligator tail meat is very delicate and needs to be treated the same way you would treat fish.  Short cook times are preferable."
Acadiana,3c3oob,rapcat,2,Sat Jul 4 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"A quick Google search took me to Chez Francois' website, they list their pricing: http://cfseafood.com/alligator-meat  Looks like most of the specialty meat stores in town carry at least SOME alligator. I would check with them.  I think that most of the alligator you get from the store is actually farm raised, so not necessarily seasonal. I would even consider checking with a few of the farms for better pricing."
Acadiana,3c3oob,tpeiyn,2,Sat Jul 4 14:10:11 2015 UTC,thanks. i forgot that the 'season' is more intended for hides instead of meat. think i'll call a few farms and see if i can get it from them or ask for their preferred vendor.

Acadiana,3bt8ax,SecondtoLastSamurai,3,Thu Jul 2 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"I have a Winegard listed here . I have mine mounted in the attic which is (guessing) 15 feet above ground. It is rated for 35 miles, but I catch one channel much further. I catch ABC(KATC), CBS(KLFY), FOX(KADN), LPB and couple of channels which I do not watch - it's mostly very old shows or religious programming. If I point the antenna in the direction, I can catch WVLA(NBC) from Baton Rouge, but lose a lot of local channels. I am in the north side of Broussard, which is about 12-20+ miles from you depending on where you live in New Iberia. You could try to make your own (there is an instructable here )or get a pair of rabbit ears and see what type of signal you get as YMMV. Good luck! I got rid of Cox after my bill kept on creeping up and I realised I was paying for a bunch of stuff I did not watch. If you are a sports fan, get used to hanging in bars or have a few friends with cable. There is a sub here /r/cordcutters that has a lot of information to get you started. TBH, there is much more entertainment available out there than you could watch online. Between Amazon, Netflix and Hulu I am paying around $25/month. And I get to watch what I want when I want, with no commercials (well, yes on Hulu, but not nearly as much as cable or TV). So online plus Free TV = more TV than you could feasibly watch."

I've dealt with my share of cops and 9/10 if you are getting stopped or just dealing with them in the wild they are rude power tripping dicks.

It's nice. And kind of cool to be able to look back in 20 years and say ""I remember when this happened."" It's historic"
Acadiana,3bjn74,Clumsybritt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:32:33 2015 UTC,"Glad to live here in Lafayette, proving once again that we live in a small island of sanity and reason  surrounded by bigotry and hatred."
Acadiana,3bjn74,bagofboards,7,Tue Jun 30 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, most of the parishes in Acadiana reported being prepared to hand out marriage certificates to same sex couples.    (Not to say you're wrong though.)"
Acadiana,3bjn74,cajunbander,-2,Tue Jun 30 03:02:47 2015 UTC,I wonder what percentage of marriage licenses will be for gay marriage in Lafayette over the next year.  I'm guessing 2 percent.
Acadiana,3bjn74,jiggy68,4,Tue Jun 30 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're trying to make some kind of point here, but it's not clear.  Normally, folks making that statement are doing it to insinuate that this fight was a waste of time and money. Which, as someone working in social services, I get.  The 2% number is a complete ass-pull, but it this most likely a relatively small portion of the population. Which is why the virulent opposition to LGBT rights is so funny to me. How many tens of millions of dollars did conservatives waste trying to affect change on an issue that has absolutely nothing to do with them? How many tens of millions worth of tax dollars were spent tying up the courts in this mess for the last decade?  Since we're already begging the question, how many tens of millions are going to be spent in courts again while various legislators attempt to pad their election-season portfolio by attempting to circumvent this constitutional decision?  Ah, well.  I'm pleased to have the option, personally. Plus, there's a good chance that when it comes to later issues like ENDA, Healthcare Access, and EO... the opposition will have already tired itself out.  All that said, I know of two other gay couples who are both planning to wait. As far as my partner and I are concerned, we've considered ourselves married for a while. We weren't exactly waiting for straight people's permission.  We may go through with it eventually, but right now we have bigger concerns than throwing a party for a friends to get drunk celebrating something we've known for years.  After all, marriage is a pretty serious commitment that we've fought hard to have access to. No sense in running out and taking that step just because we can."
Acadiana,3bjn74,jiggy68,0,Tue Jun 30 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"I'm pro gay marriage.  I support the SC in their ruling.  I'm glad to see Lafayette Parish issue the licenses.    The 2% number is a complete ass-pull   My 2% number is based on the fact that about 3% of the US identify as homosexuals and it's probably less in southern Louisiana.  I imagine, however, that there's a backlog of gay weddings that will be taking place this year.  After that I think it would level out at around 2-3%."
Acadiana,3bjn74,22travis,2,Tue Jun 30 18:32:22 2015 UTC,Over the nest year the number will likely be much higher. Because of the end of the prohibition will equal a flying of newfound rights

Acadiana,3bho6s,hegb,4,Tue Jun 30 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"It most likely belongs to whoever used to own the property, 100+ years ago. If you really want to find out who it was (assuming there's no inscription), you'll have to go through historical records and check the personal histories of everyone that lived there - especially the kind to be excommunicated (and thus excluded from the communal cemetery): non-Whites, divorced women, people who died from consumption, non-baptized children (legitimate or illegitimate), or just anyone not Catholic.  All of which will make your search more complicated... And just be aware that this is not as rare an occurrence as you may think."
Acadiana,3bho6s,hegb,2,Mon Jun 29 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured if I really wanted some answers I'd have to do some serious digging. I just uploaded some photos I took from the last time I went there. Maybe they'll help in getting some answers. http://imgur.com/a/uz8GC"
Acadiana,3bho6s,tpeiyn,2,Mon Jun 29 15:39:53 2015 UTC,"That's a terribly common name, and I kind of wish the marker on top had a name on it, since that person is the most likely to be on census rolls...   Two women's names though: I would assume they were spinsters,  but they could be lesbians (who took one another's name and it would be amazing), could also be ""witches"" (there is room for an altar at the front) or just mixed race women, good enough to receive a proper burial but not with the white folks.   I'd start with local plantations' archives if they have anything, since that seems to be the edge of plantation domain."
Acadiana,3bho6s,Sir_Trivium,3,Mon Jun 29 16:20:37 2015 UTC,"Probably worth mentioning, I believe the grave belonged to a man named John Lewis as the grave is just off a road (John Lewis Rd.) presumably named for him.

Acadiana,3bho6s,jmedk,2,Mon Jun 29 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"Secretary of State Records doesn't have a John Lewis matching the dates on the markers, so the namesake would be an older or younger member of the family. /u/jmedk below may provide more information, but again the local plantation, church and perhaps city hall would have the full story."
Acadiana,3bho6s,cloudkookoo,3,Mon Jun 29 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"Probably not the one that you are looking for, but this is another very small cemetery just up hwy 83 from there!

Acadiana,3bgy22,StephenFish,2,Mon Jun 29 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"I worked there for two years.  I don't know if every location is like this, but the one I worked at was impossible to get fired from.  It's great because you don't have to be on edge about losing your job if you're a good worker.  The down side is that you then have to work with a bunch of degenerates that don't get disciplined.  They do pay really well considering the work, though.  I left to get a job in IT and actually took a pay cut, if that gives you any ideas."

Acadiana,3b8wue,MonkeyKing_,11,Fri Jun 26 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"Here is what bothers me: With all the pedophilia that has happened with the priests, members/employees of the Catholic Church, there is no discussion about the ramifications of their (homosexual) contact with the children. Before the church decries the new law of the land (well, except Louisiana), they need to better address the problems they have in their own house. Perhaps they are concerned about the exodus from the priesthood now that marriage is recognized between two men (or two women)."
Acadiana,3b8wue,vadelta967,6,Sat Jun 27 15:47:18 2015 UTC,Yea also there was a scandal of pedophilia here at the Lafayette Diocese in the 70s. It's not like it's far from home.

The bible condemns things like masturbation adultery and pre-marital sex, but yet you don't see those same people opposed to gays getting married having rallies, protesting, and getting their gander up over that."

Acadiana,3b8wue,demian0311,4,Sat Jun 27 02:36:51 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with cjandstuff but I remember this verse being used as rationale to oppose masturbation.   Genesis 38:9, ""And Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so it came about that when he went in to his brother's wife, he wasted his seed on the ground, in order not to give offspring to his brother."" Why did God kill Onan for spilling his seed on the ground?"
Acadiana,3b8wue,cjandstuff,3,Sat Jun 27 04:53:20 2015 UTC,"Always Onan. Lol. This one is a bit tricky.  The question at hand, excuse the pun, is whether or not he was handling business himself, or was he pulling out at the last moment in order to keep his brother's wife from bearing children?  The Jews had a law, that if a man dies childless, his brother would take his wife and bear children under the brother's name, so that name would not die out in Israel.  Onan, it is believed by some, was using his brother's wife, but intentionally pulling out and spilling his seed onto the ground.  That's one take on it."
Acadiana,3b8wue,rapcat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:10:32 2015 UTC,"God had slained Er (Onan's brother) and that was seen as a sign that God wanted Onan to impregnate his brother's wife (as it was a Jewish custom so that lineage could be continued).  He was also commanded by his father Judah to do this.  Since Onan broke Jewish custom and disobeyed his father, God punished him.    It wasn't so much that he spilled his seed, it was that he disobeyed the Jewish custom and his father."

Acadiana,3ayhu3,StephenFish,10,Wed Jun 24 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a shot. For some background, I grew up in small town Tennessee (<10,000 people in my town), went to school at the state's largest undergrad, and moved around for 2 years after college from Raleigh, NC to Atlanta to the rural smoky mountains area of east TN before my career brought me here. So while I haven't lived all over the US, I've lived in enough areas to know a good place when I see it. With that said, everyone is different and prioritizes differently, so I understand where you're coming from. Here we go:    Lafayette is just the right size for me. It's not a bustling metropolis, but it's large enough to not get bored, and it seems to be growing continually.    The food here is great. This area has so many local great restaurants for its size. I realize you'll get this in most larger cities, but it's everywhere here and at a great price.    The location is perfect for me. You're 2 hours from New Orleans and 4 hours from Houston, so you can always venture out for the bigger city experiences without having to hop on a plane or take a week off of work.    The people down here have been incredibly friendly. I see a lot of complaints about the ""small minded"" people. Well those people exist everywhere. I saw them in Raleigh, Atlanta, and 100x worse in small town Tennessee. Lafayette is pretty progressive for a deep south community.   That's probably enough for this wall of text. To your point, you COULD get this in other places, but there's something intangible that has made me want to put some roots down here. I'm not trying to change anyone's mind, just giving my perspective on Acadiana."
Acadiana,3ayhu3,TotesMcGotes13,4,Wed Jun 24 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"Speaking of North Carolina, I found Asheville to have better food, better people, better beer and isn't much different in size than Lafayette.  It had a similar (but slightly less rain, a bit cooler) climate, better roads, a rich culture (maybe more homeless people?), and isn't too far from Raleigh if you want some big city action.  Plus, there's the Smoky Mountains (and subsequently the Blue Ridge Parkway).  I'd say Asheville is like Lafayette+1, which furthers my point in that Lafayette is just another mediocre place.  You can get the same experience living elsewhere."

Acadiana,3ayhu3,tpeiyn,2,Sat Jun 27 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"I spent the first 25 miles of my life 60 miles south of Asheville, so I feel qualified to respond to this! Asheville IS a nice city, but I would think of it like Austin or Lafayette--it is an oasis in a sea of mediocrity.   1) Better food? Where? I'm not sure that I have any idea wast you are talking about. Decent BBQ maybe?  2) Climate? No. Just no. Spring, summer, and fall are very pleasant, but have you visited during winter? Snow isn't going to be a huge concern, but ice is brutal!  3) Better roads? Absolutely! No room to argue there ;)  4) Rich culture -- I have found that in a lot of ways, Asheville is like Florida. You won't meet many people that are really from there. Most of the ""cool, cultured people"" are transplants. People from there are just as bigoted and close minded as people from Acadiana, maybe even worse. People from the area tend to see Asheville as Baby San Francisco, a.k.a. Sodom and Gomorrah.  5) Beer--of course Asheville has good freakin beer, we have been perfecting the art of brewing and distilling for generations!  Also, the Blue Ridge Parkway?  Another thing that is awesome during tourist season, but not during the winter! It will be closed at pretty much any hint of adverse weather."
Acadiana,3ayhu3,tpeiyn,-1,Wed Jun 24 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"1) Better food?  As I'm drinking from my Sunny Point Cafe tumbler right now, I'll use that as my go-to example.  French Broad Chocolate Lounge is beyond amazing.  Even Asheville Brewing Company has excellent pizza and calzones.  White Rabbit is badass, too.    2) If Spring, Summer and Fall are pleasant, that's better than here.  We have summer and winter and that's about it.  4) Granted while I was there I didn't speak to dozens of locals, just some of my girlfriend's family that was from there.  I just didn't see any truck nuts, confederate flags, ""Salt Life"" stickers or jacked up trucks.  Maybe that's what got me excited.  We have our seasonal tourist attractions as well.  That's pretty standard in many places, so that's hardly a con regarding the BRP.  You think people want to go on swamp tours in January or the dead of summer?  It's miserable.  And no one goes to Grand Isle or Cypremort Point in winter (maybe they do, but why?)."

Can these politicians change the over abundance of oilfield trash with entitlement issues?  Can they repair all of the roads, create a better flow of traffic and teach people to drive like humans and not monsters?  Can they teach people to care about anyone other than themselves and be contributing members of society?    Most of these problems are cultural and politics won't change that.

Acadiana,3ayhu3,Blueadder01,9,Thu Jun 25 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"I came to college 26 years ago from a town north of Baton Rouge.  Grew up an LSU football fan, but chose USL for school.  Met a girl who went to LSU and probably spent more time in and around Baton Rouge during the week than I did here.  I went home every weekend to see my friends who lived elsewhere or never left.  After graduation, I took a job in Lake Charles.  Also known as the Armpit of Louisiana, I can wholeheartedly say that there wasn't a day that I waited to get the hell out of there.  I returned to Lafayette never to leave again.  LUS Fiber is great, the traffic is terrible.  It has a small town feel but large town amenities.  You can get a taco at 2:30am from Taco Bell, but you can also get shrimp poboys from Olde Tyme on Fridays.  I'm Catholic and attend church regularly, this sentiment is echoed almost everywhere I go.  I hate the pretentiousness that noveau riche, oil field millionaires and their trophy wives exhibit, but I laugh at them when I see an abundance of Range Rovers rolling through River Ranch, waiting in line to eat at Southern first, then Ruffinos and now Antlers.  Coming from yankee bloodlines, I've had extended visits to different states for work, play and family.  I find that the south generally has a more friendly feel to it.  Lafayette does have culture, and compared to other areas in the state, thats hard to come by.  Lake Charles is East Texas, Baton Rouge is a vanilla mixing pot, New Orleans is a shithole, and the north, isn't really Louisiana.  I guess its what grows on you.  I'm not blind to think that there aren't places where I can make more money, live in a larger house, have less hot weather or hurricanes, but Lafayette has grown on me.  I have established friends and plenty of family here now, and have no intention of leaving again.  Just my 2 cents."

Kaliste Saloom is officially the ""driving absolutely no where in the left lane highway"", and of course who could forget the New Iberia Left Lane Shuffle on 90.  Lafayette quite also seems to suffer from ""country comes to town"" where someone fresh off the horse and buggy haven't mastered Johnston Street yet.   I agree with below, I'd take TN or NC.  I'm in IT, and NC isn't a bad location.  TN is absolutely beautiful, probably the best LSU road tailgate and we never miss the opportunity.  Texas is too Texas.  Too hot, too dry (except these days) and too rural (or WAYY to big city) for my tastes.  Talk about traffic, Dallas!    So I guess we need to quantify, Lafayette vs other cities in Louisiana, or Lafayette vs moving out of state completely.  If I want to stay close to family, LSU football and tailgating, summers on Old River, festivals, keeping my wife happy, and a handful of other things, I'd have to stay in La.

David Cross once joked that the only universal accent was the redneck one.  I've lived in a bunch of places, but only a few where I was old enough to appreciate them. I was born here, but I grew up in Houston, but there's not really much a kid limited to his parents' whims can do in one of the biggest cities in the US. Moved when I was 10 or so to Manhattan, KS.  It's Kansas, so I know there'll be jokes, but it was a college town, small enough to go wherever you wanted on a bicycle, and had plenty to do as far as shopping or outdoor activities. They had a bike trail around the entire city (part of which branched off and even took you in the woods), a fucking phenomenal public pool (used by KSU students, but the public park pool has expanded into a public water park), there's always shopping in locally owned businesses... and, for a flat state, Manhattan had plenty of rolling hills, you could go visit the dam, and so on. If I ever moved out of Lafayette, it'd be back here. Plus, it's an hour from Westboro Baptist, so if you've got the time to make a Baton Rouge-like drive and a carton of eggs...  Other than that... it's been brief periods of time all over the country, but the only other significant amounts of time I've spent in other cities were here and Philadelphia. Philadelphia has much the same problems as any other medium to big city, but what threw me off is that, for the City of Brotherly Love, people are fucking rude there.

I moved to ATX after graduating from UL and I don't see myself ever moving back. Lafayette mirrors a lot of Austin qualities but it is still pretty far off from what Austin has to offer. I would say the cost of living is about the same, depending where you decide to get an apartment. Location of where you live, however, is very important in Austin because you're either in the middle of everything or in BFE. I will say there are A LOT of temptations to spend money ....different activities etc, but besides that the cost of both locations are about the same."

Acadiana,3awu0a,bancroftjem,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:23:12 2015 UTC,They're likely that old because it's hard to compile live data and consider it accurate.  You need a substantial pool to draw any usable conclusion.  I find it hard to believe that things would have changed so drastically in 15 months unless there was some major economic downturn.
Acadiana,3awu0a,StephenFish,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but according to Zillow the median list price for an Austin 3 bedroom home in Feb 2014 was $320K, this February the price rose to $341K, a 6.5% increase  In Lafayette, that same house listed for $219K in Feb 2014, in Feb 2015 it rose to $222K. That's only a 1.4% increase...  So yes, things have changed in 15 months.  The demand for housing is steady (and possibly increasing) and the supply is still pretty low. They're building condos and apartment buildings like crazy to keep up with the demand.  *EDIT: was using the wrong stats in first rev. and using different months of year."

Acadiana,3aulp7,MrGravy92,3,Tue Jun 23 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure about those specific cards because I haven't received my $5 refund yet, but in my experience most merchants process those cards with a ""partial authorization."" So if you have $5 left, just go to Walmart,  slide the card to take the $5 off of your total, then pay for the rest."
Acadiana,3aulp7,tpeiyn,2,Tue Jun 23 17:23:20 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the card money left over gets reclaimed by the state treasury and you have x amount of years to reclaim it.  Since Chase is the merchant/bank, you can go to Chase and they will cash out the card for you with no fees attached. You can also buy something for $10, swipe the card and use the remaining balance then pay with cash or credit/debit."
Acadiana,3aulp7,rapcat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"If each person can't spend the final $3 or $4 on the card does that state just get to keep that money?   No, that falls under the issuing bank's authority from the moment the card is first issued. So, if Chase is the issuing authority, then Chase's policies are the ones in play.  Any unclaimed tax refunds can be claimed via the Dept of the Treasury Unclaimed Property Website. This only applies to wholly unclaimed returns such as paper checks.  The state also publishes annual reports on tax numbers if you can find the damned things. I believe last year something like 85% of tax returns eligible for refunds were filed electronically, and of those, a slightly smaller number opted for direct deposit.   This is very likely because most people receive a refund and want it as fast as possible."

Her room mate was tied up with duck tape and had her throat slit.  The campus police claimed the investigation and completely botched the investigation in a massive way.  When they couldn't find the real culprit they decided that SOMEONE had to be found guilty, so they pinned it on the room mate who was passed out unconscious in the next room after dental surgery.  For two years they ruined that girls life and drug her name through the mud with the help of the DA and the University itself.  IIRC they kept her in jail with an insane bond that no one could ever pay.  When it finally went to court and the details came out she was proven innocent, and that the police and everyone involved knew she was innocent, and it kinda looked like they were trying to pin it on her so that no one would think there was a murderer wandering around USL."

Now I'm curious too, I'm going to have to go ask him about it!  Edit: This is what he told me:  Canton City was apparently open for a very long time, like 30 years. For the first 2/3rds of it's life, it was a good restaurant that was pretty popular. About 20 years ago, the original owners moved back to China, leaving the married couple that currently runs Formosa Gardens to run it. They ran it for a little while, apparently into the ground.

Acadiana,3ao8db,grumpyolddude,2,Mon Jun 22 03:30:05 2015 UTC,From what I understand Old Dominion shipping is building next to Prejeans and now this.   That area just doesn't seem to be all that great for trucking businesses.  It's between the Super 1 foods Exit (4) in Carencro with the traffic circle and the Lowes/Ranch Outlet Exit. (2)    I would think it would be inconvenient for big trucks and the service road will get torn up pretty badly.  Is there some appeal to this area for trucking/shipping companies I'm not seeing?
Acadiana,3ao8db,budapest_candygram,5,Mon Jun 22 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"(1) It is at the intersection of two major interstates (I-10, I-49) and you can quickly get on either one, due to Lafayette's relatively small size. (2) Our airport is capable of handling multiple daily flights from Fedex and UPS, unique for a city of Lafayette's size. (3) You can quickly go between the airport and this site."
Acadiana,3ao8db,tpeiyn,2,Mon Jun 22 13:37:10 2015 UTC,"I'm really disgusted by this. I really don't think that adding that much truck traffic to the Veterans Dr. intersection is a good idea.

My husband laughs at me about it, ""You're not in South Carolina anymore, the police aren't the enemy. You aren't going to get pulled over every time you leave the house.""  Anyway, I just don't think that Veterans is capable of handling the congestion. They need to seriously look into modifying some of the traffic patterns, particularly around the frontage roads. I live between Gloria Switch and Veterans, so I find myself trying to turn on/off the frontage road opposite McDonalds on a regular basis. It is TERRIFYING!

Acadiana,3akt3i,waltc97,2,Sun Jun 21 22:40:20 2015 UTC,I lived in something like that 30 years ago.  It was a house that had been split in half in a town past the outskirts of Lafayette and I paid $100 a month for my half.    When I got a better job and moved into Lafayette I had to pay $275 a month for a decent one bedroom apartment.   When I bought my first house a few years later the note was around $400 a month.   I can't see paying $400 a month to rent that - but I suspect things have changed a lot in 30 years.

Acadiana,3a6t28,GentleSeacow,8,Wed Jun 17 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"I live in Carencro and end up spending a lot of time on the Northside. This is just my opinion:  Most of that is just racially motivated drivel. There are a lot of nice neighborhoods on the Northside of town. You can tell the good from the bad. Look for the nice, well kept yards, decent houses, and OK cars. If you don't see a little thug selling crack on the corner, chances are you will be fine! Personally, I don't think I would want to be on St. Charles, just because that is a little dumpier than I would want. I would look at the neighborhoods further north on Louisiana Ave. and Moss St., like around Willow, Pont Des Mouton, or Gloria Switch.  Note: Many of those houses won't be the ""bungalow"" that you are looking for. Most seem to be small, brick ranches that are so prevalent in Lafayette."
Acadiana,3a6t28,tpeiyn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch. One home is near St. Charles and Louisiana. It seems like most people on the street take care of their homes, but then looking down street view on the main streets some of the areas seem a bit industrial. I suppose I won't have a feel for it until I actually cruise the area."
Acadiana,3a6t28,jilliest,3,Wed Jun 17 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"I second what this guy said. My aunts live on the northside in very nice areas. You can look at the neighborhoods and tell which have older, more settled in residents. That's the areas I would shoot for. And obviously if the houses are falling apart with lots of junk in the yard I'd keep driving. There are so many nice, cheap homes there because ""oh no! Black people!!!""

Acadiana,3a5psb,realworldshaggy,2,Wed Jun 17 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"Crimes like theft, vandalism, and fighting will usually go up in the summer months. So this is probably a response to a recent rise in these incidents. Stupid teenagers will get bored and get into trouble. Usually these laws will just give police a little more help in getting young troublemakers off the street. I don't think the aim is to go around arresting kids. But it gives them the legal authority to detain and question them and try to make sure they aren't causing trouble."

Acadiana,3a5psb,uzername_ic,2,Wed Jun 17 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"Well, if it is anything like Carencro, I would imagine it's pretty bad. This time of year, we have kids wandering the streets CONSTANTLY at all hours of the night. Doesn't really bother me as long as they stay the hell out of my yard, but I can't tell you how many times I've almost smushed one of the little bugs in the middle of the road at midnight.  Last year, I worked in a position where I had to be at work by 4:45 AM once or twice a week. I would get up around 3:30 and take the dogs out. It really freaked me out to realize that there were teenagers roaming my neighborhood even then.   Anyway, I guess it is wrong of me to say that it's a bad thing for kids to be wandering around in the middle of the night since I can't really point to any issues thatthey have caused. We've only had two things stolen from outside: a  floor jack and a can of gas. I don't think that the kids wandering in the middle of the night had anything to do with it. When the little bastards broke in through my kitchen window, it was in the middle of the day.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is this: Children are evil. Just lock them all up until they turn 21."

Acadiana,3a4q4n,uzername_ic,0,Wed Jun 17 16:14:21 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to say that Cajun people are the only thing saving the Gulf Coast from impending disaster should the entire fucking Gulf of Mexico dry up within our lifetimes? The Gulf and the environment have nothing to do with culture. There would be an economy here whether or not people continued to speak French, listen to zydeco, or eat Cajun food. As long as there's oil and fishing in the Gulf this area will be profitable and able to sustain an economy, regardless of the traditions of the people here."
Acadiana,3a4q4n,Marcentrix,2,Wed Jun 17 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"No I'm saying when we run out of oil, our only major economy is tourism. If there's no Cajuns left, then what's the point. We're just another humid city with no culture. You can word it however you want, no oil = no money. Fishing will not sustain our way of life, not solely. So what's left; movie production is really starting to take off, but I have a hard time seeing Acadiana becoming as successful in that as say Hollywood. That brings us back to tourism. But wait, we let our Cajun culture die, so what's going to bring people here? The cool speed bumps on Ambassador? If no one speaks French anymore who will work at Vermilion Ville and such.   You're right though, we will have Ana economy here, no matter what. But nothing to support an area of this size in the type of prosperity we are used to.   But you know, whatever, we will never run out of oil. Lol.   Either way our fucking culture is so unique and amazing that to just sit back and let it die is the stupidest thing I've ever heard."

I cut out all television services last year and only use Internet. While I do have LUS Fiber as an option, while I was still on cox I was doing this also.  When I had cox television and Internet, I was around $175 per month.  On LUS, I am at $54 per month.  Unless there's a specific reason for TV services, I wouldn't get them. There is no piece of media that isn't available online in some timely manner.  Between Netflix, Amazon Prime, Parents having HBO so I can use HBOGo, Online access, torrents, not-so-legal streams, and other things...., there's plenty of options that don't include giving Cox your first and second born children."
Acadiana,3a0ty0,bab7880,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:21:14 2015 UTC,"SlingTV is worth mentioning with that list. It's something like 20 a month for a couple of streaming live channels like ESPN, cartoon network, food network, news."
Acadiana,3a0ty0,Rhineaux,2,Tue Jun 16 15:43:56 2015 UTC,Yep that's what I'm doing. LUS 80/80 for $55 + SlingTV for $20. OTA HD antenna for local channels.  My internet + cable bill went from $175 to $75.
Acadiana,3a0ty0,high-powered-mutant,6,Tue Jun 16 18:52:20 2015 UTC,Consider cutting all cable and run just internet.   /r/cordcutters
Acadiana,3a0ty0,cbs5090,3,Tue Jun 16 14:37:03 2015 UTC,"Cox is just high, period. I pay around $75 a month for internet only (forgrt which tier). In South Carolina, I paid $45 a month with Charter for internet. However, what you are paying does seem a little high. Maybe you should look at dropping some of your services down some. I looked the other day and if I added like their 120 channel package, I could have internet AND tv for less than I'm paying now--$65 for 12 months. Ridiculous, right?"
Acadiana,3a0ty0,tpeiyn,2,Tue Jun 16 12:05:50 2015 UTC,"That internet is likely slower than your tier, but it is still ridiculous.  Take some time today to cancel you service. A retention specialist will likely off you the same exact service for half of your current rate. They did that for me when I switched to LUS."
Acadiana,3a0ty0,bab7880,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I need to call about it. It's been on the list for a few days. I really just wish I could get LUS, I haven't been all that pleased with Cox's service."
Acadiana,3a0ty0,tpeiyn,2,Tue Jun 16 13:39:43 2015 UTC,I have the exact same pricing for the same thing you have. I'm betting we live in the same complex.
Acadiana,3a0ty0,retnuh730,2,Tue Jun 16 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"Call retention every few months, tell them their prices are exceeding your monthly alotment budget wise and may have to cancel.  Retentions entire existance is to keep customers."
Acadiana,3a0ty0,rd8t,3,Tue Jun 16 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"This can work too. Once they have you, they will do ANYTHING to keep you. Even when I was down to internet-only, they offered to keep me at a minimal, ""emergency bandwidth"" (3Gb/s) for free for up to 3 months, in case I was unsatisfied with my new provider.  They offered to cut my existing rate 50% immediately when I called to cancel.  They also took 6 months to disconnect the signal into my house, meaning I still received the ""expanded"" channels (2-70ish) for another 6 months absolutely free. It might just be that they wait for 6 months because after 90 days you are considered a ""new"" customer, hoping you are waiting for that and try to save labor when they can?  But when I found out that the service level I was actually receiving was below what I was paying for, and that LUS offered faster than what I was paying for, cheaper, I didn't look back. I called Cox while LUS was at the house installing.  Their un-support of net neutrality also helped my decision.  It's really sad for OP that they cannot get LUSFiber, for it is wonderful, cheap, and fass-fass.."
Acadiana,3a0ty0,bab7880,4,Tue Jun 16 13:18:06 2015 UTC,I switched to LUSFiber as soon as I got into a house from an apartment.    At least when LUS had a price increase ($5 a month) my internet speeds doubled
Acadiana,3a0ty0,rd8t,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"100% agree with u/bab7880. Buy the DOCSIS 3 modem. If you keep an eye on woot.com , they seem to run deals on them quite often (the motorola surfboard, which I believe is the one Cox would end up giving you anyway).    Depending on what TV you watch, check out slingtv as an alternative to a cable tv package. It's $20 a month and you get about 20 channels (ESPN, ESPN2, HGTV, Food, IFC, CNN, TNT, A&E, AMC, etc). If you pre-pay for 3 months, you get a free Amazon FireStick or Roku Stick, which can also run your netflix and amazon prime if you have it. Sling also just added an HBO option for $15 a month that gives you an HBO live stream and all of the HBO content on demand (pretty much the same as HBO GO). Additionally, go grab a digital antenna to pick up the local affiliates for ABC, CBS, NBC, etc for free over the air in HD. I do this, and all together I'm saving about $80 a month. Between Sling, HD antenna, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and my chromecast, I haven't missed out on any TV that I normally would've watched. Let me know if you have any questions."

Now that I'm forced into Cox, I decided to cut the cord on cable tv to save some money.   Which part seems complicated? I promise it's not very challenging. The modem is as simple as plugging in the cable line and power cord.    SlingTV is very similar to netflix or any other streaming service as far as the user interface. The Fire Stick is pretty intuitive to set up as well.    The HD antenna is also simple. Plug the cable into the TV, plug in the antenna, and scan for channels using your tv remote. You might have to elevate the antenna or move it closer to a window to get the best reception, but it's the same concept as the old rabbit ear antennas that my parents had growing up."

Acadiana,39wkqm,kraaz,7,Mon Jun 15 11:38:57 2015 UTC,I moved to Houston 3 years ago from Lafayette.  I hate Houston but not sure if it's because I miss Lafayette or Houston just sucks.
Acadiana,39wkqm,rd8t,6,Mon Jun 15 12:44:29 2015 UTC,Both
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,6,Mon Jun 15 22:12:55 2015 UTC,I tend to avoid the worthless cunts when possible.  Surround yourself with good friends and the rest is easier to deal with
Acadiana,39wkqm,rd8t,8,Mon Jun 15 14:27:59 2015 UTC,The unfortunate truth is that there's good/cool people all over the world.  You can always make friends somewhere else.
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,6,Mon Jun 15 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"True.  I'm comparing a lot of the small towns that are further out from lafayette to Lafayette itself.  At least here, you can find people, a scene, something.  Further out you go, if you ain't country, you are screwed in that aspect"
Acadiana,39wkqm,rd8t,6,Mon Jun 15 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, I know.  I grew up in Plaucheville:  a small town (population below 300) in Avoyelles Parish.  Everything and everyone there is country.  I was considered a devil worshiper because I had hair past my shoulders when I was teenager.  And while there is a scene for many things here, there's still enough small minded bigots to make it miserable if you don't fit into their idea of what a normal person is."
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,3,Mon Jun 15 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"The area between Iota and Jennings for me.  Our small group was kind of the scene..if you can call it that.  Yeah, dickheads and douchebags squeeze in, but the people I consider friends are good enough people that I just don't care enough about the rest.  Spent far too much time in the past dealing with that crap to just no longer bother with it."
Acadiana,39wkqm,rd8t,3,Mon Jun 15 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend is from Vegas.  When she moved here, she couldn't believe that people actually act and speak the way that they do.  It's not the accent or poor grammar, but how openly racist and xenophobic people are.  She hadn't really heard the ""N-word"" outside of rap music back home.  Meanwhile, we have a road in my home town so famously called ""N***er lane"" that half of the town doesn't even know the real name.  It may just be part of living in the South, I don't know.  I haven't lived anywhere outside of LA, only visited."
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,3,Mon Jun 15 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"You almost become conditioned to it, where you can point out how ignorant and biggoted it is, but never shocked that it gets said.  Meanwhile, go to my wife's hometown, and it's all the white people cooking meth in the houses next door."
Acadiana,39wkqm,rd8t,3,Mon Jun 15 17:27:21 2015 UTC,Lebeau?
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,3,Mon Jun 15 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"Wife is Lake Arthur...  Me, it's evangeline.  (Inlaws discovered after neighbors house was sold that the bedroom closest to theres was used to cook meth)"
Acadiana,39wkqm,ElectricBlitz,3,Mon Jun 15 17:35:09 2015 UTC,Housecreep shows history of houses/buildings.  I like finding places that were previously meth labs.  It's kinda fun searching small towns.
Acadiana,39wkqm,tpeiyn,0,Mon Jun 15 17:39:49 2015 UTC,"Forked Island checking in, I have a similar experience with it. I'm into tech and a good amount of the teens that I know(I'm also a teen) think I'm stupid because I have knowledge of tech. I just say, ""OK. I get it. You think your better than me because you ride four wheelers and drive overly loud trucks at 11:00PM at night. Why don't you be nice and keep your opinion to your self? Your not making yourself look good by being a dick to others."" I just learn to ignore them and do whatever I like. If they want to be obnoxious assholes, they can be. Just, within legal law of course. Which some of them don't keep it within that."
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,7,Wed Jun 17 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"LOL, after living in Spartanburg, SC (look it up, it's a real shithole) for 25 years, Lafayette is like heaven. Y'all don't know how good you've got it!   It's the simple things in life that make it so much better: no police harassment, lack of extensive ""blue laws,"" and economic opportunity all contribute to making life awesome :)"
Acadiana,39wkqm,tpeiyn,-1,Mon Jun 15 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Lafayette is better than Detroit, or Sudan, or North Korea.  That doesn't make it good, just better than some places that are shittier."
Acadiana,39wkqm,itsrattlesnake,3,Mon Jun 15 17:36:45 2015 UTC,"Haha, I totally understand what you are saying, I guess I'm just saying it is....less shitty? Every place has it's pros and cons, it is all about what YOU need from it."
Acadiana,39wkqm,TotesMcGotes13,11,Mon Jun 15 17:53:57 2015 UTC,I'm in Africa right now.  I miss Lafayette quite a bit.
Acadiana,39wkqm,vegetaman3113,7,Mon Jun 15 12:19:41 2015 UTC,"If everyone thought alike, the world would be an incredibly boring place. I've lived all over the southeast in cities large and small, and I love Lafayette. On the other hand, I can see the viewpoint of those of you that were born and raised here who find it boring and want to get out. Surround yourself with good people, and you can be happy living pretty much anywhere in my experience."
Acadiana,39wkqm,tokuturfey,13,Mon Jun 15 17:05:00 2015 UTC,Sounds like lafayette don't want you either.
Acadiana,39wkqm,vegetaman3113,7,Mon Jun 15 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"He has also posted about how stupid Festival Internationale is every year when it's happening.  Oh. Well, I was going to link to it, but now he has deleted his account."
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,-4,Mon Jun 15 16:09:47 2015 UTC,Having a great experience. Been working with ayahuasca the past two weeks and am in a great place. Sorry you identify yourself with the terms I used. I wasn't speaking to anyone directly. Do you not believe there are people I described in the world?  Edit. I connect with plenty of people. From all over the world and all walks of life. Perhaps you are too accepting of things that should be intolerable?
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,11,Mon Jun 15 18:15:01 2015 UTC,Wow you used drugs. DMT I'm sure makes you a better person than the rest. It seems transcendence doesn't cure asshole
Acadiana,39wkqm,themarknessmonster,3,Mon Jun 15 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"No one is forcing you to stay here.   Ah, the good old ""If you don't like it, you can git!"" mentality.  Why bother improving when you can just tell everyone to ""git""?"
Acadiana,39wkqm,themarknessmonster,0,Mon Jun 15 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that he's improving anything, but telling someone to leave because they don't like all the shitty things about an area isn't a good attitude to have either.  It's that same ""get out of my country"" mentality 'Muricans have about immigrants.  /u/10below isn't the only person with complaints about this area.  Not everyone can afford to leave.  Some people have kids that share custody with a parent here and cannot leave.  It doesn't mean these people aren't entitled to an opinion."
Acadiana,39wkqm,SweetperterderFries,0,Mon Jun 15 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"No, that's exactly what you did...well, in a marginally nicer way."

Acadiana,39wkqm,deuteronpsi,3,Mon Jun 15 17:41:55 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I know this wasn't aimed at anyone personally, but I may as well be one of those ""worthless cunts"" that lives here. I'm just as socially awkward as the next person, but I don't walk around acting like I'm better than anyone else.    Maybe you should move somewhere else."
Acadiana,39wkqm,StephenFish,2,Mon Jun 15 17:45:11 2015 UTC,I want to get some property down there and retire.
Acadiana,39wkqm,themarknessmonster,5,Mon Jun 15 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"After moving out of Lafayette after living there for 36 years I've come to the conclusion that Lafayette is sooooo incredibly boring.  I kind of knew that already from travels here and there but after actually moving away  I haven't missed it one bit.  I do miss some of my friends and family as one tends to do but the city, nah."
Acadiana,39wkqm,rd8t,3,Mon Jun 15 20:22:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that the people that never leave or miss this place after moving to a real city either have a ""big fish in a little pond"" complex or just can't handle cities.  There's dozens upon dozens of cities that have so much more to offer and they're also not filled to the brim with bigots stuck in a 1950's mindset.  I'll never understand the obsession with this place.    I'm sure I'll be downvoted for not sucking the Lafayette cock, because everyone here is so proud of this place..."
Acadiana,39wkqm,themarknessmonster,2,Mon Jun 15 20:24:22 2015 UTC,I agree with you 100%.  Let people love where they want.  This place(city/culture) can be a bubble sometimes.
Acadiana,39wkqm,rd8t,0,Mon Jun 15 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"I won't argue that there aren't problems and shitty people.  Hell, we bitch about them/mock them pretty regularly.  But, go anywhere else, you will always find shitty people, just a different kind of shit (If you aren't hearing people be dicks about race, it's usually something else like the LGBT community or whatever).    I often wonder how many decades we go before all that stuff is just an embarassing footnote, but to be honest, humanity is just a bunch of dicks and will find something else to direct hate onto."
Acadiana,39wkqm,Sudestbrewer,3,Mon Jun 15 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"And I've visited many places, traveled around the world and throughout North America, and I've seen some terrible and wonderful places.    My chief complaint rests with the knowledge that Lafayette can be so much better a culture than it is, the striving towards mediocrity and desperation to uphold ""small-town livin'"" cultural standards is literally holding this okay-ish city back from being a great city.  As long as this trend continues, Lafayette will always be the city that could, but didn't."
Acadiana,39wkqm,phenobarbidoll89,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:42:57 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem tend to be those who hold onto the outdated views.   Small town livin' is a concept that died in the 60's and 70's.  Replaced by poverty and drug manufacturing and cooking (That war on drugs sure did wonders for small town 'Murica).  Of course, while claiming they hate it, they'll still brag and love on Cocaine Wayne, defend pedophile priests, and grasp to an outdated concept that simply no longer exists.  You can experience growth and change and still keep culture, but always remember that cultures will mix and mutate into something just a bit different.  I'll admit it's important to remember the past, but not at the expense of growing for the future."

Acadiana,39utd8,Acid666,3,Mon Jun 15 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"It sucks that that's the case. I stopped going because I got tired of trekking out to Zephyrs and Lake Charles. If it was here at least 3-4 times a year, I'd build a car for it."
Acadiana,39utd8,xavier6401,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:41:14 2015 UTC,You might be investing yourself too much. Completely building a car isn't necessary to be competitive or to have fun.

We all got different meals and sampled from one another's plate and agreed the only decent thing on the table was my god son's flapjacks.  It cost $40 for just my husband and myself to eat.  Another Broken Egg is fantastic and reasonably priced, but it's incredibly packed on the weekend mornings so get there early."

Acadiana,39tez0,peepea,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:43:04 2015 UTC,The secret to eating a great meal at French Press is to not go on the weekends. I understand that not everyone can brunch it on the weekdays though.

The father of the owners had built it after a French greenhouse from the 18th or 19th century. It's been a few years since I lived in the area, so I'm not sure if they're still in business.

Acadiana,39ddmz,gizibee,4,Thu Jun 11 03:29:16 2015 UTC,/r/outoftheloop will catch you up to speed far better than I could   tl;dr - /r/fatpeoplehate and a few other subs got banned. reddit is throwing a tantrum.
Acadiana,39ddmz,themarknessmonster,5,Thu Jun 11 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, /r/fatpeoplehate is a terrible sub, in name and in community.  Any sub-wide ban they earned they brought on themselves.  They encourage weight-shaming and publicly displaying information of overweight people in hopes that the shame will motivate them into losing weight to fit their narrow scope of the human image.  ...which is a terrible approach to anything.  People don't change because society wants them to, people change because they want to.  I dunno, something about being the son of an alcoholic that recovered nine years before his death kinda gives me the authority to speak on that...butIgotbannedfromthatsubbecauseofthatknowledge."
Acadiana,39ddmz,phynn,2,Thu Jun 11 12:17:19 2015 UTC,"Yet, none of the mods have brought any evidence that the sub actually encouraged/allowed personal information sharing or brigading. Most of it was personal harassment from the users.  The sub was like Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart doesn't encourage you to dress up like trailer trash to go there but for some reason people think it is OK.   If posting a picture or video (sans personal information) of someone in order to shame them is not allowed then a lot of subs will need to be shut down.  Think of all the pictures/videos that are posted that shame politicians, police officers, etc?  BadCopNoDonut?  Banned.  SRS?  Banned.  TumlrInAction?  Banned.  IGTHFT?  Banned."
Acadiana,39ddmz,phynn,4,Thu Jun 11 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"Didn't the mods post pictures of various people that had stood up to the sub and call them fatties? And then when he people from the sub started to attack said people, the mods did nothing?  Sounds like encouraging harassment to me...."
Acadiana,39ddmz,phynn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"If they did, evidence should be provided that showed they violated reddit's rules.  If what FPH did was against the reddit rules then other subreddits should have been banned along with it.  Many subs post videos/pics of people they disagree with and allow commentary on those pics/videos.  If the mods were complacent with users posting personal info and brigading other subs/sites then the sub needed to go.  However, we still haven't seen proof of this from the reddit mods and they have clammed up when asked about it."
Acadiana,39ddmz,vegetaman3113,2,Thu Jun 11 17:48:09 2015 UTC,The evidence was literally the sidebar of fph....
Acadiana,39ddmz,rd8t,-1,Thu Jun 11 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm waiting on evidence to prove the point that the subreddit promoted posting personal information and brigading.  Also, what the site was doing different than other subs like coontown, BadCopNoDonut, SRS, TIA, KIA, IGTHFT and other shaming subs.    Just saying the sidebar said it without posting a screencap or something defeats the whole purpose of ""evidence""."

Acadiana,39ddmz,MonkeyKing_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Just seems like the sub caught flak when people made fun of overweight individuals.  Seems like most of the issues are that people x/posted to FPH and then x/posted thread got bombarded with people from /r/FPH.  I guess the  head mods saw x/post and then tons of harrasment/brigading and decided to shutdown the sub as it was creating an issue.  I'm going to assume the FPH mods knew what was going on but didn't do anything like stop cross-posting.  Same thing happened to /r/PCMasterRace a while back and they banned crossposting for a while.

Acadiana,395nfb,rd8t,9,Tue Jun 9 12:51:10 2015 UTC,I actually got hit by one a couple years ago in Ville Platte of all places.
Acadiana,395nfb,Kat_Hat,3,Tue Jun 9 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"I tend to be mindful of using atm's, gas pumps, etc and usually check by grabbing or pulling on the card slot (this is a regular habit at gas pumps).  I'm curious as to whether or not anyone has ever discovered a card skimmer, been hit by one, and how little local businesses actually do to protect their customers (Banks do have tells they put in place for workers to check visually if it's been modified, but most gas stations in the area do not."
Acadiana,395nfb,Silound,7,Tue Jun 9 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"Never been hit by one myself, but one of the other common things to look for are loitering people.  Skimmers work by either sending a low-power bluetooth signal to a receiving device (aka a phone or tablet) or by attempting to hit the RFID chip in newer cards for a response. Both of those technologies have a very short transmission distance, usually under 25 feet. RFID specifically needs a transmitting antenna, which would have to be large and likely very visible to get a response from 25 feet away.  If you see people just loitering in the parking lot, just avoid that station or go inside and pre-pay at the register."
Acadiana,395nfb,themarknessmonster,3,Tue Jun 9 15:52:30 2015 UTC,This is stellar advice.  Most people don't realize that skimming doesn't even need to involve running a card across a strip anymore.  Most times that's all that's ever reported in the news.
Acadiana,395nfb,Silound,2,Tue Jun 9 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"It's why I purposely refuse cards with RFID type communications, and think little of apple pay and the google version.  you are transmitting credit card data over a form of wireless communication.  That means it won't be long before someone figures out how to pick up and intercept that data either."
Acadiana,395nfb,Silound,0,Tue Jun 9 20:04:59 2015 UTC,"RFID chips in credit cards are a special variety. They are specifically designed to respond to a very highly tuned frequency and signal:noise ratio, which mostly can only be achieved in very close proximity. Any farther away and either there is too much distortion or to much signal:noise and they won't respond.  The goal is that it only works with a reader where you insert the card into the reader."

Acadiana,395ut0,Nothingman84,7,Tue Jun 9 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"I used to be a realtor.  I let my license lapse, though.  I did it full time right after I got my license.  I joined one of the medium sized brokerages in Lafayette.  They did a good job with training and mentoring.  BUT, you only make money when you sell something.  AND you have to invest a lot of time and, more often than not, money to sell.  First off, you have to pay realtor dues.  These are yearly.  I honestly can't remember how much it is, but it is in the hundreds.  Then you have to pay an MLS fee just to be able to use the MLS system.  Then, you have to ""rent"" a electronic key to open houses in order to show them.  If you use your broker's office space you have to pay them to rent a space and pay for office supplies (copies mostly).    It really helps to know A LOT of people when you are a new agent.  If you don't, you need to get to know a few of the more successful agents in your brokerage and help them out to get leads.  Volunteer to work their open houses (which are almost always on Sundays so be prepared to miss a lot of church).  They are usually pretty grateful that they won't have to do it, and you can pick up a few leads if people show up.  Work the call desk at your brokerage.  That's the generic number people call when they see a sign in a yard.  You usually have to sign up to work it for a couple of hours at a time.  Some places won't let new agents work the phones for a while.  I was lucky that my brokerage let new agents start right off answering phones.  That's actually where I made my first sell.  Other than that, it's a lot of pounding the pavement, hitting up your friends and family for leads, and cold calling for sale by owners.  I enjoyed be an agent, but I needed a more steady and dependable income.  You'll find that a lot of agents have rental properties and other interests to supplement their income.  I tried doing it part time, but I just couldn't make it work.    I hope I didn't discourage you.  If you are willing to put in the time and effort real estate can be pretty rewarding.  Not to mention you are kind of your own boss and make your own hours.  That was the best part!  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or want to hear me extrapolate any further!"

While it's totally safe to drink water with a little bit of chlorine, it can definitely taste funky.   When I lived up in Shreveport (the worst place ever), we used a 3M under sink water filter which worked out pretty well and should scrub your water of some of that nasty taste.  We even put one in behind our refrigerator so the ice would taste better.  If you want to shell out the big buck, you can always purchase a reverse osmosis filter . . .

It was due to the excess calcium chloride reacting with the carbon dioxide.

How in the heck does this surprise you?!? I drive 500 miles a week around Lafayette,  most of them with a trailer, people are just STUPID. I think that LA driver's education misses several pertinent pieces of information:  1) It is not appropriate to put on your brakes THEN your turn signal, it should be the other way around! 2) Smiling and waving doesn't make it OK when you pull out in front of someone.  3) Speed limit signs are NOT a suggestion. 4) Slamming on your brakes to go 25 under the red light camera with the ""45"" sign is not necessary  Anyway...end minirant."

I've traveled all over, and Louisiana is the only state I've ever seen this happen in.  It boggles my mind how this is a shared and agreeable traffic negotiation strategy among motorists in Louisiana.  ‚Ä¢  Changing lanes into the left-turn lane while braking.  ‚Ä¢  Getting into the left-turn lane to merge into traffic(which is illegal, but somehow completely ignored in Lafayette, despite the higher risk of collisions than red-light running and speeding combined)  ‚Ä¢  Trailers taking up both lanes going 10-20 miles per hour less than the speed limit.  ‚Ä¢  Corner-cutters on left turn lanes through intersections that end up crossing one or more lanes of intersecting traffic because they don't know how wide their vehicle is or the capability of its turning radius.  ‚Ä¢  Motorists trying to finish up that text before going while the light is green.  ‚Ä¢  Motorists coasting through an intersection from being stopped.  ‚Ä¢  Coming to a complete stop in traffic to turn right off the road into a parking lot.  ‚Ä¢  Coming to a complete stop in residential roads to navigate a speed bump.  ‚Ä¢  Motorists still incapable of remembering that at a four-way STOP, you give right-of-way to the right if you and any other motorists arrived at the same time, and at a four-way YIELD, you yield to the left, which is where traffic will be headed your way from.  ‚Ä¢  Motorists turning right into traffic on higher-speed-limit roads(like Ambassador Caffery and Evangeline Thruway at certain places)getting in traffic and slowly coming up to speed, much in the same way if they were turning right onto a parking lot from the road.

If you're in the right lane, you're in a dangerous spot.  This is one of those occasions where I move into the passing lane for that small stretch, even if I'm not actively passing, because I've had to react quickly to these people not paying attention and it would be only a matter of time before I wouldn't have any options.  Bonus:  Always be prepared for individuals slamming on their brakes for a school bus on the opposite side of a 5-lane road. They don't realize it's no longer required (since like 2 or 3 years now), and if you assume they know and are not at a good distance away, you'll drive up their ass in a hurry.

I've done this on one or two extreme occasions, at knowledge of my own risk, because the two motorists I pursued were both driving like they were drunk.  I remained on scene after each were pulled over by police(one male motorist and one female motorist), and both were given field sobriety tests that they failed almost immediately by tumbling over in a drunken stupor.  It took police roughly fifteen to twenty minutes to get to me each time.

About half a block away there is a side street on the right (as I'm looking at it). There were cars backed up in the left turning lane on my left.

I didn't get a ticket nor did the report indicate I wasn't paying attention.  She has GoAuto insurance. They put me 75% at fault for the accident and will only pay a fraction of the cost to replace my totaled car. Keep in mind I am 0% at fault for this accident.

Well, of course, small town, her family was known, cop did the report, then said ""nobody at fault"", which meant they were responsible for their own repairs.  Well, turned out she used the same insurance agent that I did (note, my dad and uncle used him for a ton of insurance on farm equipment, property, housing, etc), so basically we took the report to him, he looked it over and said ""she's at fault, we'll take care of it"".

What cops do is list whatever vehicle they believe caused the wreck first, so when you look at the report the first vehicle listed on the report is who the police think caused the wreck. She received a in ticket for failure to yield, I received no ticket.   Their insurance doesn't go by the accident report or by what the cop says, because he ""wasn't there to see the wreck"". Which is just fucking absurd."

However, now I know any time I get in a wreck with person with crappy insurance is better call Saul. And also, I'll have a video of how the wreck happened."

I've seen this multiple times at the intersection by Academy/Target.   It annoys me more then motorists making a mistake. It's a willful ""I don't care that my turn is over, I don't want to wait"" that is more infuriating to me than an honest mistake.  But one morning - one glorious morning - an idiot did this in front of a cop who immediately turned on his/her lights and pulled em over."

This the only other time I've ever seen it referenced; for the longest time I thought I had just made it up. Is it even fun? I don't know that I ever had anyone to play it with."
Acadiana,38l81d,bruce656,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"It is a blast to play with four people.  The entire game is cooperative, and everyone plays one Link token.  Each player takes a turn at rolling a black ""move"" die, moves the spaces rolled, then if Link lands on a yellow square in the dungeon, that player flips a corresponding tile.  If the tile is a monster, all players roll an attack die they've been given at the start.  The attack die has three swords and three red faces on each of its six sides.  If the total swords rolled are equal or greater than the number on the monster tile, that monster is defeated.  Players keep score by ""heart"" tokens, starting with three.  If a monster has a heart icon on its tile, any player that rolled a sword when the monster is defeated earns another ""heart"" token from a pile of them, but if a monster is not defeated, all players lose a heart.  Eventually, through this rhetoric, a player will flip over a tile that holds the dungeon's item, allowing Link to move to the next dungeon.  There are six dungeons total.  When the Triforce is found in the last dungeon, that player must roll all four dice, and within two rolls, roll all four swords to keep the Triforce tile and end the game.  At the end, all hearts and item tiles are added up, and the Triforce tile is worth two hearts.  The player with the most hearts at the end wins the game.  SO much fun when you have four people, and it isn't a terribly long game, either.  Setup takes about five minutes, and getting through the game can take up to half an hour."

And on top of that, probably isn't friends with him on Facebook.  So since I'd probably never know his name had I not read the article (hell, I just read it and don't remember it),  and since he's posting it on his own personal profile, this would never been seen by the normal customer.  Seems like our writer is trying to start a witch hunt...  Now for his signs in the restaurant...  The signs in the Broussard location are hardly anything to cause a ruckus over. The food-stamp thing is probably the worst.  And look at the clientele of the Broussard location.... It's almost exclusively oilfield. Money. And lots of it. And white money. I don't know if you've been around many roughnecks, but they tend to share the same racist bigotry that the owner does.  An article like this is only going to have the bigots gathering at Julien's tomorrow or next week praising the owner by giving him record setting lunch takes, buying poboys for the whole office.  Remember the lines for the Chik-fil-a Day free sandwich after the whole anti-gay comments the owner of that chain made....  Every business has a demographic they market and cater to.

Acadiana,38kgm3,ussf1701,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:26:17 2015 UTC,"In September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A has ""ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights."" According to the TCRA, Chick-fil-A officials stated in an internal document that they ""will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation"", although there had never been any accusations of discrimination against the company, only against the company and its foundations' contributions.   Yes but at the end of the day, CFA realized that they were ostracizing their clientele, families. They pulled support, and while standing by their values, the CEO personally said that he'll leave politics to the politicians. Why? Because he has something to lose. In general, when people have nothing to lose, they act out. It's only when consequences arrive do they have an ""oh shit"" moment like Julien's had when they deleted their Facebook and whatnot.   Honestly, their food is in a convenient location where there isn't many other choices in Broussard, which is why they stay in business. They're food is subpar, bland, and not worth the money. That's what began to come to light after they got regional attention, ""well, it's not that good anyway."" I've been in there once and only once because the food was subpar, the service was inattentive (because they have nothing to lose) and as an independent, non-Conservative/GOP, I did notice their propaganda. While it didn't upset me, it did kind of make me uncomfortable and I asked myself, why the fuck would someone ostracize their customers?   Also, you're right about the oilfield type being their bread and butter and that they hold similar views, so maybe their safe with doing this. I feel like if you worked on a professional level in O&G, you might find that it's a very different industry than it was even 10 years ago. That racism and bigotry might be tolerated by some a-hole white trash dudes on a shelf platform, but even roughnecks on the rigfloor are kind people for the most part. They're also super diverse (especially Nabors) and if they're racists, they don't breathe a word about it.

Acadiana,38j8wz,rd8t,2,Thu Jun 4 18:48:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely incorrect.  I know the owner of that home, and she donated more to local charities than just about anyone in town, with the exception of Stuller."
Acadiana,38j8wz,Rinkelstein,-1,Fri Jun 5 02:19:31 2015 UTC,It's fine as long as they start no shit imo.  Just does not seem like it would be an ideal location for a home.
Acadiana,38j8wz,rd8t,2,Fri Jun 5 17:41:12 2015 UTC,There is a lot of potential for that area to do all sorts of things that can bring a lot of attention to Lafayette from tourist.
Acadiana,38j8wz,DeadMomsClub,13,Thu Jun 4 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"Unless it's zydeco, cover bands, or in a foreign language, I don't see it happening. Lafayette is so caught up in ""culture"" sometimes that nothing mainstream has much ground to stand on. I wish this wasn't the case, but it's true."
Acadiana,38j8wz,rd8t,3,Thu Jun 4 18:42:25 2015 UTC,"Sadly, that is kind of true.  The good stuff you have to go to places that most consider grungy.  If only they knew those places were the most fun"
Acadiana,38j8wz,DeadMomsClub,5,Thu Jun 4 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"Well, let's consider this. We have some pretty big opportunities for what OP mentioned however, whoever is commissioning these events is continually booking gigs are either one of two extremes: completely safe (zydeco & cover bands) or obscure stuff that people will say, ""Oh, it's a drum band from South Zimbabwe that plays Disney OSTs,"" so they go.   Frankly, whoever is booking for DTA, Patty In The Park, the Horse Farm's Levitt Pavilion thing, FIL, they pushing very mediocre, safe stuff that will bring numbers. Unless you have a hot girl in your band (Givers, Royal Teeth, etc) and you're mellow, you're not taking a ""public stage"" in Lafayette. Am I wrong? Culture is cool, but Austin did not become what it is by booking Chee Weez and country-western bands. It through everything it had into it and now you have incredible stuff like ACL, SxSW, etc. If you don't support independent music beyond your regulars at DTA, then this will never happen.   I do want to point out that there are other small fests that local musicians put on. Musicians need a participatory audience in order to make the above happen. Some venues do host what we call ""touring bands."" We have German, Japanese, Swedish, etc, touring bands pass through often. You just have to know where too look."
Acadiana,38j8wz,DeadMomsClub,2,Thu Jun 4 19:52:00 2015 UTC,Heh. The girl from Royal Teeth is kinda hot. But they ARE genuinely awesome.

Acadiana,38j8wz,Derezzler,2,Fri Jun 5 22:53:24 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that the person/persons involved with the booking does like to ""play it safe"". There is a lot of culture in this area and I for one enjoy the fact that they like to embrace our culture. . . .I just want more!"
Acadiana,38j8wz,heirplant,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"They're cheap and appeal to a broad audience. Right now they need to establish the park as a place to go and need to keep the money coming in.   Those bands guarantee a crowd of people and a source of income. Unfortunately that's how it will probably be for quite some time until it really gets rolling.   You have to remember. It's not the cities that ""threw everything it had into it"", it was the people. Groups of music lovers that wanted to see something new."
Acadiana,38j8wz,o0jrock0o,2,Thu Jun 4 22:16:56 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. We've been stuck like this for quite sometime however. I'm afraid that they'll just fold and keep it as is, cheap and mediocre, in order to maintain a crowd and revenue. I feel like this is low risk and they'll stay in a stalemate lest someone come in with new ideas."

Acadiana,38j8wz,rd8t,5,Fri Jun 5 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"I think before anything, they need to establish an actual parking area/lot.  Right now, a little rain and you are forced onto adjacent property.  For any kind of festival, that won't work"
Acadiana,38j8wz,RonBurgandy2010,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"That's the truth. If they don't people are going to start parking on the streets in the surrounded neighborhoods, which will just piss off ""those people"" and potentially ruin any future events."
Acadiana,38j8wz,rd8t,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"No kidding. Do you remember when they closed down one lane on Bertrand/Johnston for Better Block (live music, drinks, and to entice people to walk the area and visit businesses there) and r/Acadiana went absolutely batshit.

Acadiana,38j8wz,pele1410,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:27:58 2015 UTC,"yea that would be nice, but they can always use Cajun Field for parking and use public transportation to get back and forth. They do that for other festivals."

Acadiana,38j8wz,Chamrox,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"It's about 105, but minus trees and water, about 75. I personally think it's big enough, especially after the extension to Rotary Point finishes."
Acadiana,38j8wz,Herpin_Around,2,Thu Jun 4 22:00:32 2015 UTC,Do we have the space to host something like JazzFest?
Acadiana,38j8wz,rd8t,6,Thu Jun 4 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly enough, Jazz fest is held on a horse race track... the Horse Farm is probably 2-3 times larger than the space Jazzfest is held."
Acadiana,38j8wz,Blueadder01,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that.  My only experience with music in New Orleans is either at the House of Blues or Voodoo.  I was thinking JazzFest was closer to Voodoo, but apparently not."
Acadiana,38j8wz,Blueadder01,2,Thu Jun 4 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"here is the 2014 lineup announcement for JazzFest so you can see it isnt just voodoo.   Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Eric Clapton, Phish, John Fogerty, Lyle Lovett, Christina Aguilera, Santana, the Avett Brothers, Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend and Charlie Wilson are bound for the 2014 New Orleans Jazz Fest. The roster also includes Robert Plant, Robin Thicke, Trey Songz, the Alabama Shakes, the String Cheese Incident, Public Enemy and Maze featuring Frankie Beverly. The 45th edition of what is officially the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival presented by Shell is April 25-27 and May 1-4 at the Fair Grounds.   It is a great time but if it rains you will not be able to forget that you are in a field typically roamed by horses from smell alone."
Acadiana,38j8wz,DeadMomsClub,2,Thu Jun 4 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"It's a fantastic idea.   So contact some board members of LCP Inc and get permission to use the park and then start fundraising. The cities of New Orleans and Austin do not put on their respective festivals. Groups of people form some sort of business or non-profit and hit the ground looking for donors to put on those events.   You aren't going to get LCP Inc to put on a big event even remotely similar to ACL, Voodoo, and Jazzfest now or in the near future. Their concern is going to be with keeping the coffers full of money to continue to maintain and operate the existing park. That's where their fundraising efforts are going. They may assist you in the future, but as of now I don't see it really happening.   So gather up your forces and start fundraising. Looks like you have some gung ho people here already. Just look at Voodoo fest. Started out as a one day event in the stadium at City Park with mostly local bands and a few lucky gets of some popular bands. Now look at what Rehage turned it into."

Acadiana,38fy9h,CatsSitOnEverything,10,Wed Jun 3 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"I found it to be good solid Indian food, and the atmosphere was nice, too - not dressed up but not ""sandals and shorts"" - and it was fairly quiet for being busy. They have a tapas menu some days, if they're still doing that. The lassi was great, too, and they have salt lassi if you're looking for authentic (or they did last time I went).  Some caveats? Bay Leaf over in Baton Rouge trumps Masala in every direction (price, food, and atmosphere wise) except for being in BR. Also, if you have a lot of friends / colleagues from that region, you might find it slightly overpriced, but that's normal when there's an ""only game in town"" situation like they have going on. All that said, there plenty of worse choices you could make in Lafayette, and I found Masala to be a good choice."
Acadiana,38fy9h,InThrowMotion,5,Wed Jun 3 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks so mucj. Being that it was the only Indian place in town I didn't know if it would be a good choice, but we'll give it a try then if we like it maybe we'll take the drive up to Baton Rouge one of these days. :)"
Acadiana,38fy9h,StephenFish,2,Wed Jun 3 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"Many of the dishes can be split, especially if you start with an appetizer.  The leftovers reheat pretty well, though.  The tandoori grill may sound appetizing, but it's a little boring if you're looking for something new and/or adventurous.  The korma is delicious if you're not vegetarian.  The Samosa Tikki Chaat is probably the best appetizer there."
Acadiana,38fy9h,StephenFish,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"I checked out the menu and was actually really curious about the korma. We'll be heading there either tomorrow or sunday.

If you find yourself in a grocery store before the restaurant, sniff some tandoori or garam masala.  If you like the smell, you'll like the food."

Acadiana,38fy9h,Clumsybritt,2,Fri Jun 5 13:14:59 2015 UTC,"as I understand it, it is Northern Indian food, and much like yankee cooking, it lacks a lot of the spice and flavor of southern indian cuisine.

NEVER... have I known anyone who ate stuff like this guy.  The only thing that ever phased him was a concentrated habajero oil.  The directions said to spice five gallons of soup with a tea spoon.  He swallowed a teaspoon of it directly just to see what it would do.    Bad things is the answer.    But he just suffered for eight hours or so and was fine.

Definitely manageable to take 2 classes while working full time, but you do have to be accountable and take initiative in your schoolwork. This isn't undergrad. Your professors and classmates have higher expectations of you. There is a fairly decent amount of group work in most classes- which is good because, let's face it, you'll have to work with others, collaborate, receive criticism, hear other people's opinions, in nearly every industry.   The program also gives you a good number of options for the electives. While they may not have a specific elective that you absolutely love, the information and concepts in those electives are going to pay off in the long run.   The professors are excellent and overall have a wide range of personalities that make class pretty interesting. They are experts in their specific fields and absolutely know what they are talking about. ALSO! There is the option to Study Abroad in Costa Rica for your IBUS 540 class. I highly recommend it. I did and it was hands down the best experience of my life.  The director/Associate Dean, Dr. Viguerie is always willing to meet with students. He appreciates hearing both the good and the bad so that he can continue to improve the program in whatever way he can. If you have any questions at all, Dr. Viguerie is definitely willing to discuss any of your concerns and answer your questions."

For me, it's more like trying to make sense of someone with an extremely thick accent, like a Scottish brogue.   My parents and grandparents and I all speak/spoke Cajun French.  We've worked as translators and tour guides, including being employed by the military in Korea AS a translator, with no formal French schooling.  You can recognize where someone is from or where they learned French by their accent (Canadians sound more Cajuns than Parisians, for example). And sometimes it's a pain to catch what they're saying because there's some linguistic drift and loan words creep into regional dialects (which happens with Africans and Cajun French), but Cajun French is ""real"" French."

I have been under a rock for so long since having kids that I didn't realize that there were so many options for what I thought was an odd array of musical tastes I had developed.  I have always been into punk/ska, grunge and hard rock.  But as I have gotten older I have really started to enjoy more bluegrass, classic country, folk style music.  I was oblivious to the fact that there were so many options that combined all of my favorites! I thought when I stumbled upon ""Trilogy"" doing the Pulp Fiction Theme, and the Steven N Seagulls rendition of Thunderstruck that it was just a goof.

Acadiana,377vtc,Longsocksandsexalots,7,Mon May 25 19:34:00 2015 UTC,I've been skating at the new Park ever since it was built. I can promise you that it has the smoothest concrete in Abbeville..  Soooooo.
Acadiana,377vtc,pvk8336,10,Mon May 25 22:42:03 2015 UTC,It was passed in the historic district where many homes and buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. It was passed to discourage skateboarding in that one particular area. I don't understand why you're singling out Abbeville specifically in this example. Many other towns have laws more restrictive than that.
Acadiana,377vtc,redditor1983,7,Mon May 25 17:16:08 2015 UTC,"I spent the majority of my teens and early 20's skateboarding, freestyle BMX riding, and inline skating.  Skaters are generally awful for the community.  Almost all of them (including me at the time) are consumed with a sense of entitlement to skate anywhere they wish, and do anything they want, usually damaging private property in the process.  So I don't blame a community for restricting it. That being said, obviously the best solution is to fund a local skate park in conjunction with the laws.  I know some of you will point to examples of the cool, responsible skater dad that takes his kids to the skatepark on the weekends for family bonding. Guys... that is a very, very, very small minority of the skating population."
Acadiana,377vtc,pvk8336,6,Mon May 25 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to generalize skateboarders myself as I don't know enough of them, but the city did make an effort to build a public skate park and every time I pass, there's plenty of people hanging out and playing there. This law is more symbolic than anything. I see people skating downtown all the time."
Acadiana,377vtc,bagofboards,1 point,Mon May 25 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"been on this stupid toy for 46 years now....skating is hell on ledges, curbs, benches, handrails, and just about anything else we can think of skating. Street skating is essentially re-purposing the environment around you into something other than what it was intended to be, whether it's draining and skating a pool (which I've done more than a few times), hitting a nice roll up to ledge, or pole jamming that bent ass pole next to the slab.  It's nice to have a park, but honestly, most street guys would rather skate the street then deal with the constant bullshit in most parks, i.e. little ones who are completely clueless, scooter-trash, parents that obliviously walk through the line/street course, and on and on....the manufactured setting of most parks is usually not all that great. Restrict it all you want, it will still get hit.   There aren't very many 'skate dads' (makes me cringe so hard) around. My kids skate since they've been wee ones, and two out of the three are now solid rippers, pool+park+bowl+street, and admittedly, that may seem like a small fraternity down here (it is) but that is due to the fact that there really haven't been that many skaters that actually stay in it for life down here.   And dirty pirate, you don't get to be old as I am and still kill a pool without padding up. I've got nothing to prove to anyone, so when I feel like going balls out, I'll pad up, since I don't want to completely destroy my knees/elbows/wrists/braincase.   Locally, the crew has never really been about skate and destroy, or vandalism at all. It has been about skating and having fun.   Abbeville needs to actully police their park though. Love to skate it (phase two is already to start, as soon as bayou vista is done), but they have to reign in the kids there that use it as a playground. The parents (used loosely) don't parent at all, the kids don't skate, and they are in the way. I'm polite once, firm the second time, third time, meh, i'll crush your snowflake, cause I won't get hurt due to your inability to actually parent your child.  'You didn't quit skating 'cause you got old, you got old cause you quit skating' the original virus j.a."

There's a difference between the Skate and DIY camp and the Skate and Destroy camp, it was always the vandals the made our crews look bad when in reality we were the ones keeping the ditches and drains clear of leaves and debris.    the best solution is to fund a local skate park   or BMX parks, them pegs do massive damage and it's always the skaters that get blamed.

Well I was one, so I think that does lend me at least some authority. Although I obviously concede that I can't comment on every skater in every city...   There's a difference between the Skate and DIY camp and the Skate and Destroy camp, it was always the vandals the made our crews look bad when in reality we were the ones keeping the ditches and drains clear of leaves and debris.   Based on my own personal experience, I would say its around 5% ""Skate and DIY"" and 95% ""Skate and Destroy.""   To be perfectly honest, I never really met any of these ""Skate and DIY"" people you're referring to, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming some exist. Basically every skater I knew growing up was an asshole looking to break stuff.  That's the blunt truth based on my own experience. I hate to say that, but it's true.   Absent dads seems to be a regional thing...   I was actually just using ""skater dads"" as an example of a more responsible crowd. It doesn't have to be about ""dads"" specifically though.  Look I know I made a controversial post that makes some allegations. But in all honesty, I didn't intend to start an argument.   I sincerely hope that I don't come off as a troll, because that was not my intention. I know that not all skaters match my experience, but a very large part of the population do and I don't think its productive to ignore that.  EDIT: I thought I might add that my experience in the skate community was in Louisiana, but not Lafayette or Abbeville. It was in North Louisiana, when I was younger. So, to be fair, I don't know anything about skaters in Acadiana specifically."

Most people buy cars with 5 & 6 year notes, so anything decent and well priced within that time frame will be scarce because people are still busy paying them off."
Acadiana,36mxfp,Silound,2,Wed May 20 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"This is very good advice. I don't know much about buying cars, so everything helps"
Acadiana,36mxfp,cajunbander,5,Wed May 20 16:08:33 2015 UTC,"Don't be so quick to discount dealers. They make money by selling cars, they make money from people leaving with a good experience.   Individual sellers are just trying to offload one car. If they lie to sell a car it's not like they need good reviews to sell more cars.   Most dealerships have an online inventory that you can look at. Most dealerships will pull a Carfax on a vehicle you're interested in.   I just went through this, some asshole pulled out in front of me on Cameron and totaled my car. (I was driving straight and she pulled across from a parking lot to go to a side street across Cameron. I swerved but couldn't avoid hitting her. Now her two-bit insurance company is putting me 75% at fault because I was driving straight, driving the speed limit, and paying attention to the road. Fuck you GoAuto, you'll be hearing from my lawyer.)  Anyway, I had been looking for about a month for a replacement vehicle. I looked at a couple private sellers but they weren't entirely truthful when I pulled the Carfax. I finally found a truck that was perfect for my price range, in perfect condition, dealer pulled the Carfax and it was clean. The dealer let my buddy, a mechanic, check out everything, he even plugged his computer into the truck to find any codes. We talked the dealer down on the price to one we both agreed on.   My advice is to do your research, go on NADA and find the value of any car you're looking at to see if you're getting a fair deal. If you have a mechanic friend bring him along, if not, most dealers and honest people will let you being the vehicle to an unbiased mechanic. And just because you look at a vehicle doesn't mean you have to buy it.   If anyone's interested, I bought my truck from Rabeaux's on Johnston past the mall. Had a great experience. I had also looked at Ray Chevy and while I didn't buy from them they treated us well. I've also heard good things about Sterling Auto.   Oh, and cash talks. If you're willing to pay outright in either a check or cash, most people/dealers are willing to come down a little bit more on the price."
Acadiana,36mxfp,rd8t,2,Wed May 20 17:05:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I think I'll go check out Rabeaux's today. Do you know of any other good dealers around? I know there's a lot. I'm relatively new to the area
Acadiana,36mxfp,underthecheese,1 point,Wed May 20 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"I think there is a Kelly Bluebook app as well.  get it.  Remember, salesmen/women are going to try and get the best deal for the dealership and their commission.  Whatever you look at, look up the value, and of course, try to get below that.    If you get the almost cocky and arrogant salesman, don't let him win.  The best way to hurt him/her, is to get up and walk off.  Some of them will almost beg to get you to come back, and if that happens, you can eitehr say fuck em, or you go in and drive the price down."

Acadiana,36mxfp,Ezziboo,5,Wed May 20 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is go onto something like car trader, yahoo auto, etc, enter in what you are looking for.  most dealers do share on these sites what they have in stock.  Expand your of price to say 10k max.  No price is set in stone, it's all negotiable, and if they say otherwise, just walk away.   Cost effective from buying from individuals are hit/miss.  Sometimes yes, but you really do not know what some people do to vehicles, or what they aren't telling you (and me, if I sell something outright, I always make sure it's stated in bill of sale ""as is"").  Dealers may have other insentives to offer (might be minor like a free oilchange or two or something like that)"
Acadiana,36mxfp,Clumsybritt,4,Wed May 20 16:04:43 2015 UTC,This is great advice. I guess I need to give dealerships more of a chance

You can usually get a better deal buying from a private party, but a dealer can offer some benefits by doing the transaction, giving tax credit if you have a trade-in, and finding financing if you need it.   If you do a private party deal, make sure you have a notary lined up at a bank or credit union to do the paperwork and make sure the seller has the title in hand, or can get it in short order.   You don't want to buy a car and then find out weeks later that the title is being held by a bank and the seller didn't pay off their loan with the money you gave them for the car."

We have found the t mobile service to be better than what I had with Sprint, but not nearly as good as the AT&T service. It is very rare for me to have dead spots.

Acadiana,35rcqn,cawkstrangla,3,Tue May 12 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't be of much assistance here.   For a place to live, I'd look around the Saint Streets or Freetown area if you want to live close to downtown and UL campus.  Girard Park on UL campus along with most parks in the city have running tracks, however, I'd certainly advise you to check out Acadiana Park. Here you'll find miles of nature trails, several miles of trails for mountain bikes along with a few soccer fields and two 18 hole disc golf courses if you're into that.  As far as food, you could eat out everyday for a year and not eat the same place twice, though south Louisiana isn't exactly known for healthy food. Definitely get yourself some plate lunches from places like Gary's, Creole Lunch House, T-Coon's, Laura's II, etc. Grab a poboy from Olde Tyme Grocery for sure. It's also still crawfish season so be sure to get you some before the season ends. Get you some gumbo for sure. We have a lot of great meat markets in the area so you can try boudin, cracklins, etc. There are just too many great restaurants to mention.    Even though Festival International just ended, there are entirely too many free music and food festivals in the area so be sure to take advantage of that on weekends to hear great live music and eat amazing food. In the Fall, you'll be able to go tailgating for UL football games out at Cajun Field. Definitely a lot of information but you can always PM me if you have any other questions."

Look outside of town a little: Scott, Carencro, Rayne, even Sunset, Grand Coteau or Opelousas. I would even say Youngsville/Broussard, but I think it would be just as hard to find something around $800 there.  As far as the food? Forget healthy!

As others have said, Saint streets which is the area close to the university anything north or the university is getting a little chancy but there are good areas tucked away in there too. The problem with finding rental houses is they are rarely listed online so you have to drive around or know someone to find a lot of these places though the quick quarter does sometimes have ok listings."

No crime, everyone knows each other, kids play in the yard still. I highly recommend it! But for $800 you may be able to get a 1000 sq ft apartment in a duplex or 4 plex. I have not seen a house rent for that since about 2005. I made on offer on the house next door, 1350 sq ft., 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 1 car garage, I will  probably rent it for $2000 if they accept. The previous owner was getting $1850  BTW, just as people mentioned, you have to jump on a house in the Saint Streets right away, whether it is for sale or rent. The one next door was put up for sale today and I made offer... that is pretty typical"

After that, I was pretty much checked out and no longer took comfort in the cliches that get thrown around to make excuses for when bad shit happens."

Interesting speculation. Personally my lack of belief isn't because my parents' sales pitch didn't go as planned. My lack of belief is because I can recognize snake oil when I see it.   Additional thoughts edit: I think that statement is a bit undermining of practicing Christians. Their fair is their own personal, spiritual belief. The lack of belief of another is not their failure."

Acadiana,35rji5,Hormisdas,1 point,Wed May 13 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Nothing against you, really, but the point of Mass isn't really to be entertaining or engaging. Mass is important for Catholics because it contains in it the most important element of our faith: the Eucharist, in which Christ is truly, physically present before us all. Not only that, we are allowed take part in the living presentation Christ established two thousand years ago.  Now, what this has to do with Acadiana, I really don't know.

Acadiana,35f4dz,Chamrox,3,Mon May 11 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of factors. The amount of business they do definitely exposes the other problems.    the fact that the building is so close to the road the location of the entrance the fact that once the drive-thru lanes are full, it also blocks off entry into their parking lot   I certainly can't fault them for their popularity, and I don't think it's a problem that they should normally be held accountable for. But if they aren't responsible for customers dangling their trunks into a busy street, who is? If it's the LPD's problem, why isn't someone there when they know this will be an issue?  It's just super frustrating that everyone knows this is a problem, with a relatively easy solution (ie. one person to tell whoever is blocking the road to ""move along, sir"".) and yet it continues to happen on an almost daily basis."
Acadiana,35f4dz,Merlin8000,3,Mon May 11 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"But if they aren't responsible for customers dangling their trunks into a busy street, who is?

Acadiana,35f4dz,rd8t,2,Mon May 11 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"It is a really frustrating problem, I agree.  I deal with it every day, except, passing the Cains on West Congress.  Damn, even sometimes the Taco Bell next door has cars spilling out into the street.  Cains has done what they can, it seems, by restricting Left turns. Yet, it still creates a crazy back up in traffic.  And Chic-fil-a did put in the second lane, which has helped. (Despite people disregarding it)  A solution may be to have another street connecting Kaliste Saloom to johnston/westcongress that is strictly for moving traffic across town.  Less overall traffic on that street would probably at least help with some of the congestion so that by they time you go to Chic-fil-a you could easily go around the idiots waiting in the street."

Also, since corporate owns the location, the operator can never sell the business, since it's not their business, they basically rented it from Chic-Fil-A while it was under their operation.

Acadiana,35cany,Phnglui,1 point,Sat May 9 03:38:11 2015 UTC,Catholicism clings strongly to doctrine and tradition. The other end of the spectrum might be more loose in those areas and more focused on community and personal growth.
Acadiana,35cany,Rhineaux,3,Sat May 9 04:09:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know... I tend to find that Protestant churches are more likely to treat you like sheep than Catholic churches.  Catholic churches are definitely more rigid in the dogma, but because there's a unified interpretation, they actually can spend more time tending to the needs of their parish.  Protestants on the other hand have to spend sermons trying to convince their congregation that they're right, and tend to err more on the side of spoonfeeding than personal growth.  That's just my experience though."

Acadiana,351toq,Phnglui,9,Wed May 6 13:07:36 2015 UTC,"okay, fine. it endorses the judeo-christian god.   alternatively putting ""in the teachings of gautama siddhartha we trust"" doesn't establish a specific religious affiliation as there are many buddhist faiths. but doing so does endorse one belief system over the others."
Acadiana,351toq,rapcat,1 point,Wed May 6 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Islam is not a judeo-christian religion and they believe in a God.    Sikhism is not a judeo-christian religion and they believe in a God.

Acadiana,351toq,gizibee,4,Thu May 7 07:36:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm going to nitpick some more.  They all believe in the same Abrahamic God but not the same Judeo-Christian God even though I think they are the same.    To further nitpick, Christians don't believe in the same God as in the other 2 religions.  Christians believe that Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit are all one being.  Judaism and Islam reject that idea due to their beliefs that Jesus was not God.  Judaism and Islam both believe that God has no image but Christians believe that God can take human form.  Judaism and Islam have more in common with the idea of God than they both do with Christianity."

I think someone needs to see if LCG would post a ""Good Without God"" plaque on their government building.  More than likely they would deny it.  That would frame the argument now that they are actively excluding those who do not believe and would be ripe for a lawsuit."

Acadiana,34jesw,cajunation,7,Fri May 1 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"Because all Acadiana needs is more drunk tboys on the roads and levee rat housewives doing tequila shots on a Monday night, then getting behind the wheel. True story, drunk driver nearly killed me last year and I'm pretty much over the whole laissez-faire attitude towards irresponsible alcohol consumption here."
Acadiana,34jesw,ZydecoSucks,11,Fri May 1 21:04:50 2015 UTC,"I just think attacking Go cups is a weak argument to curb drunk driving.  Better public transportation and an attitude shift need to happen.  Usually if I see someone get stopped at the door with a beer, it's chug time instead of throwing it."
Acadiana,34jesw,rapcat,4,Fri May 1 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"Go cups are a small part of a much bigger problem this area has with excessive, irresponsible drinking."
Acadiana,34jesw,ZydecoSucks,2,Fri May 1 21:36:37 2015 UTC,The allowance of go cups won't change drunk driving. If someone is going to drive drunk they'll either finish pounding their drink at the bar or take it with them. You might as well not punish the non-drunk drivers by allowing them to finish a beer they just paid $7 for while they walk home or wait for a cab outside.
Acadiana,34jesw,JustHereForTheParty,3,Fri May 1 22:05:11 2015 UTC,I seriously doubt most people around here pay $7 for a beer. Maybe for a 6 pack.
Acadiana,34jesw,ZydecoSucks,-1,Fri May 1 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with this at all, especially with our acceptance of drunk driving as a community. I wouldn't be against forcing every car on the road to have one of those breathalyzers built in.   But I seriously doubt having go cups available as an option makes people drink more, though I guess it's hard to argue against the point that it does foster drinking and driving, though not nearly as much as drive-thru daiquiri stands I'd bet!"
Acadiana,34jesw,rd8t,15,Fri May 1 21:18:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for not saying Geaux Cups

They're part of the fabric of what makes our community unique, providing an experience that you can only get in a few other locations in the country. Also, based on my anecdotal experience, I don't think banning go cups has had any significant impact on getting rid of trash, bums, or violence. So let's bring them back!"
Acadiana,34jesw,InThrowMotion,1 point,Fri May 1 20:09:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd say it's a cornerstone for our cultural identity. It does make us unique I suppose, along with drive-thru daiquiri shops. Sure, I get it, but how do you make the city buy it? What benefits of it would one actually take to bat with them to get the city's approval?  If you addressed the issue with the trash, there could be more receptacles put up and then run a campaign adjacent to it to get people to toss their cups appropriately. There's also the issue with people just hanging out, drinking in the street and sidewalks. There's definitely some questions that would potentially have to be addressed about some things."
Acadiana,34jesw,InThrowMotion,1 point,Fri May 1 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"New Orleans handles the trash by (except in certain parts of town, i.e. Bourbon) requiring vendors to hand out printed cups.  This means they are also responsible for maintaining the area outside their establishment - keeping up with trash.  It keeps the neighbors happy and the tourists happy."
Acadiana,34jesw,rapcat,0,Mon May 4 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess ""cornerstone of our cultural identity"" might've been a bit strong, but I meant it more as go cups being emblematic of the fact that the rules are different in Cajun Country, and that's part of why I love it as it feels like we're living in a foreign country while still being on US soil."
Acadiana,34jesw,rapcat,2,Fri May 1 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"I moved down here about a year and a half ago and have yet to notice that ""Go Cups"" weren't allowed. I've gotten go cups downtown from bars and restaurants on multiple occasions. Is this one of those laws that is rarely enforced or am I just a lucky lawbreaker?"
Acadiana,34jesw,InThrowMotion,3,Fri May 1 20:26:17 2015 UTC,You can get go cups on special occasions like when a festival is going on downtown or things like DTA.
Acadiana,34jesw,rapcat,3,Fri May 1 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"I figured special occasions were allowed, but I've gotten them on random happy hour stops/non special occasion dates w no issues in the past. I'm not complaining - I just didn't realize this was a law."
Acadiana,34jesw,rd8t,2,Fri May 1 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, they made a bunch of exemptions when they banned them, so most of the times you might be downtown with a lot of people, they're still legal, it's just illegal during all of the non-event times, though even then it wouldn't surprise me if you could still get one more often than not, you'll just risk getting a ticket if you do so."
Acadiana,34jesw,InThrowMotion,1 point,Fri May 1 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"Same as a lot of the DUI laws, basically."
Acadiana,34jesw,rd8t,2,Fri May 1 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"Because we need more drunk people on the fucking roads, amirite?"
Acadiana,34jesw,InThrowMotion,9,Fri May 1 20:23:08 2015 UTC,So are you saying banning Go cups actually decreased the number of drunk drivers in Lafayette?
Acadiana,34jesw,rd8t,2,Fri May 1 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"Would actually be interesting to see if there's any research on this that could be pulled together, because if banning go cups did reduce drunk driving, then I may have to rethink my pro-go cup position."
Acadiana,34jesw,InThrowMotion,3,Fri May 1 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"I would say yes but statistically insignificant.  My experience is that people try to leave with said drink and get stopped, they will chug it. If they are going to be responsible drinkers, Go cups aren't going to make a difference.  Just my opinion."
Acadiana,34jesw,rd8t,1 point,Fri May 1 21:35:34 2015 UTC,I'm saying we shouldn't make it so easy.

Acadiana,34d74c,flashblazer,10,Thu Apr 30 05:06:16 2015 UTC,"I, as a guy, wouldn't violate a woman in a harrassing way, but I honestly kind of agree with what the guy in the article says, when he put it ""‚Äòwell, if you present yourself as really sexual, then I‚Äôm going to perceive you as that, and that‚Äôs how you are.‚Äô""    Im sorry, but if im at the beach, and you're wearing a bikini that has barely any fabric that practically shows all of your lady bits, I'm going to look at you in a sexual way. Would I ever act upon it and do something illegal or immoral? No, but I can't guarantee that some other douchebag won't."
Acadiana,34d74c,rd8t,7,Thu Apr 30 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"It's that interesting balance of having the freedom to dress and present yourself how you want, and hope/expect that people have the maturity to understand that another person is't property to do with as they wish.    Don't get me wrong, I like the female form, and have been caught looking at a nice ass or some well displayed cleavage (usually by my wife).  Even that may be a little rude of me, but it's on display and it catches my eye.  But in no way does that justify anyone grabbing, touching, or saying anything.  I have gone into full apology mode when accidently brushing my hand against some womans breast, or really, any part of their body.  And most just brush it off with an ""it's cool"" or ""don't worry"" (crowded places, it happens. no ones at fault, but I do have my own thing about personal space).    But naturally there are these douche nuggets who think they are gawds gift to women and have this dick head entitlement to a ""piece of ass"".  Ranging from catcalling to bad pickup lines to calling someone a cunt if they turn them down (I've seen this years ago with a friend).    As far as rape, that's fucking horrible and sick, and I really think anyone who says a person asks for it by the way they dress or act deserves a punch in the face.  I think how one is dressed or presented has little to do as much as it does the mental instability of the of anyone who commits the violation, and how in their mind they view the person, where showing a ton of skin or if they were wearing the clothes that amish people where.  Ok, rant over, but I do agree with the base statement, if you wear certain things, people are going to view you sexually, but it doens't give the right to catcall, insult, or anything beyond that.  Show some respect to people and realize their choices are their choices.   And if you have issues with it, fuck off."
Acadiana,34d74c,MonkeyKing_,5,Thu Apr 30 13:31:41 2015 UTC,"That's where the line is drawn between productive feminists and radical feminists.   Rape is wrong, even if the girl is completely naked in public, she's never ""asking for it"". But if you're dressing to show it, I'm not oppressing by looking. I mean put the shoe on the other foot: At what point is a woman oppressing a man by checking him out?   Mouth breathers."
Acadiana,34d74c,rd8t,6,Thu Apr 30 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"I also kind of thing the same could be said for those who go around telling women to dress modestly or whatever.

You do realize that male rape is not taken seriously in this country?  Almost 40-50% of all sexual violence and rape were against men.  That's a real threat.    Quoting the slate article below:  ""Data hasn‚Äôt been calculated under the new FBI definition yet, but Stemple parses several other national surveys in her new paper, ‚ÄúThe Sexual Victimization of Men in America: New Data Challenge Old Assumptions,‚Äù co-written with Ilan Meyer and published in the April 17 edition of the American Journal of Public Health. One of those surveys is the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, for which the Centers for Disease Control invented a category of sexual violence called ‚Äúbeing made to penetrate.‚Äù This definition includes victims who were forced to penetrate someone else with their own body parts, either by physical force or coercion, or when the victim was drunk or high or otherwise unable to consent. When those cases were taken into account, the rates of nonconsensual sexual contact basically equalized, with 1.270 million women and 1.267 million men claiming to be victims of sexual violence.""  http://www.svfreenyc.org/survivors_factsheet_38.html  http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/04/male_rape_in_america_a_new_study_reveals_that_men_are_sexually_assaulted.html"

Acadiana,34d74c,spasm01,4,Fri May 1 13:15:59 2015 UTC,"yay! to the guys that don't get it...  try to look at it this way. You have no idea what the woman's intentions were when putting on a piece of clothing.  You don't know her and you don't know what she's out to achieve, if anything.  Perhaps the shirt just doesn't fit right, and her cleavage shows, perhaps she just likes the way a dress hugs her waist.  Does any of that involve you?  Nope...  Women understand that you find them sexy.  We find men sexy all the time, we just don't go out of our way to make them feel uber uncomfortable about it.  mmmm a pair of tight fitting pants or a nice shirt over a man's strong shoulders... but then... I'm not going to assume he wore those pants or that shirt because he wants me to slap his ass.  (despite how much I may want to)    And don't say something stupid like ""I would love for a woman to slap my ass in public.""  Because what if she wasn't a pretty woman, but a creepy weird woman, or a not a woman, or a polar bear.    Lastly, if the woman is onstage literally asking for it (as I sometimes am)... like with her words ""holler at me and throw me money"" then yes... that would be an appropriate response.  She's made her intentions clear.  But even then, there is a line that shouldn't be crossed.  Yell and throw money..but don't fucking touch."

Most people will tell you it's pretty damned great (I think).  Electric and water are paid to the same utility as the internet, LUS.  As I recall, LUS' rates for everything are pretty reasonable.  The other option for internet is Cox, which is expensive, and as LUS fiber is still new, you might be stuck with Cox.  Where are you moving from?  My best advice, especially when you don't have a ton of stuff, is to hire movers of the variety that will just move your already-boxed-up stuff from your house to your U-haul (and vice versa).  To me that's the hardest part of the job, and getting someone else to do it is about $200-$300 and worth every penny."

We have Cox internet, and it's actually the best service around here so we would just transfer our account.  If what you say is true about just hiring u-haul to load-move-unload for $300, then I think we may have made our decision.   We've been bouncing back and forth between the ides of selling everything and just driving a carload full of our stuff, then buying stuff again over time.    This is great information.

Acadiana,34ardj,adapter9,5,Wed Apr 29 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"It just caught on fire man. Like I said, I went inside and I came out to smoke and opened the door and WOOSH flames. Piece of shit wasn't even running"
Acadiana,34ardj,StannisBaratheon_AMA,3,Wed Apr 29 19:54:03 2015 UTC,"Oh crap, I'm a smoker and my first thought was ""I hope it wasn't a not-snuffed-all-the-way cigarette that caught it on fire""... Which, with the new law against throwing cigarette butts out the window, creates a need for a vessel to deposit them into and anyone who smokes knows an overfull ashtray can catch fire pretty easily. Do you think the manufacturer or your insurance will try to say that's what happened? That you were irresponsible/negligent and caused the fire? Or is it provable that you weren't at fault? I'm so sorry this happened to you."
Acadiana,34ardj,CajunShock,7,Wed Apr 29 21:36:57 2015 UTC,"Fortunately it's going to be fully covered by my insurance, and what my insurance doesn't pay my gap coverage will make up for. Unfortunately I owed more than the car is worth so I won't be getting any money back, on the bright side I still have a motorcycle so I'm not totally transportation-less. Hopefully I'll be on four wheels again in the next month or so.   There's no fault on my part, it was a total fucking fluke. like I said random electrical fire. I have been noticing the past week or two that my battery had been dying and I've been needing to get jump started a lot lately so the fire department suspects it was a problem with the battery charging system and it just shorted out finally.

The cabin was completely smoked out so I couldn't see inside, I felt the glass to make sure that it was not hot and to also make sure that I didn't cause a flash-over. It was cool so I carefully open the door and there was a bunch of fire under the dash board and the rest is history.. Fire Department seems to think it was an electrical fire."

That immediately tells me that he ties emotion to his decisions, as he obviously has the ""I ain't dialin' 1 for English!"" elitist 'Murican attitude. Dude. Our own language, the Cajun French language, was squashed by bigots that were assholes to Acadians that were exiled from Nova Scotia. He's none removed from a typical ignorant politician.

I don't know who the property belongs too, but it'd be a great place to set up camp and it has a decent area to swim and fish.

Acadiana,34b7l4,jefuchs,5,Wed Apr 29 19:32:53 2015 UTC,Serious question. Why is Ford not a good truck? And how does it compare to what you consider the best pickups?
Acadiana,34b7l4,Silound,4,Wed Apr 29 21:35:48 2015 UTC,"I was a loyal Toyota customer for years.  About 12 years ago I needed a bigger truck (not so much bigger, but more towing capacity) and a nearly-new Ford Ranger was on the market for a good price, so I bought it.  In 12 years it has not given me a bit of trouble.  It's been far better than any Toyota I've owned.  Still looks new, too.  Can't address the F-150.  Never owned one."
Acadiana,34b7l4,SweetperterderFries,5,Thu Apr 30 00:36:41 2015 UTC,"Fords are no better or worse than any other brand of full-sized pickups out there. Each brand has its own challenges with each model series that define performance and reliability, and you cannot really judge a brand/model based on small samples of data.  Almost all trucks, when comparably equipped, are within the same general performance envelope for the class of vehicle. Automakers are not about to allow one vehicle to hold an indisputable lead over other comparably equipped vehicles in the class, because that's bad for business.  Similarly, if they are well cared for, most trucks will last to a half million miles on the odometer. Yes, there will probably be some mechanical failures along the way; it's only natural and part of the cost of ownership, and all vehicles should and will have them.  The only area where I would really state preference of brand is important are the interior options/features, which is increasingly where today's vehicles are being purchased from."
Acadiana,34b7l4,Rhineaux,-7,Wed Apr 29 22:02:33 2015 UTC,"Very well said, but remember that in this town, they're also being driven as the Bro Truck Of Choice and as some sort of status symbol/sexual signaling device. Always with the deer/duck decals, and NEVER with anything in the back. The truck is strongly matched to a negative stereotype. That's aside from my own horrible experiences with Ford products.  Regardless, ANYTHING beats an Escalade or a Hummer. That's a whole different order of stupidity."

Sure, but I've seen just as many poor drivers in other vehicles. Compared to Chevy and dodge, they are three great vehicles that stand even, really. Each with different advantages.  The root of the issue is the vocal minority of r/acadianians who dislike redneck culture and feel the f-150 is the symbol of redneckhood (sidebar: i would argue in Lafayette it would be Chevy). It's an inaccurate correlation, but hey, that's just your opinion,man.   Tl;dr ford is good. R/acadiana is occasionally misguidedly jaded."
Acadiana,34b7l4,budapest_candygram,0,Thu Apr 30 01:01:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of people shifted to ford after the bailouts even though Ford execs were right there with the guys from GM and Chrysler campaigning for them (while Ford was not in the same situation, had either of those gone down, their network of dealers and such would have collapsed which in turn would have seriously damaged ford and put them in a similar situation.  And Ford was in not in a great place during that time to even consider a buyout.    Now, to be honest, I've always been a chevy guy (Owned 4, 3 trucks and a cross over, have had really good experiences with them) and now I went with another chevy because that was the best deal I could get and stay with in my self set requirements.  But for years I didn't consider fords because from the late 90's til about a decade ago, those trucks were fucking ugly in my opinion, and until recently, I felt they handled like shit (I hated the feel of brakes in the late 90's models).   This time, I looked at Nissan, Toyota, Ford, and Chevy (sorry honda, the ridgeline is f'n ugly, even if you make badass, lasting vehicles).  But even if I had bought an F150, it would not have been white, as it's just to plain and generic and such.  Though I'm a little meh with ford because over the years hearing dipshits talk about how they would never drive a vehicle made by Gubbment motors.  Fuck off.   Hell, I worked for a company that started replacing their vehicles with fords with that as a reason (even though the mechanic shop had GM mechanics and a massive inventory of GM parts), and people were all gungho to jump on it, and guess what, stupid decisions like that drove the company into the ground."

For a while fords were the main one offering it, but now everyone else has jumped on board.  I have a '14 silverado, and have loved it so far.  Any issues I may have found were first world problems (once it indexes a flash drive with music, it gets screwy if you remove tracks or replace them with better quality in that it doesn't clear the removed track, it jut adds to the index)"
Acadiana,34b7l4,Rinkelstein,-2,Thu Apr 30 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but let's play a game. Count f-150's vs silverados, or rams (rams look a lot nicer than the other two IMHO). I've tried, and I always see quite a few more Fords."
Acadiana,34b7l4,Acadianarchy,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm a fan of Chevy's body style right now. Dodges are good looking trucks though.  Are you saying you count more ford douches? That's more likely a combination of observation bias and ford is a larger percentage of vehicles on the road, so of course there are more ford douches, by volume."
Acadiana,34b7l4,Rinkelstein,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"I am as well.   I bought one, lol"
Acadiana,34b7l4,Chamrox,-2,Thu Apr 30 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"No bias. I make a count most times i head down Johnston, counting only privately-owned pickups. The brodozers are far more often F-150's or 250's if the driver is REALLY overcompensating. I'm surprised there are as few rams as there are, they're faster and better looking than any Ford."
Acadiana,34b7l4,rd8t,2,Thu Apr 30 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"I'm 33 years old and drive a 2013 F-150. You might be able to find someone who calls me a douche. I also have two kids, volunteer regularly, sit on non profit boards, and enjoy the outdoors. Are there 23 year olds living out there where are blowing their checks on trucks? Yes. But the majority of trucks you see on the road are for people who have a need to move stuff occasionally. I used to hate F250's, until I realized that they cost 65,000 bucks, and you had to have a decent source of income to be able to afford one. I don't know if there is a neck beard vehicle out there, but if there is, tell us your preferred vehicle of choice."

Acadiana,34b7l4,MmmDarkBeer,-3,Thu Apr 30 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"An excellent question!   I'd take a Dodge Ram, Toyota Tacoma or Tundra, Nissan Frontier, or Chevy Silverado over any F-series truck.  I've had no end of issues with an F-250 super duty crew truck (we were using it as a crew truck, and to haul some fairly light equipment) in the past. It had repeated pump failures and coolant leaks, and It took twice as long to drag my crew's hairy asses around the Exxon refinery (big one in BR). I eventually got another crew lead to swap for an older(and smaller) Chevy. My first car ever, btw, was a Ford Tempo, and it was a piece of shit. Fucking electrical and oil pressure problems for days. The fucking thing went up like a torch one day, just like a Smartcar.  I admit a soft spot for the Chevy S-10, small or not, because I used to get laid a lot in the back of one."
Acadiana,34b7l4,rd8t,2,Wed Apr 29 22:32:45 2015 UTC,"My first ride was an '89 Ford Tempo GL. It was ugly in the outside, but pristine on the inside. Loved it."

I think my father's logic in giving me a late 80's ford was that since i had run away when i was 16 (made it to california for about a year), i wouldn't even make it out of town in a Ford."

We're friends with some of the bands you mentioned, so I'll share your flyers and make it out to a show once things settle down for me. Your next show should be killer. FTV is one of my favorite local bands, really good guys."
Acadiana,341ybx,ZydecoSucks,2,Tue Apr 28 12:53:20 2015 UTC,"They really are, probably some of the most talented musicians I've had the pleasure to meet. Cool man, hope to see you out soon!"

Acadiana,33ylww,jiggy68,8,Mon Apr 27 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"I'd just ignore it if you're strapped.  They can't put it on your credit.  They won't bring you to court.  If you get a ton of them it might make it worth their while to bring you to court, but even then I doubt they'd do it."
Acadiana,33ylww,GEAUXUL,2,Sun Apr 26 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Um, I thought they did put it on your credit."
Acadiana,33ylww,phqu88,5,Mon Apr 27 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"They can't because you've never given them your SSN nor can they charge you anything.

Acadiana,33ylww,StephenFish,3,Mon Apr 27 02:56:22 2015 UTC,Your SSN is tied to your registration. You don't think they are going to leverage that?
Acadiana,33ylww,soashamedrightnow,5,Mon Apr 27 03:18:02 2015 UTC,No. That SSN is for ID purposes and it's illegal for that to be given to a private entity (Redflex). I fan confirm that mine aren't on my credit report. They have zero credibility when it comes to collecting.
Acadiana,33ylww,rapcat,3,Mon Apr 27 11:31:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't paid any for at least two years and thus far nothing has happened."

Acadiana,33ylww,wwjdforaklondikebar,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:07:25 2015 UTC,It's the red light cameras planned at various intersections in town.  They'll send ya a $25 ticket if you run the red or are going too fast.  They have safe speed vans they place in random spots around town too.  Super lame.
Acadiana,33znb0,firredup,7,Mon Apr 27 03:08:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'd imagine they would try and live kind of close to campus and downtown.  The biggest concentration of them will be there.  Research the saints streets area and Freetown, maybe?"
Acadiana,33znb0,itsrattlesnake,2,Mon Apr 27 03:17:47 2015 UTC,Freetown is a good area if you enjoy your car getting keyed.
Acadiana,33znb0,jilliest,4,Mon Apr 27 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"Also depends on your budget. Lots of kids living on daddy's credit card and student loans live in the snazzy new apartments. There are college kids in my complex (they do a great job of isolating them to one area!)  Saints Streets & Freetown are good bets for mixes ages and lifestyles.   But in the end, depends on your budget and what amenities you'd like. What ""lifestyle"" is your thing?"

Acadiana,33we5d,rapcat,3,Sun Apr 26 19:07:20 2015 UTC,Lafayette PD (as far as I know) is saying no gunshots were fired at last night's festival and have not reported to the media that the status has changed.
Acadiana,33we5d,InThrowMotion,3,Sun Apr 26 19:19:25 2015 UTC,Of course there's no official word or news coverage; that might scare off all dat good tourist money!  /s (maybe)
Acadiana,33we5d,rapcat,2,Sun Apr 26 19:37:20 2015 UTC,Just messaged a friend about it.  LPD is reporting no gunshots downtown and have not said anything different.
Acadiana,33we5d,mpguidry,-1,Sun Apr 26 19:22:56 2015 UTC,of course they arent reporting it...thats why its not in the news..they are trying to cover it up to keep the festival looking good and safe
Acadiana,33we5d,fishandring,7,Sun Apr 26 20:12:52 2015 UTC,it's a conspiracy! jet fuel can't melt dank memes. 9/11 was a part-time job!
Acadiana,33we5d,mojoronomous,2,Sun Apr 26 20:31:19 2015 UTC,I think this was likely made up.  We were at the Nomadic Massive concert and then left when they moved the horses in.  Then we were right outside and a younger officer told us he was about to turn on lights and sirens as a warning so we wouldnt be deaf.  The show of force as far as we could tell was totally planned.  Then we walked towards Dwyers and the police came down Jefferson on foot and in cars.  I think it was just a way to let everyone know they were in control. This show of force turned into rumors at the other end of Jefferson that someone had fired a gun.

Acadiana,33xmz3,pvk8336,9,Sun Apr 26 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Just going to go through this one by one.    who is excited for this shit music?   What's ""shit music?"" Stuff that you don't listen to?    people get ""pumped"" for shit they've never heard of.    Why are you annoyed at what other people are excited about? You're basically saying it's dumb for people to explore music that's different from their normal routine.   When I look at lineups from other festivals I attend, I look up names of bands I haven't heard of and often get excited to see them live too. I don't see how this is a bad thing at all. Some of the bands I didn't know about before previous festivals are bands that I now listen to daily because I discovered them through Festival International.   Seems very inauthentic in a lot of aspects and I've been over it for years.   Being over it, sure. Everyone has different tolerances and desires. Not going to fight you there. Inauthentic how, though? That's a very broad term.   Totally glad I didn't even step off my freetown porch to witness the nonsense.   Then how do you know it was nonsense? I can get having no desire to go, but you're insulting a large portion of your own neighbors whose only fault is being excited about going to a free outdoor event.   I'm not saying you're wrong for not wanting to go to festival. It's not for everyone, but acting like you're better than the people who attend it is surely...lame."
Acadiana,33xmz3,soashamedrightnow,8,Mon Apr 27 06:30:48 2015 UTC,"You're so right. Acadiana is a melting pot of culture, art, music, food, etc, and we celebrate that via a FREE festival. If you're not a festival person, then don't go! How do you shit on something that's absolutely free which you have zero obligation to participate in?   You can see bands from France, Haiti, Columbia, Lafayette, Africa, and in the night with the band that backed Bob Marley, all in one day. You can hand-carry in your own beers, meet new people, and eat some local food for $7-9, the same price you'd pay for fast food. Yeah, it's over-crowded. Yeah, you have to piss in a plastic outhouse. But usually you'd pay $100-300 to do that at any other festival. This is one you can literally walk down the street to, so why bitch about it?  I'd agree that I really wasn't initially impressed by the music lineup for the most part, and nearly everyone that I know said the same thing. Calling someone else's art, their performance ""shit music"" is really necessary. Honestly, I could give a shit less about zydeco, country, ""regional music,"" etc, but within reason, I'm not going to shit on someone else's craft (if you're a shitty human being, you might catch shit for that however). Music, literature, art, cuisine, etc, it's all a direct reflection of one's culture and there's a lot that they're saying if you read between the lines. This is what is referred to as ""dream-crushers,"" people that are intolerant to the work of others and shit on it in order to feel better about themselves for whatever reason. Trust that it is like this when you're a performer in Acadiana as well, as you can see below in the thread where someone took an opportunity to anonymously shit on a local musician's craft, which is by all means pretty fucking professional and easily one of the best, veteran bands in Acadiana.  So yeah. Live life on your front porch and reminisce upon your days at Acadiana High. If you don't like Lafayette or Acadiana, there's a two-way street just North of Lafayette that will take you someplace else."

I've bought music from festival plenty of times, artists I'd never heard of, and most likely won't get a chance to see again. Not cause their music is shit, but they're busy, it's a big world, and they're spreading their love (as opposed to douchebag opinion). I share that music with my friends, we listen to it together sometimes, and unfortunately we get pumped for the next festival. I know, I know, we're supposed to disregard it since you don't know fuckall about it. sorry.  I'm glad you're over it. I'm glad it bothers you. Hopefully it will continue to annoy you, that, and mardi gras, and festival acadiens, and the crawfish fest, zydeco fest, blues fest, black pot, and on and on....  pretty soon you'll be yelling 'get off my lawn you damn kids' so move to sugarland and gtfo."

Sorry you, and others, have a hard time dealing with things you disagree with... but, you did handle your refutations in such an eloquent way. More proof to how successful of a student you were/ are.  I must ask: How big are the nuts on your truck? What's your opinion on gay marriage/ interracial relationships... Maybe my opinion will cause you to spew more vitriolic nonsense laden with 7th grade insults.    Edit again: I read this again. You actually used the word ""buttload"".

You just insulted everyone who enjoys the the Festival and all those volunteers who work so hard to make it a success and multiple nationally published reviews would disagree with you.  It also brings a lot of money to Lafayette with is good for everyone.And If your only reason to go to any festival / big event is to have an excuse to get a day drunk then you and your kind are best kept to your front porches anyway.

Acadiana,33xmz3,rd8t,4,Sun Apr 26 19:03:37 2015 UTC,The rain was a big deterrent.  Rained Friday afternoon and poured down all day Saturday.  I know hardcore Festival-goers who waited to go today.
Acadiana,33xmz3,StephenFish,2,Sun Apr 26 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd agree that the rain had a lot to do with it.  We normally go all day Saturday but because of the weather we didn't even bother until after 5:00."
Acadiana,33xmz3,rd8t,2,Sun Apr 26 19:41:36 2015 UTC,If the crowds are the only thing keeping you away maybe you should try again on a Sunday. It's always much less crowded.

And that stage is opened for 4 days.' So there you geaux.

Acadiana,33mmno,kunstlinger,7,Fri Apr 24 00:24:10 2015 UTC,"That's definitely an FA 18 Superhornet. Sometimes they do cross-countries on their way to and from the Naval Air Facility in Belle Chase. I'm not entirely sure why they'd be doing touch and go's at LFT however. It's an odd place to do a sortie.   There was talking about Russians entering or hanging around the Gulf of Mexico. I've seen Superhornets buzz by the area a handful of times in the past 6 months. They could be passing through or they could be maintaining presence in the GoM. I can't make out what's on the weapon stations, but it looks like it doesn't have any drop tank on the centerline, so it's likely refueling here and there. Reconnaissance endeavors would also require a shared recon pod on the centerline, in which there doesn't seem to be one either. There's no telling.   Edit: I think there's also a USMC unit like right across the street. Both the USN and the USMC have STRIFITRON (Strike Fighter Squardon) units. They can be passing by for a visit or just dicking off."
Acadiana,33mmno,itsrattlesnake,3,Thu Apr 23 19:44:27 2015 UTC,"First off. Let me respond to my error. I'm not at all sure why I said F15. I know better. I checked out of the Truman 10 months ago. I lived with these things for 4 years. Two deployments on the Enterprise, and one on the Truman. I was engineering, but still, I know better. In fact I started to write a comment and called it a Super Hornet in my comment I didn't post.   Anyways  I know I've heard of them stopping here or in the Berry to refuel on cross country flights. I can't say or deny if he was loaded or not, as well as if he had recon stuff on. He shot out after he hit the deck. Never came back around. I'm used to watching those things do circles and touch, then head back out and around the port side.  Also he was alone at least on approach, which I found slightly odd. I can't believe I've ever seen one alone. Even when I'd see them doing sorties at Oceana. I dont believe it was a USMC jet, but I can't say for sure really.   I dont know. Lots of weird things happening these days with the Navy. I'm anxiously awaiting the Roosevelt to get out of River City 1 so I can email some friends and get the inside scoop."
Acadiana,33mmno,itsrattlesnake,4,Thu Apr 23 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"New Iberia is also home to AVEX which is large enough to paint 747's.  They do plenty of military aircraft there, too.  It's not uncommon to drive by the strip and there'll be an F-15, Chinook, Huey, or Cobra just sitting there on the tarmac as a result.  New Iberia gets quite a bit of strange air traffic in and out because of this place."
Acadiana,33mmno,ToddNew,3,Thu Apr 23 21:32:23 2015 UTC,I was just talking to a guy I work with about that place. Apparently that's one of the largest runways in the south united states. He told me a few years ago they almost landed the Shuttle there due to bad weather in Florida
Acadiana,33mmno,LittleHelperRobot,5,Thu Apr 23 21:36:02 2015 UTC,It was always an alternate landing site for the shuttle.  It used to be a Naval reserve base in the 40's.

Acadiana,33mmno,leakyconvair,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:03:55 2015 UTC,"They've been maneuvers with in-flight refueling X-47B drones that'll deploy from carriers. It's rad because they unmanned and can refuel via tankers (FA 18s, KC-130s, whatever) so the distance and longevity of sorties (missions/flights) is unbelievable. This extends the project of power, the reach of carrier/strike groups. There are also weapon systems on blimps/zeppelins in the Middle East right now that have a far reach. It's a pretty good paying job manning them as well.   The USS Roosevelt (carrier) is sitting next to Yemen locked down in River City 1 condition, waiting to intercept ships full of Iranian weapons. Are there nukes onboard? Who know? They're literally buckled down ready to pull the trigger on them. If you've never seen a ship sank by a battle group ...uuuuuuunnnng. Crazy shit.  The EA-18 Growler is operational. I worked on an earlier version of self-protection jammers on the FA 18, but this is a strike fighter electronic attack aircraft. They could more or less fly into Houston, and jam the entire city to a dead stop, black it out with all of the electronics onboard. It's more or less a flying supercomputer to begin with and you wouldn't know what hit you.   There's a lot of cool, interesting stuff that just doesn't belong on the web right now. However there are some subs on Reddit that are really neat that talk about current technology development like exo suits, those crazy robot attack dogs (Fahrenheit 451 looking shit), orbital bombardment systems which are more or less tungsten and uranium rods that are orbiting in space that can be programmed to drop out of orbit and strike a Coke can floating in the ocean if you wanted (crazy accurate). I think it's called Poseidon's Spear or something like that."
Acadiana,33mmno,Rinkelstein,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:54:12 2015 UTC,"I figured as much. Superhornets are easily distinguishable. No idea why they'd do a touch & go and bolt like that at a regional airport.  If it's an escort, it's likely going to be more than just one jet. The same if it's being an aggressor and chasing someone out. It'd have a minimum load out of 20MM rounds, an AIM- 9X, AMRAAM, and maybe a Sparrow. You'd be able to see those on the right side though. That's why I feel like they're just doing an iron-swap from base to base,  probably from Shreveport."

It's also really fun to go through the tunnels that pass under Cajun Dome Blvd.  You get to ride through town without being in danger of drivers murdering you because they have to have their phones attached to their eye balls or they'll combust."

Acadiana,33ldmu,Silound,3,Thu Apr 23 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"They're definitely an easy target. They break into these without a trace, like clockwork in Houston. I've seen so many instances where someone goes into a restaurant get grab a 30 minute lunch, and when they get back all of their belongings are gone. Oilfield company trucks are usually Ford F-dumb-50s and thieves steal tools, equipment, computer bags, suitcases, etc."
Acadiana,33ldmu,aycefayce,3,Thu Apr 23 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"Right now in Houston, I understand the big rage are tailgates with backup cameras. They're stupid easy to remove from a tuck (drop the tailgate, cut the wires, lift and remove), have no identification stamped on them anywhere, and retail for damn near $4000 OEM.  Meanwhile, the thief will rewire the tailgate and sell it for $1500 and anyone who has to pay for that out of pocket will jump at the chance for a used one of the right color combination in good condition selling for $1500."
Acadiana,33ldmu,Silound,2,Thu Apr 23 19:36:53 2015 UTC,I've heard of tailgates being stolen as well! I didn't think about the backup camera though. I bet they can pull off a tailgate and drive away in a minute flat.

Acadiana,33ldmu,rd8t,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:52:59 2015 UTC,"IMO, a decent bit. Most of those guys stealing tailgates are looking for a ""smash & grab"" style theft, because a tailgate is a large noticeable thing."

Acadiana,33ldmu,Rhineaux,2,Thu Apr 23 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"They still do them, and they're still dumb as ever.  Up until 2007 or so, the keypads were tied into the alarm system, but the flash memory where the programmed number was stored was located in the damn door!  Knowing people could easily remove the keypanel with force and rip the programmed keypad number right out of the door. I had to do this at least twice on my Mountaineer."

Acadiana,33fi7r,threetoast,8,Wed Apr 22 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"We farm out crawfish down here. Good size, fresh crawfish can be very expensive.   Acadiana has its list of problems too, its not all sunshine and rainbows. Like the week long storm we had last week. Bayou Teche is still has very high waters.   Also if you live in the berry (New Iberia) when the wind is just right the whole city smells of shrimp (thanks Delcambre!)   Our waste water pipes are too damn small!   Gov. Bobby Jindal seems to think running for president, is more important than our city.   We only have two seasons: blood boiling, brain melting heat, and insanely fucking cold.   One word here: hurricanes.   We have our up to though, outweigh the bad.   Sportsman's paradise, and the only way anyone could explain this to you would to bring you here.   If you think you have a party city in Canada, Louisiana could out party them any day. (New Orleans is our best bet) We have many holidays!   New Iberia Haircut anyone?  The list goes on. Feel free to expand."
Acadiana,33fi7r,ZydecoSucks,5,Wed Apr 22 03:43:04 2015 UTC,"So, how cold is insanely fucking cold? Cuz we got our coldest winter on record this year with some -40s -50 in January.

Acadiana,33fi7r,dirtyPirate,9,Wed Apr 22 03:46:09 2015 UTC,"By insanely cold he means we still have humidity during the winter and it makes 50s feel like 20s.

Oh oh or sometimes when it gets really cold, you end up with like snow forming around your nostrils.   Its scary."
Acadiana,33fi7r,ThirdCocacola,7,Wed Apr 22 03:52:41 2015 UTC,Thia paragraph is exactly why us Cajuns stay our asses down here.
Acadiana,33fi7r,ThirdCocacola,3,Wed Apr 22 04:09:34 2015 UTC,The limit of absolute humidity approximately doubles for every 20F increase in temperature. So the amount of water that the air can hold at 40F is much much lower than at 80F.  Which becomes much more relevant when it's goddamned 97F and 95% humidity.

Acadiana,338zun,rd8t,7,Mon Apr 20 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"Some friends purchased the basic pass, mostly because she's 7 months pregnant and wanted to ensure access to seating, short lines, and (most importantly) clean bathrooms.  I'm going to  eyeball what they get out of it this year and make my decision for next year. $65 is essentially a cheap ticket to a concert or show, so I won't feel bad spending the money if I get something remotely worthwhile out of it.  I bet they'll be a booth where you can purchase a Festival Pass on site somewhere, so if it looks good I'll jump."
Acadiana,338zun,Silound,2,Mon Apr 20 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people got very high horsey over the $1k passes.  Granted, the gaps in tier pricing is a bit much, but if someone wants to drop a grand and it keeps the festival free, be my guest.  Since she's pregnant, hope the pass is worht the money spent. In her case, it's a pretty strong case for something like that."
Acadiana,338zun,microgoddess,5,Mon Apr 20 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"The jump in price is obscene... I did consider the basic pass, mostly because I severely hate public bathrooms and usually just hold it the whole time. Or leave early cause I have to pee..."
Acadiana,338zun,cajunation,7,Mon Apr 20 20:33:57 2015 UTC,"Part of the challenge Festival faces is that the original concept behind the ""Rain Angels"" program was to give everyone who loves Festival and is of means a way to contribute to insure Festival's survival in the event a year with heavy rain kills beverage sales. So it was never intended to be a VIP experience but that's what it evolved into over the years, which is actually bad for Festival as now they have to spend significant money to create a VIP experience, which negates some of the effectiveness of this program.   So it's not surprising that the VIP experience has been lacking in the past, though they've got new leadership this year so it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out.   I didn't consider buying a pass as I already have a couple of other options for real bathrooms, but I'm definitely going to be buying my pins and drinks to support Festival as I love it!"
Acadiana,338zun,pele1410,2,Tue Apr 21 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"That's what I think people keep missing about the $1K passes, they're basically the old Rain Angels VIP.  Alot of those people were major donors (or worked for a major donor like LGMC), so $1k isn't even alot for them."

Acadiana,338zun,Silound,2,Mon Apr 20 17:21:13 2015 UTC,"The question is, will whomever purchased the $1000 pass actually go to festival?"
Acadiana,338zun,ToddNew,3,Mon Apr 20 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think they needed a graduated tier system. How do you go from $65 to $1k? Why not do $100, $500, $1,000, etc? Definitely a flop on that one, IMO."
Acadiana,338zun,bagofboards,2,Mon Apr 20 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"Last I looked, it went $65-400-1000, so there's a bit of a tier."
Acadiana,338zun,ToddNew,2,Tue Apr 21 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"I had VIP passes the last two years from a buddy who only liked to go on Sunday. I was disappointed with what the organizers considered ""VIP"", a special place to watch the bands (some stages area's were great, others were actually worse for watching the bands). There was 1 free buffet style dinner per day with the artists included. It sucked, food was cold and served on paper plates, drinks ran out. Free wifi inside was non-existent. Here's something that really irritated me, last year they had the low tier VIP tent (called Amis du Festival/$50 and cleaner, no line port-a-lets. They handed out free waters and snacks while you rested in the AC cooled tent. They would NOT grant VIP's access to this tent. They flat out refused me entry. I was livid, and remember, I spent nothing for these passes. I told my friend about all of this and convinced him that his $2,400 advertisement with the organization shouldn't continue and he listened.  Edit: the powers that be with FIL seriously overpriced the tiers this year. Even after last years debacle I probably would have bit on top tier passes at $500 and IF they were lanyard style passes. The wristbands make them non-transferrable which makes them useless unless you go every day. I could have seen a path to spending a reasonable amount of money supporting the festival but now they've made it impossible to share with friends or clients.   Double Edit: fuck tickets for drinks <end rant>"
Acadiana,338zun,bagofboards,3,Mon Apr 20 23:25:23 2015 UTC,"If they don't sell tickets for drinks, then there are way too many people handling money, and there would be significant losses from that. If you don't want to use all your tickets it's easy to resell them to someone. Sorry for the inconvenience, but unfortunately theft occurs, and it's the best way to mitigate losses."
Acadiana,338zun,ToddNew,3,Tue Apr 21 10:46:24 2015 UTC,"Here's my idea. A reloadable card with PIN. Festival goer would create an account, pay something like $10 to activate, and any unused balance just carries forward until the next year. Half of the wait time in line for drinks is from people having to awkwardly pull out tickets and count/tear them for the people behind the booth. Festival attendees win, Festival International wins, booth workers win."
Acadiana,338zun,bagofboards,2,Tue Apr 21 11:59:50 2015 UTC,"It's a good idea, but let's face it....most people wouldn't do it.....i got enough 'pin' numbers to last me two lifetimes, and wouldn't want to hassle with it. personally, i've never had or noticed issues with people/vendors who aren't ready with tickets....not a big fan of the rollover either...."

Acadiana,338zun,InThrowMotion,2,Tue Apr 21 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but remember, I'm not saying everyone must adopt a card/pin system (or better yet a LE Bluetooth / Apple pay like method). Put the costs associated with making it happen on the Festival goer. I doubt people would load more than $100 and these people would be reloading every year. We're talking about $15-25 that would most likely carry forward which would be resting on FIL's balance sheet (which, if you haven't seen, is quite eye opening)"

Acadiana,333hri,Yohfay,4,Sun Apr 19 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"March Fourth Marching Band is worth checking out. I'm probably going to watch Lost Bayou Ramblers, they're pretty good. Other than that, I can't really say.  My whole strategy for what bands to watch is generally not to have a strategy. I make myself aware of what's out there, and then whatever I feel at the time, I do. Basically, I work a job that's all about structure and schedules, and this is an excellent opportunity to just do whatever I want whenever I want to do it for a few days. This is my surefire method for myself to have the most fun with the least stress. Other people will have other methods, but I find that this works pretty good for me."

This hip hop collective uses ""old school"" influenced beats combined with multi lingual MCs. I'm pretty stoked about it."
Acadiana,3327ds,itsrattlesnake,6,Sat Apr 18 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"Around Lafayette -   Rip Van Winkle Gardens is a beautiful home that once belonged to Vaudeville actor Joe Jefferson.  The gardens are the best around and the oil disaster that happened on the neighboring lake is pretty ridiculous to even imagine. Avery Island houses Tabasco.  I'm not a huge fan of the factory tour, in fact I think it's the worst factory tour I've ever been on.  The gift shop is nice, though.  Jungle Gardens is pretty great, especially in the Spring when the snowy egrets are out with their mating plumage. Shadows on the Teche is an antebellum home for tour in New Iberia.  The French colonial architectural style is interesting. Parish Brewing is the local brewery that I love.  Check their website for tours. Breaux Bridge has a decent antique shop or two, as does Washington if you're into that sort of thing.   Of course, the big draw for many is the food, and there are dozens of threads devoted to that subject.    Other cities -   New Orleans has so much to do that you could write a book on it (and people do).  My favorite thing to do after a jaunt around the French Quarter is a relaxing ride on the storied St Charles Streetcars down the Garden District.  Natchitoches has a lovely little downtown area that's known for it's Christmas light display.  It's most widely known for meat pies (Lasyone's makes my favorite).  Baton Rouge I haven't seen too much of, but I do recommend the state capitol.  It's art deco architecture is really something else.  I've heard the old State Capitol is also a sight to behold.  Random Stuff -  I've been to 5 of the 50 US state 'high points' and Driskill Mountain is the third lowest (at 535', ahead of Delaware and Florida).  It's a short little jaunt to the top and it's near Ruston, LA.  I really want to check out Fort Pike and Fort Jackson.  Fort Jackson was civil war battle site.  Avoid Shreveport/Bossier."
Acadiana,3327ds,i_haz_username,5,Sat Apr 18 23:11:59 2015 UTC,Avoid Shreveport. Ha. This person is from Louisiana.
Acadiana,3327ds,salmonerd202,5,Sun Apr 19 02:11:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to avoid any large cities in this list just to highlight the smaller towns and cities.  Jennings, LA: ""The Cradle of Louisiana Oil"" - this city started the oil industry in the state, and as a result, you have a lot of oil museums. The city's architecture is kinda northern since it was started by a bunch of midwestern farmers. They have a neat little drive in, The Rocket Drive Inn, a public library built by Andrew Carnegie, and several museums in town and off of  I10.   Eunice: the best time to come here is during Mardi Gras. Everyone is country as fuck and also drunk as fuck. You can drink, chase chickens, and wear cool outfits. I think there's a run too... also everyone is drunk. Other things that are cool is the Jean Lafitte Prairie Acadian Cultural Center which controls the Liberty Theater which has live Cajun bands on Saturday's.  Saint Francisville: if you're a cyclist, this is the mecca for cycling in the state. Rolling hills,  gravel roads,  plus big fancy houses in some spots. There is a cool old timey antique feel to the city center area which would be cool to check out. You're also close to the Clark's Creek nature trail which is a good place to hike.  Mandeville/Covington/Slidell: these three cities are on the northshore. This area kind of has a nouveaux riche kind of feel to it. A lot of money here. There are a lot of small local shops and restaurants in these two cities. Covington's downtown is pretty nice.   Natchitoches: oldest city in Louisiana. Home to many historical places which includes forts, plantations, etc. Also home to LSMSA which is a super high school."

Acadiana,3327ds,rd8t,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:28:07 2015 UTC,"As a former resident of Jeff Davis Parish and around Jennings:  Lock your vehicle and don't leave valuables in plain sight (this should be anywhere, but Jennings very much so).  Incidently, the first land based oil well was not drilled in Jennings, but 6 miles north in the community of Evangeline, in Acadia Parish (the most to see on that is a plaque on the side of the hwy).  Also, if you go to Jennings, stay on the main streets and avoid shortcuts.  Last place you want to end up is lost down south main."

The burlesque show.   The fact that we have such a large Lebanese population that we have no less than 10 amazing Greek restaurants never ceases to amaze me in Cajun country.   What else? Agave on a Friday night when teachers are whooping it up.  The yearly gumbo cook off. Or the catfish or chili.   Festivals acadien.  Hanging out in Scott by the tracks for Mardi Gras.  I for one have active friends that we plan all kinds of activities when the things above don't have us occupied. Ideas we've had for fun get togethers.  Murder mystery with food from the time period. A dress up party. Bonfires in people's backyards. Game night. Etc.  There is plenty to do in Lafayette!"

This was about 4 years ago, mind you.  Brand new house.  I was watching them build a lot of the houses in that place when I was doing construction and working on the river. I wasn't too confident that they were taking soil moisture factors into account when they were laying foundations, because they were just building them as fast as they could. Expect some nasty foundation failures after a lot of rain.  In twenty years, it'll look like the projects. If we're lucky.  edit: I accidentally a word."

Out of nowhere the glass door to a real estate business behind me just shatters to the ground. I called the phone number to the business to let them know, and the lady was so pissed. She couldn't believe that the glass pane had broken on its own. I could. Most of those building and homes are such poor quality. Then I noped the fuck out of there before she arrived."

The most common causes are:      Impact to glass surface, break will typically show pattern radiating from point of impact. Minor damage during installation such as nicked or chipped edges later developing into larger breaks normally radiating from point of defect. Binding of the glass in the frame, causing stresses to develop as the glass expands and contracts due to thermal changes or deflects due to wind Internal defects within the glass such as nickel sulfide inclusions Thermal stresses in the glass Inadequate glass thickness to resist wind load      Interesting: Car glass | Safety and security window film | Glass floor | Molotov cocktail   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Acadiana,32tdid,rd8t,6,Fri Apr 17 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"As someone who worked at Pro-Legal Copies when RR was just finished and people were moving in, the number of Perret Doise cases regarding shoddy architecture, work, and craftsmanship I'd have to scan/copy/archive would stagger most of you.  Dozens of boxes full of full-six-inch-binders of pictures of different homes and apartments where things are cracking, splitting, caving, falling apart, crumbling, leaking, flooding, soaking through, breaking, and pretty much any other destructive adjective you can think of was happening.  You'd think they knew they were building it that way."
Acadiana,32tdid,themarknessmonster,8,Thu Apr 16 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they did know they were building it that way, and probably had already factored the lawsuits into the amazing stacks of cash they were taking in as profit."
Acadiana,32tdid,themarknessmonster,6,Thu Apr 16 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, though.  Who but the repair and maintenance and law industries stand to gain from shitty construction of a city within a city?"
Acadiana,32tdid,themarknessmonster,5,Thu Apr 16 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"No, that's not what I was implying. The developer builds the houses as cheaply as absolutely possible, knowing that there are going to repair claims. But if the costs of the repairs are costing him less than it would to just build all the homes to a better standard, the developer stands to make more money that way. That's what I meant when I said they take the lawsuits into account when calculating their profits. I'm sure there's a marketing term here that I am unaware of. Let's say building them to a better standard would decrease your profit margin by 20%, but the lawsuits from building them at a lower standard would decrease your profit margin by only 10%. It's more cost effective to deal with the law suits."

Acadiana,32sx7t,Lafayettecomedy,3,Thu Apr 16 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"Bands were not bringing in people?   I guess they shoulda had more cowbell.  I'm not knocking comedy or their promotion.  I think they are doing a great job of getting the word out, and have grabbed attention of someone at the advertiser.  It's a shame they don't give that kind of coverage to everything going on.    If it's not Downtown alive, or zydeco or whatever, they just have little interest in bothering to promote.  I usually find out about shows from friends who invite me on social media or post here, or from the venues if I happen to follow them (facebook has been screwy with a lot of my followings).  Would it be so difficult to have a simple submission page or email address for events where you give them date/time, venue, band, genre and just post it to their site (don't worry, everyone will clear the cookies for the views).  Show a little support and be fair about it, even if it's something that's not all nice and polished and family friendly.  I know a lot of guys who are pretty agressive in promoting on social media, word of mouth, flyers, etc, so it would be cool to see them get attenion as well.  Kudos to the guys promoting the comedy.  I've been seeing your stuff everywhere as well, so keep up the good work"
Acadiana,32sx7t,rd8t,5,Thu Apr 16 14:37:06 2015 UTC,The amount of invites I get from comedy shows on facebook has become so redunk its not even funny.
Acadiana,32sx7t,ohhyouknow,3,Thu Apr 16 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, they are doing a great job of getting that info out there.  I just wish the Advertiser would offer more attention to what goes on locally other than popular coverbands and such.  Glad the COmedy guys broke through on something."
Acadiana,32sx7t,rd8t,3,Thu Apr 16 16:01:03 2015 UTC,I know. That's the + & - of social media. Apologies :)
Acadiana,32sx7t,rd8t,4,Sat Apr 18 02:53:29 2015 UTC,"Lafayette Comedy has certainly worked hard to create their own presence and find their niche here. They definitely got the attention of the Advertiser, which in these parts validates the fact that you've definitely begun to make waves. The comedy guys & girls are friends of the music scene, they're often at shows, and at times they've also run sound as well as MC'd local music events. That's why I included both music and comedy heavily in the Calendar of Events.   Btw, I've been way too busy to keep the CoE updated in a quality manner. I promote every event with the same enthusiasm and I've gone out of my way quite a bit, because I love Lafayette and I love music. I'm on the fence at the moment because I don't want to show favoritism and I don't want to exclude anyone, neutrality and balance is important. Some people are completely undeserving of it because they shit on others in Acadiana. /rant  The Advertiser has been nothing but good to Acadiana and I sort of feel like if a group (band, singer, comic, artist, performer, etc) cares enough, they will either make waves are reach out on their own. There are ways to self-promote in Lafayette such as entering your event into http://liveandlocalacadiana.com/, which I often create events on for people because the guy who runs it is tight with Planet Radio 105.1, 106.3, etc. In fact, the guy that this article is about, (Jason Leonard)[http://liveandlocalacadiana.com/guitar-talk-with-jason-leonard-never-judge-a-beard-by-the-cover/], seems to have been covered by Live and Local in the past on Guitar Talk.  Anyway. If you want to make it, you have to pave your own way. Soon enough, people will catch wind of the alternative entertainment (alternative/underground musicians, burlesque, etc). It's always been DIY and the people who support stuff like this are the best people in the world IMO, but it's going to breakthrough one way or another. I'd rather see hardwork and dedication grab the attention of Acadiana, just as Lafayette Comedy has, rather than punching events into their website.   Lafayette Comedy is the shit. Given Tom Segura has already passed through, I give it a year before we see rising, well-known comics like Mike Birbiglia or Hannibal Buress stopping through on their way to Nola at places like JP's (which has without a doubt done a lot of good shit for performers in the past few years.)"
Acadiana,32sx7t,rd8t,3,Thu Apr 16 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"If you need help with the calendar, hit me up and I'll see what I can do.  I agree with you 100% on the DIY mentality and having to get out there and work your ass off and prove yourself.  And I imagine in an area like Acadiana, that's working harder because you have the good ol' boy network that permeates so much of the culture in the area (and no, I'm not even going to go where you think I'm going to go).  Myself, I'd like to see it embraced and promoted more.  I'm not in a band or doing standup or performing, so it's not a ""too lazy to do the work"" kind of thing as much as it's ""the more I meet people who are passionate about what they do and are just cool and interesting individuals"", the more I'd love to see something out there dedicated to supporting performers and artists.  Not only just to promote, but to give a little something of a voice to.  I suppose the whole concept was done in Zines before the internet, and while it would not be totally difficult to setup even a basic website, it's the keeping up and maintaining as well (though if anything, it would also offer an outlet to any mucisian, artist, comedian, etc who'd want to write up their own post or whatever  (I know so much of this can be done via facebook or reddit, but you also have the expectation that your audience will use both regularly enough to see, and facebook is fucking wonky and easy to miss posts).  I also fully realize I could just be over complicating it and many may not want to go that route.  I'm just saying it would be cool that if not that, then local media get on and promote more in some fashion, at least as a sign of support to locals who are working their asses off."
Acadiana,32sx7t,SweetperterderFries,3,Thu Apr 16 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"Coming from playing music for 14+ years, I know the struggle well.  This advertiser thing came about because on April 30th, the new Times of Acadiana will relaunch.  They are devoting people to each area of the arts, so there should be some music waves.  Comedy is new to this area, so it has a ""stick out"" factor.   We are lucky to have this press. Riding the wave as long as we can."

Acadiana,32oed6,rapcat,9,Wed Apr 15 12:27:05 2015 UTC,"That's a very interesting choice. Cox is an awful residential ISP, no denying that. The one board member who spoke up has a point. I think that it's fair to base the decision upon price, experience, and technical merits. Experience in education services though? LUS was already the provider... so it's almost like awarding seniority or a tenure to the other companies, which doesn't really allow newer ISPs to be competitive.   It's curious that an LUS representative didn't attend the meeting, and it's curious that the LCG wouldn't choose LUS in order to dump tax money back into a local gov't program."
Acadiana,32oed6,rd8t,7,Wed Apr 15 13:08:39 2015 UTC,"residential they are awful, but they will drop to all fours and take a mouthful for the business customers.  That's mainly because they also have to compete with LUS (Fiber to business) and AT&T (Fiber to business) and will paint a pretty picture to grab those business customers more so than residential.  Especially O&G, because any player big enough to be publically traded have large campuses here, and usually multiple locations.  To me, it sounds like this decision was made well before, and players were aware.  Why else wouldn't LCG and LUS fight harder for it."
Acadiana,32oed6,rd8t,3,Wed Apr 15 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"I love having LUS Fiber at the house. I will say that their technical support is subpar. Their techs are 1 word short of being an asshole on the phone. Also, I fought with my router/internet for 4+ hours and I'm stilling getting 5.77Mbps vice the 25.67+Mbps, including spotty connectivity that's been going on for easily 8-9 months. I'm fucking sick of it and they're unapologetic, blaming my router for the failed history of speed tests daily."
Acadiana,32oed6,rd8t,4,Wed Apr 15 13:31:51 2015 UTC,"No matter the provider, their default is always ""blame the customers equipment"".  Though with LUS, when you consider the speeds, most people buy low end routers/wifi access points that choke on anything about 25-50mbps"

I'm betting either someone is shaking hands with Cox under a table due to this, or else this is someone's attempt to slam the political parties/persons affiliated with LUSF. Could also be an attempt to deprive LUSF of a major contract to try and force them into insolvency, since there are still political entities that feel Lafayette shouldn't have a municipal fiber option.  From a technical standpoint, I don't see a good reason to pick Cox over LUSF (or any other existing provider that's been doing the job for 13 years) unless something was going wrong with service. LUSF most definitely has top-notch business service (in my experience), and if they were the sole provider for 13 years, they've been doing something right."
Acadiana,32oed6,cajunation,9,Wed Apr 15 13:55:53 2015 UTC,I spoke about this to friend and we both believe that LUS didn't show because they can't compete. The problem for LUS lies in the non-city parish schools. LUS probably has to lease fiber from a third party to reach those schools. This severely bites into profitability of a contract. Our guess was they just let it be a loss when they ran the numbers on it.

I was planning on doing our taxes online like I had always done. We don't have any kids or investments, our taxes are pretty straight forward.

Normally, I would have filed them at the beginning of February, once all our documents are in, so direct deposit and get my money back in like March or sooner. Well, the CPA just filed our taxes about a week ago, so we're still waiting on refund money that we desperately need to pay our bills.

Acadiana,32lka9,kraaz,3,Thu Apr 16 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"What's happening is that Innov8 is spinning out of the Chamber as an independent organization controlled by One Acadiana, LEDA, and the Community Foundation of Acadiana. The goal is for it to become self sustaining as the model of trying to run it as a volunteer-led Chamber committee just wasn't. As a result of this transition, they decided not to try and hold an event at this year's Festival but instead will start a series of events that run throughout the year.  It also appears that Innov8 is officially taking over CajunCodeFest, which used to be run by ULL but coincided with Innov8 and which is also not happening next week because of sustainability issues. Their website mentions a new format that will launch sometime next year.  My beef with both events to date is that they have absolutely been giant circle jerks with a lot more backslapping and chest puffing going on than actual innovation. What makes this so frustrating is that what we need is actual community building to create new opportunities to connect the cool people who are doing cool things in town, not a $40k keynote address by an innovation ""expert"".  Unfortunately, the new strategies for both of these events seem to be heading further down the wrong direction as Innov8 focuses on startups and pitch competitions, which can be great for individual entrepreneurs but don't do much to build community, and as CodeFest no longer even has coders in the same room for 24+hrs but instead stretches the competition out over months where most of the work will be done in private.  I wish everyone associated with both events well as I think for the most part their efforts are well-intentioned, regardless of how misguided they might be, and it would be great for our community if they were successful."

They breathe through feather-like gills and are found in bodies of water. Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is fresh water running, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and rice paddies. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as the invasive Procambarus clarkii are hardier. Crayfish feed on living and dead animals and plants.

My issue with it is that they kicked people out of their homes to build their completely unnecessary 4 lane, median divided road.  Then they set the speed limit at 35 and sit a camera van there 3 days a week.  That and they basically started the trend of speed cameras (or at least my experience with them), which is just a shady business in general."

Acadiana,3297tt,jiggy68,10,Sun Apr 12 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"Lafayette needed another road that connected Johnston Street and Kaliste Saloom.  They talked about where it would go for decades, long before River Ranch was a concept.  If you look at a map it was the best possible place to build it with the most benefit and the least amount of home destruction.  There was really no better place to build a necessary road.    The reason the speed limit is 35mph is because the non-River Ranch homeowners that would have the road run along their backyards insisted that the speed limit be 35mph to lessen the traffic noise.  The City promised this and built sound barriers as well. The neighbors are vigilant in making sure Lafayette keeps its promise."
Acadiana,3297tt,redditor1983,4,Sun Apr 12 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"Well... I don't know anything about the four lane road development; I think that happened before I moved here.

They clearly have a purpose and I'm not trying to say they shouldn't be there.  My issue is with how they're operated and managed.  The company that runs the speed cameras, in River Ranch, at least, is not even local; they're out of Arizona last I heard.  Lafayette paid for the cameras, paid to have them installed, and then pays this company to basically manage them and collect on any infractions.   In turn Lafayette gets a percentage of the money the company collects.  Which is an absolute bargain for the company.  No start up costs and they're basically a glorified collection agency, which is a shady business in itself and from the stories I've heard of people getting tickets and wanting to contest them, they live up to the stereotype.  So, again, I have no issues with the cameras.  The same way I don't have any issues with payday loans.  The people who tend to run those businesses, however, are some of the most unethical people I have ever come across, in my experience."

It was designed as an attemp tto be it's own entity (a village) with architecture purposely used to differentiate itself from the rest of the area, while carrying this aura that it's an area that cultivates art (money rarely cultivates art).  It's an area that tries to put on a false identity to purposely be different in a fashionable way.

Acadiana,323ybe,cdb3492,6,Fri Apr 10 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"It's basically the response to the fact that younger generations in a lot of areas are migrating away from the bigotry that was not only taught, but was considered acceptable.  Suddenly, white kids were friends with kids who were black, hispanic, asian, etc, and they had to deal with it.  Then, especially in this region, a lot of those parents had to eat shit when suddenly their white daughters suddenly brought home a black guy, and then eventually suffered through the ""embarassment"" of having a grandchild who was of mixed race (I've met people like this, they are pieces of shit simply because they have a grandchild and they have issue with skin tone).  Slowly, things become more acceptable, but lets not kid ourselves, biggotry and racism exists.  So what do they do, they find something else to hate/attack.  And homosexuality is such an easy target because they can attempt to mask that biggotry behind a bible and belief (for this region mostly).  Hell, there are people who did the same hiding for racism, as I grew up in an area with a Pentacostal church that specifically told it's congregation that god made them white because he favored them.    In their mind, despite being tattoo'ed, adulterers, having sex/babies out of wedlock, having sex for purposes of pleasure rather than procreation, and/or married multiple times (all against their religion), they can hypoctritically justify and embrace that bigotry because some book that I'd imagine 80% or more have never read told them to.  And what do they do, they teach that bullshit to their impressionable kids by telling them ""god will send you to a fiery pit of eternal pain and sorrow if those two men kiss each other"", and those kids go to school and think it's perfectly ok to torment and torture others who might be a little different, some to the point that they take their own lives.  And why, because she was attracted to other girls, or this person was born a male or female and has no association with his or her own gender (if someone else can provide a better description, please feel free, as I'm not good at it myself).    That entire mindset is then embraced by douchebag politicians who want to ""bring back morals and values to America"", and then they push for bullshit like this.  It's really nothing more than a way to Pander to voters.  And it comes in the form of ""Omg, they are taking away our freedome to worship.  Unless someone points a gun at your head and says you can't pray, then you have never had your freedom of religious belief denied, you are just being a whiney bitch.  That's why Jindal is doing this, because he needs some type of platform after damaging the state he has run with his own piss poor policies and habit of traveling to every place but his own state.  So fuck him.   Hell, one of the few things you see both Republicans and Democrats agree on is how much a piece of shit Jindal is (this is outside of the hardcore members who will blindly vote for whomever is a part of their side).    *If you are a person of belief, and are either cool with how others live their own lives, or even if you are not of agreement, but at least have the decency to not trample over someone elses rights, that's awesome.  Remember, you don't have to agree with what others do or how they live, you just have to learn to mind your own f'n business."

The same  goes for every religious friend I have.     Anytime it's brought up with friends that agree with me, however, all they talk about is how crazy right-wing religious wackos are going to destroy the country and anybody that disagrees with same sex marriage is a backwards country lunatic.  My parents are nothing like that and would never scold or belittle someone for thinking same sex marriage is acceptable.

There's picnic areas and bathrooms. There are some hiking and biking trails around the lake and the lake is great for paddling.   Going other places in Kisatchie will be far more primitive. There are marked trails and you camp anywhere.

If someone asks for some basic help, like this guy is,  in my field I supply it enthusiastically.  You never know when a favor like that will be returned.  And offering someone an ""in"" on the ground floor in a budding business is an opportunity that someone should weigh.  It's not devaluing at all to have it offered.  Fortunes have been made in this manner.  What the logic in saying it's demeaning?  If you don't like the offer just say ""no thank you"" and there, nothing was devalued in your mind.

If you're a jeweler and someone asks you for a diamond ring for free it does not devalue the diamond.  You can always decline to help, but only people that have no concept of the value of their work would think that someone simply asking for free help devalues their work.  You must be one of those people.  And of course I'm aware that a lot of ""ground floor"" offers are bullshit.  I never said they weren't.

All over the country, dominionists are getting their interest-bills passed into legislature to skirt around LGBT/non-believer rights, and in several states, those groups are making those laws backfire to stifle the interest.  In Florida, a bill was passed allowing christian dominionist groups to pass out bibles and foist dominionist propaganda on children in public schools, and it was teacher supported.  Now they are also forced to pass out atheist material as well.  The dominionists are backpedaling.  In Indiana, that bill everyone is talking about is showing up in a massive kind of backfire - there are a number of non-denominationally-proud organizations and businesses denying service to dominionists and claiming religious freedom laws.  Thousands more organizations that do business in Indiana are now withdrawing their business, as well as several business chains.  Indiana's state reps and senators keep defending the bill, but are constantly waffling on TV to keep it spun positively in the public eye.  The only way to fight religiously-oppressive legislature is to play their game of arbitration.  If the arbitration precedent is set, then be arbitrary.  Dominionists rarely consider that there are other belief systems outside of their own, so it really is the only way to teach them that they aren't the only kind of people on the planet.  Making exceptions for muslims in front of them really makes them squirm, as well.  That happened in a gift shop in Gary."

Acadiana,31tpbz,Yohfay,6,Wed Apr 8 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"Were I you, I would avoid walking around too much. I'd pick a stage with the most bands you want to see and stick mainly to that area. In my experience, the most stressful and tiring part of Festival is navigating the crowds.   Probably the most comfortable stage is Scene Lafayette. Lots of grass and trees, plenty of space, usually not too crowded, and plenty of concessions nearby. There's also the Marche des Arts right next to it, so you can check out the vendors and such.   And, y'know, you don't have to stick to that place exclusively, but as a general rule, navigating crowds is hard. It's also best to stand far back from the stage because the noise levels can get pretty high up close."
Acadiana,31tpbz,Yohfay,3,Wed Apr 8 02:31:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Is the Scene Lafayette next to the ""LAFA_ETE"" park?"

As neutral as I can be: the food is somewhere around average (give or take), the service should be decent (they don't keep shitty servers long), and some of the drinks are decently priced. I'd rather eat the food at La Pagua, La Fondas, or even Chili's, but I'd probably have drinks at Agave."

Acadiana,31r7ln,Chamrox,7,Tue Apr 7 18:55:03 2015 UTC,Supposedly the Festival people don't want to give an actual statement because they don't want Zeus to bring a lawsuit.
Acadiana,31r7ln,rd8t,3,Tue Apr 7 19:04:12 2015 UTC,Seems like it'd be pretty cut-and-dry if they broke an actual rule.
Acadiana,31r7ln,Better_Call_Smeeee,3,Tue Apr 7 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. Festival is way too big and great to be bothering with petty stuff like this. They don't need the controversy or bad publicity. Besides, those guys are known to be shady, so that speaks for itself and the know that."
Acadiana,31r7ln,squeamish,9,Wed Apr 8 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"TBH, the food quality at Zeus has gone down hill tremendously over the past couple of years. Watery hummus and burnt meat? No thanks."

Acadiana,31r7ln,bagofboards,2,Tue Apr 7 15:55:00 2015 UTC,"There definitely is more to the story. A few of my friends on the board ""can't comment"" on whatever happened. The article is obviously Zeus' side of the story as all of the comments are from their PR person.  I don't know why people are in such a huff about a mediocre greek restaurant that you can literally find every day in Lafayette and the surrounding areas not having a booth at FI."
Acadiana,31r7ln,pvk8336,8,Thu Apr 9 04:26:31 2015 UTC,Zeus has gotten inedible in the past year. Athena's is far better quality.  I feel like there's a lot more to this. Run em off and let a new vendor havr a shot.

The people there are definitely one of a kind.  I had some awful experiences with a different daycare in town, but I am not here to smudge names, because I know people who use that same daycare and don't mind the constant staff turn over or indifference towards children that aren't perfectly ""normal"" and easy going on the development scale.  But, that's a whole other story.  A-bears kids only is where it's at! Last time I checked their rates were approx. $125/week which I found to be about what other daycare centers were charging for what I would consider subpar care! But I am biased.  If you go tell them Catherine and Adrian sent you.  They know us well."

You can tell the employees are happy to be there and enjoy what they do.  Not just indifferent college kids just there for a check.
Acadiana,310f68,bagofboards,2,Wed Apr 1 11:58:12 2015 UTC,MRW I realize how much childcare costs when we're having a baby in less than a month.
Acadiana,310f68,JoWhackySpack,2,Wed Apr 1 13:22:07 2015 UTC,"Oh honey, prepare your anus and your wallet.  You are going to fork out a MASSIVE amount of money over the next couple years for strangers to do what you already do for free day in and day out, keeping your kid alive and learning.  My kids are 8 years apart and for the first one I worked full time and had to pay for daycare and about 1/3 of my paycheck went straight to the daycare center.  It hurt extra bad giving it to a crappy place.  A-bears took a little of the sting away because I felt I was at least getting my money's worth.  For my now 1 year old I now am lucky enough to have a job where I no longer need child care. I must admit though, for what I am saving in daycare costs I am paying for slightly with sanity points.  This momma was not cut out to be on baby duty 24/7, along with running a business and the now 10 year old with his new found pre-teen attitude! But, I promise.. All insanity aside kids are worth it. Don't stress, it's pointless.  You will find that it's easier to fall into the role of new parent than you think because well once the baby is here, you do what you gotta do and stress does nothing but make simple tasks MUCH more difficult!!! Congrats to you guys and enjoy the roller coaster you are about to jump on!"

Acadiana,310r9i,JudgeJigg,2,Wed Apr 1 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"I used to, but do it no longer due to job schedule and kids.  However, my best advice is ask technicians/receptionists at local vet clinics.  Most of them need some form of supplemental income and get it via pet sitting (I know because that's how I got started).  You get the added bonus of having someone with veterinary medical experience looking after your dog especially since Great Danes and their digestive tract can be an iffy situation to someone who doesn't know any better. There are a couple of actual pet sitting services but I know nothing about them to offer advice, they will probably run higher rate wise than a vet tech moonlighting as a pet sitter.    Edit: for what it's worth I was charging $25/day for 2 visits about 4 years ago, and I was on the cheaper end... you have to remember most boarding facilities are about $20/day on large breed dogs, and pet sitters are usually more expensive than boarding facilities due to the convenience.  Just wanted to put that out there."

Acadiana,30w87x,flashblazer,8,Tue Mar 31 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"That's private property, so technically it's a parking lot and not a road. The speed limit signs are only enforceable by the mall security, who can only ask you to leave the property.   Source: Got a ""ticket"" from those clowns when I was 16."
Acadiana,30w87x,Rinkelstein,2,Tue Mar 31 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"They've got enough reverse speedbumps in that road that it almost requires a jacked-up truck to drive any faster than that, anyhow."
Acadiana,30w87x,InThrowMotion,4,Tue Mar 31 06:40:50 2015 UTC,"How often is it enforced? A speed limit is only as good as the credible threat of ticket. If it's not enforced, then just don't go all crazy there, Speed Racer....  That begin said, the road has a speed limit, but the parking lots inherently do not.  I guess it's a good thing I almost never go to the mall."
Acadiana,30w87x,bab7880,2,Tue Mar 31 10:59:44 2015 UTC,"They're private roads, so the cops won't enforce anything."
Acadiana,30w87x,cajunbander,3,Tue Mar 31 19:48:00 2015 UTC,I remember when the mall was closed on Sundays I would drive the loop around the Goudchaux's side like a race course for fun.   I don't think I'd advise driving five times the current speed limit with speed bumps and other drivers.
Acadiana,30w87x,grumpyolddude,2,Tue Mar 31 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"I was thinking Johnston or Ambassador.

Acadiana,30w87x,cfjedimaster,2,Wed Apr 1 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"I think the speed limit around the mall is necessary, because if you go any faster, the potholes will drag you straight to hell."

Oh right, staying quiet so he doesn't get any political backlash for his eventual failed attempt at a GOP nomination. /sarc  But sarcasm aside, this year they must be hurting. Even as good as the crop should be, it's unusual to find refrigerated F250's running around to businesses selling 30# live sacks of decent sized crawfish for $40. That says they're hurting to sell what they can harvest, which is bad for the fisherman and the crawfish."

Acadiana,30r1j0,rd8t,4,Mon Mar 30 02:31:22 2015 UTC,"Of course, the most ignorant of commentators immediately go ""well, you shouldn't hire immigrants, you should hire legal, American workers"".   Not all immigrant labor is illegal, and in all honesty, it costs more to go the legal route for immigrant labor.  My uncle did this for years, and not only did he pay the worker, but he housed and fed them.  He hired the same worker for almost a decade (ending with my uncles death in 2013) and this man came here and worked his ass off, happy to have the opportunity to work, and for the treatment he received (granted, not all will receive this treatment from their employers).  They ran the boats, sorted the crawfish, sacked it, etc, and also assisted with repairs, and yardwork (in one case, without being asked).    Do you know why farmers go this route, because most American's who run their mouthes dont' have the want or workethic to go out and do backbreaking labor for 12+ hours a day, in the cold early mornings at the start of the season to the hot and humid conditions of the latter half.  It is harsh, miserable work that no matter how much most say is hard, have remotely no idea just how hard it is.  But, those same fuckers will piss and moan over prices and how you need to support 'Murica, all while going out and purchasing packaged crawfish from china, which, is not harvested from ponds, but from latrines, and other waterways used for different wastes...because it's half the price.  People want crawfish, but they don't realize how expensive it is to farm it (seeding, bait, traps, fuel, water, labor) and that the hardest part is not dumping them into a pot of boiling water, but getting them from trap to sack."

It's not an excuse for hiring illegals, being an illegal immigrant, etc. Just sayin', we need an immigrant workforce in order to get things done here."

It's debatable I suppose, but I don't think it's affiliated with UL and it's not intended to be on campus.  They're hanging out today because of Acadiana Pride Fest I imagine. There have been a few times where I yelled at them, made sure that their kids heard that it's not unnatural to be gay, that their Jesus loves them anyway. Fuck 'em.  /u/zydeco sucks and I have talked about grilling on the opposite corner and dressing like Terry from Reno 911, skating around in tank tops. If someone can figure our who they are, I'm sure they have a Facebook and we can give them to attention they want and deserve.  Edit: /u/zydecosucks... not /u/zydeco. Sorry.

Of course, it's far too easy when you can pick and choose hat to follow in your beliefs,  like something about shellfish or a female being allowed to have a voice.   At the end of the day, quit fucking worrying about how others live when it doesn't affect them.   I mean, what's next?   Interracial relationships? Gasp!   I will say this:  I do think that even though I do not agree with them, they have the right to protest, even if it is fundie mouth breather logic.   As long as it's non violent and they aren't harassing or threatening people, do it.   I hold the same to those who protest what I agree with.   Physical threats and harassment are for the ignorant"

A friend had given me the name of her ex in N.O., so I stopped an hour out of town and called him at 9PM, asking for crash space if he had any. He replied that he didn't right then, but no maybe he did. He had an apartment he was going to have renovated, on Magazine Street above his shop, currently empty. If I didn't mind it being a bit disheveled I could stay there for a week or so if I wanted. He then asked if I was coming into town for Jazz Fest. I said ""What's Jazz Fest?""  .....

Lots of new and clean machines, lots of classes (included in costs) excellent pools, locker room facilities, it really has everything. Cost metric is a bit different for me since my wife is a die-hard Red's fan and adding me to the account was only an extra $50 per month or so.

Press the shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shampoo, shampoo in that order.  The drain will open up and a ladder will be presented.  Don't take the ladder.  Wait at least 5 seconds and press the body wash.  The stall across will become an elevator.  Take the elevator to sub-basement B-3.

Unfortunately, I say this with a degree of personal experience. My father used to own a martial arts school on West Congress, and as his son, I was expected to go.

Red's costs you $850+, double the price of a 24hr center that isn't PF.  If you enjoy variety and fitness is an enjoyable activity,  go do a week trial. It becomes a day-long drop off for kids in the summer, which is pretty shitty IMO. Unless there's a program going on, I don't understand why Red's tolerates that."
Acadiana,30dre4,rd8t,8,Fri Mar 27 00:50:17 2015 UTC,It's been a drop off for kids forever.  In the late 70's my parents dropped me off there and I played tennis all day.  Much better than a lot of things I could have been doing.  I see no problem with it.    Red's is very much worth it if you can afford it.

Acadiana,30dre4,jiggy68,5,Fri Mar 27 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"Oh its great for the kids and parents. I just think that's a shitty caveat that you can pay $30 a month instead of childcare and leave your child there all day while you work and let then run amuck,  leaving members and staff to police/babysit them. Ofc, I'm an in & out kinda guy and that's just too much stimulation for me. Exercise is my zen.  Red's is great besides that the sex dungeon in the men's change room."

Acadiana,30dre4,InThrowMotion,2,Thu Mar 26 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"The babysitting service is great for the gym business model in general: that way fewer adults use the equipment and hang out and just eat and drink. When the adult members don't use the primary benefits of their membership, it keeps the overhead down, increasing their profit margin.  And the booze and food almost certainly have better profits than the gym, anyway.  Edit: /s to denote sarcasm, because Nyquil!"

I agree, and I hate a thief more than anything...unless his life was in danger(which, it wasn't), he shouldn't have shot at them.  It's a sad situation all around... from the family who lost their child, to the 2 kids who had to watch their friend die in front of them, all the way down to Seth Fontenot for pretty much throwing his life away (at a VERY young age) over something so menial."
Acadiana,30b3qi,dannytheguitarist,8,Thu Mar 26 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"My biggest thing is this, and I say this as someone who owns and loves guns: any responsible gun owner knows you don't handle a gun unless you intend to use it.   He used it.  If he'd have caught the guys actually in his truck, fine. But he was shooting at someone (and more importantly, HIT someone) who was fleeing.  We all male stupid decisions sometimes, but I can't fathom how you see someone running away and still think they're enough of a danger to necessitate lethal force. A gun should ALWAYS be treated as lethal force. Guns aren't made to politely warn. I agree it can be an effective deterrent, but in the end, only you can control your trigger finger."
Acadiana,30b3qi,pele1410,4,Thu Mar 26 04:33:20 2015 UTC,"someone running away and still think they're enough of a danger to necessitate lethal force   He was probably just thinking that he's going to scare the shit out of them so they don't come back.

Acadiana,30b3qi,realworldshaggy,4,Thu Mar 26 14:57:52 2015 UTC,"So am I the only one that reads those comments and suddenly things ""we need a new plague!  This herd needs thinning"".   I mean, the evidience suggests that shots were not fired as a form of self defense, but that the accused went on the offensive as they were leaving and could no longer be considered a threat.  That doesn't excuse or show innocense for their crime, and it did not justify his actions.  It's not a 2nd amendment issue, and for the lamebrain mouth breathers, no, you can't sit there and say ""well they should have gone after them boys parents for allowing them to be out"".  Those involved are to blame, nobody else.  But of course, it's always the goal of the agenda'd to pass the buck.  In the end, I know a lot of people have this crazed dream they beat off to where they get to off an intruder in the name of self defense that they furiously masturbate to, but the truth of the matter is this:  I'd bet the majority of the big mouths would probably seize up in a panic, or pull the trigger unintentially.  The rest may be justified if it comes to it, or they could end up like this person, where he lived up to the talk, and now he's looking at a decade or two in prison.  Injuries, death, and a thrown away life were not worth what may have been taken or broken into.  I believe in the right to own a firearm, as long as it is done by a stable and responsible individual.  You know who are neither, mouth breathers who need to compensate for a tiny dick and delusions of grandeur (thanks google for fixing my spelling).

Acadiana,30b3qi,rd8t,3,Thu Mar 26 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"I've always felt that the goal should be that if you draw the weapon, the goal should always be to force them to surrender and stand down, and that if a shot is fired, it's because you were left with no alternative.

Acadiana,30b3qi,rapcat,2,Fri Mar 27 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"They were dropping Austin off at his house from a party. Austin lived on the same street as Seth. Even if they were stealing from his truck (no actual evidence to prove that) and were fleeing, Seth would still go to jail. End of story. If your life isn't in danger, you can't kill people.  The fact that you compared teenagers sneaking out of their house late to someone murdering one of them is sickening and ludicrous. There is no defense for it even if they had robbed him.  ALSO: he testified that two of them were wearing a black and white shirt. Which they were. Guessing those two colors is a very baseline and broad guess, especially since it was night time. That doesn't prove they were in his yard. And even IF they were, there's still no fingerprints on the truck, which Seth swore he heard being broken into.  Basically, if he had guessed correctly that they were wearing red and green shirts, then he'd have a better argument. Not to mention he was pretty close to the truck and could have seen inside."
Acadiana,30b3qi,rd8t,0,Fri Mar 27 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"i never said he was justified in shooting them, don't put words in my mouth. what i said was when you steal you run a risk of getting shot   they were trying to steal from him but now have to create some shit alibi to seem like a 100% complete bystander.  if you believe their testimony well i have some volcano insurance to sell you"

I'm grateful that I grew up with minority and gay people in my social groups, because otherwise I'd be blind to the kinds of things that happen on a regular basis around here... and maybe this kind of play is needed to wake people up to the reality that Louisiana is very much part of the South, INCLUDING New Orleans and Lafayette.

I look at the bands ahead of time and see who looks interesting, but I don't make any solid decisions until I'm on the festival grounds.

Homage to something super American,  like blues or jazz, maybe some rockabilly or Americana would be awesome. And no, DTA bands play every wrrk. We don't need rock cover bands.  A stage dedicated to local musicians would be really cool. I feel like they deserve that much. Givers, Catseed Boudin(or whatever) could headline the local roster.

I mean, it seems like the only music festivals we get are cultural music (Internationale, Acadiana, and now this). The few times I went to rhythms they played country or Cajun. Granted, I need to get out more"
Acadiana,305iyx,themarknessmonster,3,Tue Mar 24 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that that type of music is more likely to get a variety of people, more so than say hard rock or rap.  And alot of older people around here grew up on Cajun music, and they're more likely to spend money at these type of events."
Acadiana,305iyx,rd8t,6,Tue Mar 24 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"You're right. It's unfortunate because I'm growing weary of zydeco, Cowboy Mouth, Chee Weez, etc. Festival International is great, but I'd like to celebrate something that isn't cultural or some kind of novelty. I can't be the only one."
Acadiana,305iyx,themarknessmonster,3,Tue Mar 24 19:58:54 2015 UTC,Yea.  There's so many other great genres of music.  It would be nice to have a festival with real variety in Lafayette.  Plus zydeco just feels so cliche.  I know it's fun for the tourists and old folks... But ugh.

If you want a bunch more mileage out of old school Legend of Zelda, this is your setup.  MUGEN: customizable fighting game engine. You can build your own fighting game with your own characters, but the premade ones are pretty good as well, such as DC vs Marvel, Mortal Kombat Project, etc.  OpenBOR: side scroller beat-em-up engine.

Acadiana,3038ma,jiggy68,2,Tue Mar 24 11:11:58 2015 UTC,At Albertson's this morning chicken breasts were 98 cents/pound.  Throw in a 65 cent of can of peas and a salad and you can feed a healthy meal to a family of four for under 6 bucks.    Most veg is ridiculously cheap.
Acadiana,3038ma,rd8t,3,Tue Mar 24 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing, with or without money, people are slaves to convienance.  And in some cases, lazy.   Not many people care to stand in front of a stove tending to something when they can snag something otu of the freezer, fling it in the oven and have dinner ready with the most effort being the disposal of the box.  And in other cases, after working all day, grabbing yoru kids and getting home, not everyone has the energy or will to do the prep work and cook (the cost of an actually healthy, inexpensive meal is the work in preparation).  It's why fast food is so popular, despite the adverse affects to yoru body and the low low quality, it's cheap and easy.  And as far as getting kids to eat healthy, that's a combination of just a child not having a taste for those things combined with the parents attitude, especially now that there is this really dumbass arguement when talking about eating healthy that people will go to how when it's your time it's your time and Jeebus will take you regardless of if you ate healthy or ate burger king 5 times a day, so you might as well be happy (how you can be happy when you weeze instead of breath and have a foot amputated is beyond me).  And I'm not justifying one over the other, but obviously there are different situations and I'll leave the argument for those who need versus those who abuse and are fraudulant to others.  It's always easier to have an opinion on a side of something when you never experienced life on the opposite side of it."
Acadiana,3038ma,jiggy68,3,Tue Mar 24 19:34:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with all of that.  Hell I eat crap food sometimes for all of the reasons above.

Acadiana,3038ma,TotesMessenger,3,Tue Mar 24 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"Because it was a very small town and everyone knew everyone. We were in business when we transferred from paper stamps to EBT. They were being used good as cash, in drug deals, for services, etc. The cards were also misused.  We ID'd because people would give their cards to others for goods or services. Then they began using their children as the middleman to come in and buy things to trade.  Sweeping generalization my ass. We did business in the hood and I saw it taking place. Yes, I know people on welfare that actually do need it. Statistics show that nationwide, it's single white mothers who utilize it most, believe it or not. I'm not ignorant or generalizing whatsoever, so try not to take it that way. Welfare fraud is a thing and to deny it is perpetuating it.  And yes I know how the process works, I've helped people enroll. I've had someone living with me on it and we had to keep separate pantries actually.  You should really check your attitude and quit acting like I'm oppressing the poor or that you're a victim. Some people abuse the system, some dont. You're being butthurt over a personal issue. I'm certain that whoever you knew really did need assistance and that's what the program is for. I think that my opinion is of value because I grew up in commerce, in retail, where our bread and butter was EBT."
Acadiana,3038ma,threetoast,2,Tue Mar 24 16:16:23 2015 UTC,Whatever. I don't feel like having this dialog with you. People abuse the shit out of welfare. I've seen it. That's my experience and you cannot discount that. Get over it.

Acadiana,301c3o,gizibee,2,Mon Mar 23 18:08:59 2015 UTC,which rumors are those? i'm a bit dismayed if prices are going higher as i've heard from many that the high prices of downtown real estate are what's holding back development in the first place as most of the land is owned by people who'd rather sit on it until they find a sucker to pay their crazy prices rather than focus on getting development moving forward in earnest.
Acadiana,301c3o,Chamrox,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"The city has proposed this layout and architectural vision they want downtown to have, but obviously would rather push out the bars and clubs and bring in what is viewed as more professional and appealing businesses.  Obviously their vision of family friendly downtown can't exist with bars, clubs, and such.   Incidently, the first time any of these rumors came up was around the same time  I heard someone utter a rumor about the mckinley strip making a come back.     It could all be dumb rumors, and very much a coincidence that these came out at the same time, but as someone who grew up in small towns, it's not an unheard of tactic when a town and businesses have a sudden vision for how they want a neighborhood or area to be."
Acadiana,301c3o,pele1410,8,Thu Apr 30 16:08:06 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest here. River Ranch IS Lafayette's downtown.  ""Downtown"" is just a bunch of bars. At this point they'd be better off going full ""Bourbon Street"" with it. Block off traffic, put a bunch of live music venues, allow open containers, maybe a strip club or two. Fuck it. I know literally no one who shops there. No one who brings their kids there for anything but the museum. It's just a nightlife area."
Acadiana,301c3o,ZydecoSucks,6,Mon Mar 23 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. I bike down there often,  get gelato, hang out at the parc, grab food during the day, go to a shop or two, etc.   It's certainly not the greatest place after midnight in a Saturday,  but what nightlife area is? They've made a big effort with DTA, Artwalk, etc. I certainly don't think it's a haunch. It's also not as cool and cultural some people make it out to be some times... mediocre at best really."
Acadiana,301c3o,ZydecoSucks,3,Mon Mar 23 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"Better/free parking could improve foot traffic. Also, encourage more shops. It looks dead with all the closed studios, bars, and tattoo shops."

Acadiana,301c3o,dannytheguitarist,2,Mon Mar 23 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"It does seem to fall into line with the rumors I've heard about some bars shutting down due to increased rent.  Plus that weird thing about the McKinley striping ""coming back"".    Or it could all be a big coincidence"
Acadiana,301c3o,realworldshaggy,5,Mon Mar 23 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"That is all true. But I know many people who refuse to go downtown for anything because they just don't feel safe there.  There's always something on the news about people getting in fights after hours, or in the parking garage. Lots of random transients wandering around. Nobody wants to deal with that. It seems there's always some kind of random crazy shit going on down there every time I go. Be it bums begging for change, or people with rucksacks looking for the train station. You could live your whole life in Lafayette and have no reason to go downtown for anything other than if you get summoned to court.  Look, I'm all for them doing it right with a uniform code. But that's not all the area needs. It needs a new reputation."
Acadiana,301c3o,mikebagger,13,Mon Mar 23 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"anything other than if you get summoned to court.   Or the library, or most of the art galleries in town, or the music festivals.

Acadiana,301c3o,deestanleysez,4,Mon Mar 23 20:10:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I think it's understood that when anyone discusses downtown in this context, it's the nightlife. No one complains about daytime downtown. I certainly won't, as my kids love the museum, the children's museum, and especially the splash pad.

Acadiana,301pfg,InThrowMotion,3,Mon Mar 23 22:03:38 2015 UTC,"in another part of the rant, i stated I don't even hate athletic programs.  I did know people who thought that their only shot of getting out of small town hells like I grew up in were either scholarship or military.  Because who wants to get trapped in that cycle."
Acadiana,301pfg,rd8t,6,Mon Mar 23 22:08:32 2015 UTC,"Spending money once on refurbishing a few football fields is a lot cheaper than keeping a school running. And from what I've heard, the school that they'd close is one that lost menu of its students to the Schools of Choice program. It's students are already going to other schools.   You can't get rid of football. It's a huge extra curricular activity that keeps many kids out of trouble and maybe gets kids into college through scholarships that may not have otherwise been able to go to college. The problem with the fields is that they have dips and divots that could potentially hurt kids playing football, soccer, field hockey, playing in the marching band etc. $23,000 a field is small change in comparison to the amount of money they could possibly lose in litigation from an injury.  Just playing devil's advocate."
Acadiana,301pfg,cajunbander,2,Tue Mar 24 03:01:57 2015 UTC,Valid points.
Acadiana,301pfg,FermentingSkeleton,3,Tue Mar 24 03:39:33 2015 UTC,Yep - they can't afford to have my daughter's school renovate the butler buildings or decrease the teacher/student ratio (sad to say I'm glad my child is in special ed with more regulations which protect this at the moment) but god forbid the football fields not be up to par!
Acadiana,301pfg,fieryfish42,3,Mon Mar 23 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"This is a shining, exemplary example of why I detest Lafayette public schools.  I went to Comeaux, class of 1999. We had to hold fucking fundraisers to have a prom because the school bequeathed all its funds (including our prom) to the football field.  If Comeaux didn't have such a shit football team at the time, it wouldn't have been so egregious...except they spent our fucking prom money, homecoming money, etc on it.  Oh, our football field was spectacular. But our 1960s textbooks sure weren't.  Now that I think about it, I learned more on my own in a month than I did my whole time at Comeaux."
Acadiana,301pfg,dannytheguitarist,3,Mon Mar 23 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"Acadia Parish and Jeff Davis Parish are just as bad if not worse.  Jeff Davis seems to always get funding for one school while the rest are left in shambles (in one case, it should be condemed).  I used to hope for local teams to lose just because people there were so obnoxious after they won a title in 1992 (and still need to paint that on murals even today).  I went to school in Iota (also class of 99.  represent).  that is all that town had to live for was football (They also do for girls basketball.  guys basketball, no they suck.  Freshman year they manged to go 0-32 or something).  The head coach could get away with being an overall perv to quiet a few of the girls there, very blatantly I might add.  Overall, I blame a lot of the parents who feel the need to live vicariously through their kids if they are even remotely good, but sure as hell won't brag if they spawned the wizkid who is good at math and science.  I don't even hate sports programs, I'm fine with it, but dammit, why is it that the first thing to get cut is something like music and art, and they have to beg for money and bust ass for anything while athletics get backers with no effort what so ever."

Even at similar ages some wake up still when others don't and at night it's much harder to soothe multiple babies as opposed to at a naptime.

Acadiana,2zqhu4,Chasing_Bacon,3,Fri Mar 20 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"What I've done is began with a layout with source code already established:  **Friday** March 20, 2015    Wild Salmon - Neat | Kickstand (Detroit) | Wray | Derek   That it has the date, venue/location, and then the venue/location. The event itself follows after. This is just baseline for now until someone has a better/easier format idea.  I'm linking the event string variable directly to the source. Most of which is the actual Facebook event page or the website with the event information. This keep it clean and users can reference the link for times, event information, etc. That why it's straight from the horses mouth and we don't flub event information.   Also, I'm not savvy with it, but I think that if someone were to establish a public, Acadiana Google Calendar with a GUI that helps us put in information, that would be super easy. Then you can actually download all of this to outlook, your phone, etc."

If we had a Google docs page that made it easier to input (fields for where, when, description and link) that auto entered it to the calendar,  thst would be cake and anyone could push events into it for approval.   I think the wiki is pretty rad, but a few months of this might be an eyesore and get really tedious.  That and we have to dee of people actually begin using it."

Spending $250,000,000 in tax money to get $50,000,000 is not good when we are seeing a deficit.

They said that they're likely cheaper in Nola because they're running specials to get people into restaurants and that they're likely serving much smaller crawfish that we are, which would explain the upside down price. They've gotten a touch bigger here in Lafayette in the past 3 weeks. So there's supply and demand of a finite resource, and then you also have the size of the crawfish on the platter that affects the price, so it's a weird, double-edged sword thingy goin' on."

Acadiana,2znm8i,ZydecoSucks,2,Fri Mar 20 13:11:16 2015 UTC,Why so much cheaper in Nola?
Acadiana,2znm8i,lobsta042,0,Fri Mar 20 04:58:14 2015 UTC,Because that's where all the crawfish are being shipped due to demand. Our prices are higher because they're harder to get here thanks to the supply being shipped out of the area.
Acadiana,2znm8i,ZydecoSucks,3,Fri Mar 20 11:55:15 2015 UTC,There's also a shit ton of ponds and suppliers around the Bonnet Carre Spillway and Belle River. That's where the majority of NOLA crawfish come from.

Acadiana,2znm8i,jbird41,2,Fri Mar 20 22:19:25 2015 UTC,If demand is high with a product (especially one that has a finite supply) prices should rise to meet an equilibrium between supply and demand. Through in the fact that it naturally costs more to transport crawfish to NOLA and what you're left with is a huge WTF.

Acadiana,2zkvwm,rapcat,6,Thu Mar 19 12:53:38 2015 UTC,closing the school doesn't change the number of students that need to be educated :/  So their plan is to take all these kids and put them into other schools.  Are they going to hire more teachers in these other schools or they going to up the class size from 30 to 40 kids per class.
Acadiana,2zkvwm,SweetperterderFries,5,Thu Mar 19 14:33:35 2015 UTC,Their mobile site is unreadable. What school are they proposing to close?
Acadiana,2zkvwm,SweetperterderFries,6,Thu Mar 19 14:36:19 2015 UTC,"an under performing school on the northside.  They didn't name it.   It's either that or firing people.  I obviously don't know the answer to this situation, but it just seems like removing support by firing nurses, coaches and assistant principals is the last thing you'd want to do in an area with such poor performance to begin with."
Acadiana,2zkvwm,rd8t,6,Thu Mar 19 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"So it's basically a decision made between financials and non real world metrics.  The idea that this number of teachers can accomidate this number of students with this amount of space per facility.  I'm sure somewhere right now, Bobby Jindal is furiously masturbating to these types of news articles and metrics as he desperately tries to rationalize voucher programs"
Acadiana,2zkvwm,rd8t,3,Thu Mar 19 15:32:20 2015 UTC,Voucher programs?
Acadiana,2zkvwm,fishandring,3,Thu Mar 19 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, our governor thought it be good to take tax money to pay for kids to go to private/religious schools rather than researching and figuring out a better way to improve and fund public schools."
Acadiana,2zkvwm,rd8t,4,Thu Mar 19 16:24:59 2015 UTC,... And coupled with that giving massive tax incentives to bring new business to the state. Those new tax free or tax incentivized businesses are resulting in a 150 million dollar shortfall in the education system.

Acadiana,2zkvvi,theregoesanother,3,Thu Mar 19 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"Komen is not a scam. Hear me out.  The problem is that businesses are throwing pink labels on their items and it's out-selling items without pink on it. You're going to buy it anyway, so people grab the can with pink. It's no different than using smile.amazon to give 5% of your money to your favorite charity, NPO, whatever. I'll leave you to think what you will of that.   I'm familiar with this because Wounded Warrior Project recently went through this same thing. There are people, for whatever reason, that are fighting against charities, pumping out misinformation. This is the gist: if you do not know how to read a company's Annual Financial Report, it's easy to be tricked.  NPOs, charities, have income and expenses. They have revenue and profit. They are a business. Some of the expenses include paying salaries, buying office supplies, advertising, etc. To someone who isn't educated in business or finance, I suppose it's easy to get suckered into thinking this.   Please, please, please, please, please look at this and support financial transparency.. Look at page 17. Look at Public Support and Revenue. That's $393,000,000 in support in 2012 and $308,000,000 in 2013. I feel like some of the decrease can be attributed to misinformation, and that's not fair. That's horseshit.   The idea that little money goes to research is bs. What people fall victim to is thinking that ALL of the money goes directly to research, but a LOT of money goes to support, programs, therapy, medical assistance, etc. The ""research"" angle is so bad. Research falls under Expenses>Program Services in business. If you work the numbers... of course you can come up with ""only 15%"" when you're dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions per year.   People are doing the same thing with WWP and the guy who started it was sued pretty fucking bad by them for perpetuating lies about a program that serves veterans. I just ask that everyone do some research and look at the numbers, and don't perpetuate calling helpful charities ""scams."" This hurts everyone."
Acadiana,2zkvvi,theregoesanother,4,Thu Mar 19 14:31:53 2015 UTC,In fact most of the money raised by Komen Acadiana affiliate stays HERE in Acadiana to benefit local women.
Acadiana,2zkvvi,pele1410,3,Thu Mar 19 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"There are things that I'm not so educated on, that being the trademarking and whatnot. I don't have an opinion on that because I haven't made time to research it. I'm going to assume either they have a good reason or it's misinformation until I learn otherwise, considering the mass misunderstanding/ignorance with the finances."
Acadiana,2zkvvi,theregoesanother,2,Thu Mar 19 14:44:51 2015 UTC,"End of day, my main train of thought is that at end of the day, as long as it's going to help people, in whatever form, I""m good.  It's why I've talked up Miles Perret over the years, because I've seen directly what they do for people.  So of course it's easier because I've seen it.  So, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I do think there are multiple sides, the side that questions how much a charity actually does (some to an extreme), the side that supports in some way (actually does something) the side that blindly follows, etc.  And the ones who think buying something that is pink or has a ribbon believe they are doing something to help, when actually the company is doing it to push sells and labels it as raising awareness rather than money (years ago, there was an article about a company selling pink office supplies that donated none of the sales proceeds, but simply said they were raising awareness for a cause.  I kind of dislike that strategy, as it does nothing but pad profits of people with good intentions)."
Acadiana,2zkvvi,pele1410,3,Thu Mar 19 15:05:33 2015 UTC,"I want to believe that the pink isn't profit strategy. I feel like it's quite obvious that people who are going to buy something anyway are going to elect to have some of their money do some good. I feel like the public, someone, is twisting this perspective for the sake of internet traffic.  Let's face it. It makes news stories and drives web traffic when you develop an idea like this."
Acadiana,2zkvvi,theregoesanother,4,Thu Mar 19 15:10:30 2015 UTC,"this report was from a few years ago, so it may take a while to find it, but it pretty much admitted in their financial releases that they had not donanted to any of the charities.   It's easy to become jaded and view things one sided, hell, I'm guilty at times, but, there are a lot of people who think raising awareness is the be all end all.  I kow that this sounds a bit arrogant, but I think after a while, we can admit to being aware of the problem, now, what can we do now to solve, or at least improve the conditions beyond that."
Acadiana,2zkvvi,rd8t,0,Thu Mar 19 15:17:37 2015 UTC,Well you have zero sources so that makes me question the credibility of this story. What does it mean to take too high of a percentage of money? I doubt they did this out of spite.   I think you're full of it.

Call 911 immediately Absolutely do not move the patient. There could be a suspected spinal injury, and moving the patient can do significant damage Apply pressure to any bleeding  Only start CPR if you're trained to do so   Beyond that, it's best left to the professionals. I hate to be the buzzkill, but there's not a whole lot civilians can do in first aid emergency situations. If you need to know more than this, by all means take a first aid class."

Acadiana,2zcmny,mikebagger,7,Tue Mar 17 14:01:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the horrible traffic doesn't allow you to look at what's around you.  Instead, you have to keep constant vigil for someone cutting you off at the last second, changing lanes and slamming on the brakes, or coming to a complete stop in the left lane to turn and/or to get into the turning lane.  To make matters worse, it's one of the ugliest areas on that side of town.  Most of the store fronts are old and unexciting.  Hell, if I ever did pay attention to what was on Johnston St, I'd probably be surprised to see what's actually there."
Acadiana,2zcmny,StephenFish,3,Tue Mar 17 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"I think that is pretty much it.

Acadiana,2zcmny,StephenFish,4,Sat Mar 21 01:29:07 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. Maybe it's because I avoid Johnston as much as possible.

Acadiana,2zcmny,mojoronomous,2,Tue Mar 17 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Same here. I think at least part of it has to do with the cross streets being angled. Few of the major (any?) intersections are a straight 90 degree intersection.  For example, If you're on ambassador at the light crossing Johnson, all you see is the Daiquiri place, Phares, and maybe Lafayette shooters. You don't really see what's on the left corner.   I'm saying, at intersections that are 90 degrees, you get a good bearing of where things are. Here, where everything is angled, you really only become accustomed to half the picture."

They have a 20ish mile long hiking/biking trail that goes around the lake with campsites set up intermittently along the way.  There is also a campsite on the island in the lake accessible by kayak or canoe.  It's our favorite camping spot because it's not that far of a drive.  And the trail is long enough that you can break it up over a weekend.

For strictly hiking, the Azalea Trail in the Kisatchie National Forest is also available. Not really much in the way of designated campsites, but nice.   Like at Chicot, some of the sites at LFP are on a short trail, others are accessible only by water, and one is both on the water and on a trail. I love the paddle-only sites, and though they are a few dollars more, there is almost no chance one will be taken whenever you want to camp.  I strongly recommend not camping between about June and late October or November, as the bugs are unbelievable.  There's also a paddle club in town that was instrumental in getting the paddle campsites built. Good place for tips on camping and making friends with a mostly middle-aged set that likes to camp and paddle."

Acadiana,2z09zs,pele1410,2,Sat Mar 14 12:37:45 2015 UTC,Husband of the CEO of Reddit.  Local Louisiana Fat Cat. Allegedly ran an investment scheme that closely resembled a Ponzi Scheme which bilked a ton of money out of retirement accounts here in Louisiana.  Multiple posts discussing it (some with thousands of upvotes) have just been hidden away from any front pages.  You can only find them if you have a link directly to the page.  Many other people have reported being shadow-banned for discussing it.

And an update HERE which caused some accusations of favoritism.  There is a bunch more out there.  Go digging! Errr... Redditing!
Acadiana,2z09zs,Clumsybritt,3,Sun Mar 15 02:11:02 2015 UTC,"Had to google to sort it out. That's a messy situation. I don't know why it's getting banned on other subs. It's a legit legal case.   From just a few clicks, it looks like a typical investor gone bad situation. I feel bad for the pensioners getting screwed. As for his wife's suit, that's going to be a hot mess, as discrimination suits often are."

I'm not really sure what birds do when they're frantic and trying to find their mama.  I heard one story about how a bird got out and was found 10 months later in another state.  So I'm not really sure what to do about that"

Try calling up the local Legion. They might have some local connections. There's also a ton of construction and oil/gas firms that value the work ethic of most veterans."
Acadiana,2yzm6k,rapcat,3,Sat Mar 14 12:47:29 2015 UTC,Maybe check with Truston Technologies.  Erick Knezek is the owner (he is also on the Lafayette school board) and he was/is a Navy guy.  Not sure if he is hiring but it won't hurt that you guys were both in the Navy.
Acadiana,2yz5h9,ElectricBlitz,5,Sat Mar 14 01:33:54 2015 UTC,The place youre looking for is the Power-Up LAN center. I used to frequent there alot and its a really great place. They hold LAN tournaments alot. (I've been in a few of their League of Legends tournaments)

I noticed that in this thread some of you guys had already suggested us and I'm glad you guys had a positive experience!  Power Up has tons of people who play Counter Strike: GO, LoL, WoW, DOTA 2, Smite, etc!  If PC gaming is something that interests you then come check us out.  We give a free hour of game-time to new customers and also a free hour when you refer a new customer.  About the inquiry here about hosting LAN tournaments, Power Up hosts tournaments all the time!  We are trying to build a larger community for CS:GO to do a big tournament for it.  Feel free to contact us if you would like to host your own tournament.  We post all our events on our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/PowerUpLANCenter.  I'd be happy to answer questions about the LAN center on here if there's anything you want to know!

Acadiana,2ywn1j,rapcat,5,Fri Mar 13 15:26:32 2015 UTC,Maybe not burqas.   I remember a while back there was one parked on Robley and it was really muddy and rainy that day so someone pulled their truck in front of it and started peeling out and just covered the whole front of the car in the mud.   Edit: I didn't see it happen. I can only assume that this is what had happened because the whole front side of a speed can was covered in mud and the ground in front was a little torn up.
Acadiana,2ywn1j,cheez0r,8,Fri Mar 13 20:06:42 2015 UTC,I get so mad when I see someone brake for no reasons because there is a speed van.  You were already doing 20 on Johnston because it was raining.  How slow do you want to go?
Acadiana,2ywn1j,waltc97,6,Fri Mar 13 13:22:47 2015 UTC,New to the area. What is a speed van? I haven't noticed one yet...
Acadiana,2ywn1j,cheez0r,4,Fri Mar 13 14:41:13 2015 UTC,It's not a police van (it may be operated by Redflex) with cameras that issues photo tickets for speeding violations. It is moved around at the whims of the P.D.
Acadiana,2ywn1j,itsrattlesnake,2,Fri Mar 13 14:49:20 2015 UTC,Ew. How much are the fines?
Acadiana,2ywn1j,waltc97,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"That's the best (worst) part. Fines are typically $20-ish. I welcome discussion, but it seems the reasoning is that few people will go to court over a fine so low, but they do report to insurance and if you attempt to evade paying, something happens between nothing and credit score torpedo."

Acadiana,2ywn1j,ZydecoSucks,2,Fri Mar 13 16:25:29 2015 UTC,I'm sure alot of people pay them.  And the parish can't enforce them.  They've tried to and failed.
Acadiana,2ywn1j,bruce656,2,Fri Mar 13 17:18:37 2015 UTC,"it's mainly paid by people who don't want anything sent to collections.  And i know some have found ways to challenge, but a lot of people are very watchful and protective of their credit, and do not want something like a $25 charge bringing down their rating.  Personally, I think it's very much horseshit that this program exists."
Acadiana,2ywn1j,rd8t,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, even if they do report you to a debt collector, the collection company can't enforce anything because you've never entered into a contract with the company turning you over. I believe someone's got a file form for the response you send the creditor explaining so."

When you consider what some users manage to do, the ability to go out and see who else has experienced this special kind of hell is a lifesaver."

If you can provide some info about the motherboard, the slots it has (photos even), how much ram you have, how much space you have left, what kind of slot your graphics card is in, etc, we can lead you in the right direction.   Personally, I have a damn box full of dual core processors, RAM, power supplies, a graphics card, a motherboard, etc, they are up for grabs if they fit. My house/work is like a PC graveyard. Also, download Malbytes and a good anti-virus. It's cheaper than repairs and paying a computer tech. I personally like Norton Systemworks 3.0+, AVG (free), etc. Sometimes if you work for a big company, they will actually give you a free, or $10 copy, as a perk so that you don't infect work computers with your personal PC/thumbdrives."

Now, as a computer guy, I'm a big fan of Windows XP, my fave. However, Microsoft no longer supports XP security. That's your first problem. W7 Will cost you about $40 for a home version.  Your processor is fine. I recommend a quad core i5 or i7, but for what you're doing with it.  You have: Dual channel shared DDR2 SDRAM system memory. Unbuffered, non-ECC DIMMs only. The PC only supports 8GB RAM (2GB per channel).. Do you have extra slots for RAM? You should have two more that you can simply snap 2x2GB sticks into! These are like $24.99 shipped on Amazon.  You're likely using onboard graphics, which is crap for gaming. You will need to find a graphics card that fits either: PCI-Ex1, PCI, or PCI Express x16 slots.

Acadiana,2ywwbr,pseudoguru,2,Fri Mar 13 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"You are such a lamb! Thank you!!    I still have the issue of the possible virus that has been installed, what do I do about that part of it?  Would removing the OS and upgrading to windows 7 take care of that issue?  Is there a way to limit download activity on windows 7 or would the virus software offer that?"
Acadiana,2ywwbr,pseudoguru,2,Fri Mar 13 15:23:22 2015 UTC,"It's likely that if you reformat and put a new OS on it that it would fix it... but I recommend running Malbytes first, maybe even restoring to factory settings, running Malbytes immediately, and then installing a antivirus afterwards. Make a separate profile for your kid and lock down the admin profile. I'm really not familiar with parental controls and stopping downloading, but some antiviruses have that built in.   Also, ask your ISP if they have free antivirus! Most of them offer a copy for download!"

Acadiana,2yvomz,ThrwAwayAcadie,10,Fri Mar 13 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"I've got to agree with /u/rapcat on if you want to see change here, make it.  And I'll go over a few points.  The weekly Cards against humanity game is open to anyone who shows up to Smitty's to play.  Nobody has been denied a chance to play, and despite how cynical people tend to be on here, it's a fucking blast.  (Just give a little business to Smitty's while there, buy food or some beer.  That crew has been super accomidating)  I've started most of the threads on tabletop gaming, and I've also brought up the smell that was experienced  on a saturday at And Books Too during MTG tournament.  Me and my wife went in to buy books, and what we experienced was a building full of individuals who lived up to one of the most negative stereotypes that gets stuck to a particular culture.  In one case, one that passed by and caused my wife to gag, and not in the mocking way, in the legit, we have to leave or i'm going to puke way.  I get that when you stink, everyone around you will know well before you will, but please, if you have access to a shower or bathtub, please, use it... And if you don't, um, I'd maybe re-evaluate if MTG cards are a sound financial decision... Those things are pricey.  Despite the comments of some, not all people who work in the oil field or the attached industries are awful mouthbreathing jerks.  The majority are some pretty ok, and even cool, people, even if we do share a large difference in opinions.  With that said, there is a pretty small percentage of them that fit a particular stereotype of big ego, entitled, live beyond their means type, and they tend to be the bain of my professional existance (I work IT for an energy company).  Their spouses are worse (they tend to be the oilfield equivalent of army wives, and love to throw it around).  The rest, even if I don't see eye to eye, are ok people.  The MS Paint thing, was funny, and if you had ever met /u/theRobisaur in person, go back and look at his, and it's fucking funny as hell.  As far as the speed dating thing, I find it more absurd that it's in a grocery store... I find a bar in the middle of a grocery store abusrd, but obnoxious joking aside, to each their own.  In the end, their kidding around, and there are some that do go the route of katc commentators with their replies.  There is always a line, and some will cross.  And I will completely raise my hand up and admit to goofing off and trolling.  It's the internet.  I'll admit to understanding the use of a throwaway, but I always see throwaways and ask ""has the person who created that partaken in said trolling as well?""  So, it's hard to take it all seriously because yes, it happens, and I'm sure 90% of the subscribers who do more than lurk are guilty.  In the end, if another sub gets made, it'll end up having the same thing happening, or it's made private and only a select few join... in which case, it's just for the ""elite"" redditers of acadiana.  So, how difficult is it, out of curiosity, to add a button for the posts to make event, serious, etc, and those posts get the ""if you troll, it gets deleted or whatever"".   Thoughts?"
Acadiana,2yvomz,rd8t,9,Fri Mar 13 14:47:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for calling my post interesting and fun!
Acadiana,2yvomz,MonkeyKing_,6,Fri Mar 13 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"I've been on Reddit for too long.  I never thought this sub was worse than any other because, well, it isn't.  Reddit is home to trolls, name-callers, and assholes.  The fact that this sub is no different, does not make it stand out.  It makes it blend in."
Acadiana,2yvomz,jefuchs,5,Fri Mar 13 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"I don't do content moderation, I only do CSS fixing-up. But speaking from an outsider's perspective (literally, I live in Colorado, I'm just from Avoyelles) I think you're hyping yourself up a little too much for what this sub is supposed to be. You say ""I love this city"", but this sub encompasses a good chuck of the state, not just one city. Also, to my knowledge, this sub isn't limited to just a certain type of content. If the members want it to be then they should organize and petition the mods to provide posting rules and whatnot. The mods can get together and create guidelines and put it on the sub's sidebar so people know what type of content will be allowed and what will be removed.  Again, these are just observations from someone who no longer lives in the area and was just asked to make the sub look OK. Take my ramblings with a grain of salt."
Acadiana,2yvomz,vegetaman3113,11,Fri Mar 13 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"You have to consider that this is a small community on Reddit, and an actual community on Earth. That means you are dealing with all different kinds of people in relation to the area. I have seen posts that have gotten out of hand (I'm looking at you Arcadiana), but there are also very informative posts about news and events. The latest one is about Pi day, and I will be taking my daughter to the event. It's just like every real community, lots of different kinds of folks, not everyone is going to get along.  TL;DR  Not everyone will agree always, just a fact of life."
Acadiana,2yvomz,rapcat,12,Fri Mar 13 07:34:35 2015 UTC,And the sad part is the people who don't agree are getting downvoted to oblivion below when expressing their views.

If you and others do it enough, it may stop.    I'd also ask you to be the change you want to be, and submit content and comments that are as great and open minded as you want this sub to be.  This very post has garnered 38 votes and spawned quite a discussion!  We're not a default sub, we're pretty small and I think it'd be pretty easy to make a positive impact.  I also personally disagree that this sub is as toxic as you see it.  Looking at the top 25 posts on /r/acadiana, only 3 posts or so are circlejerky or 'toxic'.  That's barely 10%!  No doubt the bad comments represent a similar portion of all comments.  It's a natural tendency for the squeaky wheel to get all the attention, though.  Finally, a heavy handed moderation team kills a sub far faster than the occasional circlejerky post or asshole user.  I appreciate the lax hand that my comrade mods use to reign over this sub."

Acadiana,2yvomz,squeamish,10,Fri Mar 13 13:27:46 2015 UTC,See I'm the opposite.  KATC's site sucks so much that I don't bother going there.  I think that the articles that get posted here would atleast be relevant to my interests.

Acadiana,2yvomz,squeamish,7,Fri Mar 13 13:38:38 2015 UTC,Oh I wasn't talking about posting all articles.  I always thought the articles that did get posted were relevant to the sub's community.  Those were the articles I would probably have wanted to read anyway.

Hence this poop-flinging thread with its ~30 comments and ~30 upvotes and your positive references with 0 comments and 4 upvotes.   The love you take is equal to the love you make, kids. If all you pour into a community is apathy and negativity, the community will be nothing but apathetic and negative. Ironically, this statement will cause those very folks to downvote it... but it's got to be said regardless. Even if a single hipster checks his superiority at the door because of it, the cost was worth it. ;)"
Acadiana,2yvomz,themarknessmonster,6,Fri Mar 13 13:12:42 2015 UTC,Yea unfortunately people use the upvote/downvote site mechanics more so when they are emotionally invested in whatever is being said so posts like this get an unusually high amount of feedback. This is not to say that it's high quality content or anything.  Recently I've been joining smaller subs and leaving the bigger ones and I've noticed lots of good quality posts don't get upvotes much at all.   I have had to reassess how much value I place in overall upvotes as a result. I think it helps if you can totally disassociate the two.
Acadiana,2yvomz,SweetperterderFries,2,Fri Mar 13 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly what I do.  Up/downvotes could EASILY come from lurkers who contribute nothing or people in a voting brigade like SRS or TRP.  Especially for small subs, if you watch the comment numbers and read the tone of people who actually contribute? It tells a completely different story.  There are a lot of people who will use karma and the voting mechanics as a weapon to silence dissent, which makes it an absolutely terrible mechanic for fostering discussion in smaller subs like this one."

Instead of 4 posts being made about different events, you now have one being made by a mod. I dunno. It would be nice to see everything in one thread though."

Acadiana,2yvomz,StephenFish,5,Fri Mar 13 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"Also, what's wrong with the sub the way it is?  If a community itself is so toxic in culture, why can't an internet forum be an avenue of grief/reflection of ridiculousness/expression of satire about said culture?  If the entire sub is comprised of posts making fun of Michael Jackson 2.0 and her dogs, Berry the Deservedly Lambastable, Joey the Clown - who can only pick up one paper bag to save his life, but deposits tens of thousands of our tax dollars into the speed bump and roundabout company, but can't seem to find any money to fix roads on major arteries, a bar scene that can't manage to keep people from stabbing each other on a weekly basis, serious quantities of political and community-pillar infighting like children, and a not-so-close-knit community of dumbfucks who regularly post about the wrath of god in every Facebook post KATC and KLFY makes about anything even remotely progressive whatsoever...can you see how this place is an escape for some of us?  Post posts you like.  Involve your friends.  Make this community what you want it to be.  Bitching about a user-submitted community built on the interests of the users who submit is tantamount to foolishness.  /rant"
Acadiana,2yvomz,rd8t,7,Fri Mar 13 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"You're right. I'll give you that. I do want to point out however, that if a sub on Reddit makes you ashamed to be here... then you need to take a break from the internet and grow some thicker skin. This is nature of the internet unfortunately. Sorry, hun.   This sub was dead, even for a regional sub full of uninteresting shit like finding roommates, looking for select size potatoes at the market, and historical facts. Even the mods themselves have stated that traffic is significantly up and users are becoming more active. Yes, we've had some shitstorms. The Acadiana Internet Justice League is strong and swift. We've learned from it and it hasn't got that bad since.   I do want to point out that I've yet to see truly misogynist threads. Trust that sometimes redditards joke, have a good time, and someone who is less tactful comes in and says some pretty hardcore, asshole stuff. I can't help that. That's a job for the mods. The mods aren't fun police, nor are they accepting hurt-feels reports, sorry.  I'm a big fan of the burlesque group which includes ladies, men even, of all shapes and sizes. Fuck, I even bought gold for a performer that nicely told off some dickhead that made fun of one of the performers on a post once. Redditors bailed a dude out of jail once when he was taken in on bs charges after posting some crazy art in town. We go to peoples events that are important to them. Good shit happens here. Hell, I met a lot of my current, best friends via this sub. Remember when one user was threatened to have his ass whipped after doxxing himself via showing his art/work in the sub? Remember people putting an end to it immediately? Remember months later when he actually got his ass whipped and we were doing what we could to help, sharing posts and looking for the d-bag who did it? Point is, people drag shit into here sometimes unknowingly, so check yourself before you post.   We've been having meetups despite it had getting to the point where no one showed up, even when users said they'd bring a keg of home brew and cake. People have been meeting up lately to play cards, board games, these past few months, and good times are being had. Some of the inside jokes and fun has been bleeding off into the sub via them dank-ass memes, son. It's the nature of the game and maybe we should all take a moment to consider feelings, and that some of the subject matter is unsuitable. Hell, even the mods are posting memes and jokes. Someone drew a dick in MS Paint. Whoopty-fucking-do.  If someone's being sexist, over the top, misogynistic, an asshole, etc, call them out and tell the mods. IMO, the speed dating event is fair game. It's funny. When it turned into comments about individuals (whom I am friends with and know well coincidentally, very good person) that was a bit too much. I don't want to hear shit about jokes about tabletop gamers. We joke about them, but it's irony/sarcasm because half of the people in this sub are gamers of some sort, tabletop gamers. That's the joke. Get it?  Tl;dr Yes, some people need to access their content before they post. Lafayette is very small and it's easy for things to get personal. The more your post, the more personal it's going to get. That's like a law of the internet or something. Also, grow some fucking thick skin or discontinue activity if you can't handle a fucking joke. There are assholes, yes, but this is not a place for sexism, misogynist activity. Everyone please check yourself, look over the reddiquette, and be mindful of anonymity. Some of us don't mind a lack of anonymity in a regional sub (I personally dgaf) but we don't have to dox people that aren't part of the sub for sure.  Edit: Oh, and that MS Paint selfie thing is fucking hilarious. I spent my entire lunch break doing mine and it's hot af. Go upvote it bc honestly, it hurts my feels that my MS Paint skills are not being appreciated. I am an artist."
Acadiana,2yvomz,rd8t,3,Fri Mar 13 13:24:52 2015 UTC,"To note this, a couple of years ago I discussed on here the possibility of a meetup, gathering, whatever you call it, and the interest just seemed small for organizing something monthly.  I had in mind something similar to the old Net2Lft meetups that kind of died back in 2011 (Organizers real lives had gotten too busy to continue), but a bit more informal in that you find someone to talk about a project, a hobby, art, collecting, etc  (Say, find one of the local comic artists, and do a Q&A, enjoy some beer and meet other people).    Then I questioned if I really had the patience to find a venue, organize it, and promote it to get people to show up.  Just seems like a lot of work and it end up having a crowd of 5, which, lets face it, if you find someone to show up and talk about what they do or what they are working on, it's pretty shitty to them.  At least with the CAH group, I've met some pretty rad people."

Acadiana,2yvomz,InThrowMotion,4,Fri Mar 13 12:55:32 2015 UTC,There's a handful of jerks that have turned this sub from tolerable to unreadable in the past few months in particular.

Acadiana,2ytwvu,rd8t,5,Thu Mar 12 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"This workshop is open to anyone.  And we mean Anyone.  We're offering the opportunity for you to perform on stage in front of a private audience.  During 6 rehearsals, We'll pair you with a troupe member who will choreograph a piece just for you based on whatever style act you choose.    If you'd prefer to perform onstage with a buddy, we offer the ability to perform as a duo or a trio.  You will also be able to borrow from a huge trunk of gloves, boas, stockings, shoes, dresses, you name it.  You should see all the shit we have!     Friday May 15th you'll be invited to a pasty making and bedazzling party where we'll watch Campy Burlesque movies, drink wine, and glam up your costumes.    Finally, May 23 we will doll you up and throw you on stage for a grand review!  The audience is by invite only, so no worries about your boss showing up.  We will also ask that audience members not take photos. However, a professional photographer will be there to capture your big moment!  Acts are not restricted to burlesque peels, dancing, or singing. Anything you want to bring to the stage, we will do our best to facilitate :D   This is going to be a really fun and unique experience"

Acadiana,2ytwvu,Rhineaux,4,Thu Mar 12 20:31:09 2015 UTC,"haha, I totally understand.    Unfortunately, we don't have many men in our troupe who can lend costumes.  We're hoping however that some guys are brave enough to join the workshop.  Despite the stereotype, straight guys do burlesque too.    I saw an AMAZING tongue in cheek act once where this man was in 70s garb with a handlebar mustache and he did the most hilarious routine I've ever seen.  The best way I can describe it would be ""baby, come rub my belly.""    It was so...so...so very impressive."
Acadiana,2ytwvu,rd8t,2,Thu Mar 12 20:37:24 2015 UTC,"I'll be serious in that I'm rarely jealous of what other people have as much as I am of attitudes, mentalities, and balls/overies to just go out and do things and give little to no fucks.  Especally what you and others do, where you do something that exposes yourself for all to see, where others are made to feel embarassed and vunerable because society is so damn immature over even something as common as a goddamn nipple.  I mean, a guy whips out a nipple, and rarely does anyone get offended, but omg holy shit what the fuck, a woman shows a nipple, and she's an immoral whore.  That mentality is so much so that something as simple and common as breast feeding causes outrage, and of course, the word morality gets thrown around and this becomes a cuase to protect the children.  Because no parent should ever have to use their mouth other than breathing and shoveling in Lays bbq potato chips (TM).  Imagine how bad it would be to explain that ""she is a mommy and her breast (it's not a dirty word, I bet the kid has eaten a chicken breast) produces food for the baby, and the concept is similar to a bottle, and the mommy's nipple is functional, while daddy's nipple is just for decoration.    Also, just because I'm on a roll, all the holier than thou types who are so disgusted with nudity own technology that more times than not contains photos and videos of dicks, tits, and vaginas.  And it's always the loudest of those morally upright citizens that do this..How do i know, because I've fixed their fucking laptops, phones and cameras.  I've seen it, and know what, even if it's awkward, I move the fuck on.  So, with all of that obnoxious ranting behind me, I think what you ladies and guys do is cool as hell, keep making badass art and performances."

Acadiana,2yohh1,cfjedimaster,3,Wed Mar 11 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"I doubt that they'd have plans to lower the cost. HBO Now has yet to launch so it's still up in the air whether it'll be successful or not.   For someone who already has cable service, the $3 isn't a bad deal considering you'd get HBO in HD, HBO Go which would give you access across your devices, DVR capability, and also On Demand, which is a really nice perk. If I were to get HBO, I would personally just include it in my cable package in order to bundle it and not having a completely different service/bill. I think it just depends on your situation and needs."
Acadiana,2yohh1,rd8t,2,Wed Mar 11 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"I think (could be wrong though) that HBO Now includes HBO Go - so you get live + the ability to pick shows. Just limited to one device though. As it stands, I only DVR HBO shows when I remember it, and if I don't have to record them to watch when I want, then it won't matter. ;)   But yeah - def too early for LUSF to respond - just curious if other folks in town will be trying it out."

Acadiana,2yl204,bruce656,2,Wed Mar 11 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"You do realize that they just hosted Tom Segura, right? These people aren't Louis CK famous, but they're hosting comedians that've actually opened for Louis CK and been on very popular comedy shows and whatnot. I wouldn't call them D-listers. For those who follow the comedy circuit, this is actually really impressive for the Lafayette comedy scene."
Acadiana,2yl204,bruce656,2,Wed Mar 11 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but for those of us who don't follow the comedy circuit, which I would wager would be the majority of people here, it would be nice to explain who these guys are. It's also just kind of what you do when you're trying to market something."
Acadiana,2yk9se,atchafalaya,8,Tue Mar 10 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"To do the I-49 expansion properly, they basically need to do what Houston did to the Katy Freeway section of I-10.  They would need enough width to put a six-lane limited-access concrete-foundation highway through the corridor (with emergency shoulders) and also have two-lane one-directional service roads down each side from I-10 to at least past the airport.   Most of it would also have to be raised on earthen works to provide a relatively flat roadbed (none of this up and down crap) while preserving room to allow the major surface cross-streets (Pinhook, Louisiana, Cameron, and Willow) to pass underneath the highway and intersect with the service roads.  Preferably, access to the highway itself would be limited to 2 or 3 total entrance/exit ramps that merge into the service road in between the major cross-streets."
Acadiana,2yk9se,Silound,3,Tue Mar 10 15:17:37 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't it be cheaper to just widen the existing lanes and build overpasses crossing it?
Acadiana,2yk9se,Silound,6,Tue Mar 10 16:51:06 2015 UTC,"Cheaper in the short term possibly, but not for the long term. Mostly because the stretch from Northgate Mall all the way south to Pinhook Rd is not up to Interstate highway quality and would need to be replaced anyway.   As far as the decision on raised/above grade/grade/below grade, that will probably be based on how many dollars the state can beg the federal government for. It should be done in a way to properly avoid short-term issues and give room for expansion 5-15 years in the future, but Louisiana isn't very good at looking ahead to the future when planning.  The single biggest factor they have to fight is the constant desire of highway planners to treat Interstate highways as city-streets instead of limited access highway (they like to put an entrance/exit at every road). That mistake was made on both I-10 and US 190 going through Baton Rouge, and now the surface traffic trying to use I-10 contributes heavily to the congestion during the day.  edit: spelling"
Acadiana,2yk9se,Silound,3,Tue Mar 10 17:16:05 2015 UTC,So upgrading the ground level would be more expensive than building an elevated roadway?
Acadiana,2yk9se,Silound,3,Tue Mar 10 17:18:58 2015 UTC,"More expensive up front, less cost incurred in the long run."

It's also part of the state's budget every year maintaining I-110 for a reference point.  I will try and find some to post tomorrow."
Acadiana,2yk9se,rd8t,2,Wed Mar 11 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"how many dollars the state can beg the federal government for   It also depends on who's doing the begging. I know Jindal's going to be out soonish, but here's hoping the next gov doesn't follow his lead and just refuse federal money all the time."
Acadiana,2yk9se,cajunbander,2,Tue Mar 10 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, if our next governor is anything like Jindal, or our senators, Senator Ass and Senator Clown, they'll be too busy mailing poorly written letters to world leaders instead of actually doing something for this state.  Before you know it, our schools will only be able to afford textbooks written in the 50s, a couple of group pencils and a school sharpener, and healthcare will be limited to a guy handing out swigs of Robitussin.

Acadiana,2yk9se,rd8t,3,Thu Mar 12 21:49:32 2015 UTC,"Eminent Domain would come into play heavily with all of the private and commercial property that would have to be bought out to accomplish this (shit storm 1), in some areas, you would need a service/feeder road for access between the streets that would cross/be crossed via overpass. and lastly, it's Louisiana, where the politicians are more worried about trivial shit that affects re-election.  I think one thing most agree is it should have all been I-49 all the way through to New Orleans long ago, and lafayette should have had some kind of loop that passes somewhere in scott, south of youngsville between New Iberia, outside of Louisiana ave, and around carencro  (If someone has suggestion on better locale, I'm all ears, my thoughts have been more a loop that is accessible before getting into lafayette.  I'm going off an obviously uneducated guess when it comes to engineering)"
Acadiana,2yk9se,squeamish,2,Tue Mar 10 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"What should have been done is the Thruway should have been an interstate all along. When Ambassador was built, it was intended to be an expressway from one side of Lafayette to the other. However, because it was a state highway, not an interstate, real estate boomed and we have what we have now.  Ambassador should have been made into a spur of I-10 that went all the way to I-49 taking the route it currently takes (remember, this hypothetical has 90 as I-49 all the way to New Orleans). This would essentially make a loop with I-10, I-49, and I-210 (or whatever number would be assigned to the I-10 spur)."
Acadiana,2yk9se,cajunbander,3,Tue Mar 10 20:44:10 2015 UTC,"Louisiana, the takes 5 tries before getting it right state)  210 is the lake charles loop actually"
Acadiana,2yk9se,squeamish,2,Tue Mar 10 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"I-210 (or whatever number would be assigned to the I-10 spur).   Spurs begin with odd numbers, loops with even. (ex. 110 and 310 are spurs since they branch off 10 and never reconnect and 610 is a loop since it connects back to I-10). I think it's still technically a loop (and thus an even number) if it reconnects to another Interstate."

Acadiana,2yk9se,squeamish,3,Wed Mar 11 11:57:15 2015 UTC,"That's what we did in Shreveport 30 years ago. There was an existing RR right-of-way that we followed and widened. We also have a fantastic series of loops around the city, but only a couple Interstate-level river crossings.  It's good and bad. You can get anywhere in town in no time, but that's what (literally) drives people out of the city. For years I lived on the Southern edge of the city limits, but could be in my office downtown in under 15 minutes door-to-door. Now almost all my friends live out in the country, despite all the relevant services still being in town."
Acadiana,2yk9se,Silound,4,Tue Mar 10 21:49:54 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the reason loops aren't the golden bullet some people hold them up to be. They can be beneficial, as an economic stimulant to an area and everyone likes them. But they can also be detrimental by assisting in accelerated urban decay through a socioeconomic based urban sprawl (the money wants to live away from the city) and, ultimately, contributes negatively towards the area they enclose."
Acadiana,2yk9se,rapcat,2,Tue Mar 10 22:14:23 2015 UTC,I'm totally against a loop for this reason. I also think elevated I-49 is a bad idea for the same reasons.
Acadiana,2yk9se,bruce656,3,Wed Mar 11 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"They would need enough width to put a six-lane limited-access concrete-foundation highway through the corridor (with emergency shoulders) and also have two-lane one-directional service roads down each side from I-10 to at least past the airport.   Is that not easily doable with the existing footprint (including the block between the current lanes)? I guess I'd have to find somewhere else to get gas and interact with panhandlers if they bulldozed that RaceTrac, though."

Acadiana,2yft1m,CrazytownUSA00,2,Mon Mar 9 15:34:40 2015 UTC,"But the overall poor taste in beer is partially to blame for our poor selection.  There's little demand for good beers.  Although it's gotten better in the last 5 years, Louisiana is still pretty far behind compared to many states when it comes to distribution.   I end up spending $200-300 on beer when I leave the state just so that I can have the good stuff for a while when I get home.  We can't get Dogfish, Russian River, Duck Rabbit, Ballast Point, or Deschutes.  The breweries that we do have access to, we get a grossly limited selection.   We can't even get Lagunitas Brown Suga.  Hell, even Sam Adams' new IPAs are scarce.  It sucks having to settle most times.  I guess if I had to choose favorites from what we have to choose from, I'd go with North Coast's Old Rasputin, Chimay's white, and Green Flash's Green Bullet."

Acadiana,2yft1m,aycefayce,2,Mon Mar 9 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"I believe it's brewed in Pittsburgh and distributed all the way to New England and down the East Coast. They have it as far as Pensacola and Orlando, but no where near here. You won't see it here however. I've already talked to distros. It's actually an inexpensive beer, what I call a ""drinking beer."" When my friends drive in from Florida, I have them pick up 30 packs of cans that I break out every now and then at get-togethers."
Acadiana,2yft1m,pmkleinp,4,Mon Mar 9 13:42:14 2015 UTC,"It's brewed in Pottsville, which is between Harrisburg and Scranton in Central-Eastern PA.  People in and around PA fucking love Yuengling.  Colloquially, they just call it 'lager' when ordering it at a bar."
Acadiana,2yft1m,BreesusisMagic,2,Mon Mar 9 14:19:50 2015 UTC,This is correct. We used to have it on tap in kegs instead of natty light or beast in college. I'm from pittsburgh and went to school in Allentown/Bethlehem pa. It's cheap and tastes way better than normal shit beer. It's also the oldest brewery in North America.
Acadiana,2yft1m,Chamrox,2,Mon Mar 9 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"No kidding, eh. I have friends that're from PA that I served with, and they sold it at the commissary from time to time. They'd go batshit over it."
Acadiana,2yft1m,ImLazyWithUsernames,2,Mon Mar 9 14:21:36 2015 UTC,I had a coworker who introduced us to Fat Tire before it was distributed here.  We went to houston for a dept meeting and ended up coming home with 9 or 10 cases in the back of the car (majority of that was for 2 of the four people in the car)
Acadiana,2yft1m,pele1410,4,Mon Mar 9 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"I remember Fat Tire from long ago when I lived on the West coast. I was glad to see New Belgium gain a lot of ground around here and especially the fact that Acadiana embraced it and you can get it on tap everywhere now. Recently however, I feel like it sneaks up on me really quickly and my friend had agreed. It also tastes kinda strange to me (at the Cajundome) recently, so I don't feel like it's consistent. It might just be me, I dunno. I had one Friday and I wasn't crazy about it."
Acadiana,2yft1m,pele1410,4,Mon Mar 9 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"It also tastes kinda strange to me (at the Cajundome) recently, so I don't feel like it's consistent.   Shilling doesn't have a very good track record of cleaning their lines, especially at the Dome. This can affect the taste of the beer. In fact, they almost lost the New Belgium contract because they weren't cleaning their lines correctly."
Acadiana,2yft1m,dannytheguitarist,3,Mon Mar 9 15:25:19 2015 UTC,That explains it. Stuff like South coast and Envie could def make some of the lighter beers taste funky if they don't keep up with their equipment and use different lines for diff beers.
Acadiana,2yft1m,dannytheguitarist,4,Mon Mar 9 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Even without switching beers, beer stone can build up in the line and bacteria can grow on and in the faucet, both can give beer a bad taste."
Acadiana,2yft1m,dannytheguitarist,2,Mon Mar 9 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"So just think, you have the opportunity to get bad beer and see a terrible band at the cajundome in the near future"
Acadiana,2yft1m,ZydecoSucks,3,Mon Mar 9 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"Well, if you get any of Shilling's beer, yeah. If you get Crescent Crown beer, then you have good beer while watching a terrible band."
Acadiana,2yft1m,Chamrox,3,Mon Mar 9 16:47:42 2015 UTC,The same friend who was addicted to it (he live din Denver for a bit) has said he feels it isn't the same as it was previously.  I rarely get it on tap and stick to bottles
Acadiana,2yft1m,Phnglui,3,Mon Mar 9 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"Terrapin (at Albertson's) makes a stout named Liquid Bliss. It's a chocolate peanut butter stout. I thought that it was either going to be incredibly good or incredibly gross, and it was damn good. Check it out."

Acadiana,2y2cha,Krazed59,1 point,Fri Mar 6 13:07:41 2015 UTC,"Right now any 5th Edition D&D game is going to be very friendly to new players.  The complete ruleset hasn't even been out for a year yet.  Everyone is still learning the system.  Along with that the rules themselves are much less complicated than 3.5 D&D and Pathfinder.  Also, on a personal note, as a DM myself I would much rather have a new player who's genuinely excited to learn and play the game than an experienced player who's just goofing off.  Don't feel discouraged from joining a group just because you're new, without new players this hobby would die out quickly."

He'd bolster higher education and more kids would go to college and we wouldn't be so reliant on the oil industry. Side note - I've never identified as a conservative republican   Then I graduated. Got a legitimate job in the media (yeah, a communications degree...) and began to see through the thin veil over what was really happening.   The man started off great with good ideas.

Mouthbreathers on KATC will chime in with ""well what, you want more handouts?"" Thing is, none of these handouts are going to me. They're going to hospitals to take care of people. They're going to schools so Louisiana can attempt to pull itself out of the bottom five educationally, and so on.  What gets me is that people are still pro-Jindal even after he made cuts to LSU.

Acadiana,2xx046,GEAUXUL,2,Wed Mar 4 23:25:10 2015 UTC,"This exchange marked the exact moment I knew I could no longer work for Bobby Jindal or Republican campaign politics.   That line right there made me a little sad.  Instead of sticking with it and reforming the party to a more modern, relevant party, the author chose to abandon it outright.  I'm not in his shoes of course, maybe that's too Herculean a task to accomplish.  But without a struggle to try, that change will never come anyway.    I generally vote Republican, but I can't help but feel that this Republican administration has failed me terribly.  I don't ask much of my state government, all I really want is decent schools and decent infrastructure and maybe just a little transparency.  A decrease in blatant corruption would be nice, too.  Those things haven't improved at all since I first moved here 9 years ago.  Even as a Republican, it makes me cringe when I hear my out-of-state parents talk about how Jindal would be a marvelous president.  I'd vote Democrat, but I'm not sure that would make a difference, either.  I guess it's a turd sandwich/douchebag type of scenario, it's like Louisiana is stuck with this shabby situation indefinitely."
Acadiana,2xx046,rd8t,3,Wed Mar 4 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"look at third parties.  I know some say it's a wasted vote, others call you a spoiler, but really, if enough people got out of this mindset of having to only vote for one of two parties, you might actually bring someone else in.  not saying that would make a lot of difference, but considering the big two have bee kind of providing us with dipshits, douchebags and dumbasses, it can't hurt."
Acadiana,2xx046,22travis,3,Thu Mar 5 02:22:39 2015 UTC,"It's not a wasted vote. Quite the opposite actually. Voting for a third party candidate that better aligns with your beliefs forces both major parties to adjust their strategy in order to win your vote. And make no mistake about it, the two major parties DO actually care about capturing the votes of third party voters. If only 4 or 5% of voters voted for the Libertarian Party we'd see gigantic shifts from both parties to win those voters back. On the other hand, when you vote for the ""lesser of two evils"" there's really no need for them to change. Why would they?"
Acadiana,2xx046,rd8t,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:17:02 2015 UTC,"Well, the parties use that as an excuse.  Al Gore in 2000 claimed that Green Party votes hurt him as well as all the florida controversy.  GOP candidates have claimed Liberterian votes have hurt them.  Well, that, and those nutty teabaggers in the long term did not help their cause, imo (political fundie extremists either suck people in completely, or put them on total defensive.  You rarely see someone who says ""Well, I agree with teaparty on this, but not that"".  It tends to be all or nothing).  The truth is, it's a very small percentage of politicians that actually are worth a damn, the rest are just party shills or puppets for lobby groups."

The nurse kept missing her vein and when she finally got it, she blew it and my then-g/f ended up with a huge bruise on her forearm for a couple of weeks.

Acadiana,2xwy7n,flashblazer,3,Wed Mar 4 18:10:52 2015 UTC,I hear it pays decent enough. You'd just have to have at least two hours of free time and show up as early as possible because even showing up at 8 means you'll be in the back of a long ass line.
Acadiana,2xwy7n,smfaviatrix,2,Wed Mar 4 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"Ive been to Talecris multiple times whenever I need a bit of cash and I've never had a bad experience. People say to go early, but actually, if you want to be in and out as quick as possible, you do later in the day. I usually go between 2-3 hours before they close and im done in about an hour and a half. Half an hour to be called and interviewed, and 45min-1hr for the donation itself.  The girls who work there are super friendly and its a quick and easy way to get some cash. If you're a new donor, your first 5 donations are 50$ each and you can go twice a week. Not a bad deal if you ask me!"
Acadiana,2xwy7n,jilliest,2,Thu Mar 5 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"My first trip took over 4 hours but that was with interviews and drug tests and shit. Now I give it about 3 at most. I can be in and out in less than 2. You get $50 the first 5 or 6 visits. Refer a friend if you can. If you're a student go on Tuesdays, they pay $10 more. If you go, go twice asap, then if you wait it out they might send you a card that says "" we'll give you $20 more if you donate again"". I think it was a month that I hadn't been, but still in my first 5-6 so I made $70 that day.   The prepaid card gets loaded stupid fast. With a smart phone you can check your balance before you even get back into your car. Go to Albertsons and ask to get just cash back, they can do it without a sale. Unless you get an asshole cashier, some won't just because they're judgmental.   The people who go there are generally lower class. Sure. For a couple hours of your time you get instant money. You're not attracting high class folks with that. I found out about them because I had been flat broke for two months. Most times a donation helps pay a bill or pads my rent check. Just hang out and enjoy. Yes the clientele are not super educated, well-spoken people. But they're people just trying to help themselves out. Some get an attitude but the techs are all pretty great and friendly."
Acadiana,2xwy7n,smfaviatrix,2,Thu Mar 5 04:44:56 2015 UTC,"My roommate goes every chance he gets. Like someone else said if you go when they open you're way late and probably won't get seen. He's never had a bad experience, though, and he's been going as often as he can for about three years."
Acadiana,2xwy7n,squeamish,-1,Wed Mar 4 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"The money is not good, and they will waste between 3 and 6 hours of your day. Most of the clientele are kind of...methed up, if you get me. The waiting room and people in it are mostly depressing ghetto or trailer trash. The donation rooms are kept very cold and the actual donation can take several hours if it isn't set up right.

Dilute the super strength formula it 40:1 for vinyl and pressure wash it with a 15-degree tip, spraying down so that water doesn't get up into the siding.

Acadiana,2xt15w,rapcat,6,Wed Mar 4 05:55:47 2015 UTC,"Story: I'm sitting outside while studying for an anatomy exam so I can smoke (cigarettes) while I do so. Judge me if you want, but it's a helpful way to overcome test anxiety.  My wife comes outside to see how I'm doing and mid-sentence, gasps and points at our bedroom window. It's then that I see a damn snake crawling up my window, heading toward a little crack leading into my attic.  I had (and still have) no idea what kind of snake it was, but I did know I didn't want it getting in my house. So I took a rake, knocked it off the window, let it curl around the end of the rake, and promptly turned the rake into a sling and tossed that bitch halfway across the state.  I posted the picture on Facebook to help identify the snake. I didn't panic or anything, I just figured I didn't want the sumbitch getting in my house. Worst case scenario, it's poisonous. And I'd rather it bite me attempting to get it away from my house than get inside and potentially bite my kids.  Can you identify this snake? I thought it was a python of some sort. But my Facebook friends suggested it could be a water moccasin. If it's indeed a cottonmouth, how do I make sure it doesn't come back to my house without burning the whole damn thing down?"
Acadiana,2xt15w,lind0,7,Tue Mar 3 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Edit: I was being a bit douchey, apologies.    Go check out Jeff boundys book on snakes of louisiana.  It is fantastic for  snake ID breaking down species by parish, habitat preference, and a great section on venomous vs nonvenomous snakes  He is the state reptile/amphibians guy for wildlife and fisheries. Also This link is great for general identification for venomous vs nonvenomous. Most important thing to remember is to get a good look at the head. Theres over 40+ species of snakes in the state, around 20 or so in the lafeyette area.  http://ufwildlife.ifas.ufl.edu/water_moccasin_watersnake_comparison.shtml And best way to make sure the snake doesn't come back is remove areas where it would find cover/food. If you have any debris piles/ remove them. keep weeds/grass down. If you have foundation planting. Make sure they're properly maintained. Don't leave pieces of tin or wood or logs around (areas for its food to hide) Try not to attract birds, (This will draw in rat snakes)   The Lafeyette Nature Station in Breaux Bridge has some really knowledgable people to contact. Also There is a chapter of the Louisiana Master Naturalist Program to contact for concerns. They'd be happy to help. There whole thing is teaching People to become Educational Teachers."

It's just silly to me,  if I don't know something,  I won't try to talk like I do. I'm passionate about ecology.  I hear shit about people killing snakes all the damn time.  Used to be a daily occurrence. When it would take maybe an hour of research to learn about.... It's just lazy and cruel.  If I were to come shoot a family's puppy In front of them because I claimed it was a violent pit bull ready to attack me.  I would be thrown In jail. I've been on the side of the road trying to move animals away...and had people speed up to just kill them."

I can't identify a snake for shit, just not my thing, so I'd like generalize whatever it is.

We can talk more about it if you wish.  I've been a piper now for around four years, officially cigarette free for nearly three(three this June 23rd, my IRL cakeday.)

She's also a neurologist, which is why my wife sees her.  I have a friend in Lafayette who drives all the way to New Iberia just to see Dr. Savant.  (and you've got to love the irony of her name)"
Acadiana,2xod6o,jefuchs,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:44:28 2015 UTC,"Dr. David Dawes was the best psychiatrist I ever saw, and I've seen more than my fair share. He is an advocate for proper mental health care so he was concerned about more than just prescriptions. He listened and taught me techniques to help myself instead of just constantly upping my dosages. Dr. Conception, my previous doctor, had me on so many meds I would fall asleep if I sat down for more than 2 minutes. Pa bon!( I don't usually call individuals out but if I can save someone from what I went through it is worth it)"
Acadiana,2xod6o,ladyfoghladha,2,Tue Mar 3 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"I've been working in psychiatric and addiction treatment facilities going on five years now. I've worked in facilities that employed both of these men, and I completely agree with your assessment. If I'm not mistaken (which I may be, it's been a while since I thought about him), Dr. Conception also specializes in pain management, and therefore deals in narcotics.  Dr. Dawes, on the other hand, was the only psychiatrist I knew who actually interacted with the staff of the hospital in a friendly way. He would actually come into the cafeteria and eat with we lowly Mental Health Technicians. Great guy."
Acadiana,2xod6o,Yohfay,1 point,Tue Mar 3 06:42:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if Dr. Conception does pain management, though I've never encountered a psychiatrist who does. In my case, I wasn't in any physical pain. I was a 17 year old battling depression and anxiety for which I was prescribed 2 different types of Xanax and Valium on a day basis plus lithium and a high dose of antidepressants. Way too much medicine for what I was dealing with but I was taught that doctors know what's best and we should follows their orders. I'm not so naive anymore and am grateful to have the internet to do my research."
Acadiana,2xod6o,ladyfoghladha,2,Tue Mar 3 15:25:01 2015 UTC,"I know that there's at least one psychiatrist in the area who also does pain management. It may not be Dr. Conception, but my fuzzy memory says that it is, and that's obviously not to be trusted."

Also, that website you posted isn't the state's motor vehicle website. In Louisiana, they're called OMVs (Office of Motor Vehicles) as opposed to DMVs.

Acadiana,2xah8d,pele1410,3,Fri Feb 27 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"Cross posted from r/news, but not only is this a great thing ensuring the internet isn't censored arbitrarily, but it also allows alternate ISPs to come in and offer faster internet (or internet service in general) at a competitive price, without preferential buy ins or internet speed throttling.  Locally, this could mean apartment complexes and the like will finally have a viable option rather than wait for LUS or sell a kidney to pay to Cox.  In fact, part of me is thinking this is making Cox (and other companies, like Comcast) shit themselves in anger, because now they can't show favoritism, throttle certain websites, etc.  And... I figured there's enough nerds here like me that would love seeing this.  This also means more places around the nation could have a service much like LUS, getting their internet through the utility company. The way LUS has handled their competition with Cox is brilliant, and I'd love to see that go nationwide."

Acadiana,2xah8d,bab7880,2,Fri Feb 27 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"I think one of the reasons apartments don't offer others is because while the provider will run to the structure, sometimes it's the property owner's responsibility to pay for distribution within the building.  I think that's more of the reason why apartments don't offer LUS Fiber.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a shitty practice. However, upgrading the wiring to thousands of apartments (in some cases) isn't a trivial expense.   Ideally, you could charge every tenant $XX for upgrading offerings, but that won't fly well with many customers.  Although, if they were smart, they could spend the money now, charge current tenants if they want it. If they don't currently want it, charge the first tenant that does. Most sane people might understand the reasoning.  I also don't realize what type of switch hardware would be needed near or even within the apartment complexes...."

As for data, yes. Apps use data, surfing the internet uses data, spotify is still a thing and it uses date. You can mitigate the amount of data that you're using with a home wifi network.   Be careful with the whole sign a 2 year contract and your phone is free or $0.99 thing. Sometimes there are additional monthly fees that are tacked on because of this.   Most mobile providers are quite flexible and if after a month or two of usage you realize that you need more data or whatever, you can change your plan accordingly."
Acadiana,2xba2m,ladyfoghladha,2,Fri Feb 27 04:05:19 2015 UTC,A smartphone contract is gonna cost you $80-120 a month easily. It's a necessary evil if you want to be connected.

I'm like you, it took me forever to switch to a smart phone so I didn't need a ton of data since I'm usually in WiFi range when streaming music or browsing Reddit. I never went over for what it's worth. However, the account was an older account so if you are starting a new one there may be a deposit necessary depending on your credit."

I was really disappointed, this place where I had spent hours of pleasant time was forever spoiled for me.  I never returned, instead going to And Books II to pursue my comics addiction.

Acadiana,2x9g4j,dannytheguitarist,3,Fri Feb 27 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole situation was really weird. And yeah, her name was Theresa. She had a bunch of binders of singles that she would sell for people on consignment. I would browse through these while my friend would play her in that old Marvel TCG, Overpower.  I'm sure some cards actually did turn up missing, but it was just sad that she jumped to that conclusion that we were the ones who did it, after we have been going there for years and never gave her any trouble. She even went to the length of looking our numbers up in the phonebook and calling our parents about it. They believed us against her, but it was really hurtful she would accuse us like that; I thought of her as kind of a friend, as much as a young person can think of an older woman in that way.  And that's when I decided to become a super villain."

Acadiana,2x501s,rapcat,12,Wed Feb 25 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Kemp invested almost $30,000 of her own money to bring her food sales to the point they needed to be. But at Wednesday's ATC hearing, a closer look at the bistro's books showed it wasn't even necessary. Her food sales were outweighing alcohol sales without her contributions.   So this entire time, Artmosphere was actually selling enough food to qualify, but they just didn't know it because of ""bad math""?  Whether you like Artmosphere or not, this whole thing seems like there's something going on behind the scenes. None of this makes any sense.  As I've said in other posts before, I'm betting Artmosphere pissed off someone in local government."
Acadiana,2x501s,redditor1983,2,Thu Feb 26 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"That feel you get when you realized you just threw away $30k for no reason.

Acadiana,2x501s,dannytheguitarist,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:27:13 2015 UTC,So it all boils down to someone (either Artmosphere's bookkeeper or the ATC) being bad at math.

Some people just can't wrap their heads around people having different tastes, and that that's okay and doesn't make anyone better than anyone else. You like what you like.

Acadiana,2x501s,themarknessmonster,11,Wed Feb 25 20:30:21 2015 UTC,Terrible business practices being excused has nothing to do with tastes.  But let's continue to keep the discussion two-dimensional.
Acadiana,2x501s,GlowstickSage,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:04:40 2015 UTC,"Most of the hate I've seen for Artmosphere (especially in this thread) has to do with the fact that they offer a venue for Indie and alternative music, or cater to a more hipster/artsy type crowd. Bad business practices is a good reason to dislike a place, and I didn't bring it up because I see no injustice in calling out a business for their business practices.  But by all means, let's continue to be dismissive of each other's points and opinions."
Acadiana,2x501s,dannytheguitarist,5,Thu Feb 26 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"I feel like most of the jokes are directed at the hipster/artsy crowd, but if you check every post in the sub before this, all of the discussions have been about bad business practices. I feel like people are just getting their jabs in as this winds down until October when we'll start again.   I don't like liars. I don't like people that pander for business that's run poorly and throw pity parties. Revisit the top post in the last thread in which you'll see where I stated that what they did is illegal and they should be held accountable. What if I wanted to run a legit bar or restaurant and I have to compete with liars that operate illegally? I hold a business degree myself and i remember taking a lot of classes on ethics."
Acadiana,2x501s,Clumsybritt,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"This is it, this is exactly it. While some of us feel grievances toward Artmosphere legitimately, we still have senses of humor. A couple of friends of mine are what you may call hipsters, and even THEY will join in on hipster bashing. It's my fault for getting mean about it, but well...  Let's get completely serious, then. The beer was overpriced. There's covers regardless of what's going on. Despite being at the bar first and holding out cash (the universal sign that someone wants to order something), the bartender looked at me like I had a third eye and served a few other people before me. It took ten minutes to get that overpriced beer. When I finally did order food, it took almost an hour to arrive, was cold, and did not taste good at all.   Stepping out of personal experience, I feel the owner skirted the law knowingly. I don't mind helping out at all; I am rather kindhearted, but when you have a very public story about how you circumvented the law, and you solicit help to further circumvent it without even addressing it (my respect for Beryl herself would skyrocket if I saw her actually post her thoughts on what she was thinking, honestly, when she applied for that license), I feel you, as a business owner, are participating in shady business practices, and I can't stand behind that.  Thus, my dislike for Artmosphere would stay personal based simply on terrible service if Beryl came out and said, ""OK, I screwed up. I'm either going to attempt to get a liquor license, or I will hire a competent kitchen staff, formulate recipes and make Artmosphere a true bistro with decent food."" Hell, I might even give it another chance if that were the case. If she's spending tens of thousands of dollars to coif the receipts (something else I feel is dishonest), she could have afforded to at least start installing a proper kitchen, right?  She would HAVE to start catering to the eating customers, though. Pilot's Pub had a kitchen, recipes and such, and actually had good food, but they were known as a bar and when they lost their license temporarily, no one came, because most of their customer base were drinkers who occasionally ordered food. Beryl's crowd, as it stands now, are the same. They are drinkers who occasionally order food. If she wants that to change, she's going to have to cultivate a restaurant model, something like Bisbanos, maybe, because the mediocre staff and lackluster food as it stands now aren't going to do it."
Acadiana,2x501s,todayilearned83,3,Fri Feb 27 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"It's not about taste. It's about the attitude, behavior, ego, and entitlement  that comes with it."

Acadiana,2x501s,pvk8336,7,Wed Feb 25 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"So now they can drop all pretense of being a restaurant and go straight to being a place to sell PBR to hipsters and elderly, out of state zydeco culture vultures?"
Acadiana,2x501s,RonBurgandy2010,7,Wed Feb 25 18:48:03 2015 UTC,Not exactly.  They ATC gave them clearance that they weren't in violation of the law.  They have a few months until they can petition for a renewal for the license.  At that point the ATC will rule about whether or not to issue them a bar license.
Acadiana,2x501s,pvk8336,4,Wed Feb 25 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"Which they still can't do because of other ordinances, correct?"
Acadiana,2x501s,dannytheguitarist,3,Wed Feb 25 19:47:01 2015 UTC,Correct. In October they can only renew for a restaurant license unless they are granted an exemption or city ordinances are changed in order for them to be classified as a bar.
Acadiana,2x501s,CrazytownUSA00,3,Wed Feb 25 21:57:38 2015 UTC,So this ruling was more to relieve them of fines than to allow them to operate as a bar and venue?
Acadiana,2x501s,pvk8336,4,Wed Feb 25 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"It's to allow them to continue operating under a restaurant license as long as their annual receipts reach the 50% requirement, yes. They can't get a state license as long as they don't meet local requirements for a local license as well.   According to them at the meeting, they satisfy all requirements on the state side of things except those two local ordinances are keeping them from being issued a bar permit."
Acadiana,2x501s,dannytheguitarist,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"So... being polite about this because I'm tired of negativity- how likely is it they'll be granted an exemption? Have other bars in the area asked for- and more importantly, received- such an exemption before?"
Acadiana,2x501s,FecesTheStankyClown,5,Thu Feb 26 01:33:44 2015 UTC,"They won't get an exemption, they'll have to operate as a restaurant forever until the ordinance changes."

Seeing as there are two ordinances they're bumping up against, I'm assuming whichever government entity is going to treat this with kid gloves so as not to unnecessarily anger anyone. It's going to be interesting to watch it play out."

Acadiana,2x1znr,Doubleu1117,12,Wed Feb 25 00:32:30 2015 UTC,"My question is does the language have a chance, or is it too late?    Well it could be worse. There are approximately 200,000 people in southern louisiana who speak french, although a percentage of that number is Louisianian French Creole which is a separate language (for historical reasons and survey/census simplifications, it's included in with French).  Given immersion schooling and renewed interest plus the laxing of societal prejudices against French will probaly ensure the survival for at least 50 years. I would be comfortable even saying the next one hundred years. But the number of speakers has continued to decline (particularly as older generations who make the majority of speakers die).  Most people who had relatives or ancestor who spoke French probably dont speak French now and it likely wont be their children's first language. But a small number of people still speak French on a regular basis (cant think of numbers off the top of my head) and there are young people who are learning it as heritage speakers or still it as a first language.   It would be really interesting what Acadiana would be like today had it not been suppressed. Perhaps even like Quebec.   French was suppressed to an extent in Quebec. There are two big reasons for the difference between louisiana and quebec. Quebec had a lot more French speaking colonists (and was a French colony a lot longer). Francophones (french speakers) remained at least a 3/4 majority throuhgout the last 200 years in Quebec. Today 4/5 Quebecers speak French as their first language and 95% speak French when L2 learners are included.  Secondly Quebec even under British rule had institutions in French. Schools, churches, certain positions in local government. So you could go to school in French (and learning english was only important to succeed at higher levels of government and business). These institutions helped preserve education in French and helped keep French present in public life.  Louisiana was much less developped when it became a state (the 1st non majority English speaking state), and had a much smaller population. Even still French remained the primary language of southern louisiana until the  1920's. Compulsory education in English and the discovery of oil which brought in more English speaking americans really began to change language use in southern louisiana.  On a side note, there were other French speaking communities up and down the mississippi river. Cities like Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Ste. Genevieve, and Mobile were all founded by French colonists and non immigrant French speakers could be found in those places for quite a long time after becoming american territories. Masses were said in French in a few churches of Detroit until the 1940's. There are also a few communities in Missouri that had French speakers a few generations ago (songs, cultural customs remain).  TD:LR   Probably not soon.  Update: Merci pour l'or, redditeur anonyme! (Thank You for the gold, anonymous redditor!)"
Acadiana,2x1znr,Pyromane_Wapusk,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"So you're saying there is a good chance for survival but likely not growth?  And that's interesting what you said about Chicago and Detroit.  It's a shame it was so put down down for so long, you could only imagine how life would be there today."
Acadiana,2x1znr,Pyromane_Wapusk,3,Wed Feb 25 02:51:35 2015 UTC,"If you are interested in this sort of history, look into ""Ghost Empire"" by Phillip Marchand for a good book about the French in North America.    So you're saying there is a good chance for survival but likely not growth?    Well I suppose anything is possible, certainly some growth is possible, but I think a stable population of French speakers would be a start. I don't think Louisiana will ever become majority French speaking in the near/forseeable future again. It is kind of sad that diversity has been lost. But it's certainly left its mark on Louisiana."
Acadiana,2x1znr,br00tman,6,Wed Feb 25 03:42:43 2015 UTC,"There are lots of young people who are learning or have learned French in school or from elders.

Acadiana,2x0t91,rapcat,7,Tue Feb 24 20:45:45 2015 UTC,Yup.  More than likely someone got a hold of a list and is trying to scam money.
Acadiana,2x0t91,GEAUXUL,7,Tue Feb 24 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"Who specifically called you?  I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure the odds of you being picked up on a warrant for unpaid traffic tickets and shipped two states over to answer for a 10 yr old parking ticket is really damn low.  The easy answer is to lawyer up and let the lawyer handle it. It probably won't cost you more than a couple hundred bucks.  If you want to do it cheaper, start writing letters to the judge who issued the warrant or the DA of that county and tell them what you told us. Don't be an ass about it. Given your story, a copy of your current drivers license is should be more than enough proof for him."
Acadiana,2x0t91,grumpyolddude,3,Tue Feb 24 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"What do they want you to do about it?  Pay again?  Do you recall how you paid last time?  If it's a check or credit card you might be able to have a bank pull your history.   Since drivers license renewal is around your birthday every four years you can probably narrow it down to a specific couple of months when you would have paid.   It could be that you just need to contact the department you paid the fine to and have them update the records of the department that called you.  Unless it's a large amount of money, it might just be easier to pay it again and hang on to the receipt this time than trying to get a lawyer or spending too much time on it.    It also wouldn't hurt to verify that it really is some official department calling and not some scammer.  Good luck."
Acadiana,2x0t91,CrazytownUSA00,2,Tue Feb 24 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"The ticket was only for $150. Unfortunately, it was cash or money order only, so I sent a money order. Bit of a crapshoot, but I figured it was legit since the DMV gave me the address in OK I had to mail it to. I KNOW they received it, because I had to show the receipt to the DMV to renew on my 20th birthday.  It would be cheaper to pay it again than lawyer up, but I shouldn't have to do any of that in the first place. The DMV told me it needed to be paid before I could renew, and I showed them the receipt, so obviously I paid it.  I tried telling the lady it HAD to have been paid, because otherwise the state of LA wouldn't have let me renew, but she was insistent.  This has me thinking ""scam"", except she knew when I got the ticket, how much it was, etc."
Acadiana,2x0t91,vegetaman3113,4,Tue Feb 24 20:05:29 2015 UTC,Check the address that they want you to send a payment too or call the town's city hall and ask them if you still owe them.
Acadiana,2x0t91,pele1410,2,Tue Feb 24 22:57:54 2015 UTC,They will have records of money orders. Check with your bank and see when you bought it. Then check with the place you purchased it. Then contact the legal authority.
Acadiana,2x0t91,k9centipede,3,Wed Feb 25 12:35:42 2015 UTC,I'm thinking scam too. Lookup the phone number to the sheriffs office in Oklahoma where you were stopped. Call them directly and ask if you've still got an unpaid ticket.
Acadiana,2x0t91,StephenFish,2,Tue Feb 24 21:57:04 2015 UTC,First they legally have to provide you with an invoice stating what is owed and second it's past the statue of limitations so you don't owe shit. It's probably a scam. If they call again get their info and report them.

We waited 20 minutes for our drinks, and another 10 before she asked for our order. Then we waited an hour before asking how our orders were doing. Turns out she didn't put them in. Another 45 minutes and we still had seen none of our food, and no drink refills. Not even the hummus appetizers we had ordered. We finally asked again about our food, and she said they just started cooking it.   We left. Never went back.  Sorry Artmosphere. Gave you a chance."

That being said, I'll say the same thing I've said in other Artmosphere-related threads: Why now?   They, apparently, have been in business for well over a decade and everything was going fine. Now all the sudden, they're under fire. It makes me think that politics is behind this somehow. They must have either pissed someone off, or they had someone in government helping them out that is no longer doing so.  The article mentions a rumor that someone specific is behind the filings for some reason. I wouldn't be surprised."
Acadiana,2wwpke,CrazytownUSA00,6,Mon Feb 23 22:47:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they want to be a restaurant they need to have a wait staff come to the table and take orders.

You could totally reinvent yourself and capitalize on this, or embrace the death rattle. Shit, rent out Frankie's and local hipsters would damn near rebuild and redesign the place for them.

Frankie has to close his place down because he can't afford the rent.  You don't see anyone rallying to have his rent lowered.  He isn't on Facebook whining and begging everyone to help them stay open or do something about his problem.  Instead, he thanked the community for their support, put together some badass shows, gave back to the bands and bowed out gracefully.  And as far as we know, he wasn't even breaking the law.  I wish someone would shut these Fartmosqueers up."

Acadiana,2wwpke,Dharma_Monkey,4,Mon Feb 23 23:31:56 2015 UTC,"Ah. It happens. There are, really, a smattering of decent bands at Artmosphere. But it's few and far in between. Usually, those bands only play once and are never asked again, no matter how well they did. Our band was one.  The band Mission vs. Madness had a running joke that they'd be asked to play Artmosphere every six months. They'd be booked, do a solid show, and yet never be asked again... until six months later, when they'd get a new booker. Repeat this cycle every six months. New booker, a show, no more word until new booker...  Fun fact: my old band was one of the bands banned (heh, bands banned) from Artmosphere, so I know firsthand."
Acadiana,2wwpke,peepea,9,Tue Feb 24 18:58:54 2015 UTC,"I said it on Facebook, and I'll say it here:  Unfortunately, the culture of the place is going to get caught up in the unlawful manner in which Berry has been conducting her business for the last 10 years. At this point, I am siding with the law. If you've tried every trick in the book (and she has) to pass yourself off as a restaurant and you've continued to promote your liquor sales, you aren't a restaurant. Posting drink specials online, having a large chalkboard with drink specials above the bar and around the building on flyers, and promoting your ""wine-bar"" to generate sales of the older generation some-odd years ago shows you have no inclinations about actually being a restaurant, despite how badly you want to pass your business off as one and also despite how much you beg and plead to your customer base to help keep you one by buying your over-priced stonerfood.  I'm sorry, but I have no sympathy for Berry. She shafts her workers, who shaft their customers, who then turn around and bail her out because she is only one of a few venues that promotes good bands, which she doesn't even pay to book. The cover pays, and she takes a small amount.  Berry can fail for all I care, and I care very very little about her business. I'm even more disappointed that the culture she established will die because of her neglectful and reckless business practices.  And really, that's just what Lafayette needs, LCG changing the laws to save a bar...of all things.  We can't even keep our roads properly paved, but Berry wants to keep her bar on special pleading.  And what's even worse is I have multiple friends on facebook I cannot talk to about this, because they don't want to pay attention to the details of the last 10 years with this place, and are blindly supporting Berry's spoiled child antics.    Berry The Manipulator.  Never changed."

Sorry, but compairing a civil right to what's going on at Artmosphere seems sad, desperate and childish.    And I somewhat agree with Joey Durel's statement in that if you let one, you cannot argue against letting others.  Agree with the ordinance or not, I think it's pretty shitty when they give a pass for some and not others.  (and this isn't me sitting here wanting to see Artmosphere close.  I'd rather not see it close, not for the owners, but because I do have friends who love going there.)"
Acadiana,2wxl1h,cajunbander,5,Tue Feb 24 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"It just depends on what side of Lafayette you live on. If you have relatively easy access to I-10 then it should be about an hour commute. Most of it would be the interstates, which aren't too bad, the slowdown would be on US-190, from 1-49 to Livonia it's a two lane road.   Lafayette has a population of about 120,000, which probably doubles during the week with people commuting to work. There is no interstate loop system or any time of expressway system to easily get around the city, unfortunately. The city's bisected by the Vermilion River, and there's only three or four roads that cross it, all of which get pretty busy during the day. 1-49 terminates in Lafayette, but continues south as Highway 90. Though it's been in the works extend 1-49 south along 90 for decades now, it has a lot of traffic and a lot of lights, which makes traffic horrible on it.   As far as where to live in Lafayette, the better pets of town and the better parts of the city are on the south side, across the river from I-10.   If you leave early enough in the morning, it shouldn't be too bad, but on the drive back unless you're doing it at 7-8PM, traffic will suck. Traffic is always a major problem.   Now, don't get me wrong, I'd recommend Lafayette 10/10 over BR, but I don't know if it'll be worth it for you.   Tl;dr, theoretically you could commute to Livonia in about an hour. Realistically, you'd probably have to add 30-45 minutes to that commute with Lafayette traffic."

Acadiana,2wrrwf,446172656E,2,Sun Feb 22 16:54:15 2015 UTC,Woodvale apartments. Like $570 for a 2 bedroom. They're old looking but surprisingly spacious. Although it's a 5-10 minute drive to campus depending on traffic and lights.

Acadiana,2wowup,dannytheguitarist,8,Sat Feb 21 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Update: The staff straight up said that ""the rent has been jacked up,"" so that's the word straight from the venue.  I just want to say that last night, when I showed up the venue had an ice chest full of tallboys for the bands. They gave us free water for SOs, and for drunk people when we requested it, free of charge.  They also gave all three bands free food. They treated us better than any local venue have ever treated us, surprising all of us.   Anyway, just wanted to share that. It was a good time for all, they paid us well, and it was a damn good night. Here's to Frankies."
Acadiana,2wowup,dannytheguitarist,6,Sun Feb 22 08:32:32 2015 UTC,Because some punk bands are going to blow the roof off.
Acadiana,2wowup,StephenFish,3,Sat Feb 21 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"Straight from the horse's mouth: Rent. Rent is going up downtown. Supposedly, City Bar and Club Z are amongst the closures too, but word has it Club Z is looking to move into Frankie Burger's spot."
Acadiana,2wowup,pele1410,4,Sun Feb 22 21:50:40 2015 UTC,"Whoa, City Bar is closing??? One would think they could afford the rent.... Not like I've ever been there or anything, but isn't that place pretty popular?"
Acadiana,2wowup,pele1410,2,Mon Feb 23 04:22:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that one was the most surprising to me. But I hear rent is going up astronomically downtown, and only bars with a sizeable pool of regulars like Green Room is sustaining it.  Arcadian is on that list too, but that's not all that shocking."
Acadiana,2wowup,dannytheguitarist,4,Mon Feb 23 13:28:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like an overall effort to run bars and clubs out of the area.  Between the ATC's hard-on for that area, the refusal to issue new liquor licenses and now the blanket raise in rent it just seems like the idea is to kill the night life downtown."
Acadiana,2wowup,aycefayce,2,Mon Feb 23 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the rent run out all of the other businesses though? Tattoo shops, small businesses, restaurants,  etc? Besides,  City Bar is always loaded in the weekends."
Acadiana,2wowup,aycefayce,1 point,Mon Feb 23 15:02:13 2015 UTC,Depends on if the rent went up across the board.  Maybe rent is only being raised on bars?
Acadiana,2wowup,peepea,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:57:18 2015 UTC,Yup. Seems a little unfair. The Lafayette mafia must be a thing now.
Acadiana,2wowup,peepea,2,Mon Feb 23 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"I don't understand driving bars away from downtown.  This will only spread them out across the city, which would make it harder to police."
Acadiana,2wowup,adartmo,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I understand that they don't want it to be a haunch. We can √¥ l'y speculate. Honesty,  Frankie's needs some TLC otherwise it's going to go to shit. The bathroom door doesn't even hitch closed. City Bar could easily be a Walk Ons or something similar. That would bring in more revenue, more taxes,  a different crowd.   They're starving out businesses it seems. Perhaps they have a vision for downtown. I can't say I disagree honestly. I'm not interested in art shops people selling fleur de lis shit. I get that people are onto this hippy, culture thing, but I like rock shows and having good beer with my friends too."

Cost varies place to place and on the type done (there are several methods). You'll likely have a copay & it's an in-office procedure under local anesthetic

Acadiana,2wms87,StephenFish,1 point,Sat Feb 21 15:18:38 2015 UTC,My brother got his done for ~$300-400.  It's an outpatient procedure and really not a big deal.  I'd get one if my girlfriend would let me.

Acadiana,2wms87,Louisianabeard,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on your age and marital situation, your urologist might not let you either.  If you're older with children already (let's say in your 30's), you probably won't get counsoled."

Acadiana,2wlbum,CrayonDNA,5,Fri Feb 20 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"Some observations based on experiences with other similar ponds in the area. Hopefully you can take these and provide a better experience:   Shade for visitors is a must, natural trees, cabanas, whatever it takes.  I've heard horror stories about the snake infestations at other ponds. No idea how you can control the snake population, but pulling up your stringer of fish and finding a snake nomming the end of them is a huge bummer. Make sure it stays clean, nobody wants to eat fish out of a pond with diapers floating around in it. Offer refreshments, but don't try to stop people from bringing their own. Sell ice. Sell mosquito repellent. Sell beer. Sell all the things that people forgot to bring. Have a plan to keep walking paths from becoming mud pits Have a nice place to hang out for those in a group that don't want to fish, or want to take a break. TVs during football season couldn't hurt. CLEAN restrooms Spot to clean fish before bringing them home Spot to clean kids before bringing them home We'd pay, provided it's not too expensive for a family of 4-6 to come spend a nice afternoon, and getting into and out of the place isn't a nightmare."
Acadiana,2wlbum,Chamrox,2,Sat Feb 21 00:40:54 2015 UTC,"I'd go to a park that provides all that, minus the tv's, but it sounds fairly expensive to maintain."

Acadiana,2wlbum,Dharma_Monkey,3,Mon Feb 23 17:00:57 2015 UTC,"Don't do the TV's, even for the non-fishers.  Fishing is all about getting away from that shit.

It is a not-for-profit organization that provides job training, employment placement services and other community-based programs for people who have disabilities, lack education or job experience, or face employment challenges. Goodwill raises money for their programs through a chain of thrift stores which also operate as non-profits.

I live in Freetown, and most people know where that is, while most people don't know where my actual street is located.

Acadiana,2wgw0g,kunstlinger,5,Fri Feb 20 00:18:51 2015 UTC,Let's see I can pay $60/month on contract for a year then $78/month off contract for 50/20 Mbps service with 300GB cap (sure it's not enforced but they send annoying letters) or  80/80 Mbps off contract for $55/month with 800GB cap.
Acadiana,2wgw0g,bab7880,3,Thu Feb 19 22:43:04 2015 UTC,wait... LUS has a data cap?
Acadiana,2wgw0g,kunstlinger,2,Thu Feb 19 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"in the fine print, yes, however it is not enforced.  You still get a notification, but atleast it's at a decent cap.  300GB is super easy to go over.  800GB not so much.  I just read the most current customer agreement and see the cap for an 80/80 connection is almost 2 TB monthly, so they are beyond reasonable."

Acadiana,2wgw0g,kunstlinger,2,Fri Feb 20 01:32:59 2015 UTC,I know plenty of folk who seed all day. The worst was when one seeded over 3TB in a month. LUS simply told him to do a virus scan. I'm sure they knew what was up.

Acadiana,2wgw0g,50000lightyears,2,Fri Feb 20 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"Supposedly it isn't offered in a lot of places.  And if you do recycle,  it costs you a fee.  That blew my mind when I learned you have to pay to recycle! I understand paying for trash disposal...  But recycling?"
Acadiana,2wgw0g,lacajun,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:44:13 2015 UTC,I don't remember having a fee when I lived in Lafayette. You just had to pay for your can. I simply took it with me when I moved.

Acadiana,2wfrqg,IceFalcon48,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:10:08 2015 UTC,Yes. You can play locally (in the same room) and it's much more fun that way because you can communicate better than when you play with people online.

Acadiana,2wfgxf,cawkstrangla,2,Thu Feb 19 16:17:43 2015 UTC,I bought my own modem and router (89 dollars and 200 dollars respectively).

They have total control over your internet by using their router/modem combo and it is a piece of junk equipment.

Acadiana,2wfgxf,kunstlinger,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:27:12 2015 UTC,"if you're in an apartment complex or see more than 4 neighbors wifi names, you should look into getting a dual band router.  The problem with single band (2.4) is that while it goes a long distance, it goes so far that everyone who uses it interferes with one another.  Also 2.4 is suspectible to bluetooth and other sources of interference such as your standard microwave oven.  5Ghz doesn't go nearly as far, so the chance of interference is less and it isn't susceptible to external interference (unless someones using radar in your neighborhood) . You can order dual band routers online for cheap."

Acadiana,2wfgxf,cawkstrangla,2,Thu Feb 19 14:52:25 2015 UTC,Did you ever drill holes in your boiling kettle?  You should just do what I do when I do 10-11 gal batches.  Have a series of crates or containers and do small lifts.
Acadiana,2wfgxf,kunstlinger,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:31:12 2015 UTC,"No, I haven't drilled any holes into my kettle. I'm looking for a way to transfer the 11 gallons into my two fermenting buckets quickly, rather than siphoning. When carrying full buckets or carboys I use a milk crate."
Acadiana,2wfgxf,rd8t,2,Thu Feb 19 20:10:48 2015 UTC,"You could just buy a 60 l Spiedel Fermentor and not have to worry about splitting up the batches.  I have 2.  I love them.here.  I have a ball valve at the bottom of my kettles and I just pop the end of the line from that valve into my fermentor.  I have never siphoned anything into the fermentors since I want to aerate them a bit.  You don't really need to even make  a yeast starter and the yeast you pitch will do just fine this way.  I don't know if you're siphoning to be extra careful about trub or to reduce the exposure to wild  yeast/infection during the transfer.  It's not really necessary to be so careful about it.  I've been brewing about every other month for the last 3-4 years and have never had an infection and this is the way I do it.  When I didn't have fancy kettles I just dumped that shit right in, though back then I only did 5 gallon batches.  I don't think I'd physically be able to do that with a 10 gallon batch."
Acadiana,2wfgxf,kunstlinger,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:13:08 2015 UTC,As nice as it looks an 8 gallon bucket is much cheaper!
Acadiana,2wfgxf,rd8t,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:14:07 2015 UTC,"no problem.  when i lived in emberwood apartments, I had to basically only use 5Ghz because the 2.4 band was unusable."

Acadiana,2w64tb,Acadianarchy,2,Tue Feb 17 19:06:03 2015 UTC,Go to the local temp agencies and tell them you want to be an active job seeker through them. (bring resume as with any job)   They can find a job that will fit you just as much as you will fit the job. (That sentence makes sense in my head.)  I was hired on by a great company into a great position within a couple weeks of becoming active in their system.  Active: does not mean that you just filled out their online application -- you actually visited the office and told them you wanted to be active.  Personal Bias: my father works at one of the temp agencies in town.
Acadiana,2w64tb,bab7880,1 point,Wed Feb 18 01:59:28 2015 UTC,I have a friend who's having a horrible go of temp agencies. She has a degree and several years experience but can't seem to get anything going for herself. Wonder what she's doing wrong (or not well enough).

Mine, I believe was purely dumb luck.  His is a field that comes up often, and his close proximity to mine (different company) is also a unique coincidence.  As the job seeker, if your friend is having ""bad luck"" with jobs, then she has aligned with a poor recruiter/sales rep.  A temp agency won't find you a dream job (my dream company doesn't even have production in the US), but they are able to keep you off unemployment since LA has some of the worse benefits ever."

Acadiana,2vy6l9,bruce656,2,Mon Feb 16 01:14:06 2015 UTC,"I typically avoid restaurants on holidays such as this due to the insanity (plus I fully admit to being too impatient to wait nearly two hours for a table whole listening to some overly entitled mouth breather bitch how ""that table is empty, why don't they seat someone""), but if I do happen to go out on such an event,  my personal belief is that the standard gratuity is not enough compensation.   It's a holiday, it's packed, it's crazy, and to stiff on a tip deserves to be brained with a bottle of house wine (charged back to that customers bill, of course)"
Acadiana,2vy6l9,pmkleinp,3,Sun Feb 15 12:56:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I won't wait that long for a table either. 45 minutes would be my limit before I go look for another place to get my Extreme Fajitas, Shrimp Shooters and/or Pizza Poppers.

I did get one table that left $2.37 on a $70 ticket; I almost went into the parking lot for that one.

Acadiana,2vy6l9,bruce656,3,Sun Feb 15 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's only 3%. My brother used to wait tables in New Orleans, so I always tip at least 20%."

(although I have had an instance wheere a waitress in a slow restarurant pretty much sat with her friends and couldn't be bothered to do her job, so i left a few pennies.

Acadiana,2vrf65,bagofboards,6,Fri Feb 13 13:01:12 2015 UTC,Need a tl;dr.
Acadiana,2vrf65,pele1410,7,Fri Feb 13 14:21:44 2015 UTC,Oil and Gas industry is the reason for coastal erosion.
Acadiana,2vrf65,phacey,5,Fri Feb 13 14:30:29 2015 UTC,"That's not quite the right takeaway.  Oil and gas is culpable for at least some of the erosion, with 50,000 empty drilling excavations dotted along the LA coast as well as the cut-through canals, but the levee system and farm chemical runoff are also huge factors.  The tl;dr for the article should really be, ""Oil and gas contributed to coastal erosion.  Erosion is happening super fast.  There's a lawsuit to make oil and gas fund continuous erosion-stemming efforts, but Bobby Jindal made sure the suit wouldn't move forward with his political machinations."""
Acadiana,2vrf65,rd8t,2,Fri Feb 13 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. I'd say that it certainly attributes, but it isn't the sole cause."
Acadiana,2vrf65,bruce656,2,Fri Feb 13 14:38:45 2015 UTC,"hell, the simply flowing of water causes erosion"
Acadiana,2vrf65,atchafalaya,9,Fri Feb 13 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"One of the big problems though, is that the OAG industry cuts these massive channels through the marsh, which increases the 'surface area' (not the right word I'm looking for) of the marsh which is exposed to said flowing waters.   Imagine a body of land in the shape of a circle; only the perimeter is subjected to the effects of erosion. Now cut that circle up like you would a pizza, and flow water through those channels. The land is going to erode much, much faster. Not only that, but the channels allow salt water from the gulf to flow into the freshwater marsh, which kills the plant life, further exacerbating the effect."
Acadiana,2vrf65,Gandalf6969,5,Fri Feb 13 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"I've participated in laying pipelines right on top of the ground through swamp and marshland. Except where they crossed a bayou. Then we had to jet them down, or in other words blast a trench in the bottom of the bayou with a high pressure water hose for the pipe to fall into.   BP may be doing great things at the drilling end. At the other end, they're tearing it up, and nobody gives a shit."
Acadiana,2vrf65,rd8t,0,Fri Feb 13 18:25:50 2015 UTC,So you would prefer to just let the oil and gas industry continue its rape of our land and leave with the money ?
Acadiana,2vrf65,rd8t,5,Fri Feb 13 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"For the most part, O&G practices in the Gulf of Mexico don't leave a trace. I've seen them spud into the mudline, complete a well, and remove existing wells like nothing was ever there. I'm willing to bet that you're not familiar with well control practices.   There have been mistakes, incidents, like any industry, but there's also a safety and regulatory industry. That also means jobs. Operators and service companies are more socially responsible, accountable to citizens and residents then ever before. This is very new as we're demanding this, society is, from industries. My life, my family, is oil and gas and Acadiana would not be what it is without it. If you don't believe me, move to Detroit. I don't say this to be a jerk, bc you're entitled to your opinion, but this really isn't the place, the area to be vocal about this considering many of us are wondering how we're going to feed our families, how we're going to live with the current market condition here."
Acadiana,2vrf65,rd8t,9,Fri Feb 13 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"It also depends on the companies as well.  I know a lot of people are to the point that they roll their eyes when people pick on BP, but to be honest, they do not have the best record on their endeavors in the US (To this day, it blows my mind that the Texas City refinary is still in opperations).  And don't think for a moment that it's just people who are not fans of the industry, as even a lot of the big players in O&G have distanced themselves (I've been to a lot of offices that have a box of plaques and certificates from that particular company just sitting in a box in storage, while others are displayed on the wall).  In other words, you have to be willing to do a little research and see which companies are making efforts not to leave things fucked up, and which might be.  Also, it's very easy to put down the industry when you don't work in it, but, if you own a car, bike, scooter, shoes, items made of plastic, have a gas store, use a propane grill, etc, you rely on that industry just as much as the people employed by it.  (edit:  dammit, replied to wrong post)"
Acadiana,2vrf65,rd8t,2,Fri Feb 13 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"And that is why social responsibility and safety records (inckuding ISO, API Q1 & the new Q2, etc) is of utmost importance. I've worked with ALL of the major operators, here and overseas. The GoM is lightyears more safe and responsible than any other country I've been to.  Survival of the fittest. The companies with the best practices will survive,  which has become very evident as of late. We talk a lot of shit about BP, but what happened with them could've happened to absolutely anyone. It's a human problem. (I don't mean to discount their failures. I'm NOT happy at all about that.) If BP pulled from the GoM right now,  you'd feel it. They're the biggest player.   For instance, the biggest tax player to LCG is Frank's casing. Their biggest money maker is BP by far. look it up in the LCG website, tax data of you don't believe me. It's a conundrum, an evil we have to accept if you want Lafayette to be Lafayette.   I worked on the Macondo,  BP spill as part of the team that worked for 4 months to shut it in. It was bad, even worse than the media led on. Unfortunately, it was a regulatory wake up call. Personally,  I believe that drilling here should come with the responsibility of doing work to protect/rebuild Louisiana just the same, 1 for 1. We cannot do that if naysayers are making their voices null by saying ""omg get out of here you're RAPING us!"" We need people to stand up and require companies to be accountable."
Acadiana,2vrf65,Gandalf6969,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:04:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and I even worked for a small company that the safety director considered doing away with safety bonuses and similar programs because he had too many accounts of spills, accidents or whatever that were never reported or handled badly resulting in fines, just so these guys could get a little pre-paid visa card.  (I even nearly had to go to court when an employee sued due to the fact that the company had him using a chainsaw with disabled safety features had a branch knocked out from under him, cut his leg and then crushed his ankle.  This resulted in an amputation.  Just so the company could save money by not hiring a professional to do this.  And why did this employee do it, because he was the nice guy who had the mindset of be loyal to the company.  His family, and even other employees had to talk him into getting a lawyer, as the poor guy just wanted to go back to work.    Also, with Macondo, my dad knew one of the guys who was killed on it.  was one of his shop hands who left that job to work offshore.  Was a few months from getting married.  That really hit my dad hard.  The corp i work for also owns one of the companies that tried to cap the well, and even met a few of the engineers who worked on that, and how it involved a lot of throwing random ideas around because it was a round the clock rush to get something going.  I've even met and had conversations with someone who worked for Red Adair, and even had his old uniform in a glass case in his office (I knew that name because my Grandpa, who worked in the oil field from the mid 40's through the mid 80's when he was part of what really was considered oilfield trash, considered him a hero).  A lot of the people that piss and moan (and end their day by hopping into a car to go home) don't realize that, yes, while in past years, there may have been some seriously bad methods and procedures in place (which can be said of any industry), that things have improved, and these big companies spend millions into safety and environmental research.  Plus, like it or not, go ask a lot of the local charities, and even UL, who donate financially so that they can do operate the way they do (as someone whose father benefitted from Miles Perrett, fuck yeah, I'm very happy that the company I work for hands over multiple donations a year and sponsors events for them.  It's a fucking awesome program.)"
Acadiana,2vrf65,StephenFish,2,Fri Feb 13 15:26:50 2015 UTC,Cool stuff! There are def things being done and millions upon millions being thrown at safety and environmental. I could go on and on about how things have changed since Macondo. It's 180.

They're all really trashy neighborhoods.  My neighbors listen to mariachi at volumes high enough to shake my windows and they do it until 4am on weeknights.  I've tried asking them to stop, but they just threatened to kick my ass.  The police won't do anything because they said technically it's not against the law.  These are the kinds of places I always end up, but being a poor college student has its limitations when you're looking to live in a house.  It really just comes down to the self-centered, entitled attitude people have in this city.  They ruin neighborhoods for everyone else because of the ""I'm gone get mines"" outlook."
Acadiana,2vri9w,StephenFish,1 point,Sat Feb 14 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Noise ordinances go into effect at 10pm.  How are the police not doing anything?  Invite them to your house first, let them listen for a while, and then ask them to do something about it.  That's what it took one time when I had similar neighbors.  They ended up getting arrested because of the number of times I called the police and made them do the same thing.  Every time, I was justified.  The neighbors kept playing dumb, and the cop - who luckily enough was the same one every time - told them he can hear them in my apartment, and if he has to come back they are all under arrest for misdemeanor disturbing the peace or something.  All three of them ended up in cuffs and were evicted the next day.  Since they weren't there to be served, the eviction notice was posted on their door.  Keep on trying, you can make it happen.  Don't be scared of chest-beaters, they usually have very little reasoning skills, aren't intelligent enough to outwit trained law enforcement, and aren't brave enough to jeopardize what little they have for a few nights stay in jail and an eviction notice."

So either the cops aren't even bothering to show up or the idiots are ignoring them.  Over the course of about 3 months I think I've called at least a dozen times.  My plan was to call until either the cops get tired of being called out or the neighbors get tired of having cops at their house.  I think the problem arises in that I live in a shitty neighborhood and the cops seem to think that it just comes with the territory.  The last cop I spoke to said there was nothing he could do and I asked him, ""What about disturbing the peace?"", but he said that it didn't apply to this situation.  My assumption is that he was lazy and didn't want to deal with the situation.  I guess he could have been an idiot, but that's pretty basic stuff to play dumb with."

For businesses especially, the cost/speed benefit of LUS FIBER is super attractive, and not having access to that internet while other outlying cities do, will put Broussard at a competitive disadvantage for bringing in some new businesses."
Acadiana,2vq3zr,flashblazer,3,Fri Feb 13 13:36:07 2015 UTC,"I can honestly see both points of views.  Cox/Comcast/whomever doesn't mandate the municipalities to pay for the infrastructure, however; they are much larger in scope.  LUS would be awesome to have in Broussard, but I fear the bad blood in the past - water charging may hinder further friendly political relations.  I think that a compromise would be in order.  Broussard pays for the infrastructure and LUS gives discounts to the Broussard area until those discounts equal the money spent by Broussard."

It's diverse, there are couples, single people,  married people, black, white, jew & gentile.   After a few drinks, it's just off color CAH jokes, silly prizes, and funny stories. The place they have the game sets us up with a big table in the corner, takes drink/food orders, and kinda caters to us. It's a good time with random people.

I orignally picked up the domain in the early 2000's and used the domain to redirect to a fantasy football page me and coworkers used.  Eventually me and some friends played around with live streaming audio and hosted forums that was mostly occuppied by people from around jeff davis and western acadia parish.  The site came to an end when, due to forgetting to update credit card info, the domain expired, and one particular business owner who held a particular dislike for me and our particular band of misfits snagged it and tried to turn it into a political blog.  He even used some of our first names for authors of his posts.  Luckily for us, he was as intelligent as much as he was a decent human being, which is not much.  Though when it did get snagged, it really was to the point of needing to die because quite a few of the good citizens discovered it and started posting a lot of hateful shit (you know, those nice, JTown religious folk) and everythign was going the way of social media anyhow.  It was like a beta test for what became KATC facebook commentators.  So, if you remember or were active, feel free to say so."

If they did this on top of outside businesses, I bet Cox would freak the fuck out.  I'd kind of like to see the numbers of ex-Cox, current LUS customers.  Ninja edit: maybe that's the plan. Get more businesses on LUS fiber, watch Cox proverbially shit themselves."
Acadiana,2vk94z,dannytheguitarist,2,Wed Feb 11 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"I think my previous answer reply still applies.  Either way, I love the service and hope this expansion is beneficial on all sides."
Acadiana,2vk94z,latenitekid,6,Wed Feb 11 19:00:48 2015 UTC,Time to start a business in my home.
Acadiana,2vk94z,chickenmcfukket,6,Wed Feb 11 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with the good neighbor policy. There is no reason to begin with plans to bring LUS service, Lafayette service, to an area where they already have beef about other stuff. I'm indifferent on whatever the beef is, but if you can't work together, then no, you don't get fiber service.   Also, this means a LOT more money for the City of Lafayette. We're already profiting in millions annually due to LUS fiber specifically, and this means great things like road construction, parks and rec funds, etc."
Acadiana,2vk94z,Silound,3,Wed Feb 11 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same page, if you can't work together on other forms of service, you won't on this.  Fix the old breaks before bringing in potential new ones."
Acadiana,2vk94z,themarknessmonster,1 point,Wed Feb 11 19:05:53 2015 UTC,It also allows you to bring in tech companies and help diversify the area away from oil.
Acadiana,2vk94z,themarknessmonster,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"Well, part of that is the location of Lafayette that makes it ideal for oil.  It's a nice, central spot between Houston and New Orleans, and meets with i49 which dumps off into 90 eventually.  It's strategic.  As far as tech based, I think you will see some, but more often than not, availability of fiber won't turn a city into a tech mecca.  Plus, with Google implimenting their fiber in any city that will let them, it will get more common."
Acadiana,2vk94z,themarknessmonster,8,Thu Feb 12 14:07:23 2015 UTC,"While that's really awesome, the ""good neighbor"" requirement is a load of BS that should not be tacked on the requirements.  Before going out of the parish, LUS needs to make peace with the local apartment/condo complexes and offer service to more residents in the city. Apartment/Dondo dwellers account for the highest population density per acre of land and usually have more modest budgets where saving $15-50 per month on services is an attractive proposition."
Acadiana,2vk94z,themarknessmonster,3,Wed Feb 11 18:49:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think the hard part of that is they need a certain percentage to commit to the service because of the equipment that would need to be installed per apartment (fiber to coax/cat5 converters).  Plus, are there any restrictions in place if the complexes have some type of agreement with Cox?"
Acadiana,2vk94z,squeamish,3,Wed Feb 11 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. To run fiber to an entire, existing apartment complex takes money and manpower. You have to run it, integrate it, install power supply/conditioning, and tons of requirements because we aren't talking about running copper wire here. We're talking about fragile photonic equipment. If a complex installs all of these stuff, expensive modulation gear, will the city maintain profit, or go into the red?  LUS is a business and they have to operate as such. It's not charity where they just start throwing money at outdated complexes in Lafayette."
Acadiana,2vk94z,squeamish,4,Wed Feb 11 19:00:17 2015 UTC,And the last thing they want to do is sink into a hole.  The teabaggers would pounce on that like the clueless rabid meatheads they are.
Acadiana,2vk94z,themarknessmonster,4,Wed Feb 11 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"Problem is, they're well represented on the council, which is kind photonic, when you think about it from a free-market perspective.  The dog-eat-dog libertarian in these guys should compel them to do whatever they can to take over those accounts or contracts, while the government worker in them has their libertarian principles stymied."
Acadiana,2vk94z,themarknessmonster,3,Wed Feb 11 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"off subject, reason.com actually had an interesting writeup on how they are not in favor of the tea party and that they even felt insulted  by some using their party.  Mainly because they feel that the tea party was also about imposing about their religious beliefs and how they only care about individual liberties that would affect them and scream fuck the rest.  Now granted that this was probably written by someone of a political belief that doesn't need to be an irrational asshole like so many get to be, and are like some of the ones that while you disgree with, can say ""oh well, we dont' agree, but we can sit, have a beer, and bs about other things while not waving political dicks in the air"".  Anyway, long story short, Tea Party nuts are out for themselves.  So fuck em."
Acadiana,2vk94z,chickenmcfukket,2,Wed Feb 11 19:44:40 2015 UTC,Wouldn't running fiber to complexes be very similar if not identical to most small business complexes that have fiber? Or buildings like The Chase Building?
Acadiana,2vk94z,Clumsybritt,2,Wed Feb 11 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, similar drops however there's a higher chance that Chase building businesses will get internet service than 300-500 individual residents, which many have 0 internet."
Acadiana,2vk94z,Silound,2,Wed Feb 11 19:35:40 2015 UTC,How so?
Acadiana,2vk94z,Silound,2,Wed Feb 11 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"Infrastructure is the same. My point is that you have a higher chance getting businesses to buy your service rather than residential. Many people still don't have internet at home. If you spend the $$$ to make a service available to 500 units and only 230 units buy the service, then you're in the red."
Acadiana,2vk94z,Silound,2,Wed Feb 11 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though a way around that would be to write up a contract with the complex that it is rolled into the rent on at least the most basic level, then you get your 500 regardless of the numbers regarding actual consumption.  There are several complexes in the area that do that, and I wouldn't mind if my complex did that myself.    Obviously the smart way to do that would be a referendum or a series of polls before drafting a bill, but I would be interested in knowing how many people would go for this, especially if a deal could(and usually are)be worked out for bulk-pricing based on number of units."
Acadiana,2vk94z,Esper21,1 point,Wed Feb 11 19:44:25 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, or even likely. The equipment necessary to provide service to 500 isn't much more than that necessary for 230. Plus a lot of it scales after-the-fact. Yes, you have to wire it, but that is fairly inexpensive long-term.  The actual reason is no doubt related to Cox's ability to convince property owners to not allow it. No idea what the incentives are, though."
Acadiana,2vk94z,Silound,2,Wed Feb 11 23:16:01 2015 UTC,Each business customer is worth MUCH more than a residential customer. I have a client that uses a lot of Cox installations and each one is about $200-$250/month. That's probably 20-30 times the margin of a residential account.
Acadiana,2vk94z,bruce656,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"most buinesses will have routers, firewalls and switching equipment on their internal network, LUS does not supply this.  We have locations that have fiber from AT&T, which comes in to an interface that converts it to a connection that will be connectable with our firewall."
Acadiana,2vk94z,latenitekid,2,Wed Feb 11 22:34:05 2015 UTC,"Then wouldn't it be a beneficial business move to supply the complexes with the modems and routers and other necessary hardware?  If I were a manager/property owner, I'd just roll that cost into the deposit."
Acadiana,2vk94z,bruce656,2,Wed Feb 11 22:40:24 2015 UTC,"Building a proper infrastructure is not cheap.   This includes routers, switching, depending on how the fiber comes in, load balancing equipment.  just an example.  a single cisco 24 port switch is around $5k.  That's your cheapest component.  Plus, maintaining it is very expensive.  AT&T just need cable run to each apartment that go back to strategically placed Dmarcs on the outside of the building.  I mean, you can buy other brands for cheaper, but the costs of maintaning, repairing and replacing will eat your ass long term and cost you way more.  What we need is an engineer with LUS Fiber who could tell us either how they would handle this, and if it would even be cost effective.  Can we get an LUS Fiber engineer to do an AMA?  It would be the simplest solution"
Acadiana,2vk94z,latenitekid,2,Wed Feb 11 22:50:35 2015 UTC,I agree on the AMA request.  We've gone too long without getting the skinny.
Acadiana,2vk94z,Paperlips,1 point,Thu Feb 12 02:06:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand it isn't free,but you can reach hundreds of customers at a time."
Acadiana,2vk94z,Paperlips,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"but, how long will it take to make back what they invest?  Will it be cost effective long term?    Obviously they would get an increase in customers, but what percentage of customers per complex are needed to make it worth the investment for them?"
Acadiana,2vk94z,Paperlips,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:55:47 2015 UTC,"I think they'd make it back quickly if they phased it. Go with complexes immediately on the lines and phase them in first. Sure, it may look like gentrification or something, but it could totally work out"
Acadiana,2vk94z,Hormisdas,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"Now, i'm also looking at it the way I'd look at an office complex, so having an LUS engineer answer questions coudl really give us an idea of how they would do fiber to a multi resident unit."
Acadiana,2vk94z,Paperlips,2,Thu Feb 12 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"There are no fiber to coax converters. A fiber terminal is installed as an exterior ""wall wart"" and a Cat5e line is run from the terminal into the home and the back of the router.  Realistically, back in 2009, the big problem LUS had was that they didn't have the correct network infrastructure to support apartments and condos. Their infrastructure went from the fiber trunk along the road straight to the primary domicile on the property: one connection per address. Obviously, for any place that has unit numbers, this was the stopping point because a complex would need a trunk branch onto the property into a distribution box where the individual units would be serviced from (also expensive to install). By now, they should have resolved that deficiency (if not, that's a colossal failure on LUS's behalf) and they should be capable of offering service.   However, agreements with Cox or other companies do exist at many locations. Typically, those agreements provide the complex with a limited basic service as part of the rent, and tenants are expected to pay for any service beyond that limited point."
Acadiana,2vk94z,grumpyolddude,3,Wed Feb 11 19:22:00 2015 UTC,where is this router that you speak of.   because I have no.  The terminal installed on external walls does convert to coax and cat5 (if you have tv service).

When you get a Redflex ticket, they're a private company that says, ""You owe us money because our camera thinks you ran a red light / sped through an intersection.""  It's evident that it's a matter of debt rather than a legal fine because failure to pay will lead to the ticket being sent to a collection agency, not a prosecution.  Because you never agreed to this private debt, they can't enforce it."
Acadiana,2vlfql,Phnglui,2,Fri Feb 13 06:09:11 2015 UTC,"The law is specifically written to allow it/make it enforceable, I linked to the code above. The fact that a private company manages the system for the police makes no difference, that is specifically addressed in the code."
Acadiana,2vlfql,StephenFish,1 point,Fri Feb 13 13:57:07 2015 UTC,Just because a law exists doesn't make it enforceable.  You can bet your ass it'd be brought to a state court instead of staying in Lafayette if they actually tried to pursue legal action over them.

My mom and dad lived there when I was born, but I was fortunate enough to have left at a really early age when my mom and dad divorced.  From there, I've lived here, Houston, back here again, Houston again, Manhattan, KS (a surprisingly progressive and dare I say, idyllic small college town, home of KSU), then when I was about 16, back here permanently.

Acadiana,2vg33i,StephenFish,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:49:39 2015 UTC,"I don't see the big deal. It's an entire genre (klezmer, gypsy punk, punk cabaret, etc). I suppose Gogol was the pioneer that threw punk into the mix, but there's other good bands like Golem, Firewater, Balkan Beat Box, and of course Debauche. Debauche does list Gogol as one of their influences. I don't think that discounts them or anything. In fact, here's a post from Gogol from when they went see Debauche in October.  Technically, Gogol followed the likeness of World Inferno Friendship Society that formed in 1996 in NY (Gogol formed in 1999 in NY), adding a punk element vice the circus punk/cabaret."

Acadiana,2ve4vo,Yohfay,4,Tue Feb 10 06:18:27 2015 UTC,"As far as practical, I recommend boxing & MMA first. Your top McDojo choices are Gladiator's Academy & UFC Gym. I'll give you a rundown.  Gladiators: I trained there for two years in BJJ, Muay Thai, boxing, nogi, etc. The main instructors are fantastic in all disciplines. Tim Credeur (owner) is a UFC vet, the state's highest black belt, and he's fucking crazy, good crazy. He's a great guy, but he advertises awfully. Go to the gym, bring gear, ask to train for a day to get a feel. It's a no-ego gym, but the MMA craze has TONS of people trying it for a ""free month"" and the classes were packed tight, so tight that some days we couldn't roll or throw kicks without bumping into each other. It got ridiculous and the prices went form $1200 a year to about $2000, so I left. It was so packed that I couldn't get one on one with the instructors anymore, and there were lots of student instructors. Some are great guys/gals, others are full of themselves. As far as ability, it has the #1 BJJ, nogi, and Muay Thai in the area, if not the state. Not shitting ya. It's expensive because it's produced people like Dustin Poirier (UFC) and other guys I've trained with are now in UFC, Bellator, Glory, etc. Good luck getting attention for that kind of training without being a fucking animal or having lots of $$$. This is the best, but it comes with trade offs.   UFC Gym: Owned by a really cool guy that was a co-owner of what was LA Boxing in Baton Rouge. It's a good, humble guy. Some people are ex-Gladiator instructors & cage fighters. My kickboxing & nogi, Christian, is there now and he is worth every penny. He's skilled and above all, he's a great teacher, a wrestler and MMA fighter by profession. IMO UFC is a brand name however the staff there is good. It's the Tapout Mafia that comes in to ""learn UFC"" that is a pain, but that's hard to escape. As far as I remember, they do not have BJJ there, because they do not have a blackbelt to teach it. Tim Credeur has the state on lockdown, so no Gi's. This cheaper than Gladiator's, but you get a LOT more. Gladiator's is a sliding scale and you have to pay up for more training, which is why I left (besides an instructor theeping me so hard in the chest I couldn't breather, mf'r). If you ask, they'll give you a few days trial.  San Yama Ryu: This is some kickass shit, but it's hidden away and word of mouth. I'll PM you the details as it's traditional and not advertised. There are high level karate with aikido aspects. It's not my thing, but a cool discipline. The other guy, Sensei John is a Japanese-American guy that teaches San Yama Ryu. It's a discipline that he's developed himself that is Japanese bujutsu-kai but it has a LOT of judo entrances, hip throws, etc. They practice with katana (mock swords ofc), knives, staffs, but the guy will bust out a real sword and do some wicked samurai stuff and give you a history of it. It's super cheap, but kind of a word of mouth invite. I found it really cool, because it challenged me a lot. I learned to block knife attacks, take guns/knives, pull a knife/sword correctly (like a samurai) and cut on the first draw, attack sensitive spots on the body, etc. The first thing I learned was blocking a knife attack, to hip throw, to arm bar, and then using their own knife to strike them. Wicked.   Those are places that I'm familiar with. Red's has a ring, but classes cost $$$. Title Boxing is bag classes, not a discipline. I think there's a Ragin' Cajun Boxing Club somewhere that I'd actually be interested in. If you're looking for self-defense first, I recommend boxing or MMA, not karate or judo, etc. It's very debatable, but basic fighting skills are best. You can go on to learn a Far East discipline later."

I'm mostly into rock music with various other genres of music in my collection. The problem is I'm not into country music. Just not my style to be honest. That's all I've heard anyone listen to here. So, I'm looking for non-country/redneck things to do."
Acadiana,2v9l4b,bruce656,7,Mon Feb 9 04:39:18 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've been around the wrong crowd then, because a great majority of us are the exact opposite of the redneck country types.  Most people will likely recommend Green Room. It's rock/alternative,  pool tables, etc. Caff√® Cottage is cool. Wild Salmon is a rock dive. Jefferson Street Pub is good. There are a lot of hard rock, metal, punk, hardcore, fuzz, etc, bands here and decent crowds associated with those venues."
Acadiana,2v9l4b,Clumsybritt,3,Mon Feb 9 04:54:07 2015 UTC,"Well, shit. Maybe it's just the people around me in Youngsville haha. I've heard of Green Room, but not the other places you mentioned. I will definitely be checking them out!"

I'd suggest staying outta downtown (Green room area) to be honest. Most of it is ""meat markety"" and just very superfical. Not the best places to meet new friends.   Bisbano's is another great joint. It's got a stage area/bar and patio right under a fullfledged pizzaria!"

After the year, my bill doubled. On the advice of a friend who worked for Cox, he told me to call and threaten to cancel, and, to retain me, they'd offer me a deal similar to what I'd had before. Still got a bill for over $200 the next month, and saw it rising swiftly. By the time I asked to cancel for real, they were charging me $275. I immediately ""noped"" this, called LUS that day, and went to Cox to turn all their shit in.  A month later, I get a bill for $675. The $275 and somehow $400 for that last month.  Fuck Cox. Fuck them hard. I hope LUS drives them out of business.  Not only that, but my internet hasn't dropped a single time with LUS, while it'd drop if someone sneezed in Brazil with Cox."

My point is, there is a venue that sits somewhat dormant outside of the regular tenants most of the time, and they offer very little variety when it comes to shows.  Also, and I'm being honest, Indie has really become as much a genre than just a bands standing with labels.  In the end though, if you like something, listen to it.

It just seems to me that most bars around here don't have any appreciation for the craft and approach it with the mindset of, ""Well, I guess we have to participate in this fad to get people off of our backs.  Here you go hipsters, something that's not Bud."""

Acadiana,2uyfb9,wwjdforaklondikebar,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"Even the bar girls apologize for it. I racked up a 50$ bar tab getting snakebites and went apeshit on the manager...and my card group is about 1/2 of his Saturday night take. He cut my bill in half and apologized, but one 20oz still costs as much as a six pack."
Acadiana,2uyfb9,Phnglui,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is, it's not profitable. I managed a bar years ago and we attempted to bring in a large variety of beers on top of your usual domestics. The venders worked with us to keep the cost down and set up new systems and taps. We got customers' opinions on what they would like to see on the ""tap wall."" We promoted the hell out of it, trying to bring in new people that had been looking for a larger variety. Still wasn't able to make it work.  Problem is, Lafayette isn't big enough for something like that. Beer doesn't last forever. We were having to write off half full kegs because while everyone of the beers was being sold, it just wasn't enough. ""Beer snobs"" don't typically drink in excess.   Ended up dumping most of the specialty beers and kept 3 of them along with the typical domestics. This was years ago. I would hope Lafayette would be more open minded at this point, but it doesn't appear that way. The reason you're seeing such high mark ups on those beers now is probably for the same reasons we ended up getting rid of them. So they can cover the cost of the wasted beer left in the kegs."
Acadiana,2uyfb9,wwjdforaklondikebar,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"Happy's has 99 different beers on tap. Their biggest sellers are Miller Lite, Coors Light, Mich Ultra, etc.   Now, it's not a good location, it's too small, and there's no parking, that might contribute to it.   What we need is a craft beer store. We have Marcellos and Phillippe's, but they're wine stores that happen to carry some craft beer.   We need a beer store that specializes in craft beer and home brewing. Grow the interest in craft beer here. It's there, there's just not many places now that cultivate it.   That aside Lafayette is going to get a World of Beer, so maybe that'll help."

Now if someone called you a ""t-neg"" THAT was meant to be derogatory. (And quite racist)  I've never heard ""Toby"" used before like ya'll are saying. The only way I've ever heard that used is black guys calling other black guys a ""Toby"".  Meaning an ignorant black guy who hasn't accepted his black heritage. (From the movie/book Roots)  Now, ""Jody"" is a guy that comes and fucks your wife when you're offshore...."
Acadiana,2uy9vh,steevn,4,Fri Feb 6 14:21:33 2015 UTC,"Ya, I've never used  t boy as a derogatory term, or even heard it that way for that matter.  I have a buddy whose uncle is ""uncle t boy"" and that's his fucking name. I work the oilfield and its used often, never in a derogatory way.  A Toby is a white guy who thinks he's black. Tasha is his girlfriend.  And ya, Jody drinks all your beer and fucks your wife while you're away."
Acadiana,2uy9vh,threetoast,1 point,Fri Feb 6 19:26:51 2015 UTC,How old are you? I think this term came about around '94 or so.
Acadiana,2uy9vh,threetoast,1 point,Fri Feb 6 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"Let's just say I'm comfortably in the ""Over 35"" demographic."
Acadiana,2uy9vh,dannytheguitarist,1 point,Fri Feb 6 16:22:02 2015 UTC,This is interesting to me. How Cajun white-trash naming conventions have changed over the years from Jody to Toby.   I assume that women named their sons after the guy that was probably the father of the child; the guy who slept with them while their husbands were offshore. I would LOVE to see how many men named Toby had fathers named Jody.
Acadiana,2uy9vh,ULalum06,2,Fri Feb 6 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"To get the full late 80's/early 90's T-boy vibe you have to throw in low rider pick up trucks, a lot of bass, and an air brushed vanity license plate."

Acadiana,2uxpbq,dannytheguitarist,8,Fri Feb 6 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to dives, myself, mainly because it seems I only go drinking when we have a show. Wild Salmon, Bisbanos basement...I like Green Oaks because they have an internet jukebox and have never changed the song midsong whether I'm listening to Bad Religion or GWAR.   I've never tried Green Room or any of these others. I'm open to going, but again, I usually only go to bars when we play. I have three kids, a full time job and a full time school schedule..."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,StephenFish,3,Fri Feb 6 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Though Green Oaks has a terrible beer selection and I still don't get why anyone gets excited about their burgers, I still love that place.  As long as you don't cause trouble, they're good to you.  You can play whatever music you want, play pool all night and never be bothered.  At most I've seen a dozen people there at once.  It's smokey as hell, but when you're 130 pages deep in one of their sex novels, you tend to not notice."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,Sfthoia,0,Fri Feb 6 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"Salmon is really underappreciated. They have nice greasy drunk-chow and the prices are decent, plus their main stage is pretty great for a small bar. (As opposed to Heffes, which has terrible acoustics)"
Acadiana,2uxpbq,rd8t,3,Fri Feb 6 14:34:08 2015 UTC,I'm visiting my cousin here right now. She lives a 10 minutes walk from there. Thinking of heading there in a bit.
Acadiana,2uxpbq,bruce656,2,Fri Feb 6 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"what's funny is for 2.5 years i lived in an apartment in walking distance, had a friends band play twice, and both times managed to miss it...  I fail at life."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,wwjdforaklondikebar,8,Fri Feb 6 22:26:58 2015 UTC,The bar at Pamplona is fucking awesome. The bartenders there known their shit.
Acadiana,2uxpbq,rd8t,3,Fri Feb 6 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've been racking my brain and I can't think of one bar that I actually enjoy. There's always a trade off:  Green Room has okay drinks and it's not too smokey. I like the crowd, but there are often too many damn people. I wish that there were another Green Room that wasn't downtown.   Caffe Cottage is my crowd, sorta, I like that it has two sides, but it's smokey and congested on one side, no live music.   Wild Salmon is a fun dive to hang with friends and meet drinking buddies. The music is cool. It's a little shady late at night however. There's always a super drunk guy that needs to be stopped from driving home and it's the only place I've had to hit someone.   Bread & Circus is fucking bomb if you want a REAL cocktail and a snack. f  JP's has kickass bartenders, but it's super smokey and has a weird, douche crowd at times.   If I wanted a definite good time out, I'd go to an Icegators game, section 127, and get me a big ass $9 Canebreak, cold as ice.   Edit: The tap room at Parish Brewery is great for a beer or two. Nice staff, they obviously know their beer, and it's a beautiful bar."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,wwjdforaklondikebar,2,Fri Feb 6 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"Come to the Green Room on a week night and its perfect.  Also, trivia starts at 7pm :D"
Acadiana,2uxpbq,wooster27,2,Fri Feb 6 22:36:46 2015 UTC,"parish is a bit of a haul, but yes. i should go there more."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,pele1410,3,Fri Feb 6 17:14:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, come on. It's not that far. I work near it and have two empty growlers. Happy to pick some up for you on the way home if you give me a heads up."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,StephenFish,2,Fri Feb 6 17:25:31 2015 UTC,do they still do trivia?
Acadiana,2uxpbq,pele1410,3,Fri Feb 6 17:26:45 2015 UTC,No clue. They do casks on Friday's. They'll do stuff like chocolate ginger vanilla satsuma South Coast and stuff. It's interesting.
Acadiana,2uxpbq,Clumsybritt,2,Fri Feb 6 17:31:57 2015 UTC,whoa. the beer snob in me is tenting.
Acadiana,2uxpbq,wooster27,2,Fri Feb 6 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but for a while they were doing trivia on thursdays as well.  EDIT:  actually read the damn comments and don't glance over before answering...dammit"
Acadiana,2uxpbq,Sir_Trivium,3,Fri Feb 6 22:25:18 2015 UTC,Green Room.  I freakin love Yates
Acadiana,2uxpbq,GEAUXUL,8,Fri Feb 6 22:33:59 2015 UTC,Green room
Acadiana,2uxpbq,Refrmech81,2,Fri Feb 6 01:29:05 2015 UTC,"I like the Tap Room alot more since the new owner took over.  It helps that I can walk there.  Shiner's new Birthday Beer is a pretty smooth stout, not very heavy at all.  Edit: This is much better :)"
Acadiana,2uxpbq,wwjdforaklondikebar,5,Fri Feb 6 12:41:42 2015 UTC,"I've not been to Tap Room since it changed owners.  Do the bartenders still not know the difference between a Chimay and a Rogue Dead Guy?  Do they still charge 4x the regular bar price?  If so, I'll keep looking.  Edit: charge, not change"
Acadiana,2uxpbq,Sir_Trivium,2,Fri Feb 6 14:31:28 2015 UTC,Can't say that the price has changed much.  But the bartenders aren't constantly changing every week and they seem to know more about beer than before.
Acadiana,2uxpbq,pele1410,2,Fri Feb 6 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"I still really dig that Lava Lamp drink at Somewheres Else. And that server was rad. The Liquid Marijuana drink was neat, too. Gotta find another place to make those just as tasty.   Legends Bertrand has earned my love lately. I can drink & eat pretty cheap, it's nonsmoking and the environment is entertaining. They need to fix whatever happened with the music wiring. But great drink specials on the regular.   Weird beer? Not so much. I've been digging Andygator lately. And that vanilla stout at Legends was good, but they're out now."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,StephenFish,2,Fri Feb 6 03:29:46 2015 UTC,Well and feed n seed recently
Acadiana,2uxpbq,Sir_Trivium,3,Fri Feb 6 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"I've only ever been there for special events, I had no idea they were even open full time! What's it like?"
Acadiana,2uxpbq,ragincajun32,-1,Fri Feb 6 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"I like Pour. There's a guy there who makes a kickass Old Fashioned. He reminds me a bit of Anthony Jeselnik, I wish I wasn't so bad with names."
Acadiana,2uxpbq,daviator88,5,Fri Feb 6 04:27:45 2015 UTC,If you like a kickass old fashioned go to Don's downtown. BY FAR the best I've ever had.

I haven't soiled myself in several days.  Some of the new Transformers are really cool-looking.  Britt has enormous boobs.  I saw ducks having violent sex in Girard Park, and duck rape is always comedy gold.  Green Room trivia night might be fun.  The classic movie night at the Grand is getting good.  I have stolen enough Whole Foods coasters for all of my regular card players.  I heard a cute lady meowing along to the radio in her car today and I wanted to hug her.  My new pistol handles really well.  I have lost about 6 pounds because of my 'poo yourself slim' chili.  I haven't seen that awful saxophone bum downtown for weeks.  Crawfish ams back in season.  and finally,   Adderall is fucking delicious."

Acadiana,2uu2hc,marsatomic,1 point,Fri Feb 6 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"It got really bad a while back.  I had to tank a whole thread.  People were creating throwaway accounts to post threats and Robert Zorn's personal home address.  About 2 months after that, same thing happened.  I was the only mod at the time so I banned Arcadian talk.  I was called a ""Nazi"" and told ""I was ruining this sub"", etc for it.  Most backed me up but I had a lot of hate for it.  After about a year, I added more mods and I brought up the Arcadian issue.  We decided to not ban Arcadian talk but the threads would be closely monitored.    For the most part we follow Reddit's rules of conduct.   No posting personal information that isn't publicly available, no witch hunts, racism etc.  We also have a rule of no over the top name calling that really doesn't add to the conversation."
Acadiana,2uu2hc,cajunbander,1 point,Thu Feb 5 13:31:57 2015 UTC,We also have a rule of no over the top name calling that really doesn't add to the conversation.   Does this rule apply to conversations about Jindal?
Acadiana,2uu2hc,marsatomic,4,Thu Feb 5 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"Any conversation.  And ""over the top"" is vague intentionally so that a moderator has discretion on what is ""over the top"".  I've actually been pretty lax on the over the top name calling.  Very rarely do I have to step in and ask people to calm down.  I think the last time it happened was an argument on speed light cameras that devolved into a ""Fuck you I hope you die"" conversation that was like 50 comments deep.    As always, messaging the mods is the best way to get our attention to shitty comments or something that you think needs to be removed.  Also, if you do have a post that is removed and think it shouldn't, message the mods so that we all know what is going on.  I am sort of active right now on this sub but others may be able to respond quicker."

This is the fourth time they've been charged with selling alcohol to a minor. Nite Town was also fined $5,000.  I dislike seeing local businesses fail, especially one that has/had potential like this one. But it should be an absolute priority to communicate to your employees that selling to minors is a really, really bad thing and will get you shut down before long.

If they are arrested but not convicted, the obligatory ""allegedly"" needs to be added to the end of the line.  For example:  ""Bill Cosby is a rapist, allegedly.""  Then you are cool as the other side of the pillow!   For people who were convicted of rape but then were exonerated.  You can either not call them a rapist or call them once-convicted rapists who are no longer considered rapists in the eyes of the ""insert country""'s justice system.    For someone who is a serial rapist, I can make an exemption if they were convicted of some rapes but not all rapes they were arrested for.  We just need to make sure they are indeed a serial rapist and not just a regular run of the mill rapist.  Let me know if that makes sense."

The victims were in another vehicle and were possible fleeing the scene when he shot and killed one of them.  That is illegal.  Here is the long version and someone correct me if I don't have all the info:  Seth kept having his truck broken in to.  One night, he though he heard someone breaking into his truck.  When he came out, he saw a white truck leaving his house (maybe stopped in front of his house).  He opened fire.  He shot the driver in the ankle and the other kid (Austin, I think) in the head.    They are supposed to be releasing some info from the 2 others in the truck who weren't shot.  Rumor is that they confessed to breaking into the truck that night.  Even if that is true, they were not breaking into his truck when he shot them since they were both shot in the other vehicle.  In Louisiana (as far as I know), you can't shoot someone who is fleeing or is not posing a threat to you.  I would assume (IANAL) but sitting in your truck would constitute as non-threatening."

At the end of the day, all the people who are running their mouths were not there, did not witness what went on.  Others are people who may know this person, and by that may feel he was justified in his actions.

My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.   My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum...it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it."

Acadiana,2ulwqm,BreesusisMagic,12,Tue Feb 3 10:29:21 2015 UTC,"I was born in the Henderson swamp. Our trailer had one light bulb and mom cooked on a wooden pan. We had a family business and worked diligently, never attended school. We harvested cypress knees, shaved them with potato peelers and varnished them. They were sold at the Jocket Lot along with animal pelts and skins.   When I was 17, I was out in my pirogue checking the nutria traps on the levee when I was bit by a nutria. The nutria attacked because I had my lunch, a link of boudin, in my pocket. I spend 90 days in ICU, barely alive, while my poor family accrued all of the debt. They disowned me and I was on my own after that. As it turns out, this nutria was part of the government project, a GMO nutria that was specifically bred to to eat hyacinth water lilies that were blocking up the Henderson Swamp and other waterways in the area. Unfortunately, an interned dropped a piece of boudin in the lab forming an uncontrollable, aggressive species of modified nutria that had an insatiable hunger for boudins.   To this day, I walk amongst the trees of I-10, in the dark, and I save the people from car fires, car crashes, and I've talked down an occasional suicide nearly jumps from the Whiskey Bay bridge. I have seen many things. I live in the shadows, occasionally visit reddit in order to socialize via an iPhone 3G I found at a boat landing years ago. I have seldom ventured into Lafayette. I sometimes visit downtown during Halloween and Mardi Gras, as my appearance tends to blend in a bit more with the crowd. Last Halloween, I was sad to see that Bar Code never opened, as I heard that it was a straight bar that mostly hip hop. Instead, I visited the legendary Fartmosphere. I had bad luck at Fartcadian the previous year as there was a hole in the bathroom wall (not that kind of hole at the LaRose truck stop) and Saint Street cats were filing in left and right. As a part rodent, part man... I'm deathly afraid of felines.   Some nights I venture out to Girard Park to feed the diabetic ducks marsh grass as the bread has made them bloated and I'm afraid that there little flippers might fall off. Lately, I've been pretty bummed so I won't be leaving the swamp until Nickleback plays at the Cajundome, as they're my favorite band.   I am the mystery tipper. I invented the Boudin King Cake. It's been said, ""He's  the hero that Acadiana deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. He is Nutria-Man.""   Nutria-man, nutria-man! doing the things that a nutria can! He's part invasive species, and he's part man! Hanging out at Lake Martin with the hippo clan. Give a boudin, and I'll sing and dance. I'm Nutria-man and I don't wear pants."

I am a father of one, engaged to be married this November to a woman that has made me the happiest man on this planet.  I was born a musician and remain one to this day, and will be even when I'm dead and gone.  I love all kinds of music.    I write, in my spare time, and have gained a growing affection for fountain pens, bookbinding, and developing different penmanships.  I also have a love of pipe tobacco - including smoking and blending - and have a modest collection of pipes.    I love to play video games, learning how to craft new things, playing D&D, and board games in general.  I am currently DM'ing my first D&D campaign, and am loving every minute of it.  I've made my own maps, characters, books, charts, towns, worlds, monsters, and am bringing my party on an adventure they'll never forget.  I'm a not-so-active-anymore activist against Redflex and the Safelight/Safespeed program here in Lafayette, and have been since 2007 when they were first proposed to LCG by Charlie Buckels.  There are several posts about the topic that I have made in the past to this and other forums, so I won't bother to discuss it here.  I have traveled the world, experienced handfuls of religions, and discovered that none of them have it right, and after many years of deliberation, research, questioning, and doubting, I've since left faith and religion and belief in any kind of supernatural or deity.  I am what is most commonly referred to as an atheist.  I love legos, Deadpool, Superman, Dragonball Z, Outlaw Star, Breaking Bad, LOST, Mythbusters, Dirty Jobs, Cenk Uguyur of TYT, whiskey, Dr. Pepper, printing presses, and building things.  I am anti-gun, pro-choice, pro-LGBT, anti-new-feminist-agenda(Anita Sarkeesian's so-called ""damsel in distress"" movement), pro-freedom of religion.

Acadiana,2uf9ci,Inthe713,6,Sun Feb 1 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Where are you from?  There's just one parade the Saturday before Mardi Gras. It's alright. The end of the parade route ends at a fair so if you have kiddies that might be a good place to watch it. If you aren't up for that, the beginning of the route is in the bad part of town. It's not unsafe and I've watched parades from there in the past, but there are nicer spots to watch from. Parking isn't really terrible anywhere. You shouldn't have to walk more than a block or two anywhere you go.   If you want to try something different, check out the Courir De Mardi Gras celebrations in the small towns around Lafayette. These are the traditional cajun mardi gras celebrations and it's pretty neat to see."

Good places to watch?  I like Downtown or near Our Lady of Fatima School/Blackham Coliseum."
Acadiana,2uf9ci,RaginRealtor,3,Sun Feb 1 21:24:46 2015 UTC,"I recommend in front of Blackham coliseum. There's parking streetside, it's by ALL of the restrooms, and there's a fence streetside. If you have young ones,  you can stand behind the fence, a bit safer. It's really chill and I live right there."
Acadiana,2uf9ci,pele1410,3,Sun Feb 1 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"Since there's only one parade that Saturday anyway, I suggest coming in for this Saturday's parade, Krewe of Carnivale en Rio Parade.

Feel free to ask me any questions if you are unsure about having received a notice of violation, though, at this point, there are probably several in this very thread who can also answer many of the questions you may have if I can't get to them fast enough, but am happy to offer a second opinion - but with only regurgitating facts.  Please refer to my history for my opinions.  The last couple of times I have aired my opinions on the subject, it attracted the attention of some people I do not wish to speak to again, apologists that have created troll accounts in some cases to disseminate personal information about me, and I've received letters in the mail telling people they have police friends that are going to ""hound me and wait until I am alone and vulnerable"".  I just don't want to be harassed anymore by trolls and apologists.  I am more than willing to answer questions - with facts and links to articles with statistics and unbiased studies as sources of those facts - but discussing my opinion any further is not going to happen.

Unfortunately it's cheaper to just pay the expanded cost for the ticket than it is to fight them in court.

As for new opinions?  Broken record at this point, I'm afraid.  At this stage in the game, and to avoid anymore trolls like that one guy that lives in Shreveport(who showed up on the last big Redflex thread I participated in, who eventually elicited the attention of several friends of mine, and I think you and /u/kuntslinger took a few pot-shots at him as well), I'm going to merely refer anyone to my history if they want an opinion.  I'm of the firm belief that the facts are more valuable here anyway, despite my convictions in my opinions, and how right I may be, which I believe I am(and this thread's trend aligns with it as well, so my opinion would be of little value to anyone here).

America is the world leader in false-flag events, because they serve to help us export profitable wars and to cement control over a mostly ignorant and gullible populace. If it drives the narrative that 'our children are at risk because guns', why wouldn't they have done it? People are doubting the news more and more, and they should.  It's gotten to the point that the elite/fed has lost all legitimacy, and will be blamed for shit they didn't even do. If it helps the people of the US get back on the road to self-government and peace, how is this a bad thing? Just my perspective, no hate meant to anyone."

I understand what you're saying about restoring accountability, but substituting wild-eyed conspiracy thinking for it is not the answer."
Acadiana,2tam01,paulwal,1 point,Fri Jan 23 01:14:51 2015 UTC,"Have you heard of MKUltra? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra  There are minimal consequences if the truth is discovered because the truth can be covered up. Once you realize the media is highly conglomeratized and thus easily manipulated, it makes it easier to see things like this being possible. I'm not saying Sandy Hook is definitely a conspiracy, but it won't help to shame people who just want to ask questions and posit alternative theories. It's just closed-minded and toxic to open discussion.  The vast majority of people would have reacted in the same closed-minded way to conspiracy theorists who suggested even half of what Edward Snowden brought to light. It has been shown that if an exploit, vulnerability, or information power grab is even remotely possible, then the intelligence community is actively pursuing it. Two years ago most people would be indignant and outraged at someone who dared suggest that good old Uncle Sam would do such a thing.  Another eye-opener is realizing where the real power in the world is. It lies in the banking system. We are presented with a theatrical illusion of politicians, and thus the people, being in control and pulling the strings. It's simply not the case. It's the money masters. http://youtu.be/EeIM-4hJO44  Have an open mind and make a good faith effort at taking a close look at these things and researching the details. You will find that it's not fiction. Also keep in mind that the internet, Reddit included, is manipulated by intelligence teams. http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/02/revealed-air-force-ordered-software-to-manage-army-of-fake-virtual-people/ There are other sources and hints of this out there. But most importantly, why wouldn't they do it?  Please don't participate in shaming people for asking questions and seeking the truth. But do be wary and discerning of bullshit. http://youtu.be/fTmhQTinW1Y"
Acadiana,2tam01,atchafalaya,2,Sat Jan 24 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry, still not buying it. Sure, the media, including Reddit, is manipulated. Not very well, however.   You're asking me to believe that there is a body of Americans out there that has successfully perpetrated a fake massacre including all witnesses, local officials, hundreds and hundreds of people in all, in order to promote gun control, even though the last umpteen massacres didn't do it?  Here's what I think: gun ownership has become the modern substitute for civic engagement. A lot of Americans have apparently decided they no longer identify with the government, or with where they see America going, for a bunch of reasons, and think an AR-15 is going to insulate them from the supposed outcome. To me this is the source of a lot of anxious white male fantasizing, including Chris Kyle's hogwash about killing robbers at a gas station and repelling the hordes at the Superdome.  The second part of this is that I guess it's easier for the right wing conscience to believe the government did it than to accept that the proliferation of guns means massacres are now a feature of our society. Many people go nuts in our country, and they choose to take their easily available guns and kill people with them.  I hate this stupidity, but I've made my peace with it. All I can do is hope my kids don't get shot. I'm sure as hell not going to embrace some bullshit conspiracy theory in order to mask my complicity."

They -in general- don't care about the prices of the houses they're buying and selling. They get their 3% anyway and a thousand bucks on the sale price may be a big difference to you, but not to them.  Since it doesn't seem like you have a house to sell, they'll be drooling over you - no contingencies make the deal that much easier. Any realtor would love to have you.  I'm not telling you NOT to get a realtor, but when you're just buying a house, none are better than any other ones because you're going to be making your decisions anyway. You, ultimately, will be doing all the legwork in finding houses to go view. And you should be. Just understand where everyone's motivation is when making a deal.

Acadiana,2sw1hp,light_pipe,8,Mon Jan 19 03:19:48 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. Especially since the ""Project Front Yard"" initiative is gaining some momentum.   Edit Here is the Project front yard twitter account, which is run by the LCG."

Acadiana,2sw1hp,wwjdforaklondikebar,3,Mon Jan 19 20:21:31 2015 UTC,"Also, another person to reach out to would be the new public works director, Kevin Blanchard. While not directly related to what you mentioned, he said in a meeting a couple weeks ago, the last float in the Rio parade will be a trailer, and they're asking everyone to throw their trash in. He had a few other ideas about litter in Acadiana.  I think I found him on Twitter (@KevinMBlanchard), but he doesn't look very active. I'll do some Googling and see if I can find an email or contact form."

Acadiana,2sooan,ClockworkMachination,7,Sat Jan 17 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, to answer your question, I'm sorry but I don't know of any groups.  Second, I'm just going to say this. If your plumbing backs up you call a plumber because that guy is an expert on plumbing and will know better than anyone else how to fix it. If you break your leg you go to a doctor because that guy is an expert on fixing legs and he will know better than anyone else how to fix it. If you are suffering from depression and you want to get better, why not go to an expert who has spent his whole life learning about your condition and helping people just like you? That person will be able to diagnose you, treat you, and tell you where every support group in town meets. IMO visiting a doctor or therapist about your condition would be a very positive step for you to take. They would be able to point you in the right direction and give you guidance on how to fight this thing.   I don't know your situation so I can't comment on it. All I can comment on is my experience as a guy who is very close to a few people who have suffered from depression. In every case we were aware that something wasn't right with the person who was depressed even though they thought they were hiding it. They didn't seem happy, they weren't progressing in life, etc. In every single case, all we wanted was for them to be able to get the help they needed so they could be healthy and happy. I have to assume your friends and family feel the exact same way about you.   Best of luck to you in trying to get better, and feel free to send me a message if you need someone to talk to."
Acadiana,2sooan,GEAUXUL,2,Sat Jan 17 16:27:17 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. I never thought of it that way.
Acadiana,2sooan,Jamesers,2,Mon Jan 19 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I personally shook it off by reaching out, finding new and positive people (not religion), and seeking a social outlet. I realized I was flirting with suicide way too often. Silly or not, I realized the the club ad bar scenes were only making it worse, I'd leave feeling alone and worse about myself, even if I got hit on.   If you want to see what it's like to be in a fun and inclusive group and have a few laughs, come to my Cards Against games. I can make sure you're treated gently until you sort of 'click' in with this fantastic group of people, most of whom are now socializing randomly during the week now. I've made several good friends there, and I'm certain you can too, fluidly and easily, if you feel like you may be ready for it. (Also it's free, unlike therapy). The group is hugely diverse, a few scientists (even a third rate one like me), veterans (also a third rate one like me), LBGTA players, students, UL faculty, interracial couples, foul bachelors and bachelorettes, etc. To be honest, it's the most open-minded group I've ever seen in Lafayette. Possibly because few of us are FROM here..."
Acadiana,2sooan,TheAlmightyFur,5,Tue Jan 20 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"Are you a student at UL? If so, definitely visit the counseling center on campus.   http://counselingandtesting.louisiana.edu/content/counseling/faqs  Even if you're not a student, you can call the 24 hour counselor. They will most definitely direct you to any groups or organizations that can help you.   Seeking help is a major accomplishment, don't give up!"
Acadiana,2sooan,TheAlmightyFur,7,Sat Jan 17 05:38:23 2015 UTC,"I've always been of the mindset that if I went to therapy it would make me think about it or feel sorry for myself and would make things worse   You're going to have to think about what you're feeling to get to the root issue, but a good therapist will help guide you through the process. The bad ones will coax things out of you and not give you the skills to understand why you're feeling the way you feel or how to cope. I've had a few of these in the past.  I've been seeing a therapist for a year who's done great work with me, I can give you his name if you'd like-- shoot me a PM."
Acadiana,2sooan,rd8t,3,Sat Jan 17 09:04:24 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  I can't afford a therapist. That's one of the reasons why I'm looking for a group.
Acadiana,2sooan,ladyfoghladha,5,Mon Jan 19 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"Some places do a sliding scale payment option based on what you can afford.   In all honesty, I was just calling the guy that I'm with as kind of a checkup, and when he told me his price, I balked at it. He eventually offered me a much lower rate and we went from there.   Just recently went from a biweekly visit to a single visit a month.  Another option if you want to try medication is one of the community health centers around. They'll also be on a sliding scale payment system."
Acadiana,2sooan,polyrankin1122,4,Mon Jan 19 02:28:09 2015 UTC,"Kudos to you for the willingness to seek out any form of assistance.  I've grown to despise the fact that depression and any other form of mental ailment is treated with ""get over it"" or ""cheer up"" (like it's as simple as that).   This usually comes from 400 lb mouth breathers riding scooters who think that anything with the mind is just made up, but it's family history that their blood pressure is in quadruple digits and their blood sugar is at a level that they bleed syrup.  That or they tell you to get right with the Lord (If you are religious, and it helps you, awesome, because you found what works.  But what works for one doens't necessarily work for all).  Sorry for the Rant...  My point is, I think it's a positive step seeking out assistance, as it means you are also saying to hell with whatever stigma is attached to it. Good Work.  I'd also say maybe call around any place that does offer therapy and ask if there are programs or options for someone in your situation.  Can't hurt to ask, and you may find something that will suit your needs."

She doesn't specify what type of butter, but I find the type of butter you use when baking is super important.  I use Salted Land o' Lakes. I ended up using all 6 cups of AP flour. For the dough, I added about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice, and about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also added an eyeballed amount of cinnamon (not too much!!) in with the nutmeg.   For the filling, I added some lemon juice here as well. About another teaspoon.   For the icing, I added 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice. I also added a tad bit more water, some sweetened condensed milk, and a little extra vanilla. Basically, I wanted it to be runny, but not too runny so that I could drizzle it! (if it doesn't taste quite as delicious as you want it to, don't worry,  it'll taste awesome on the cake!!!)  sorry for the wall of text!  Important edit: keep an eye and nose on this baby while it's baking!  Mine finished in significantly less time than recommended.  It's done when you knock on it and it sounds hollow."

Acadiana,2rw4m1,50000lightyears,6,Sat Jan 10 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"Mon cousin!  I identify a good bit with my Cajun heritage, kinda a nerd about it. Do not speak French, but I know enough to know when I'm in trouble. I moderate a subreddit you may dig r/CajunHistory Acadian history is in there too. I also volunteer at a Cajun living history museum ""Vermillionville"" where I portray a Coureur de bois. The guys that worked with the Voyageurs. I demonstrate Trapping and bushcraft mostly. If you're in the Acadian area again hit me up.   Edit: if you have any questions about Cajun culture please feel free to ask. If I don't know I'll ask around."
Acadiana,2rw4m1,downtimebananas,3,Sat Jan 10 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"Salut cousin!  That's great! I'll definitely subscribe to your sub and will probably have some questions for you here and there. And when I visit again I'd be glad to get in touch.  Let me tell you, you don't need to ever explain to a Qu√©b√©cois what a coureur des bois is. :P They pretty much made for 75% of our history classes up here.  Vermillionville also sounds really cool. I visited the traditional Acadian village in Nova Scotia and I was really blown away by the dedication. Their staff was almost living on site full time : they used century old ovens and kitchenware to cook, grew their own vegetables in a garden for their recipes. They were actually building wooden boats by hand, fishing and drying fish by the ocean. It was pretty amazing.  Merci! √Ä la prochaine."

Maybe I could PM you or make a post on /r/CajunHistory? I want to learn more about my family but don't have much to go on or connections as I wasn't raised with them.

Acadiana,2rw4m1,bruce656,6,Fri Apr 24 07:16:59 2015 UTC,"Je suis 50% Chiasson (m√®re) et 50%...un nom tr√®s anglais(P√®re),mais je pense que je suis Cadien parce que depuis je suis n√©e ma m√®re nous a expos√© √† la culture cajun parce que ce est ce qu'elle savait.    But while I have accounts of my ancestors being expelled, can cook, speak french, and dance a little, I still question the validity of my participation in this particular culture. The question is always raised ""what makes a true cajun?"" because being a Cajun back in the 1700 and 1800 hundreds meant something different than it does today. Not bad, but different. Though sometimes I feel like I can't call myself a true Cajun because I do so many things that aren't congruent with a Cajun lifestyle, I am a Cajun in the way I honor the traditions that are and that have been passed down to me. Today we celebrate the past and I think it's one of the greatest revitalization movements we'll ever see and the only one I'll ever get to be a part of."
Acadiana,2rw4m1,Hormisdas,4,Fri Apr 24 08:53:10 2015 UTC,"I had an old lady laugh at me and blow me off when I told her I didn't know when squirrel season was. ""Oh, you're no Cajun, then."" I honestly don't recall ever being so genuinely offended.   But I guess it does highlight one notion, that being Cajun is about prescribing to a certain way of life. Our area is very inclusive of outsiders, and I would say my Quebe√ßois brother-in-law is now more Cajun than many people who were born and raised here, because he has adopted so many of our traits and customs."
Acadiana,2rw4m1,Hormisdas,3,Fri Jan 9 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel. I pay homage to my grandparents. I am 50% Cajun (New Iberia) they were the last to speak 100% Cajun French dialect. I only know a little plus normal French. I carry on the traditions from cooking, dancing and speaking French while sharing the culture with my fellow Cajuns. So whether we think its different then it was..we're still Cajuns."
Acadiana,2rw4m1,uzername_ic,3,Sat Jan 10 03:09:56 2015 UTC,"Merci!   That makes a lot of sense. It seems like a tricky part of the Cajun identity is that the cultural group is so small and isolated (within the mainstream American culture) that sticking to traditions was seen as the only hope for cultural survival. So I can see how it could feel incongruous to be a ""modern Cajun"".  By contrast, the French from France would never think that living today like it's the 1800's would make someone a ""true French"", since their society was able to evolve and modernize on its own terms.   I'm curious : how do you feel this revitalization you're talking about? I've seen glimpses of this in some documentaries here and there, but it's all very abstract to me."
Acadiana,2rw4m1,Bun_Kenobi,3,Sat Jan 10 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. One could essentially say ""what makes a true anything?"" so you have to decide at some point and that's why self identity is so important. So, hell yeah, I'm a Cajun no doubts about it.  I talk about the revitalization like it's a recent thing but it really started in the late 60's early 70's with the creation of CODOFIL. The whole reason why my grandfather and I were able to communicate in French is because of this organization. There is a slight dip in the number of francophones between the elders who spoke french but were discouraged from doing so as it was banned when they were in school,to the young people now who are seemingly flocking to embrace their cultural heritage. The generation in the middle,like my parents, were the ones who probably missed out on the most of reconnecting with the french dialect.  But the numbers are steadily climbing and more and more children are taking French immersion.Every year it seems like there are more and more people at the cajun and creole festivals, more restaurants, and more reasons to celebrate being cajun. It just goes to show how easy it is to find a cultural identity from language and no matter what aspect of a culture any one institution tries to marginalize, oppress, and assimilate, you cannot take a away that connection between members of that culture and they will find a way to fight back."
Acadiana,2rw4m1,Hormisdas,3,Sat Jan 10 01:48:35 2015 UTC,"I'm very glad to read all that. Sounds promising. I knew a little bit about CODOFIL before, but it's nice to hear from someone who directly benefited from it. I remember that there was some dissent between those who wanted CODOFIL to teach ""proper, international French"", and those who wanted it to teach local Cajun French. I think they ended up teaching Cajun French, right? I find it really interesting because in Qu√©bec, we all grew up learning ""proper, international French"" in school, but it wasn't a problem for us because the local, colorful, Qu√©bec-specific French was alive and well in our homes and on the streets. We just grew up with that very clear divide in our minds between ""written French"" and ""spoken French"" (le fran√ßais √©crit et le fran√ßais parl√©).  It must have been so special for your grandfather to be able to speak to his grandchidren in French. I can't imagine how bad I would feel if I had kids and they grew up without learning my language. Did he share some old memories with you? Did it really feel like a ""reconnection""?"

Acadiana,2qsgmt,waltc97,6,Tue Dec 30 05:57:17 2014 UTC,"La attorney/notary here.  You can't sign for your father on a will.  He has to sign it himself.  Since he's in SC, the will has to meet the formal requirements of SC, not La.    I'd say you need to talk to an attorney.  And $20 is not expensive for a notary fee these days.  It is very difficult to become a notary in La.  The passage rate on the exam is around 2%. Notaries are professionals and deserve to be compensated as such. And as far as ""unscrupulous"" notaries, I can tell you it's the clients, not the notaries, that constantly ask us to bend or break the rules."
Acadiana,2qsgmt,stadiumrat,2,Tue Dec 30 16:18:59 2014 UTC,"I think he may have meant that he needs to sign his father's will, not sign AS his father. Though I think he would actually have to be in the presence of his father to act as witness."
Acadiana,2qsgmt,palegothic,1 point,Tue Dec 30 20:37:50 2014 UTC,"i am signing as trustee, but by SC law. trustee still needs sig notarized plus a second witness."
Acadiana,2qsgmt,stadiumrat,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:04:31 2014 UTC,Not sure what you mean by trustee.  Does the will create a testamentary trust or is there an existing inter vivos trust or is this a specialized term under SC law?
Acadiana,2qsgmt,stadiumrat,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:07:00 2014 UTC,"Also, you REALLY need to talk to a La lawyer who specializes in wills and successions.  If it is executed in La, it needs to meet La formal requirements or it may not be valid.  There is no situation that I know of where one, and only one, witness is used, with or without a notary, under La law.  In La, it is 2 or none (not including the notary).  If you were asking me to notarize this, to be safe, I would draw a second line for a second witness to sign."
Acadiana,2qsgmt,gizibee,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:13:42 2014 UTC,Maybe trustee is like testamentary executor there ?

Acadiana,2qsgmt,stadiumrat,2,Tue Dec 30 20:00:28 2014 UTC,"The bank thing isn't exactly true. Yes, some banks have a notary in their employ. However, if you aren't a customer they won't do it (even for a fee). And I know for a fact that Chase doesn't notarize at all as the company feels the notary laws in LA are too lax."
Acadiana,2qsgmt,palegothic,1 point,Tue Dec 30 20:34:33 2014 UTC,"Louisiana notary laws are more strict than other states.

Acadiana,2qsgmt,squeamish,1 point,Tue Dec 30 21:10:23 2014 UTC,"That, too, would be illegal.  Edit:  At least it would be illegal for that notary to notarize anything involving the bank."

Acadiana,2qsgmt,squeamish,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:04:09 2014 UTC,"It's actually illegal for a bank in La to permanently employ a notary.  The issue is that a notary PUBLIC is supposed to represent the best interests of the public not the bank.  There would be too much pressure if the bank, your employer, wanted you to bend the rules."
Acadiana,2qsgmt,stadiumrat,1 point,Tue Dec 30 21:02:10 2014 UTC,"It definitely isn't, almost everything I've ever had notarized was by a bank employee. It may be illegal for a notary who is a bank employee to notarize something for his employer, but I have never had a problem (or been charged) to have someone at my bank (Premier became Bank One became Chase and also Business First) notarize something for me personally.  Hell, here is a bank issuing a press release about one of their employees passing a notary exam."

Alligators are about 2 million so, yeah. I have always wanted to try fresh fried alligator. I spoke with a Russian professor that studies alligators and he gave me good advice as to how to cull from the pod w/o devastating their habitat or hierarchy, pretty cool."
Acadiana,2qldyp,Owlettt,2,Sun Dec 28 08:01:41 2014 UTC,"I spoke with a Russian professor that studies alligators and he gave me good advice as to how to cull from the pod w/o devastating their habitat or hierarchy, pretty cool.   Your professor has no clue what he is talking about. Alligators are only in ""pods"" for the first few years of their life. After that, they are solitary with no real ""hierarchy."" And I have no clue what he may mean by saying that unless they are ""culled from the pod"" it will ""devastate their habitat.""  Source: I grew up in swamps hunting alligators."
Acadiana,2qldyp,Owlettt,1 point,Sun Dec 28 18:46:56 2014 UTC,He said that I should take a midsize to younger one so as the really big older ones are good for the habitat.  Do you have an airboat?
Acadiana,2qldyp,Sudestbrewer,1 point,Mon Dec 29 15:00:47 2014 UTC,"Not gonna lie about airboats--I hate riding in those things. This is my boat. I have pulled a seven foot alligator right over the gunnel in the past year. If you ever plan a trip down here, do it in the late summer, early Fall. That is when the season is. If you read up on the Lousiana Wildlife and Fisheries page I linked below, it'll tell you everything you need to know about hunting them down here.  Now then, I just gotta comment further on your friend's ""really good for the habitat"" comment. I still have no clue what that even means. The oldest alligators that you are really going to find in  Louisiana are only about fifty years old at the most. That's because they were almost hunted into extinction and were outlawed as a game species in 1962: Louisiana Wildlife page. In that time, the alligator has rebounded so strongly that it is a nuisance once again to people who spend much time on the water.   So then,  A. there really aren't any ancient gators around.  B. there are so many alligators in general that the relative size of the alligator does not impact at all its role in the ecosystem.   For instance, Lake Martin, famous for its mature alligator population, is declining as a habitat for basically all other species. You can see how fish populations have plummeted there (see page 9 graph for clearest picture), and despite the fact that it is a protected bird sanctuary,  bird populations are plummeting as well (see this overview )  Really, its all about soil deposition and erosion, and oxygen levels in the water. THAT'S our habitat problem in Louisiana."
Acadiana,2qldyp,Owlettt,1 point,Mon Dec 29 16:09:53 2014 UTC,"He was a Russian professor that didn't like me wanting to kill one so.... I am taking his word on that, kinda. He found me here. He said I should go kill ISIS if I wanted to kill an apex predator and I told him I already did that for three years in the Infantry so he started in on, 'OK, well, if you are going to kill one kill this size...' yadda yadda. Again, just going by his word and your info he sounds like he wasn't a very good professor.   I do appreciate the unbiased opinion and I DO want to make plans to take one. Other than reading the info you linked to, (which it sounds like I have plenty of time to do) what in your opinion is both the best way to get started and the smartest way to go about it, equipment, environment, what to expect, difficulties, and general game plan. All I know is what I have seen on Swamp People.   I was thinking at first about taking a bear but they are somewhat limited in number and you can hunt for many miles over a lot of terrain and never even run across one short of going to Alaska. Big cats are out of the question and moose are like dumb giant deer, not very apex predator-ish."
Acadiana,2qldyp,Sudestbrewer,-2,Mon Dec 29 21:44:03 2014 UTC,And we should take your word over a herpetologist because you grew up in the swamps right?

Acadiana,2qldyp,Sudestbrewer,-1,Mon Dec 29 14:34:41 2014 UTC,"It's not worth the effort convincing you as you'll likely never understand the amount of effort that goes into being a specialist, but I can assure you that professor is but a handful of individuals in the world who deal with large reptiles.

Acadiana,2qldyp,Owlettt,2,Tue Dec 30 12:28:25 2014 UTC,"Cool!  PS--does ths mean that the biologists I go into the field with are wrong? Or maybe the wildlife and fisheries page I linked above? I mean, after-all, all knowledge works in a vacuum and there is absolutely no way to learn anything outside of a university class. Certainly you can't learn about something by actually fucking i teracting with it! No! you should stay in a classroom half way around the world, or--better yet--get all your info from anonymous online sources. There is no such thing as field work, now is there? why, I bet you show up to a sight and immediately tell the simpering plebs to GTFO, because they are fuckwits who know nothing about where they live! After-all, you study fucking geology, the queen of the sciences, so you should know, right champ? Amirite? And it is so very apparent that you have enough info to know what in the fuck you are talking about. I mean, after all, geologists who work with Russians have perfect understandings of places they've never been and of species they have never actually talked to a real, breathing biologist about nor apparently ever seen. They just take a priori (a phrase from my academic specialty) whatever they read in an on-line forum from anonymous posters, deciding that to read evidence is silly, because it is! Science doesn't rely on that! It relies in truth claims made second hand and unsourced over the Internet! Such academic rigor, Mr. specialist! But that's cool. Look out Internet, geologist coming through!"

Sorry, but I'm not convinced, please don't have an aneurysm. If someone is an expert, why should we not believe them over said laymen who grew up in the swamps? Your retort was cute, gave a bit of insight which might have lead to a different response on my part but it oozes with personality disorders which left untreated will never change the fact that you're an asshole. I could care less about my background in geology, nor your take on my post history unrelated to the discussion. What a character you are."

I am substitute Audit ( I work audit when the full time audit person has days off) plus I work evening shifts and morning every once in a while. It's a decent job. Low stress. But I don't know about other hotels, but my bosses have very high expectations. Sure, we're allowed to watch movies, browse the interwebs, and do homework during downtime. But when it comes to customer service you better buck up or get out. But, it sounds like you have a good grip on customer service after being a server.  Right now things are really slow. They always are around the holidays. However, after the first of the year we will be super busy and there will be very little downtime. Don't expect to be able to study or just chill every shift.

At this time of year USPS has loads of ""casual"" employees who are brought on for the holiday season. Aka loads of people who know their position is temporary and maybe don't give 100%. I've also noticed issues in shipping when one carrier transfers to USPS, but I haven't had any issues with amazon shipped exclusively with USPS.   I know a carrier personally, and some of them are really good people who give a shit. It's upsetting that you're having these issues :(  Keep December decent."

Acadiana,2pwh66,Th3Krah,2,Sun Dec 21 00:32:30 2014 UTC,"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol:       Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for electronic mail (e-mail) transmission. First defined by RFC 821 in 1982, it was last updated in 2008 with the Extended SMTP additions by RFC 5321 - which is the protocol in widespread use today.  SMTP by default uses TCP port 25. The protocol for mail submission is the same, but uses port 587. SMTP connections secured by SSL, known as SMTPS, default to port 465 (nonstandard, but sometimes used for legacy reasons).  Although electronic mail servers and other mail transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages, user-level client mail applications typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying. For receiving messages, client applications usually use either POP3 or IMAP.  Although proprietary systems (such as Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes/Domino) and webmail systems (such as Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail) use their own non-standard protocols to access mail box accounts on their own mail servers, all use SMTP when sending or receiving email from outside their own systems.

If you're using it wirelessly, when you ping it, are you sure you aren't just pinging the router?  Likewise, if you are installing it for wireless print jobs, make sure you are installing the wireless drivers and that it is properly connected to the router, and port-forwarded if it needs to be(I don't remember if that's necessary, it's been ages since I've installed a wireless driver on a digital printer).  Best of luck.  If you have any other questions, I or /u/rd8t can answer questions if /u/theRobisaur doesn't get back to you.

Acadiana,2ph0uo,Chamrox,10,Wed Dec 17 15:59:16 2014 UTC,"Here's the key to christmas shopping in Lafayette: Get an Amazon Prime membership and buy all your gifts online.  If that's not an option: Get all of your shopping done before 11:00am or after 6:30pm.  If that's not an option: Say the Serenity prayer, do mindful meditation, whatever. Accept people being angry and breaking traffic laws as something beyond your control. In the immortal words of Sublime ""Fuck it, fight it, it's all the same."""
Acadiana,2ph0uo,kunstlinger,2,Tue Dec 16 16:08:55 2014 UTC,"95% of our shopping is via Amazon Prime.  However, due to a last minute change, we had a couple of items that we could not guarantee would be delivered on time.  So that is the basis for that.  As far as accepting people being angry, no f*** that.  This isn't anger by people being wrong, it's people being entitled dipshits who have this massive superiority complex because they don't work in retail or the service industry (actually, being from a really small town, some do/have and either think they are still far above others, or have forgotten where they came from).  Some things I can justify being angry at, Like nearly getting hit head on by Jabba the June.  But bitching out a waitress because she is trying to serve all her customers and you are not given the priority you deserve, or at the store clerk who has a dozen customers pulling them in multiple directions and not ignoring all of them for you is not justifiable.  Also includes bitching out someone in the store because they sold out of an item.     These are all first world complaints, and nobody is going to die if your family member doesn't get the exact gift they asked for"
Acadiana,2ph0uo,gizibee,0,Tue Dec 16 16:18:38 2014 UTC,"Dude, it's ""the public"" you're angry at. You're angry because you think your anger will get people to change their behavior. No matter what you do, you can't change the behavior of ""the public"". There will always be a bigger idiot for you to get mad at. Yeah, if someone is berating a retail employee, say your peace calmly and move on. Better yet, alert a manager and let them deal with it. If you make the worlds problems your problem then you're going to spend all your time getting angry and die young from stress.  As far as your June incident - yeah, that would have pissed me off too. I probably would have done the same thing you did. Some people are just out there spoiling for a fight, and I would have felt like I got down to her level by engaging her in a verbal altercation. IMO, ignore her. Sure she drives off thinking she won, but that's a little brain thought. Let her have her little thoughts and her insignificant victories."
Acadiana,2ph0uo,gizibee,4,Wed Dec 17 14:42:03 2014 UTC,"Actually, my anger was directed at the near damage to a perfectly good and nearly paid vehicle.  And I know Lafayette is not the only place this occurs.  But there is something about the holidays that turns adults into mindless dipshits who think it's perfectly acceptable to injure someone just to get their hands on whatever hot item that advertising has convinced if they don't have they should just kill themselves.  As far as managers in retail, I'm torn.  I worked in retail over a decade ago, and I can probably point out 1 out of a dozen managers who would actually go to bat for the employees.  The rest just sucked the customers ass because gawd forbid that you grow a pair and put a dipshit in their place."

This sub is a community within a community. Sometimes we ask for help, help each other out, meet up and do things together, share stories, and often times we just vent about things. Yeah, it's fruitless to attack ""the public"" because collectively, we are the publlc, we are Lafayette. Sometimes it's just nice to vent collectively about what's going on in the city for the sake of knowing that we're not alone. In fact, what I got out of it was, ""Hey, it's busy out there. Let's all be cool to each other."""

I spent all weekend Christmas shopping and navigating Lafayette. It was stupid busy. I feel like all of trash crawls out from the smelliest swamps and drives their jacked up Ford F-750s through our streets like retarded mongoloids and it pisses me off to no end. I'll keep this in mind and try to remain patient and pleasant, I have been lately.  Don't forget to remind yourselves that Lafayette is really cool and there are good people here. There are nice holiday things being done, charity events going on, etc. Be cool to each other. Oh, and if you see someone acting like an asshat and treating retail staff, cashiers, waitstaff, etc, like shit, CALL THEM OUT. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a lady being a bitch to a cashier and I ask her if that's necessary. No one wants to get in trouble at work for setting someone in their place, but I will proudly tell Mama June where she can go for you."

Acadiana,2ph0uo,cajunbander,5,Tue Dec 16 16:22:56 2014 UTC,"ah yes, the yearly scourge.  Not that Lafayette is much better in non-holiday months either near the mall area, but yes, this time of year becomes absurd.  There are no shortage of idiot drivers who don't think.  They will block traffic in inane attempts to get past a red light that is backed up, causing further back ups from lanes that can't go because some asshole is in the middle of the intersection with a thousand yard stare because they dare not look anyone in the eye.  With Robley getting construction I've had to get out the car to yell at people because they don't understand what a DOUBLE YELLOW LINE MEANS (hint: it doesn't mean the otherside is a TURNING LANE).  I love Lafayette drivers.  They are so stupid sometimes that when they screw up they try to blame YOU.  Too many people, too few roads."

While the regular city drivers understand the (already complicated) roads and traffic patterns, the onslaught of rural, unfamiliar drivers who are coming into the city make it worse for everyone because they don't understand how to navigate the city. I'd rather drive New Orleans or Baton Rouge 100% of the time, because they're large cities filled with people who understand that driving in a city is different than driving in a pasture."
Acadiana,2ph0uo,todayilearned83,2,Tue Dec 16 17:58:14 2014 UTC,"100% This. Everyone from all of these small towns within a 50 mile radius are all heading to the corner of Ambassador and Johnson to get their Christmas shopping done. It's extremely stressful for them to navigate the traffic, so they panic and do weird things. They seriously don't understand ""traffic"" and honestly, our infrastructure doesn't exactly help them much.  They're used to being able to hop in their car and go grocery shopping and be back in 15 minutes. The concept of sitting at the same light for 15 minutes is foreign to them."

Acadiana,2p7qrc,fieryfish42,2,Sun Dec 14 15:29:06 2014 UTC,There's a house on Beverly drive by Lafayette general that has dancing lights! :)

I'm sure there are some neighborhoods down West Bayou Parkway that would be illuminated, but I can't be certain.   Additionally, the zoo has lights. I went last night. The only catch is that it is really dark as the Christmas lights are the only ones lit."
Acadiana,2p7qrc,smileslime,1 point,Sun Dec 14 00:23:51 2014 UTC,"Thanks! That's the neighborhood we ended up at, they had a couple nice houses.

I would think he must have been driving a pretty decent speed to hit and kill someone but maybe she stumbled into his vehicle and fell under the tires, so who knows. A shame for both families."
Acadiana,2p3cul,dead_hero,3,Fri Dec 12 20:28:24 2014 UTC,"he didnt even have to be going fast. if you get hit and run over even at a crawl, the amount of weight probably crushed her or even just broken a bone that could have punctured something or ruptured an organ. It doesnt take much to actually kill someone.   I still think he shouldnt be charged with manslaughter....."
Acadiana,2p3cul,Cajuncowboy08,11,Mon Dec 15 17:08:40 2014 UTC,he blew a .082? so only .002 over the legal limit?   did they check her tox levels? this is actually pretty ridiculous that he is facing charges for something that could have been her fault.....
Acadiana,2p3cul,Cajuncowboy08,2,Fri Dec 12 20:02:41 2014 UTC,And what is the margin of error? Would it have been prudent for the cop to retest 1 or 2 more times to make sure he was really over the limit?
Acadiana,2p3cul,General_Hide,3,Fri Dec 12 22:53:42 2014 UTC,"Margin of error works both ways. At the end of the day, if you're that close to being legally under the influence, you should not be driving. I'm also sure a blood test was taken (at least I would hope)."
Acadiana,2p3cul,TotesMcGotes13,-2,Sat Dec 13 02:58:50 2014 UTC,This.  Was there a blood test?  I get the feeling that this may be a witch hunt.

Acadiana,2p3cul,TotesMcGotes13,4,Sat Dec 13 03:01:38 2014 UTC,"He blew over the legal limit while operating a motor vehicle. So what that it was only .002 over. Hell, he could've gotten a dui for just sitting behind the wheel with the engine running."

Takes an accident on both their parts but how do you not watch out for moving vehicles in a parking lot. Specially ay cowboys  I'm Gunna side with him on this and I don't think he should be charged with manslaughter. Not saying he shouldn't get a dui. Just sayin he shouldn't have his life ruined cuz of some drunk chick can't hold her self up or be responsible.

Acadiana,2p3cul,ohhyouknow,3,Fri Dec 12 18:52:32 2014 UTC,... accidentally did it from kindergarten to graduation...    It's good that he's finally caught after so many years of accidental killing.
Acadiana,2p3cul,StephenFish,2,Sat Dec 13 16:24:49 2014 UTC,Well I didn't wanna imply that he purposely ran over her lol.
Acadiana,2p3k6a,boog23,2,Fri Dec 12 18:13:56 2014 UTC,"The YouTube comment says, ""We wanted to be unique."", so why then would you parody something that's been parodied so many times before?"
Acadiana,2oz8z0,crocajun1003,4,Thu Dec 11 15:29:31 2014 UTC,Would it matter? We had video documentation of the Eric Garner situation. It won't make a difference.
Acadiana,2oz8z0,stillcasey,8,Thu Dec 11 18:46:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that was one case. And there are other documented crimes by police that go unpunished as well. But that doesn't mean there aren't very many cases that will receive proper justice as a result of cameras. Just because something doesn't have a 100% success rate doesn't mean it shouldn't be implemented."
Acadiana,2oz8z0,stillcasey,3,Fri Dec 12 00:37:26 2014 UTC,That's a fair point. It would probably prove useful in cases where the right thing is done.
Acadiana,2oz8z0,rd8t,4,Fri Dec 12 01:28:56 2014 UTC,"Meanwhile, Illinois has made it a crime to film police.  Wonder what they would have to hide"
Acadiana,2oz8z0,latenitekid,2,Thu Dec 11 19:05:55 2014 UTC,"That's not entirely correct. What you said is unconstitutional.  The bill hasn't passed yet, anyway. And if it does, it will be struck down by the Supreme Court."
Acadiana,2oz8z0,rd8t,3,Thu Dec 11 19:53:08 2014 UTC,What I meant was they are trying to pass it.   But it's not out of the realm of rational thinking to know that even unconstitutional laws end up passing.
Acadiana,2oz8z0,fictitiousantelope,6,Thu Dec 11 20:03:20 2014 UTC,"And by 'exploring', they mean finding ways to circumnavigate them, so as to continue the tradition of abuse, corruption, and nepotism that makes them such jolly fucking people. I've seen some decent cops in Laffy, and they ALL quit. They violent, abusive fuckers...the ones who like breaking the wrists of little raver girls or ticketing bikers into poverty for being tall and actually getting into the military...these ones stay aboard forever. Let's just admit that here, like anywhere, it's better to have a gun in the hand than a cop on the phone. No cop ever in my life improved anything by showing up. The closest I've gotten is 'we'll call you if we hear anything'. Fuckers don't even investigate anything that happens to anyone who isn't rich. Must be nice for whoever is selling anabolic steroids in this town...that's one drug dealer who is immune from prosecution."
Acadiana,2oz8z0,heiney_luvr,2,Fri Dec 12 07:44:45 2014 UTC,"I don't think this is a fair depiction of the Lafayette police force. As many have said elsewhere in this thread, I think we have our bad apples, but for the most part the Lafayette police is just good people trying to do their jobs. The issue being hotly debated nationally at the moment is that the bad apples are too protected.   I'm no police apologist, but I think we often become victims of the moment and overdramatize our own situations. We need to not lose sight of the issue."
Acadiana,2oz8z0,fictitiousantelope,3,Fri Dec 12 17:42:22 2014 UTC,"I know it can be a brutal job. I brought a bunch of free pizzas by the station the night of that bomb scare in Girard Park, because I KNEW it was gonna be an endless cross-agency paperwork nightmare. Noone wants to be on the phone with the assclowns at Homeland Security for two hours, trust me.   But I also know business owners who have been driven out of business by targeted checkpoints, people who have been hospitalized and abused, and a close friend who quite LPSO in disgust from the corruption.  Police in general are the new praetorian guard. Unanswerable to the people, above the law, rewarded for killing. Between them, the NSA, and the growth of for-profit prisons, we're living in a police state. As a former Marine, I signed an oath to uphold the constitution, and more and more, that looks like an ugly conflict brewing. All I want is to just be a decent scientist, but more and more, I see conflict brewing and no way to address it effectively.   Yes, we probably are due for a revolution, but the ugly fact is that most police are more than willing to use military hardware to slaughter civilians who have a right to be angry.  Sorry for the novel. It's a frustrating situation."
Acadiana,2oz8z0,Ishouldnt_be_on_here,2,Fri Dec 12 19:01:52 2014 UTC,"I don't live in Lafayette, but one time I went and thought that the police I met were some of the friendliest I've ever encountered."
Acadiana,2oz8z0,CrazytownUSA00,5,Fri Dec 12 02:04:23 2014 UTC,"You are right to think that. In general they are. But when there is an issue, the press refuses to report in a fair manner. You will never get a full or discriminating report from the local TV media on the abuses that do happen. They read out prescripted press releases from the police departments. The lack of investigative reporting here is quite awful. I compare this to Baton Rouge's TV media, which in general, are pit bulls to the government compared to here."

Acadiana,2oxpoz,Sg1324,7,Thu Dec 11 03:24:25 2014 UTC,"To be completely honest, that's not gonna happen around here. Thai, Viet, and Japanese are done very well in Acadiana, but you won't find good, traditional Cantonese here. It's all Americanized takeaway.   There's store on Johnston St named Asian Market, near Jason's Deli and Harbor Freight, and they sell tons of good Asian foods. They have really good prices on very big bags of frozen gyoza (Japanese pot stickers) and shumai (dim sum). They also have bottles of gyoza sauce and other stuff for dipping. Sure you won't get the big table and basket experience like in Hong Kong or China, but it's pretty good and not expensive. A steamer basket or carefully cooking it with a rice cooker will do the trick."
Acadiana,2oxpoz,446172656E,2,Thu Dec 11 13:49:48 2014 UTC,That sounds perfect. I know the place . Thanks.

Acadiana,2oxpoz,gizibee,2,Thu Dec 11 15:52:19 2014 UTC,Lotus Garden!  For the Mongolian Grill alone.  Edit:   Tokyo Like Hibachi brunch on Saturday and Sunday.

Acadiana,2oxpoz,bruce656,2,Thu Dec 11 16:43:23 2014 UTC,Lotus Garden does.  The Mongolian grill is just the lagniappe.

Acadiana,2oxpoz,bruce656,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:28:35 2014 UTC,"I find China one to be pretty lackluster, tbh. Is is because they use less MSG? I find I don't get the Chinese-food-thirsties there like I do at other places."

Acadiana,2otfv8,squeamish,11,Wed Dec 10 01:53:21 2014 UTC,"There's a lot more to this story that people don't know about.   Edit: Two bars in Lafayette intended to open up as Barcode, different owners, different locations. We'll call the downtown one Barcode A and the other, never opened one Barcode B. The Barcode A got in the game first but Barcode B had created a Facebook page first. People liked that page thinking it was the one downtown, while that owner of Barcode B decided to not open another bar named Barcode.   Meanwhile, people kept asking about the one downtown not knowing about the plan for a separate owner to open up Barcode B. Someone got a hold of the Barcode B's Facebook page and made that post about not being a gay bar. It was not necessarily sabotage, but maybe someone who didn't know better. People thought that was the page for Barcode A and everybody grabbed their pitchforks.   The owners of Barcode A we're trying to let people know that that wasn't them and that while they weren't necessarily a gay bar, they would welcome anyone. By that time it was too late. The outrage, along with a possible lawsuit from the original Barcode in Virginia over the logo, shut Barcode A down."

Acadiana,2otfv8,cajunbander,9,Wed Dec 10 14:18:45 2014 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better. Also, while it was unfolding someone noticed that the Barcode FB page that was under scrutiny had the physical address listed on the page as 5503 Johnston Street. What is this address? It's the address for Brewski's. Brewski's is Barcode A. FYI, the owner of Brewski's also owns Fame. They both wanted this name... but the downtown location allegedly registered it with the state first. The address was then changed to the downtown location address once people on FB began to catch on.   The original Barcode in VA caught wind of this and I think that the Barcode B saboteur played upon this. By the time that Barcode A caught wind of this, they created a Facebook page, addressed it (decently, but not good enough damage control), and began utilizing their page immediately to talk about the establishment. They were too late. The people crying sabotage (I mentioned it in the initial post along with another person if you look back in this sub) were ignored and people ran forward with their pitchforks. By then the Ind had already published an article about it. It was a good article... but I feel like this needs to be looked into and addressed. If Lafayette indeed shut down a business before it even got it's doors open, and it was the product of sabotage, shame on the saboteur and shame on us. I think this needs to be revisited.  Edit: Just noticed this is an Ind article. Got too caught up in my own opinion to see the link in my Reditr browser."
Acadiana,2otfv8,Zemedelphos,1 point,Wed Dec 10 14:45:30 2014 UTC,It's the address for Brewski's   Word on the street is that they're about to close.

Acadiana,2otfv8,bruce656,5,Wed Dec 10 14:31:58 2014 UTC,"if so, ""straight bar"" does not imply inclusiveness.   You're correct, but I believe someone who types out a sentence that reads ""It a straight bar that mostly hip hop,"" doesn't really have the reading comprehension to grasp how subtext works. I believe the author was not trying to EXCLUDE anyone, just that the person just didn't understand the potential shitstorm that was about to break.

Acadiana,2ok5e6,squeamish,2,Sun Dec 7 23:02:00 2014 UTC,Sorry.  Old guys at Reddit meetups just seems like an awkward thing.  Hope you guys had fun.
Acadiana,2ok5e6,jefuchs,1 point,Mon Dec 8 00:50:43 2014 UTC,"Not at all.  The awkward bit, I mean.  We did have a good time."

Acadiana,2ok5e6,Gonein69seconds,1 point,Mon Dec 8 16:30:13 2014 UTC,It's a thanks and a sarcastic retort in one.  Kinda  like those oreos. Amazing vanilla cookies then there's that chocolate shit inside.
Acadiana,2ok5e6,The_Voiceofgod,1 point,Sun Dec 7 17:39:07 2014 UTC,And I'm still surprised you showed up!
Acadiana,2ok5e6,Gonein69seconds,2,Sun Dec 7 21:42:42 2014 UTC,"Course,  food was involved."
Acadiana,2ok5e6,Yansommi,1 point,Mon Dec 8 00:20:27 2014 UTC,I was to broke to show up unfortunately. Maybe next time will fall better! Rent is a killer.

Raiding the cabinets!"
Acadiana,2ok5e6,The_Voiceofgod,1 point,Sun Dec 7 21:03:59 2014 UTC,How does one borrow food... Can I borrow some food from you then return it once I am finished with it?
Acadiana,2ok5e6,Yansommi,2,Mon Dec 8 19:15:10 2014 UTC,"Think of it like a borrowed ditto at the daycare. We agree to borrow, but after all the nasty shit you've done to it  I would rather not touch it afterwords."

Acadiana,2oilwm,dannytheguitarist,10,Sun Dec 7 02:52:56 2014 UTC,"While, I'm sure Mary's hands were not clean in the matter, I find one thing extremely disturbing about Cassidy.  I'm sure everyone in the area had their mailbox filled with propaganda attacking Landrieu pretty strongly.  You also notice in was all paid for by third party groups.  I count over half a dozen different names that came in.  Obviously, this is all from lobby groups who desperately wanted this man elected.  That should tell you he obviously will be receiving a lot ""contributions"" (ok, legalized political bribes) to push these groups agendas.    While ones hands obviously are not clean, the others are a lot dirtier, and I always get uncomfortable when lobby groups get the puppet they want on the main stage."
Acadiana,2oilwm,rd8t,5,Sun Dec 7 13:50:39 2014 UTC,Did Landrieu's camp or anyone else even spend any money campaigning for her?  I don't think I saw anything except one radio commercial in her favor.  Just non-stop Cassidy.
Acadiana,2oilwm,pele1410,4,Sun Dec 7 14:23:16 2014 UTC,"I think Democrats knew she was a lost cause from the get-go, particularly the DSCC, who announced they wouldn't do any ad-buys after the primaries."
Acadiana,2oilwm,itsrattlesnake,1 point,Sun Dec 7 18:11:48 2014 UTC,I don't even remember anything before the runoff.
Acadiana,2oilwm,pele1410,2,Mon Dec 8 00:56:54 2014 UTC,That is typical with non-incumbents.
Acadiana,2oilwm,squeamish,2,Tue Dec 9 14:15:41 2014 UTC,"It's kind of why I think the whole lobby thing and contributions should be labeled for what they really are, as legalized bribery"
Acadiana,2oilwm,rd8t,2,Tue Dec 9 14:32:50 2014 UTC,"I'm sure everyone in the area had their mailbox filled with propaganda   I live in Freetown, where everyone there is either too illiterate or too disenfranchised to vote, so my neighborhood always gets skipped over for political targeting. We do get a metric fuck-ton of coupons, though."
Acadiana,2oilwm,bruce656,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:50:12 2014 UTC,"I get both.  I think more people would vote if ""none of the above"" was a binding option"
Acadiana,2oilwm,rd8t,12,Thu Dec 11 16:55:24 2014 UTC,"Mary Landrieu is the force behind the bill (that became law) that mandates that every child adopted from a foreign country is naturalized automatically. When that bill became a law, more people became Americans that day than any day since. And if that doesn't warm your heart, fuck ..."
Acadiana,2oilwm,gizibee,8,Sun Dec 7 05:43:37 2014 UTC,Parent of 6 adopted kids from outside America - so yeah - I'm a fan with a warm heart about her. Sorry to see her lose.
Acadiana,2oilwm,cfjedimaster,7,Sun Dec 7 20:54:43 2014 UTC,"I didn't realize that was a thing. But I'm glad, I don't see why foreign adopted kids shouldn't be treated as any other American kid.  TIL."
Acadiana,2oilwm,Hormisdas,6,Sun Dec 7 07:50:25 2014 UTC,"While Cassidy is for an immigration bill to ""stop amnesty"" that rounds up illegal children, holds them at ""military facilities,"" vaccinates them, and deports them. Sounds like something we do to cattle."
Acadiana,2oilwm,squeamish,7,Sun Dec 7 16:18:17 2014 UTC,"One thing that really sat wrong with me during Cassidy's ads (besides the ""bring our values back"" bullshit) was his stance on immigration. Closing borders, granting zero amnesty...   I feel a lot of people have idiotic stances on immigration. They aren't taking jobs the guys who harp on that want to, they aren't receiving free aid from the government, and they aren't enjoying benefits that taxpayers pay for.  My personal opinion is that it's just straight up xenophobia and fearmongering-- much like Christians, who compose an overwhelming majority of the country, think they're being persecuted."
Acadiana,2oilwm,squeamish,4,Sun Dec 7 19:10:52 2014 UTC,"On a similar note, I can't stand when my fellow Catholics also go right along with these ignorant policies. It's incredibly arrogant to accuse every illegal immigrant of being criminal scum for trying to have a better life.  Too many want to abandon the teaching on human dignity when it applies to anyone but themselves."
Acadiana,2oilwm,willargueforfood,-3,Mon Dec 8 01:35:07 2014 UTC,Vaccinates them???? What a monster!

I'd like a vet discount at the door, but only retired and disabled vet get ID cards. There's no veteran ID that I know of. I heard talk that the OMV can put veteran status on your DL, but I can't confirm that. I don't believe it.

Acadiana,2o05l4,bfbabine,2,Tue Dec 2 13:12:25 2014 UTC,Especially after she threw her constituency under the bus.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/12/02/mary-landrieu-has-a-serious-early-voting-problem/
Acadiana,2nvd4m,uzername_ic,3,Sun Nov 30 20:25:45 2014 UTC,"Rather than try to make your own site, get wordpress hosting.  Use downloadable templates to make a site as you see fit, and google your way to victory on things you don't understand.  It's a lot easier to get a wordpress site up rather than making one yourself, and it integrates plugins for things like webcarts and payment processing.  Having to learn all that from scratch would take quite some time.  I'm not a web designer, but I do have to make webpages for certain things, and this is by far the most time and cost effective solution available to those who aren't web-designers/programmers."
Acadiana,2nvd4m,kunstlinger,1 point,Sun Nov 30 21:45:19 2014 UTC,"The problem with word press is I can't find a template I like. I'll find one that will support a logo, but it will put pictures out of my media in places o don't like, and I can't change it. Or figure out how too. I just made another one in weebly, but I'm already paying for other hosting. So I need to decide if I like it enough to pay again, or try another time with wordpress"
Acadiana,2nvd4m,Dharma_Monkey,1 point,Sun Nov 30 22:16:25 2014 UTC,"Hi. Web designer here. /u/kunstlinger has good advice about the hosting plan you should get. The BlueHost package is a good deal. As far as finding a wordpress theme, I can help you to find the right one for you. If you want to meet in person, I don't mind consulting you on what you need to know. I won't charge. I just enjoy this kind of stuff, haha"
Acadiana,2nvd4m,Dharma_Monkey,1 point,Mon Dec 1 14:26:44 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks for the offer. I've got it running on a WordPress template right now at about 85% where I want it. But there's still some tweaks that need to be made and I'm not sure how to do it. My main concern at this point also is growing. Will I be able to handle more traffic in the future? When should I hand it over to professionals? Yada yada. I would love to be able to sit down and get some advice from you one day. Mostly when I posted this I saw a huge increase in my social media followers and wanted to get the site up after I've been working on it for a few weeks and was never happy with it. But yes, I would love to site down and chat, and get my ducks in a row."
Acadiana,2nvd4m,Dharma_Monkey,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:03:15 2014 UTC,"Great. Well I work Monday through Friday 8 - 5, so I can meet in the afternoons or pretty much any time on weekends. Let me know when you'd like to meet."

Acadiana,2nvd4m,cfjedimaster,1 point,Tue Dec 2 22:29:02 2014 UTC,I have bowling on Wednesday evenings but we can meet up this weekend if youre free. We can also Skype tonight or done other time if that works for you
Acadiana,2nvd4m,smfaviatrix,2,Tue Dec 2 23:10:03 2014 UTC,"This weekend should work. I don't think I have a whole bunch going on. Youre doing me the favor though sir, so whenever its convenient for you."
Acadiana,2nvd4m,nongobi,3,Tue Dec 2 23:21:24 2014 UTC,"If you can't pay, and you can't use wordpress, I'm sorry to say you're a bit screwed.  People go through a lot to learn how to do this, which is on one hand saying you should pay them for their knowledge, but on the other me telling you that you too can learn.  old man story - When I learned how to make websites there were only books. How weird to learn the web from a book right? Well it's especially weird when you have free things like:   code academy code avengers youtube google stack overflow   There's a ton of stuff to learn with this, don't be intimidated. What works for me may not work for you, that's ok. But you have literally all of humanity's knowledge at your finger tips for free.   If you can't pay someone to do it for you, this is your option."
Acadiana,2ntyby,xhazerdusx,2,Sun Nov 30 08:36:44 2014 UTC,What FB page?
Acadiana,2ntmlr,Sir_Trivium,11,Sun Nov 30 05:33:59 2014 UTC,"Best? As in what they offer? Red's is pretty much hands down. They have anything that you might be able to think of, from indoor tennis courts to a bar. Pricey? Maybe. Close to your house? Maybe not, but Red's can beat anyone one else with the sheer amount of shit they have."
Acadiana,2ntmlr,cbs5090,3,Sun Nov 30 06:03:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah as in range of things to do. And you know, a damn squat rack or something besides smith machines"
Acadiana,2ntmlr,JustHereForTheParty,12,Sun Nov 30 06:36:56 2014 UTC,Dude. Reds.
Acadiana,2ntmlr,FermentingSkeleton,3,Sun Nov 30 07:55:22 2014 UTC,"Your best bet is gonna be Red's or Snap Fitness (the Youngsville or Verot locations being the best, and membership to one is good for all of them). Red's advantage is sheer size and number of options to participate in. Snap is 24 hr, multiple location, possibly less busy. Kind of a 'pick your poison' situation."
Acadiana,2ntmlr,louisiana_whiteboy,1 point,Sun Nov 30 07:30:14 2014 UTC,I had a good experience with anytime fitness. The gyms quality vary from location to location but overall I enjoyed my experience.
Acadiana,2ntmlr,nongobi,1 point,Sun Nov 30 19:56:35 2014 UTC,"If you're looking for a broad range of stuff that goes beyond machines, Red's is the place. There's an upstairs gym that is like any fitness club, but there's two of a lot of the machines/stations. There's a downstairs ""heavy gym"" (that's what I call it) and that's where I lot of the bodybuilders work out at. It has the more obscure machines, gear, and places where you can throw weights around if you want to go big. It's a very different from the normal club atmosphere.  I haven't been to Planet Fitness, but my opinion is that they seek quantity over quality. These other clubs actually give a damn about your health and fitness and don't feed members tootsie rolls and pizza. The ""lunk alarm"" crap and absence of free weights is bs. I understand that they are creating an inexpensive beginners environment where people can feel comfortable, but they shaming fit people and calling them ""lunks"" is no atmosphere for someone who lifts. Yknow?"
Acadiana,2ntmlr,ragincajun32,1 point,Tue Dec 2 14:39:15 2014 UTC,"I know what you mean. Most gyms are places where people go to get healthy. PF seems like a place built around luring in people with shitloads of flashy machines and gimmicks. I mean.. they don't even have a bench and the free weight area is tiny. I used to go there with my cousin. It seemed like we would always see people come in, sign up, workout everyday for like three weeks, then never seen them again."
Acadiana,2ntmlr,gongonzabarfarbin,6,Fri Dec 5 22:23:53 2014 UTC,"Red's is rad, but you're gonna pay about $800 for your first year ($550-600 annually and a $200 newb fee.) It has everything: pools, crossfit, tennis, racquetball,  boxing ring, the entire social aspect of course.  I've been an Anytime Fitness member for about 6 years and I like it. I pay $41mo. The equipment is good shape, it's very clean, good staff, and it's 24/7.  If you want to go at 9PM, no problem. Out of state? No problem, go to any ATF. There's a handful of them between Broussard and Scott. I've used all of them and the Kaliste Saloom club was my favorite. IMO, the gym closest to home is the best gym. On days that I'm not motivated, it helps to have a gym right around the corner and not all the way across town."
Acadiana,2ntmlr,Bucky664,3,Sun Nov 30 22:19:16 2014 UTC,Agreed with your assessment of Anytime Fitness on Kaliste Saloom.  Jeff does a great job with the place.   I did take a brief hiatus but am back there now.
Acadiana,2ntmlr,Dharma_Monkey,5,Tue Dec 2 14:31:28 2014 UTC,Reds has everything and then some. I've been a bunch of cities and reds is still by far my favorite gym.
Acadiana,2ntmlr,gizibee,3,Sun Nov 30 07:15:52 2014 UTC,"I used to go to Snap but now I'm Red's. It's a little pricey but you get a shit ton to do there. The first time I took the tour, I was in amazement of all the machines and equipment I never knew existed."

Acadiana,2nnzik,LFKhael,2,Fri Nov 28 18:56:07 2014 UTC,Yeah true. That program needs tweaking. The best thing to do is to map out your route prior to a trip or call their number beforehand.

Acadiana,2nbd1i,cajunbander,13,Tue Nov 25 01:18:48 2014 UTC,"If he were smart, he'd capitalize on it. Obviously, if many people are asking him, there's demand for an LGBT friendly establishment.  You know, instead of t-boy hiphop club #9000."
Acadiana,2nbd1i,dannytheguitarist,7,Tue Nov 25 01:40:46 2014 UTC,"When I talked to the manager, they didn't know what kind of club they wanted to be, though she said they didn't want to be a dance nightclub/ hip hop club."
Acadiana,2nbd1i,cajunbander,6,Tue Nov 25 02:08:34 2014 UTC,Someone needs to let their social media person know.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,dannytheguitarist,1 point,Tue Nov 25 02:56:03 2014 UTC,"""Mostly hip hop"" means a black bar, right? If so, they're not hurting themselves by alienating gay people.  Is that racist? Or homophobic? Or both?"
Acadiana,2nbd1i,squeamish,5,Tue Nov 25 02:42:55 2014 UTC,I don't think people are necessarily asking because they want a gay bar.  They're asking because it's damn close to the LGBT logo.  I know that's why I asked.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,pele1410,0,Tue Nov 25 13:02:10 2014 UTC,"I imagine you would have less problems as well. I mean lets be honest, why did Karma close down again?"
Acadiana,2nbd1i,phqu88,7,Tue Nov 25 14:37:47 2014 UTC,Hah. Go look at barcodes in Va's Facebook. Apparently they have something planned for our Barcodes grand opening.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,uzername_ic,5,Tue Nov 25 01:04:07 2014 UTC,What're they going to do?
Acadiana,2nbd1i,bruce656,5,Tue Nov 25 05:31:36 2014 UTC,I don't know. Just said they had something planned.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,uzername_ic,3,Tue Nov 25 06:32:58 2014 UTC,Hopefully they get the entire Acadiana LGBT community out for the grande opening
Acadiana,2nbd1i,bruce656,1 point,Tue Nov 25 06:37:01 2014 UTC,Checked their page. Couldn't find anything about it :/
Acadiana,2nbd1i,pele1410,3,Tue Nov 25 05:37:05 2014 UTC,All I found was this:   Barcode: We actually have something in mind...stay tuned.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,dannytheguitarist,6,Tue Nov 25 13:06:07 2014 UTC,"Story seems to have taken an interesting turn. Troll? Corporate sabotage? Either way, it begs the question; who is antagonistic enough to do this? Whoever it is got their wish. It made national news."

Those that have read through the posts on the page,  do you think that there's a chance that this is trolling or sabotage? It had Brewski's address on their page instead of Jefferson... coincidentally the owner of Brewski's owns Fame.  Thoughts?"
Acadiana,2nbd1i,cajunbander,4,Mon Nov 24 23:59:36 2014 UTC,Nah. I think any homophobia in the deep South Bible Belt is unfortunately sincere.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,StephenFish,9,Tue Nov 25 01:38:56 2014 UTC,I wouldn't call south Louisiana the Bible Belt.   From what I've heard the owner is arrogant. Parked his expensive car up on the sidewalk in front the club instead of in a parking lot a while back.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,rd8t,4,Tue Nov 25 01:57:52 2014 UTC,"Either way, there's a ""new"" page up. The other one had dates like Sept 28th on some of the posts. I saw the way someone that was accused of sabotage was writing and it look oddly familiar to the suspect post that was made.  I'm leaving the new page alone. If someone's screwing with them I don't want any part of driving an innocent business into the ground."
Acadiana,2nbd1i,JamieHynemanAMA,5,Tue Nov 25 02:52:51 2014 UTC,This. is. HILARIOUS!  You can't make this up.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,Phnglui,2,Tue Nov 25 18:17:30 2014 UTC,"You know, looking at the logo style and colors, I'd have thought ""80's"".  Of course, I've also never claimed to have had my finger on the pulse of pop culture.  Though, I'd like to think I have enough sense to know saying something like this would cause a backlash."
Acadiana,2nbd1i,squeamish,0,Tue Nov 25 03:18:10 2014 UTC,"Internet justice?   There's a difference between clarifying who this nightclub was meant for and clear-cut homophobia ""no gays allowed"".  Seems like everyone and this author is starting a fight for the sake of fighting."
Acadiana,2nbd1i,squeamish,7,Tue Nov 25 04:48:20 2014 UTC,"They came off as very hostile to potential LGBT customers.  When you call yourself a ""straight bar"" how are gays supposed to take that than ""we don't want gays here""?  They could have just as easily said it's not an exclusive bar and bam, point taken, LGBT aren't the intended audience but the owner doesn't sound like an asshole."
Acadiana,2nbd1i,squeamish,2,Tue Nov 25 08:11:58 2014 UTC,And if the guy was oblivious enough to not see the rainbow/gay connection then I doubt he's capable of choosing his words very carefully when talking to/about gay people.
Acadiana,2nbd1i,danspeed3,2,Tue Nov 25 20:34:22 2014 UTC,"Are straight people not welcome at ""gay bars?"""
Acadiana,2nbd1i,squeamish,2,Tue Nov 25 20:33:31 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure that gay people refer to gay bars as ""bars."" Straight people, society in general for the most part, has referred to them as ""gay bars."""
Acadiana,2nbd1i,squeamish,-1,Tue Nov 25 21:03:38 2014 UTC,"There are bars that are absolutely intended to be almost exclusively populated by gay customers and pretty much everybody knows that what ""gay bar"" means, so the word is cromulent. In those bars, are straight people welcome? I've found they kind of are, kind of aren't, same as any person not the same as the people in a place that is 90+% homogenous along one characteristic (gay, black, Irish, frat, etc.)"
Acadiana,2nbd1i,Phnglui,1 point,Tue Nov 25 21:17:56 2014 UTC,"Why do I have you tagged as ""religious jerk"" in res? And people wonder why no one goes to meetups.  Well, that's your perspective on the gay community I suppose. I'm straight and I've been to them before. My orientation has never come up as a subject and I felt very welcome. When you stop seeing people as ""gay"" or ""straight"" and nightlife places as ""gay"" or ""straight,"" you might have a better understanding. Just for fun, here's a description of a local bar/club here in Lafayette posted by the owner/staff:  ""______ is a place where everyone can come together to have a good time. We aren't only a place for the LGBT community, but a place for everyone to come together. We are looking to have a nice, fun and laid back environment. We are looking forward to our upcoming changes and events. So stay tuned to watch our transformation. Looking for to meeting a ton of new faces."""

I honestly think either is fine, because both have a full menu, bar atmosphere and full service well and brand liquor and beer menu.  /u/therobisaur thought Cafe Cottage would enable us to engage in games, he has a full Cards Against Humanity set, and I have a Munchkin set, certainly nobody is opposed to that.  Not saying that Bisbano's isn't boardgame/cardgame friendly, I think we both agreed that the worst of it would be the live bands, but I don't really have a problem with it, and live bands aren't going to be that much louder than the music at Cafe Cottage anyway.  So my suggestion would be to take those two and put it to a vote."

Your problem sounds very symptomatic of a poor coaxial connection from the cable box to the modem; most likely caused by either too many splitters or a splitter going bad. Cox doesn't seem to be able to detect this issue from their end ever, but a technician would be able to detect the problem if they hooked up to your lines in your house.   If at all possible, find out where the primary cable drop enters your house/apartment and connect the modem directly to that line. Test your signals and speeds again: if things improve (and stay that way) then you need to put a good splitter on that line and keep your modem right there."

From here I'd call and complain enough until they sent a technician out (free!) to connect and run some signal strength tests from your end. There's no reason for your upload to be so crippling.  If the technician doesn't find anything wrong, you might have to see if you can procure a different modem to try.

Acadiana,2mnyng,Timmeyh01,0,Tue Nov 18 18:28:30 2014 UTC,"No, it is not legal; you are not allowed to use the turning lane as a merging lane.   While that is bad, it's not nearly as bad as when people cross over the near lane into the far lane when making a turn. I have to reverse into Johnston street when leaving my driveway, and I've had more near-accidents because of this than I care to think about. You're supposed to turn into the near lane you so don't rear end someone else merging into the far lane!"
Acadiana,2mnyng,gizibee,6,Tue Nov 18 18:38:32 2014 UTC,I have to reverse into Johnston street when leaving my driveway.   Holy shit. Honestly... I'm speechless. That's crazy.

Crackhead ran into a busy street where I was crawling behind a vehicle about to turn.  Rna into my driverside door and almost broke the mirror.   Side note, best friend was reading books on photographic memory, and after me beating a dead horse with a dumb joke, managed to get him to trip up after describing the guy to a cop about how he had a pornographic memory)."

Acadiana,2mnyng,bruce656,2,Tue Nov 18 20:51:06 2014 UTC,"I guess it hinges on the definition of proper lane. I would argue the proper lane is the lane closest to where you were turning from. To avoid a possible collision with people turning into the outer lane. The fact that they even add that stipulation, proper lane...  Edit: according to the site below, it depends what state you're in, of course, whether or not it's permitted to turn into the far lane.

I passed it, turned into Kinko's, and was in line, now in front of the car I would have been behind (since they chose poorly on which lane).  After about 30 seconds in line, I noticed at least 4 cars on Ambassador all with blinkers waiting to turn in.  This was at 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon (within the past month). Seriously people...

Which just create another problem, people driving through gas stations and driveways and down side streets backing up traffic there. Until they can widen Verot and add turning lanes, there really isn't a good answer. The best solution really is just people in the opposite lane of traffic not being assholes and letting these people make their turn."

It's a shitty situation, but we live in a city with poor infrastructure, so we have to deal with it. Part of that is watching out for these poor assholes trying get to make the turn, and letting them in. We all have to deal with the same shitty infrastructure, and we've all been that poor asshole before.  If you want to talk about assholes, how about ALL those peoole who don't  let that guy turn? They're just as culpable  inconveniencing all those people backed up for the half a mile just as much as the guy making the turn. Those people are worse, IMO. the asshole has to deal with a bad situation; these guys can actually fix it, but don't."
Acadiana,2mnyng,dannytheguitarist,4,Tue Nov 18 20:02:40 2014 UTC,"if that traffic is flowing, they are in no way obligated to stop and let him turn.  now, if they are at a stop, it's cool if someone lets them turn.   Also, most individuals are not smart enough to think things through and say ""just because it's the shortest way home doesn't mean it's the fastest or easiest"".  I know it sounds dickish the way I word it, but take the typical good ol' boy mentality where thinking is against their moral beliefs and is just for nerds and heathens, and they will never contemplate the idea that going another route could get them home more efficently.  I don't take the shortest route home, just the one that keeps me from sitting in one place for too long.  I do agree with the infrastructure being shit.  It's pretty funny to see reactions to people who come from other cities and think driving here won't be shit due to the size.  Then they discover ambassador or Johnston at 5pm."

Acadiana,2mmr4j,pele1410,6,Tue Nov 18 16:32:02 2014 UTC,"I've not written about this for a while, but here's Why I hate Critical Mass:   Mission Creep: back in 1992 when SF started CM rides were a way to raise awareness of the need to include bicycling in the city's infrastructure. Now it's turned into a clusterfuck of dipshits that rarely ride making bicycling the cause du jour for the mis-guided activist.   The result of ""taking the streets"" and causing gridlock doesn't promote community interaction, instead it antagonizes and divides the community.  On the road we all need to move in a predictable manner, be it on 18 wheels or 2 wheels, jamming the grid to bring attention is not a positive reward action, instead it makes others suffer and creates a rift between those that ride and those that drive.   Generally speaking: the majority of riders I've met that participate in CM are unhinged jackasses that user CM as a way to say FU to the world, it gives them a false sense of superiority and an outlet to be a smug asshole. We don't need a bunch of entitled trustafarians holding their brakeless fixies up to the sun to block the traffic, we need a campaign of education for both riders and drivers in order to navigate the grid safely and make good time."

Acadiana,2mmr4j,threetoast,2,Tue Nov 18 18:38:13 2014 UTC,"Good point. IME, most people think it's pretty cool and stop to watch. However, I don't see the need to ride on Kaliste Saloom, Camelia, etc, as there are sidewalks and the road is too busy for that. I think it's a good initiative otherwise, riding downtown, through neighborhoods, etc.   Maybe they should reconsider their routes and obey traffic laws, I agree with that. However, I 100% support showing presence of the cyclist community. We've had handfuls of people injured, hit & runs, and even a few deaths. Cyclists are taunted, harassed, and at times people have been intentionally assaulted. As drivers, we need to be cognizant of them and learn to share the road. We need to slow down a bit and give them their three feet of clearance. As cyclists, we need to obey traffic laws and USE LIGHTS AT NIGHT for safety.   It's a double-edged sword. Maybe Critical Mass is being passive-aggressive assholes, but I don't see anyone petitioning for educating these two groups on proper laws, rules, and etiquette. I'm neutral on it all, because I can see why both groups would be upset."
Acadiana,2mmr4j,threetoast,2,Tue Nov 18 18:47:53 2014 UTC,"If they obeyed traffic laws and attempted to be part of traffic instead of just causing traffic, they'd probably do alot more to increase awareness.  And I'd be all for that.  I know it's currently dangerous as a cyclist.  I ride casually on various neighborhood roads and have almost been hit several times.  My girlfriend was basically run off the road by some idiot who just had to pass her before turning.

Acadiana,2mm083,Woosier,-1,Tue Nov 18 12:43:00 2014 UTC,"test is absurdly easy and involves things like basic math and reading comprehension   Have you taken it? I have, and I have a bachelors degree. It's not insanely easy. I passed it with a 90 something, other people I know who've also taken it after college scored mostly in the 70s-80s range. I wouldn't call it insanely easy. Those are average scores.    Unless they took classes in law, their education is inconsequential.   Education is education. A better educated person is usually able to handle certain situations better than an uneducated person.    Some precincts even reject applicants with IQs above a certain level.    First off, a precinct is a geographic zone within a certain agency's jurisdiction. One precinct wouldn't have different standards from a another one.   And it's true that one agency was given the right to reject applicants with IQs above a certain level. That level was well above average, and the reasoning behind it was that a person with an IQ that high wouldn't be challenged mentally with the usually mundane job that is police work, get bored, and end up leaving for something more suitable for him to be doing. It costs a lot of money to train someone to be a cop and you don't want to waste it.   That doesn't mean that all agencies reject smart people. And the agencies, or at least the large agencies around here, do not, they want to hire the most intelligent people they can which is why they recruit heavily at places like UL, LSU, and McNeese. In fact after scoring well on my civil service test I was contacted by plenty of agencies that wanted to recruit someone who scored highly on it."

Acadiana,2mg2p7,RaginRealtor,1 point,Sun Nov 16 19:30:42 2014 UTC,I'm just curious as to how the process works. The school I currently work for I didn't have to go through district screening. Do I strictly apply to the district or go through the school?   I agree that if you're a great teacher your work will speak for itself. However I'm looking for a school with a supportive staff and administration. There is some weight in school/district performance and teacher happiness.
Acadiana,2mg2p7,circusboy,1 point,Sun Nov 16 19:41:08 2014 UTC,"Give the district you resume. Then go around to the schools you may be interested in and ask to speak to the principal.  Since you graduated from UL, think about the schools you visited during your studies and talk to anyone you graduated with about the school they work at and what opening will be coming up. There are three student teachers at my school and I believe they already have district jobs lines up for the spring."

Acadiana,2mf9ib,sprinklesvondoom,2,Sun Nov 16 21:02:17 2014 UTC,"Somewhere where we won't necessarily have the place to ourselves, but don't have to worry about sweating a square foot of space and nobody can hear anyone else talk.  I know Artmosphere isn't very popular here, and I'm not a huge fan of it either, but it does meet those criteria.  Fast Eddie's gets that way sometimes as well, but is a toss-up on whether it's going to be like that on the 6th, and they don't have pitchers.  Ummm...I could suggest DIX or Corner Bar, but I've heard those places have become real frat-boy packed lately, and I'm going to take an educated guess that frat bars aren't the typical 337-redditor's scene.  Then there's always dinner-bars, like BJ's Pizza or Bisbano's, where they don't just do beer & pizza(although I'm a huge fan), they also have a full-service dinner menu that isn't a bank-breaker, and honestly, that scene would be my ideal choice.  Legends Annex behind Marley's is small but also kind of fits that criteria.  Just a few ideas to mull over.  If I were organizing this, and I had to do my best to please our demographic on at least one of all the demanded criteria, I'd go with a place like Bisbano's, Legends Annex, or BJ's, because they provide sports on the tv, good music that isn't too loud, food that's not just jalapeno poppers or cheese sticks, and they have a beer menu and/or liquor(I'm not too certain if Bisbano's has a hard-liquor bar, but I wouldn't doubt it, they're on campus...I just don't frequent them because they are on campus)"
Acadiana,2mf9ib,themarknessmonster,2,Mon Nov 17 00:42:35 2014 UTC,"I love the idea for the Legend's annex, I'm just worried about the weather.    But its a great place b/c there's parking everywhere and you have options if it gets lame and you wanna go to your bar of choice for a lil while"
Acadiana,2mf9ib,sprinklesvondoom,1 point,Mon Nov 17 03:25:50 2014 UTC,"I think you've got the right idea. Artmosphere has ample space (get their early and get the corner inside) and a nice outside area with heaters usually.   Bisbano's Cellar Door is small, not usually packed, and has a real bar. We play shows there sometimes and it can get loud there when rock bands takeover however.   Don't know how you guys feel about Caffe Cottage, but the cafe side is good for talking, playing cards, etc.  There's an Icegators game on the 5th. It's cheap, fun, and we can finish the night at Smitty's Wings down the road. Just a handful of options."

Acadiana,2m99yt,mojoronomous,3,Fri Nov 14 05:05:17 2014 UTC,"It's not Lafayette or Maurice but Satin Belle Retrievers in Morse, La are excellent.  I was a vet tech for 10 years and the care and compassion Ed and Jackie had were unbeatable.  Definitely worth the drive and cost for high quality, serious training.  They specialize in hunting retrievers but do all around training as well.  Also, Roger Abshire owns USK9 in Kaplan.  He trains police/bomb/drug dogs but I am pretty sure offers all around training as well.  Roger is more business, and the dogs are working dogs, he won't pet and cuddle and baby talk them, but he is by no means cruel or harsh.  I took care of both these peoples personal pets/training prospects and was always impressed with their knowledge, abilities and training methods.  If you want something not so ""official"" that requires your dog ""going away"" for a month or so then Lafayette Veterinary Care Center offers a hands on dog training class where you go and work with your dog and learn together.  I know the owner very well and he had spent many many years focusing on dog behavior and training techniques, which is passed down to his instructor.  For tips on at home training for your dog that will help you understand the psychology of dogs and make it easier for you to do at home obedience research ""deference training"" it really is the core of having a healthy, happy, obedient dog.  Edit: I just went back and actually read what you are looking for and what you have already accomplished and if your dog is already  ""trained"" and you are just trying to build confidence then the at home ""deference training""  is really what you should do, save the money on a big time dog trainer.  Also, realize some dogs are more timid, submissive by nature and that is just their personality.  Good luck, feel free to ask any questions.  Hope this helps!"
Acadiana,2m99yt,JoWhackySpack,1 point,Fri Nov 14 11:43:26 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the advice... I've been doing some of the deference training, and Lafayette Veterinary Care Center sounds really good.  I'll give them all a look-see.  I've got a lot about dog psych down, and we work with some deference training, but I'd like to get him out and about a bit more.  As far as timidity, he's far more confident in the woods than with people, and he's great with people he knows. He's more fearful with things like mailboxes or engine noise and such than anything in the woods or fields (where he explores like any other dog would), so I think he may have gone through some weird stuff before I adopted him or been neglected as a young pup (as some of the shelter staff implied).  It's literally like I have two dogs sometimes.  I'm just trying to normalize him a bit so he's more likely to pay attention to me in a strange environment... so stepping up the deference training like you suggest also sounds like a good idea."

Acadiana,2m6tsb,everettmarm,1 point,Thu Nov 13 22:30:10 2014 UTC,"lowe's has them new, range from $100 to $1200  there's also the portable propane heaters for $50  http://www.lowes.com/pd_107999-88644-TT15CL_0__?productId=3262157&Ntt=propane+portable+heater&pl=1&currentURL=%3FNtt%3Dpropane%2Bportable%2Bheater&facetInfo="
Acadiana,2m6tsb,everettmarm,2,Thu Nov 13 22:54:39 2014 UTC,"I had luck with oil-filled, electric radiators. There is a digital, Honeywell model at Walmart and I had two of them. They have wheels and a handle for moving it. There's also a tip-over shutoff feature. It works great in smaller rooms, but I had high ceilings and 20x20 rooms and it took forever.   I recommend buying the $12 warranty on it. I had go out on me and had to return it."
Acadiana,2m6tsb,everettmarm,2,Thu Nov 13 16:09:41 2014 UTC,"I've got 4 space heaters. What I do not have is a plethora of electrical outlets. I also have zero electrical outlets in my bathroom, but I DO have a gas pipe in there. So I figure a small radiator would be the way to go."
Acadiana,2m6tsb,planza,2,Thu Nov 13 16:26:54 2014 UTC,Stevenson st. Area by chance?
Acadiana,2m6tsb,dannytheguitarist,2,Thu Nov 13 16:35:06 2014 UTC,"Close, Freetown, anyway. Apparently not having heat isn't all that uncommon. I talked to another landlord, a friend of my parents, who I figured would be a little more reputable. None of her places had heat either! I don't know what the deal is."
Acadiana,2m6tsb,redditor1983,2,Thu Nov 13 17:02:11 2014 UTC,"Those are old houses. A lot of the heaters that some originally had were unsafe to begin with, if you look at the wood floors and some of the houses in that area by the doors you can see black marks from all the soot that those heaters generated.   It's pretty expensive to retrofit heat to those places, and it incurs a good bit of liability and insurance expense, so the landlords often times don't do it.I live in one in the area for a long time, and I'm familiar with the slumlording that goes on there :-)"

Acadiana,2m6tsb,redditor1983,3,Thu Nov 13 19:45:14 2014 UTC,Yeah you're right.  Definitely a dick move on the LL's part

Aside from that, you can buy a new ventless gas heater for about 250 bucks on amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Kozy-World-GWD208-Vent-Free-Dual-Fuel/dp/B001XW102Q/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1415897940&sr=8-4&keywords=ventless+gas+heater  You can also call local HVAC companies.

Acadiana,2m3p04,squeamish,4,Thu Nov 13 01:39:48 2014 UTC,Hey I worked there too. Most demeaning/disrespectful job I've ever worked. Thought about quitting literally every day I went in. Good luck finding a new gig! Have you tried freelancing?
Acadiana,2m3p04,thereachinghand,3,Wed Nov 12 22:53:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah, freelancing is difficult.  Nearly every client I've had has given me the typical schpiel about getting free artwork with the promise of ""more business"", to which I have to inform them that you wouldn't do that at McDonald's so what about my business screams charity?  Of course more polite than that, but you get the gist of it.  How long ago were you there?"
Acadiana,2m3p04,thereachinghand,2,Wed Nov 12 23:44:06 2014 UTC,Beginning of this year. Was working there with another guy who has since been hired at a much more respectful environment. I've been freelancing full-time for a number of months now. It's scary but kind of great.
Acadiana,2m3p04,thereachinghand,3,Wed Nov 12 23:54:02 2014 UTC,"I replaced that guy.  By the way, I get to hear an earful about how terrible of a worker you were at least once a week, which I know is false, because I've seen your portfolio.  How you never saved files correctly(false, I know because I've used them in some repeat jobs), how you never typeset anything correctly(false, I've never had to redo any of your work because it was against specs), how you never got off your lazy ass and did any actual work(false, nobody else holds that sentiment except the boss), and how you always managed to waste time(again false, only the boss's opinion).  With me, it's all about material.  I have never in my life worked for a print shop that doesn't have a material-waste budget.  How the hell else is a designer/printer supposed to know he is printing the right thing?  I have to beg to print a sample of something so I can match color, and most of the time, the response is ""It's in the system"", which is such an ambiguous and general statement I'm ready to bust a vein whenever I hear it.  I know it's in the ""system"".  Can you be more specific and stop just trying to sound like you know what you're talking about?  The ""system"" includes several platforms, which I'll now elaborate on:  The thousands of art files on the server, the email history, the invoicing software, the hard-copy filing cabinet, and the jobs awaiting approval, estimates awaiting approval, and current email correspondence.  If you can't be bothered to take the two seconds it takes to think of and articulate the specific platform you wish me to explore to find what you are looking for, I can't be bothered to waste time guessing what you're talking about while you get progressively angrier at me for not being psychic.  Seriously, one of the most aggravating things I've ever dealt with in my life."
Acadiana,2m3p04,thereachinghand,3,Wed Nov 12 23:56:19 2014 UTC,That place burned through some employees this year. Two dudes quit at the same time when I was working there.
Acadiana,2m3p04,HEIL_ALLSTAR,2,Thu Nov 13 00:02:28 2014 UTC,"Turns out her reputation precedes her all the way to Sunset.  The last employee that left got a job at a screen printer's there, and they hired her specifically because they knew how bad a boss she was dealing with."
Acadiana,2m3p04,uzername_ic,3,Thu Nov 13 00:09:10 2014 UTC,Hahahaha. That place was and continues to be a shit-show. I did the best that I could given the conditions I was working under. It didn't help that there was no real production manager there or anyone overseeing workflow or proofing things other than myself and maybe one other person if I was lucky. They were so concerned with getting things out the door as quickly as possible that mistakes were made constantly. Then they bitched about having to reprint things. Unbelievable. The most liberating part of every day was walking out those doors come 5 p.m. Never again.
Acadiana,2m3p04,thereachinghand,3,Thu Nov 13 00:11:09 2014 UTC,"I finally left.  I wasn't going to be abused anymore.  I calmly explained my position to her, and was told that it was ""just my opinion"".  Haha, no, it's the opinion of pretty much everyone I speak to."

I've collected various edibles in SW Louisiana for a while now.  I've also picked in the PNW and out East.  Louisiana has a multitude of edibles, but our conditions are miserable.  Basically, the main picking seasons are below (from my experience)  May-Aug  Chanterelles Sept-Nov Ringless Honey Nov-Feb  Oyster  These are the main flushes that are pretty consistent year in and out.  There are edibles available throughout the year, but those are the major fruitings.  Oysters are generally found year-round, but the major crop is foundd in the winter.  look for them on either Tupelo or willow trees.  Chanterelles are found from late spring to early fall, peaking in summer of course.  Look in old growth forest around mature oaks.  Found in abundance around the Vermellion River if your looking in Lafayette.  Pm me if you have more questions, we actually have a lot of edible varieties here in LA!

Read through that, and that will give you a good idea of the things the area has to offer.  As far as beignets go, that's a tough one. I wouldn't even know where to begin to recommend you try to look. You're right, it's not as big a thing here as it is in New Orleans or even Baton Rouge. You might try places like Dwyer's cafe or T-Coons. I'm fairly positive Kellers Bakery makes them. You might try some of the other local bakeries like Twins or maybe even Poupart's"

Acadiana,2ljuqn,ArkZilla,2,Fri Nov 7 04:47:10 2014 UTC,I teach in Lafayette parish and I'm sort of curious about the opinions of cooper from people outside of the world of lpss. It's a celebration for every teacher I know. But I guess I was just wondering what's the outside perspective of it all?
Acadiana,2ljuqn,elizabethsink,1 point,Fri Nov 7 15:24:42 2014 UTC,"I'm in both camps--I'm a teacher, but not in LPSS. I dunno if that makes me an insider or outsider.You can see my opinion below."
Acadiana,2ljuqn,Owlettt,5,Fri Nov 7 15:54:46 2014 UTC,Haha a little of both I guess. I agree. As a new teacher it's an absolute MESS right now. The amount of just stress and frustration is through the roof. I'm hoping we all see some relief and change real soon.
Acadiana,2ljuqn,elizabethsink,4,Fri Nov 7 18:07:46 2014 UTC,"As a mid-career teacher, I cannot express the level of damage this man caused. He essentially fired a generation of experienced teachers who should be my generation's mentors. He replaced them by packing in young, naive teachers who desperately need the advice of the older generation. All they have for advice are mid-career people like me who are still perfecting their game. It says volumes that the majority of these younger hires that I have spoken with do not support him either. Education is not a business--it is a vocation. I didn't earn a masters degree in my specialty (History) because teaching was my second option in life. Teachers like me and the younger ones as well depend on the institutional memory and wisdom accumulated by previous generations of teachers. To Cooper and his cut-throat agenda, that memory and wisdom represented a threat. Good riddance."
Acadiana,2ljuqn,Owlettt,1 point,Fri Nov 7 15:32:58 2014 UTC,"Maybe I'm not in the know, but what did Cooper do to lose so many veteran teachers?"
Acadiana,2ljuqn,rapcat,2,Fri Nov 7 22:55:44 2014 UTC,"Not lose. Fire. Pat Cooper had a history of firing older teachers for no other reason than that they disagreed with his policies. It would be tactless of me to name names here, but suffice it to say that at least two teachers of the year that I know at different public schools were tendered their severance under very suspect circumstances.  Edit: I need to say that he rarely fired someone outright, though he did so when he found it necessary. He was much more insidious. If he didn't like an older teacher, he made his/her professional lives hell, haunting them at every turn. Younger teachers he just outright bullied. Look, you know some teachers in this community; just ask them honestly about their experience under Cooper."
Acadiana,2ljuqn,Owlettt,2,Sat Nov 8 05:48:28 2014 UTC,"This is the story of Cooper, a small puppy, that was owned by a small Amish community.   Cooper obeyed and followed his masters orders and directions at first.  No one knows what made Cooper turn, but something changed, something made Cooper bite the hand that fed him.  The Amish community banded together and became an angry mob.  They raised their pitchforks and torches and uncovered that Cooper had done many horrible deeds.  He had become an arrogant and pompous buffoon.   In the end, Cooper was muzzled and banished from the community.  He continues to bark to this very day."
Acadiana,2ljuqn,yoinkz,1 point,Sat Nov 8 03:40:27 2014 UTC,"I was talking to someone earlier who, while not necessarily a supporter of Cooper, said this kind of reminds him of high school cliques in a way.  Neither side seemed to want to offer any support or willingness to work together, and it's turned into just a sad, pathetic mess which now will move into the legal sector as the intentions to sue were clearly stated."
Acadiana,2ljuqn,rd8t,1 point,Fri Nov 7 19:35:42 2014 UTC,"The whole ""board versus cooper is a big childish mess"" argument is only valid when you don't talk to any teachers. Teachers in LPSS (which I am not) are NOT children. They almost universally have no good words for cooper.  This is because cooper turned their professional environment into an unpredictable cauldron of backstabbing and vitriol. About half of the administrators love him, but hey, they got paid more. That's kind of the point."

Acadiana,2lekkm,ChrisDeg87,3,Wed Nov 5 21:19:03 2014 UTC,No problem. I heard talks of DNS issues or possibly upstream providers.   There were rumblings this morning of a cyber attack (from a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend) but nothing was concrete.
Acadiana,2lekkm,Yohfay,6,Wed Nov 5 21:21:22 2014 UTC,I have to wonder if this was a random attack or if LUS was targeted for some specific purpose.
Acadiana,2lekkm,bruce656,8,Wed Nov 5 21:31:21 2014 UTC,"The question is not what the purpose of the attack was, but how much Cox paid to make it happen?"
Acadiana,2lekkm,kunstlinger,4,Wed Nov 5 23:20:55 2014 UTC,"if I had to guess, they targetted LUS DNS servers to participate in a DDoS DNS Amplification attack.  Most likely LUS was behind the times in terms of DNS hardening.  This let a botnet use their public facing DNS server to participate in the DDoS, which caused the server itself to basically get blacklisted (filtered by upstream), or simply cause it to run out of resources itself and fall off the face of the earth and become unavailable.

My friend says Grub Burger has delicious veg burgers. That portabello burger sounds great. We make those at home!  When we do burgers, we typically go to Burgersmith. I""m a big fan of their burgers and my SO gets the grilled cheese. It has like 4 diff cheese and she gets grilled onions on it. The fries there are amazing and they have good, local beer, so everyone is always happy.   Mellow Mushroom is a recent winner in my book. I'm happy (because pizza) and there are a lot of options for veg friends as well as gluten-free dough. Also, Saint Street Inn has delicious food that is veg and vegan, and draft beer is often $1.50 during the week. Oh! And there's a burger at SSI called the Saints burger that is ON POINT!"

However, I cannot fully agree with them due to some instilled right/wrong ""morality compass"" in me. I've accepted my ignorance and realized I may never understand it. In accepting my own ignorance, I understand why morality based laws can be hurtful to society.  These kind of laws are ""gut feeling"" laws and they are not healthy.    Same thing with marijuana.

Anyway, yes I agree; moral compass legislation should have no place in our laws. I feel the same way about pot legislation. I know plenty of people who have had their lives thrown completely off track by smoking too much, and legalizing it will only make that process that much easier.

You just voted against an act that would help redevelop blighted neighborhoods by making the sale of vacant or abandoned property easier.  You just voted against giving a homestead exemption to disabled veterans rated with 100% unemployability. Oh, and speaking of blighted neighborhoods, you also voted against making the purchase of certain property easier in the Lower Ninth Ward for people interested in re-developing the area.

Acadiana,2l9iu3,ChrisDeg87,2,Tue Nov 4 18:38:05 2014 UTC,So - still problematic (up now for the past few minutes). Call tech support - was number 7 in line. Person there said they had no known issues so she would forward me on. Now I'm in another freaking queue - number 8.
Acadiana,2l9iu3,This_Fat_Hipster,2,Tue Nov 4 19:52:38 2014 UTC,Noticed that several customers have experienced DNS issues with LUS today. This may be related to problems you guys are having.   Moral of the story: Don't use ISP DNS. Use OpenDNS (208.67.222.222 / 208.67.220.220) or Google (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4) and you'll be happy

There's no way this is not a service provider issue. If a customer service technical support person tells you that they are not aware of any problems then why can't I  even connect through to be placed on hold for another hour? Very poor service indeed. Looks like lus had their chance and they are blowing it.  I'm calling my old service provider tomorrow. It's just too bad no one from lus will see this thread. I doubt that they would care anyway.

Acadiana,2l2kje,22travis,0,Tue Nov 4 00:57:49 2014 UTC,FYI. UAV use for commercial purposes is currently banned by the FAA.
Acadiana,2l2kje,22travis,3,Mon Nov 3 01:31:19 2014 UTC,Thanks. I'm going to check into this before I do anything else. Wouldn't be good to have the university busted for some Homeland Security issue just because I wanted a video.

I've been following every move of the FAA concerning this for the past year on almost a daily basis. If it's not just for fun, or you are one of the six companies allowed to make money flying it goes against the rules. Read more here: https://www.faa.gov/uas/"

"" helping with scientific research and environmental monitoring by NASA and NOAA, supporting public safety by law enforcement agencies, helping state universities conduct research, and supporting various other missions for public (government) entities.

Acadiana,2l2kje,uzername_ic,1 point,Tue Nov 4 23:01:22 2014 UTC,"Jesus Fucking Christ. OP said: ""I'm the PR director at LSU Eunice."" It's commercial use, NOT research.

I don't know how big the batch was, but it's been a recent, albeit expansive problem. I experienced the same thing with multiple Envies around town. Here's to the next batch!"
Acadiana,2l00gw,acadiennes,3,Sat Nov 1 20:09:43 2014 UTC,Mystery solved!  Definitely looking forward to the next batch!
Acadiana,2l00gw,StephenFish,2,Sat Nov 1 20:37:58 2014 UTC,The same thing happened to me.  I bought a six pack a while ago and every beer was fucked up like this.  I then went to Heffe's and bought an Envie there with the same results.  I'm nervous to buy Envie ever again and it's normally so good :(
Acadiana,2l00gw,itsrattlesnake,2,Sun Nov 2 03:58:24 2014 UTC,I was thinking it was too much priming sugar.
Acadiana,2l00gw,cawkstrangla,2,Sat Nov 1 20:27:40 2014 UTC,AFAIK they only naturally carbonate bigger bottles and they are labeled as such.  I'm pretty sure they force carb their beer.  I think on the tour they said it takes 8-10 hours.  I could be wrong.  Maybe they just over carbed it. idk.

Acadiana,2l00gw,everettmarm,2,Sat Nov 1 20:45:51 2014 UTC,Heard of this with a couple sixers of canebrake also.  I think parish had a miscalc somewhere a few weeks ago.

If I drank it out of the bottle it was a bubble bomb in my mouth. When I did get liquid, it tasted like champagne. Super carbonated."

Acadiana,2kx7dt,Hormisdas,2,Fri Oct 31 22:00:39 2014 UTC,"I voted yes on all but amendments 3 and 5. I don't think the the gov't should use outside parties to be collecting taxes and I think that judges should have a mandatory retirement age. (I maybe would support increasing the age to 72 or 75, though.)  I do support CA 12, because it will diversify representation on the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission. We all know that north Louisiana is pretty different from south Louisiana, so I think this is a change for the better. CA 14 is simply fixing a loophole. I don't feel too strongly on any of the others, but for the most part, I agree with them."

I'm going to vote no on 11 and 12, and I'm abstaining from Orleans parish specific items, but outside that I agree with you."
Acadiana,2kx7dt,cdb3492,1 point,Mon Nov 3 02:34:27 2014 UTC,"Honestly, for the Orleans specific items, they should have excluded Orleans parish from those requirements when they wrote the Constitution. These kinds of proposals come up too much; Orleans (or those in power there anyways) always wants to be excused from some constitutional requirements.  I don't know why so many seem to be voting ""no"" on many of the items; they're not really detrimental. Maybe it's time for another Constitutional Convention: good ol' Louisiana tradition!"

Acadiana,2krb3a,rapcat,6,Thu Oct 30 13:09:23 2014 UTC,"I used to work at a casino that built a sports bar.  to be legally compliant, you basically have to pay per the building capacity (so if you used directv, and your facility can house 150 people per fire marshal, then you had to license for 150 people every month).  This may have changed in recent years, but it really is an outrageous cost every month, but it keeps you compliant with all sports leagues and broadcasting rights.  But, the big non profit NFL and Roger Goodouche can suck it, imo."
Acadiana,2krb3a,rd8t,3,Thu Oct 30 13:27:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah I used to work at Buffalo Wild Wings years back. People would always call to see if we had the boxing match on. When I would tell them no, they would want to pay for it. I would have yo explain that we would have to pay like $20(?)x seating capacity. Ofcouse they would blame me. Good thing I don't work in customer service any more."
Acadiana,2krb3a,louisiana_whiteboy,2,Thu Oct 30 13:58:17 2014 UTC,"People still watch boxing?  I remember in the mid 2000's around when MMA really hit mainstream.  Casino I worked at put on boxing events (because the guy handling promotions had a hardon for boxing and a bias to see that the popularity was fading).   Most of the attendance was comped tickets and a handful of hardcore fans.    I know if a business can afford to do direct licensing with a league for those events, they have potention to make money due to being able to resell officially licensed gear (casino I worked at, they had the sports bar license in 2005 for the post season and world series.  that was the year Houston played the white sox.  since the majority of that places customer base was out of south east texas, they made a killing.  Though the idea was to get and promote as an official venue for viewing the 2005 world series)"
Acadiana,2krb3a,rd8t,1 point,Thu Oct 30 14:12:49 2014 UTC,Well I still prefer boxing to MMA. Though I'm not big on either one. But boxing must still rake in money if Floyd Mayweather can get a 9 figure check for a fight.
Acadiana,2krb3a,louisiana_whiteboy,3,Thu Oct 30 16:57:43 2014 UTC,"It boggles my mind that a $9.5 billion dollar company, with a potential market cap of $46bil,  is exempt from Federal taxes. I'd love to know what they would pay in taxes, and what each franchise would pay. We could throw that at the US deficit, charity, build some roads, educate kids, etc. Not to mention that Roger Goodouce brings in $30mil+ on his own."
Acadiana,2krb3a,Guyote_,3,Thu Oct 30 13:54:05 2014 UTC,"The individual franchises make the money, and therefor pay taxes. The league itself makes no money; the money goes to the owners. To tax the league would be double-taxation."
Acadiana,2krb3a,rd8t,3,Thu Oct 30 14:04:53 2014 UTC,"Considering the patents, copyrights, licensing, etc the league owns, I'm pretty sure they get a cut.  They are the last of the professional leagues in the US to still be considered a non-profit."
Acadiana,2krb3a,rd8t,1 point,Thu Oct 30 14:08:38 2014 UTC,"Well, to be fair, the NFL is 501(c)(6) tax-exempt NPO because of their structure. A 501(c)(3) organization is reserved for charitable organizations. I think people get confused thinking that they are given the same tax code as churches and charitable organizations. That's just not the case."
Acadiana,2krb3a,GEAUXUL,3,Thu Oct 30 14:34:23 2014 UTC,"Interestingly enough, i bet churches and charitable orgs wish they had the following of the nfl.  or the tobacco industry"
Acadiana,2krb3a,louisiana_whiteboy,0,Thu Oct 30 15:00:41 2014 UTC,...which all goes to the owners.
Acadiana,2krb3a,rapcat,2,Thu Oct 30 22:27:47 2014 UTC,"And this makes the NFL different than other sports leagues how? The NBA, never tax-exempt. The MLB dropped their 501(c)(6) status in 2007 (so they wouldn't have to disclose executive salaries).   This, by no means, qualifies the NFL to pay member pensions directly from tax-exempt, 501(c)(6) revenue. There's a long list of things that the NFL gets away with, including NFL employees not paying taxes on hotels, restaurants, fuel, auto rental, admissions taxes, etc. The NFL itself pays executives, just like our employer pays us, and $50mil+ of those taxes need to be accounted for, so imo, there are grey areas and loopholes.   You don't have to agree with me, but know that I'm not talking out of my ass because I know IRS code for organizational operations with cooperative basis. I disagree with how it's collected because there's not enough transparency and it leads to big grey areas in tax law. I also think that the gov't can get more, deserved tax money from the NFL, NHL, PGA, and LPGA. My paychecks are damn near upside-down when it comes to taxes, so they can sure the hell pay what they owe from theirs."
Acadiana,2krb3a,louisiana_whiteboy,3,Thu Oct 30 14:27:52 2014 UTC,Wow. TIL we committed copyright infringement when all my friends put up money to get BBQ for our SuperBowl party in which we watched it on a projector screen in the shop.
Acadiana,2krb3a,rapcat,3,Thu Oct 30 13:48:17 2014 UTC,"Yes and no maybe.  IANAL but I think as long as you don't charge someone to watch the game and it's not a public viewing then you should be OK.  If you invite a few friends, you can charge for food and drinks.  I think there is also a provision for home use that covers screens over 55"" as well.    tl;dr:  Copyright law and football be dumb."

I have countless instruments, retro video game equipment, etc.   Pro Tip: If you're very active on the site, wait 6 days before paying. After 7 days, they relist it and you can get banned for not paying. However, if you win a handful of things from the same facility, they can ship them together and save you a ton of money.

Acadiana,2kmugr,This_Fat_Hipster,2,Wed Oct 29 07:30:00 2014 UTC,I used to bartend downtown. It's not really a heads up as much as hearsay. A lot of the time I would hear that ATAC was coming and they didn't.

I don't think the state police ever finished the investigation, or I've never heard anything more about it.   I will say that police have missed things in pay downs, especially when they're going quickly, and that many people are able to get their handcuffed hands to the front of their body from the back.   I'm not saying the cops aren't covering anything up, just that this report isn't anything new and this it is plausible that the guy could have shot himself."
Acadiana,2km4w7,AgainstLogic,3,Tue Oct 28 23:56:52 2014 UTC,I'm a tall thin guy and I could shoot myself in the side of my chest where this guy did with my hands secured behind my back. I'm not saying he did but if I could do it then maybe others could too.

Acadiana,2km4w7,d0pey,2,Wed Oct 29 14:39:52 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I'd did the same thing but used a stapler  to see if I could get that angle. It's definitely a stretch.

The trouble spots follow the growth. That's why traffic is so terrible on ambassador. We know through history that you can't build your way out of traffic.   Burying the power lines would make the grid safer, and would make Lafayette less of an eyesore."
Acadiana,2k3l25,rd8t,4,Thu Oct 23 19:42:45 2014 UTC,"While I completely disagree with your sentiment, I'm not sure I agree with the feasibility of the idea. I'm just not sure that Johnston could be widened any more. Furthermore, I don't think I would WANT a six lane road cutting though Lafayette. It would start to look like that miserable stretch of I-10 when you enter Metarie.
