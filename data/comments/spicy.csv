spicy,3e2fit,Leavesdoorsopen,6,Tue Jul 21 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"I can't view the recipe so this may be redundant but I've been making chili oil for a while.   For the oil I always use a neutral cooking oil, generally whatever is cheapest (this is generally soybean oil where I'm located at). I also put in sesame seed oil which gives a nuttiness to the flavor sort of like an amped up peanut oil.   I generally make it by throwing red pepper flakes (usually a ton, if I had to guess around a half cup or so to three or so cups of oil, I don't measure anything when I cook), a minced head of garlic, and several tablespoons worth of fresh ground pepper into the oil and set it to simmer very lightly for about 2-3 hours (low enough to prevent the pepper flakes and garlic from burning).   Once I finish with the simmering process (should be a nice bright red), I place some flake and a little garlic and onion powder in a jar of tempered glass and pour the still hot contents of the pot  into the jar using a sieve to filter out the cooked flakes and garlic.   The extra red pepper flakes add just a little punch of freshness and I let it sit for a couple days before using."
spicy,3e2fit,Cogito_Ergo_Rum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:49 2015 UTC,Not redundant at all! Seeing multiple ways to do it really helps me figure out how I want to make it myself.
spicy,3e2fit,JaggedOne,4,Tue Jul 21 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"I definitely would suggest sticking to vegetable or sunflower oil. Something scent less, unlike olive oil. Just gives it a weird flavor. As well, you can prepare it by just taking oil and the flakes and throwing them in a jar and let them sit for 3 days! Personally I take veg. oil and the flakes and add enough soy sauce and malt vinegar so that it's barely noticeable by taste, add chopped garlic, white pepper, and a very small amount of Asian spice salt. Can't say I've ever used peanuts or peppercorns though but not bad to try. Fresh green chillies aren't bad to throw in the pan for 30 seconds, I find. They get kind of crispy and have a smokey flavor for later. 10/10 condiment"
spicy,3e2fit,bulldog1602,4,Tue Jul 21 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah; you don't want to use olive oil for Asian cooking.    Sometimes you can find unrefined peanut oil at Asian markets, that's the best; it smells like roasted peanuts.  Personally I use canola."

If you're using fresh then you for sure want to put them in the boiling oil and roast them a bit to kill of bacteria, as well as storing it in an air-sealed container. However, I think the jarred garlic should be fine without boiling, no?"

spicy,3e2fit,Shovelware_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:04 2015 UTC,that Lao Gan stuff is the closest thing I have been able to find to the chili oil that is on the table at restaurants.    The jar stuff still doesnt have that crisper texture that the tabletop stuff does though. Is restaurant chili oil the way it is because it is made fresh on site like in this video?  Side note: the look of the guy on that label is just the weirdest expression.   Ill look at it from time to time and have never figured out what the expression is.

I haven't yet figured out why anyone would eat the stuff unless they were literally dying of hunger.  In the future, after you puree and cook the sauce, work it through a wire mesh strainer with a large metal spoon (by scraping back and forth) rather than using cheesecloth.  The wire mesh strainer will stop all the seeds and larger fibers, but the microfibers will still make it through, so you'll end up with a silky sauce.  If you use cheesecloth, you end up with a juice.  Then you're boiling and boiling to try to thicken."

spicy,3dttpn,Nordoisthebest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:15:31 2015 UTC,First time I got the Iguana I put it all over my omelet. I was eating LAVA. Now I use only a couple of drops and spread them really thin and I get the nice flavor and everything. No more eating lava.  Today I tried the Cayenne one and its really nice. Less spicy then the iguana but spicier then the Hellfire one.

Flavour profiles, L - R: Maga - garlicky, savoury, smokey, awesome, want to buy. 4/10 hotness, 9/10 flavour. San Luis - balanced, light sweetness and vinegar tang. 4/10 heat, 7/10 flavour. Llanera - best of the bunch, intense citrus flavour (no citrus fruits listed in ingredients list, so I'm guessing the variety of chilli used is responsible, if anyone has any info is love to know). Want to buy. 5/10 heat, 11/10 flavour. Yahualica - light hot sauce flavour, not too sweet, but heavier on the vinegar, standard hot sauce. I imagine would be favoured by the less seasoned chillihead. 3/10 heat, 4/10 flavour."

Next I add 1 cup of water at a time until all peppers are covered. I take the total volume of water and plug it into this calculator. It tells me how much salt to add, i use pickling salt and weigh it out with a scale, then add it to the fermentation vessel that has the peppers and water. Let it sit at room temp in the dark for 5-7. Make sure peppers are submerged in brine or in a vessel that doesn't allow air to get in Sauce day i add just the peppers/fruit and garlic to a blender and then add 1/4 cup of the brine solution from the bowl into the blender. I start blending at the slowest speed for about 10-20 seconds and then move to the next speed and so on until i get to the highest speed (for me it's the liquefy speed). I keep adding 1/4 cup of the brine until i get to the desired consistency, in this instance it ended up being 1.5 cups"

She said her family would use any local peppers they had to make it back home but the stuff sold in jars just use chili and cayenne but must use such a massive amount that it can be really spicy.  The kicker for me why I like it so much is that they put in dried fish and shrimp powder so it has a really unique taste which goes good with mostly anything from meats to vegetables to Domino's which I just had it with : )

The Blair's sauces near the top of the range have some flavour but they're overwhelmed by the flavour and heat of the extract.  When you're adding sauce to stuff by using a toothpick you're just using a stunt sauce because you can't possibly be deriving any flavour from that 0.05ml drop.  Get a less spicy, flavourful sauce and add a dollop, I say.  For fresh peppers, I had a Reaper and it was too hot too be enjoyable.  I'm glad I chomped it once to know what it was like, but the heat just went on way, way too long and it was hard to speak properly, let alone form coherent sentences, for well over five minutes afterwards.  Anything up to that I like fine but like I said above, these days I'll tend towards the lower heat stuff because I want more flavour than just the pepper flavour to come out in my food."

Even the absurdly hot pepper sauces, or just peppers themselves, are something I can handle because the flavor is still good. I guess the pain becomes worth it because it tastes so good.

I have two Moruga Scorpion plants and they have a nice flavor but I never just take a bite out of one like I do with Thai chili peppers.

As far as hot sauces go, I only do Sriracha and the milder stuff from the Latino ethnic store (The black and yellow Valetina, Guacamole Zaaschila).

Heat dissipated within a few minutes, wasn't uncomfortable or anything.

Just ate some habaneros with lime and salt on them, and Damn they were hot. I had two halved peppers. I got through the first half in a couple bites, it was pretty hot, but not too bad. I was recovering easily, but then I ate two more halves pretty quickly with the tacos I had in front of me, and the heat went way up. Now, I've had sauces that were technically hotter, but sauce heat doesn't last nearly as long. The heat from an actual pepper seems to find it's way to every spot possible and just lingers.  I felt very refreshed afterward, though. 10/10 would do again."

Current fashion encourages people to pretend they enjoy things hotter than they really do, and people ""push themselves"" to be cool.  All that notwithstanding, I do love very hot foods, and like most people here find that it's easy to go too far with things that use purified or synthesized capsaicin. Those are not very interesting.   A few years ago I was at a fancy Mexican restaurant / tequila bar in San Francisco that was started by Julio Bermejo, who was the very popular bartender at another then-hip tequila bar, and Julio, knowing that I was that guy who never found anything hot enough, offered me some shots of a habanero-infused tequila.  Drinking that felt like drinking shards of jagged glass - it felt as if it were cutting an tearing everywhere it touched as it went down, and when it hit my stomach it did not abate. That was the first time I ever had something where the heat made it truly offensive and overwhelming. It helped me to understand what folks really feel like who insist they don't like spicy food. What I felt then I would not wish on a living person. It was definitely not cool."

The instant I swallowed it though, my throat clinched shut. My face immediately went 100% numb from the nose down, and snot, spit, and tears drained out of their respective orifices nonstop for a good 10 minutes. I looked like Munch's The Scream because I was completely unable to control my facial muscles enough to close my mouth. I couldn't speak intelligibly because my tongue was entirely limp.

I certainly haven't tried all the hottest peppers in the world, but I haven't found a natural pepper yet that I hated. Currently my favorite hot sauce is Pain 95%; it's a good blend of flavor & heat.

spicy,3dom50,VainWyrm,2,Sat Jul 18 02:45:20 2015 UTC,Dehydrate the peppers first. Grind them into powder. Then use your typical marinade for the jerky. Lay the meat out in the dehydrator then sprinkle the pepper powder/flakes over the jerky. Keeps the flavor of the marinade while adding heat without the heat or peppers changing the flavor of the marinade. Unless you are looking to incorporate the pepper flavor into the marinade.

spicy,3dlmt1,SirNarwhal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:09:43 2015 UTC,I've had the habanero ones and was so disappointed that they weren't even close to being as spicy as the old habanero flavored chips that were out when that Godzilla movie came out a few years ago.
spicy,3dlmt1,StickySnacks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:49:33 2015 UTC,"Make sure you don't get the ones that say Frito Lay on them, it's like Sabrito or some other Mexican company that makes them.

spicy,3dlmt1,SirNarwhal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can get them here in the UK - the roulette ones are good, but I'd rather they were 90% spicy, and 10% cheesy instead of the other way around."
spicy,3dlmt1,Aqueously90,3,Fri Jul 17 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"I bought 2 bags of these, the first I found no overly hot ones.  Then I came here and someone said they're hot so I bought them again, they'd be less hot than franks."
spicy,3dlmt1,thongerrr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:33:02 2015 UTC,Each bag is different depending on how many spicy chips are in there. I got a bag that was over half spicy chips and as a result it was spicy as fuck.
spicy,3dlmt1,SirNarwhal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:42:27 2015 UTC,They're much hotter than tabasco. Depending on how many spicy chips you get in a bag it ranges from like habanero to scotch bonnet levels of spiciness. The bag I got was like half spicy chips and was most certainly on par with scotch bonnets and such.
spicy,3dlmt1,SirNarwhal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly I gotta admit this is the first like mass produced food product marketed as being super spicy, that was actually pretty spicy."

My two year old has happily eaten Roulette Doritos (thanks to my junk food junkie husband). Of course, he's probably got a higher tolerance than average because he was basically marinated in hot sauce in utero, but he's still TWO."

I have asthma, guess I better watch out next time I eat a commercially available spicy product. It might just kill me. Also, these aren't that hot - I'm not just saying that as a cool spice bro, they're just not terribly hot. About the same level as Tabasco, especially when eaten in conjunction with the cheesy ones that are also in the bag. Weird story.   In other news, those Roast Chicken crisps in the UK always make me feel sick. No warning on them either, can I get them out of shops?"

The flavors are:   Habanero White Cheddar, a classic white cheddar powder with a nice habanero flavor and a substantial kick. A good way to kick up mac & cheese too. Ghost Pepper Salt & Vinegar, an addicting tangy seasoning with a nice smokey ghost pepper flavor. It's also awesome on potato chips.   California Hot Saucce Expo Deals  I just got back from the California Hot Sauce Expo. Big hat tip to Steve Seabury of High River Sauces for putting on such an awesome event. All of his sauces are on sale right now - I highly recommend Foo Foo Mama Choo.   One of my favorites at the event was Cully's, based out of New Zealand. I was able to pick up two of their sauces, which are not available anywhere else in the US:   Kiwi Hot Sauce, a super unique fruit based sauce made with orange habaneros. Applewood Smoked Chocolate Habanero, a delicious smokey sauce with a substantial kick.   At my booth I was selling some of my favorites: Secret Aardvark, Hotmaple, Palo Alto Firefighters, Yin Yang, and The Abyss. One of the most popular was The Abyss, which is a rich chile sauce made of walnut and hazelnut oils, with roasted garlic and cayenne. Seriously gourmet stuff.  Other great vendors at the expo included  Bravado Spice, Humboldt Hotsauce, Lucky Dog, Pure Evil, Tabanero, and Oso Pepper Company. Can't wait for next year!    Our really low shipping rates:   Single bottles and chile powders ship for only $3.95. Up to 6 regular sized bottles ship for only $4.95! Never pay more the $9.50, no matter how big your order is.

Spice blends are really over priced to begin with and from experience I never found one that both tasted good and was spicy enough.  This was one of the most important lessons I learned when I started cooking more at home.  Fuck the hype and stock up on the whole ingredients.

I guess the overlap isn't enough to make a big difference for perception of actual heat.
spicy,3dipbd,hathegkla,0,Thu Jul 16 18:05:37 2015 UTC,Interesting stuff - thanks for posting
spicy,3dipbd,LuckyDogHotSauce,5,Thu Jul 16 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"I've definitely noticed it over the years. I used to just put crushed red pepper or sriracha on everything; eventually it got kind of ridiculous and I was absolutely burying my food in it, so I got a habanero powder and some hotter sauces. Those are becoming kind of tamer than I'd prefer lately, so I've since acquired a shaker of ghost pepper powder.   It's been a slow progression though. Helps that literally every meal I eat is spicy somehow."
spicy,3dipbd,unthused,4,Thu Jul 16 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's real - a Thai friend of mine needed to order ""Thai spicy"" and add about 1/2 C of Thai bird chiles to his food to feel anything.  The thing about tolerance is that it's like weight lifting - if you eat the same level of spice all the time you'll maintain the same tolerance. If you push yourself by periodically elevating the heat, you'll find that when you get back to the norm ""jalapeño/Serrano"" levels you'll be less effected by them."
spicy,3dipbd,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Thu Jul 16 19:08:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely real.  In a few years I went from being unable to tolerate a few jalapeno slices from Subway on my sandwich to topping probably 75% of my meals with crushed habanero and loving it.  It takes a special jalapeno for me to even notice any heat these days.  Once you build the tolerance, you get a chance to experience the flavors of the spicier peppers.  I find the fruitiness of habanero is my favorite.  Do you do anything to cut the heat (like drink milk), or do you just let your mouth simmer in the pain until it subsides?  My tolerance grew pretty quickly by just letting the heat sit until I was ready for more.    I believe the tolerance is localized - the biggest surprises are when the hot stuff gets to places that it normally doesn't reach.  Ever sneeze while eating something with a moderate level of spice?  The burn you feel in your sinuses is pretty crazy compared to what you feel in your mouth.  Or if you get some at the back of your throat, that's always uncomfortable."
spicy,3dipbd,KovaaK,2,Thu Jul 16 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"The tolerance is real but I think it varies from person to person. This is the first year in like 5 that I haven't grown my own peppers (ghost, jalapenos, habeneros and usually one wildcard) and I can feel the difference but that's just me."
spicy,3dipbd,hamilted,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with that as well - just like alcohol or drugs will be more or less intense person to person, same with capsaicin."
spicy,3dipbd,LuckyDogHotSauce,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"Tolerance happens, but your mileage may vary. I thought Tabasco was incredibly hot when I was 5. I was blown away by habaneros when I was a teenager; now they're standard fare. Extract sauce (Dave's, Blair's) took my breath away in the '90s; now I regularly eat Dave's Insanity. I can only eat a few drops of something like Flashbang, and I don't have an urge to have much more, but I could imagine getting accustomed to that too if I worked at it. I have friends and relatives, however, who like spicy food and who have come a long way from jalapeños, but who still suffer hiccoughs or problematic posterior burning if they go much hotter."
spicy,3dipbd,Cvilledog,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"If you keep eating the same heat level foods in the same quantities, your tolerance will creep up very slowly, if at all depending on frequency.  To really increase tolerance, I found I had to push my limits. A particularly face melting experience left me with a significantly heightened ceiling for spice tolerance."

Then add some more onions in towards the end of the cooking process so they're still a bit crunchy. That way they're still awesome.

spicy,3d9naz,LuckyDogHotSauce,5,Tue Jul 14 21:47:18 2015 UTC,You've got to have some kind of meth kitchen type ventilation when you're doing that.  I've fried up Serrano's before and had to evacuate for 15 minutes.  This...this is insane.

spicy,3d9naz,liamt07,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:40:28 2015 UTC,I read the ingredients but do you just put them in a pot together then blend after?   I have some reapers and I want to do more than just add them to salsa.  Raspberry reaper sounds neat.

His site should be updated to direct all his traffic our way by the end of the month.    Edit: These arrived this morning, so we should be good on NW Elixirs inventory for a while."
spicy,3d7m56,RealHotSauceBoss,4,Tue Jul 14 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, but if you're not doing order fulfillment, including production and shipping, too, I'm not sure that that will help the problems OP experienced, no?"
spicy,3d7m56,snark_nerd,7,Tue Jul 14 14:36:25 2015 UTC,Sorry. Guess I wasn't clear enough. We will be handling 100% of all his fulfillment including wholesale. If he runs into any other production problems it won't be a problem for us. The site doesn't allow back orders. You can only buy what's in stock.
spicy,3d7m56,RealHotSauceBoss,5,Tue Jul 14 15:04:27 2015 UTC,"Cool - as long as I've got you, can I also ask, will you be handling communication with buyers? That, to me, is the biggest sin of what OP described (if it is true) - everyone can run out of product when they're first starting out and get a sudden influx of new customers (although he probably should've accounted for it better), but there's no excuse for not responding to customer inquiries. Will you help that part of the problem?"
spicy,3d7m56,snark_nerd,4,Tue Jul 14 15:17:19 2015 UTC,Absolutely! We are very attentive to customer inquiries. There's a contact tab on every page of the desktop version of the site. I get a copy of every communication submitted via that contact form.
spicy,3d7m56,RealHotSauceBoss,22,Tue Jul 14 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"I have also sent this in a personal email to the customer but would like to share the conversation and publicly apologize for my poor customer service.   Good morning. I am very sorry that your experience with NW Elixirs has been a poor one. I am even more disappointed with myself that it took a reddit post for me to respond to you, I am not sure how you slipped through the cracks with me but you did and that is not okay. It is truly unacceptable customer service, which we try and be exceptional at. I will be totally candid with you here, I screwed up big time. Over the last four years of running this company I have not had to work through a huge influx of orders as I did following the airing of Chopped. I was completely overwhelmed and my ego didn't want to admit I couldn't handle the orders at the time and be honest with customers. I made the poor decision to try and rush all of my production and pretend that there was not an issue. I also made the mistake of not communicating with my new customers such as yourself. It is only myself running the company and I simply wasn't ready or prepared for the orders. I realize had I just sent an email or made a phone call I would not be writing this email now.   I am truly sorry for the experience you have had in this process. I want to extend you a full refund, send you a new set of sauces as well as a shirt, hat, hoodie. I know that this is not going to cover your let down but I hope it goes a little ways towards letting you know that I am so very sorry that I made this mistake and that you and all of our customers are very important to me. Without people like you ordering from us I wouldn't be able to do what I love. It was never my intention to pull the wool over anyones eyes. I would love to make things right with you and please let me know if there is anything else I can do to rectify this. Additionally, I would like to ensure you that since this incident I have figured out how to handle my increased demand and maintain a full stock of sauce so problems like this one do not arise in the future."
spicy,3d7m56,NWElixirs,9,Tue Jul 14 16:25:20 2015 UTC,"That's a heck of an apology - stand up guy.   For what it's worth, I've met Andrew several times - excellent sauce maker & a really nice person.

Running out of stock is a sign that you're doing things well. However, may I suggest that if/when you run into this issue in the future, you just mark things as 'out of stock'?

I don't get why people think that's an acceptable way to treat customers. It also floors me that someone can act that way and still be as seemingly successful as that guy is(winning awards, being on Chopped, etc.)  Also, there are a number of great people on this sub that sell sauces if you're wanting to make it up to your husband. I've only bought from pexpeppers but the customer service experience with them is about the absolute opposite of what you described. I've seen similar positive reviews for some of the other sellers on this sub.  I'm also sad I don't have cable/satellite anymore and missed the hot pepper episode of Chopped. I love that show but haven't seen that one, hah. I do remember one episode where they had ghost chiles in the entree basket, that was fun.   edit Should be noted I posted this before the updates about him fixing it. Glad all is right now."

spicy,3d9q6e,jollyn,3,Tue Jul 14 23:48:20 2015 UTC,well the plants will only grow as big as the roots will let them. Once the roots are stuck and can't grow anymore the plant stalls and stays that size because it can't uptake any more nutrients than it already is.  you can trim any branches that are getting too big or spread out for your fancy it won't hurt the plant. You can even trim the main stem but you need to leave a few nodes (places where the leaves / branches come out) so it can grow something.

His sauces by themselves are amazing. In fact, they are so good that my wife, who is not a hot sauce person, has fallen for them and now I gotta fight her off all but the black and pink labels.   If that wasn't enough, Scott himself is such an awesome guy that even if his sauces had sucked I believe his personality and passion alone would have swayed us to buy from him. Both my wife and I are honored to have been able to have dinner with the man and his right hand helper Sity.

spicy,3d5r9m,generic_redditor_78,3,Mon Jul 13 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"If your Caribbean style carrot based hot sauce is a little too thick, that's probably an easy fix.  Once the sauce is seasoned and done, work it through a wire mesh strainer using a large metal spoon.  This will strain out the larger fibers and bits of seeds, but the microfibers will make it through.  The sauce will be silkier and a bit thinner.    Adding xanthan gum isn't going to make your sauce thinner; it will gel and stabilize it, making it even thicker.  When making a carrot hot sauce, I think it helps to cook the carrots for a very long time.  Something happens chemically to carrots when they are overcooked that makes them taste almost buttery.  I think this complements the flavor of habaneros.  I've left a batch of carrots in a slow cooker overnight, and after 8 hours, the aroma was perfect.  The onions, garlic and chiles certainly don't need to be cooked for so long.    You can add spices to the sauce in small amounts.  I've used dry mustard and basil.  Even ground coriander and cumin.  And allspice is a Caribbean spice, so that's a natural.  I think the secret is to use a light hand, so these flavors are on the threshold of taste.  And finish with cane vinegar or sherry vinegar, rather than white vinegar."
spicy,3d5r9m,Cdresden,3,Tue Jul 14 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"Xanthan (or any other) gum will thicken the sauce.   I'd advise using more water if the acidity is good, or more vinegar if too base.   The key is to thin the sauce out while keeping the pH below (ideally) about 3.5 or lower.   4.15 is the legal limit, but that's pretty high and risky as a shelf-stable pasteurized sauce. Recommend 190 degrees for no less than 8 mins for proper pasteurization. Hot pack & invert to sterilize. Works great.   If you love the flavor of your current recipe, try juicing the carrots to reduce the fiber from them. That'll thin the sauce without losing the flavor as well.   Good luck with your hobby - I did it for 8+ years and loved every second of it. Making sauce on weekends was how I reduced the stress of my day job.   For great sauce making advice I'd recommend checking out thehotpepper.com - they have a sauce making forum, and both pros and hobbyists have contributed heaps of advice, basic recipes, etc for both pasteurized & fermented sauces.   Cheers  Scott"

spicy,3d4xw1,Merendino,3,Mon Jul 13 15:41:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly for best results go to the store and pick up 6-8 good sized habaneros.   Dice them & toss them in with the wieners & BBQ sauce.  Stew it up for 6-8 hours & that will be plenty hot. It won't be extract hot, but the flavor will be better and they'll give you a very respectable burn."
spicy,3d4xw1,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Mon Jul 13 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"I like to add some ghost pepper hot sauce that I made to store-bought barbecue sauce. You can easily substitute habaneros, but scale back the sweet ingredients because habs are less spicy than ghosts. The main idea that I think goes best when cooking with really hot peppers is to add some sweetness to the ingredients to tame the spiciness a little bit.   My hot sauce recipe was; ~9 ghost peppers, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2c. shredded carrot, 1 large ripe peach, 1c. apple cider vinegar, 1/3c. rice vingear, 1T salt, 1/2teaspoon cumin, 2T Honey. Remove stem, cut peppers in half & leave all flesh and seeds in pepper. Simmer all ingredients for ~90-120 minutes. Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth like a sauce.  Add that hot sauce to some simmering BBQ sauce of your choice and taste it until you think it's hot enough, and taste good. I spent some time living in NC, so I also like to add vinegar & mustard to my BBQ sauce to make it a little tangy."

spicy,3d4xw1,2hardtry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:23:55 2015 UTC,"This seems like a no-brainer to me.  Just make sure you use a quality barbecue sauce, e.g., Stubbs, Bone Sucking Sauce, etc., rather than cheap shit like Sweet Baby Rays, Kraft, etc.  Mince up some fresh habs and add to taste.  Maybe add a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic (not garlic powder). Puree if you want.  Let it cook down a bit to soften the chiles.  Use Insanity Sauce if you don't want to change the flavor profile of your barbecue sauce."
spicy,3d4xw1,sglville,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:23:28 2015 UTC,"If you want spicy sauce and have a Trader Joe's nearby grab the ghost pepper grinder and add to your sauce.   If you want to do something interesting stuff the sausages with habanero slicez or inject them with sauce.  If the sausages are hot enough you can use regular BBQ sauce to give the eater a false sense of security.  If you want to go all out then stuff,  inject,  and spike the sauce :)"
spicy,3d2cc9,MarkMerrill1102,16,Sun Jul 12 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"Congrats! That was the CaJohn's booth, and I'm proudly wearing my wristband for finishing it as well. I have to agree with you, that Get Bitten sauce at the end was murder. They use 6 million SHU extract in it according to the CaJohn's site. I was just fine with a half a Carolina Reaper over at Puckerbutt's, but that extract sauce man, yeesh!"
spicy,3d2cc9,Jaeflash,4,Mon Jul 13 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"I couldn't remember the name, thanks for that."

That shit was pretty darn hot too, I was hurting more from those than anything else at the expo. Had to gulp down 2 grapefruit ales to calm the flames!"
spicy,3d2cc9,Cdresden,16,Mon Jul 13 05:33:08 2015 UTC,The real tragedy here is that you had to order a root beer float to induce vomiting.  A root beer float should be a height of the summer.
spicy,3d2cc9,NekkidSnaku,6,Mon Jul 13 00:05:33 2015 UTC,I originally bought the float to help with the burning. I hadn't had a drink in roughly four or so hours. I'm probably going to make another one tonight to make up for that.

spicy,3d2cc9,Jaeflash,21,Mon Jul 13 00:58:51 2015 UTC,Having straight extract? That's a pretty stupid thing for an exhibitor to do.
spicy,3d2cc9,JJG,14,Mon Jul 13 00:40:44 2015 UTC,I'm not arguing with you there.
spicy,3d2cc9,PirateOwl,6,Mon Jul 13 00:47:41 2015 UTC,"It's not straight extract, it just uses extract in the sauce. A lot of it though. It's CaJohn's Get Bitten sauce. There was one booth selling straight extract though in liquid and powder form. You couldn't try it straight though."
spicy,3d2cc9,hihowrudoingtoday,7,Mon Jul 13 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they have that CaJohn's one at my local shop. They keep it in a back room along with the other extract sauces. You have to be 18 just to go in and they insist you sign a waiver before purchasing anything.  Screw that  Extracts scare the shit out of me."
spicy,3d2cc9,Jaeflash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:10:49 2015 UTC,Dude they're so amazing though. I mix some CaJohns with my favorite extract-free scorpion pepper sauce. The extract is a fucking mean bite but the scorpion covers the chemically taste. It's excellent and is fun to destroy myself and friends with!
spicy,3d2cc9,hihowrudoingtoday,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:38:29 2015 UTC,"You could! If you mean Texas Creek (the liquid)... they had some mixed in things like frosting, but you could get a drop on a spoon if you wanted of both the 1.5 and 9.6. It wasn't terrible, since it absorbs slowly and the drops are small... getting a big spoon of some of the hotter sauces there was actually worse.  There is a reason to try it straight tho... to check their claim that unlike standard extract used in sauces it has absolutely no taste. Its true and sort of impressive actually."
spicy,3d2cc9,Jaeflash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:23:47 2015 UTC,"Was it bitter at all? All extract stuff I've tried has this really acrid, bitter aftertaste to it."
spicy,3d2cc9,krebstar_2000,3,Mon Jul 13 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"No, really 100% tasteless like a drop of water. That's why I thought it impressive... since extract sauces all have a very noticeable revolting taste to me. I don't know how common extract is made, but this was just capsaicin powder dissolved in alcohol/water I think. I assume it isn't some technological breakthrough, just that the powder is more expensive to produce. Anyway I didn't think I would be into it, but it seemed like it could actually be pretty useful so I got a bottle of 1.5."

spicy,3cvvnk,PAdogooder,8,Sat Jul 11 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"Avocado Green Chile Sauce  This is a pretty versatile sauce.  It can be used as a dip for bread or bruschetta.  Or you can toss it with hot pasta, then garnish with chopped tomato and shredded parmesan, and maybe top the pasta with grilled fish or chicken.  Or grill some teriyaki chicken skewers and use as a dip.  Because of the acid from the vinegar, it won't keep its color longer than one day, so it's best used the same day it's made.  2 poblano chiles 2-4 jalapenos, to taste 6 cloves garlic 1/2 bunch cilanto 1/2 bunch flatleaf parsley 1/4 cup sherry vinegar 1 avocado, diced 1 tsp salt 1/2 tsp ground cumin 1/2 cup olive oil   Fire roast the poblanos and jalapenos, using a gas stove, a propane torch or a grill (or you can use the broiler of your stove if that's all you've got).  Place the chiles in a small bowl, cover with plastic and let rest for 10 minutes to let the steam loosen the skins.  Peel by wiping away the skins with a paper towel.  You don't need to get rid of all of the skins; little bits of blackened skin will taste fine.  Combine all ingredients except olive oil in food processor, and puree into a smooth paste, scraping sides as necessary.  With processor running, drizzle in olive oil in a slow stream to make sauce."

Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of bacon fat.  Puree the bacon and the 2 tablespoons of bacon fat with the rest of the ingredients until relatively smooth.  ───  Spicy Cheese Bread  Split a baguette or some French rolls; spread both sides with Habanero Bacon Mayonnaise.  Sprinkle both halves with thinly sliced green onions, then top with a mixture of shredded sharp cheddar and shredded Swiss cheese.  Bake at 400F until cheese is fully bubbling and edges of bread begin to brown.  Cut into fingers and serve with marinara."

Heat up a dry skillet on medium high without any oil until quite hot, then add the corn.  Toast the corn without oil, stirring constantly, until it is browned and caramelized in spots.  Remove corn and clean skillet.  Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots, garlic, ginger, serranos and zucchini and saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high and add corn, tomato and green onions. Cook until most of the juices evaporate, 5-8 minutes.  Add sugar, vinegar, sriracha, salt and pepper and cook until zucchini is tender. Remove from heat and add cilantro. Adjust seasonings as necessary. Use in burritos or as a garnish with grilled chicken or meats."

But Brown or Pink? All day.   Appreciate the feedback. Agree about Red - hands down my most versitile. Medium sweet/heat balance..I use it on everything."

spicy,3ct7mg,berhamporian,3,Sat Jul 11 05:53:21 2015 UTC,"typically pepper sauces won't have an expiration date.  They have a ""best buy"" date.  anything approaching and/or over that date, you start to lose some of the flavor composition.  I have bottles of sauce that are over 2+ years old, and they start to taste cardboard-y.  The vinegar starts to take it's toll and the sauce is generally not THAT good.  When I have my products made, each comes stamped for 2 years POST fill date.  So bottles filled on 7/29/2014 will be  ""best by"" 7/29/2016"

That said, if you try a drop on your finger you'll probably be able to tell if it's bad without suffering ill effects.  You should be able to taste the ""wrong"" even through the heat.

spicy,3ct7mg,celticwhisper,2,Fri Jul 10 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"If it was bottled properly, it's going to still be safe after 2 years.

spicy,3cnst3,Aesthenaut,0,Sat Jul 11 01:08:03 2015 UTC,"ive used homeopathy since i was born its worked great, as for crystals i have healed many things with them. its a matter of oppinion but as far as me an my wife are concerned garlic isnt good for ur cum so why eat it..."
spicy,3cnst3,BrckT0p,3,Fri Jul 17 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"Two chili peppers? The salad may be tasty and have obscure ingredients, but I have a bag of chilis in my freezer, and I eat them whole and raw regularly.  I find they impart a nice flavor to a gin and tonic."
spicy,3cnst3,billbob100,3,Thu Jul 9 15:49:04 2015 UTC,It's traditionally bird's eye chili which is around the same scoville level as habanero. Plenty hot for most people.
spicy,3cnst3,PaintsWithSmegma,3,Thu Jul 9 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"Thais that I've eaten out with use double that most often and sometimes more.  Also it really is insanely spicy when prepared at this level of spiciness.  Before I left for Thailand a few dishes in various places would seem spicy to me.  Now the only dish that seems spicy to me, even within Thailand, is this one.  This is far and away the spiciest thing I've eaten after living in Thailand for 5 years."
spicy,3cnst3,BrckT0p,2,Thu Jul 9 19:08:07 2015 UTC,I learned to make this dish in Thailand. 2 chili's is foreigner spicy. Thai spicy is 5 and it'll make you sweat. Thy have a bunch if different types too. The salted blue crab version is intense.
spicy,3cnst3,mrcleatus,2,Thu Jul 9 21:09:36 2015 UTC,"Well you can certainly take a man size portion of 10-20 chilli then bro, what's stopping your pussy ass? Just get the bag, mash em up an eat em down. Stop being such a big girl, an why are you drinking gin!? Fagot. You need some real mans drink that put hairs on your chest."
spicy,3cosph,TxSurfer,3,Thu Jul 9 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"Here's a good resource: http://umaine.edu/publications/4385e/  Basically, as long as you are using only dried ingredients, you heat the oil to 180, pour over ingredients, store in cool dark place for up to 3 months.   Adding fresh ingredients is where it gets risky."
spicy,3cosph,heathotsauce,2,Thu Jul 9 17:41:41 2015 UTC,Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin is destroyed by heating to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for longer than 5 minutes.
spicy,3cosph,KnowsTheLaw,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Not the toxin, the bacteria that creates it. You can't get rid of  the toxin with heat."
spicy,3cosph,KeavesSharpi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"Botulism is more of an issue with root vegetables such as garlic and onions.  The bacteria prospers in anaerobic conditions, like those found in canned goods that haven't been completely pasteurized, or when fresh garlic is preserved in oil.  With chiles and other fruits, botulism is less of an issue.  When I make chile oil using dried chiles, I'll take the oil and chopped chiles up to just above the boiling point of water, to about 220F.  Because there is still a small amount of moisture in dried chiles, at that point you'll see very tiny bubbles coming off.  I hold it at that temperature for a minute or two, then let it cool to room temp, then cover and let steep at room temp overnight.  Then strain.  The problem with heating the oil to its smoke point is that oil denatures at high heat, significantly shortening its shelf life.  It also changes the flavor of the oil.  The best quality oil infusions are made by adding ingredients to oil without heating.  But then it takes weeks for the flavors to infuse.  When I make a garlic infusion, it's important to heat the oil to about 270F for 10 minutes to kill any botulinum (the spores are notoriously heat resistant).  Since this higher temperature is going to partially denature the oil, I only use a small amount of oil, and load all the chopped garlic into that.  Then after cooling, I mix the strained oil back into regular oil to achieve a good dilution."
spicy,3cok0e,taarshing,2,Thu Jul 9 14:49:33 2015 UTC,Oh man he looked like he regretted that huge spoon of sauce. Nice review though.
spicy,3cnscp,BKMurder101,7,Thu Jul 9 10:02:01 2015 UTC,"So I know you didn't really ask for this, but one of my favorite things to make with a bunch of habaneros is Jamaican curry chicken  See this link for a good recipe.  Instead of adding hot sauce to the batch, I actually de-seed two habaneros and mince them up and toss them in with the onions and saute them before making the sauce."

spicy,3cnscp,Zygomycosis,4,Thu Jul 9 17:15:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you just dice them up and toss them in the dip, on a pizza, etc.  It's a good idea to wear gloves when working with chiles, and the capsaicin oil from the inside of the chiles is going to get on the knife and the cutting board, so wash those well before you take off the gloves.    Freeze any chiles you're not going to use in 2 weeks.   ───  Basic Superhot Salsa  This is a good test sauce for getting an idea of just how hot 1 superhot chile can be when blended into 2 cups of sauce. It's a good general purpose condiment for chips, potatoes, eggs, etc.  1/2 onion, chopped 3-4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 Tb olive oil 1 fresh superhot chile, halved 1 14-oz can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, with juice salt to taste sherry vinegar, to taste, or cane vinegar, rice wine vinegar, cider vinegar   Saute onions and garlic in olive oil until onions are softened. Add chile and tomatoes with their juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then puree. Add salt to taste, then add vinegar to taste."

spicy,3cnscp,Stevenberries,3,Thu Jul 9 11:33:16 2015 UTC,"All store-bought sauces are cooked during the canning/bottling process to sterilize the sauce.  The fresh salsas sold refrigerated in 1 lb. containers aren't cooked, and have a limited shelf life."

spicy,3cnscp,gaedikus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:36:30 2015 UTC,Seconded.
spicy,3cnscp,Zygomycosis,3,Thu Jul 9 17:16:10 2015 UTC,Definitely wear gloves. I once picked my nose hours after I had cut habaneros (plus washed hands) and the burning was unbelievable. I've also gone to pee and really lit a fire on Harry and the Henderson's. I've learned my lesson the hard way (twice).
spicy,3cnscp,donkeyrocket,3,Thu Jul 9 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"I may be the odd one out here, but when I make nachos (in the case of what you're asking) I just cut 'em up and put them on top of my nachos (seeds and all) before cooking them in the oven. Couple this with a drizzle of Sriracha (it's tasty stuff and you all know it) and you've got some wicked hot grub coming your way. I find that by oven cooking the peppers it gives the heat a chance to move into the nachos as a whole and you get the overall spicy effect in each bite.   If you're real ballsy you can also cut up the pepper, extract all the seeds and sprinkle them over the nachos as well as the pepper slices so that you have more coverage. Like others have mentioned, you'll DEFINITELY want to have gloves on when working with peppers of this level."
spicy,3cnscp,Mutasyn,2,Thu Jul 9 14:55:52 2015 UTC,"Like others have mentioned, you'll DEFINITELY want to have gloves on when working with peppers of this level.   WTF? I cut and dice habaneros all the time with my bare hands, then just rinse with a splash of water. Zero issues ever.   This fall, I'll have my first harvest of a variety of super hots. Still won't be using gloves. Will probably still lick my fingers after..."
spicy,3cnscp,Tsilent_Tsunami,2,Fri Jul 10 08:03:48 2015 UTC,"I made a sauce with about 10 ghosts, no gloves or anything. But I touched a kettle after messing with the chillies and about 10 mins later my wife used the kettle.  She then started feeling a slight burning sensation on her eyes and nose that increased with time until it was unbearable to her. It turns out she used a tissue to blow her nose after touching the kettle.  Had to wash her face with milk to help her out.  Later, when I took a very hot shower I could feel some burning on my fingertips and cuticles."
spicy,3cnscp,archimedesscrew,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"The above is only based on my experience with habs. Once my super hots come in, I'll have to see how that goes.   Glad your wife is okay. I can see how it could be bad if you don't realize you have super hot chili oils on your fingers, then touch your face or eyes."
spicy,3cnscp,Tsilent_Tsunami,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:13:03 2015 UTC,Isn't your method SUPER hot?  I like hot but straight up habanero seems a little too much.
spicy,3cnscp,Zygomycosis,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"Rubber gloves: yes. Always a good idea when handling higher capsaicin level peppers. The dried/smoked varieties are usually less intense (don't know what you're using) but it's safer. I'd advise making a batch with one deseeded pepper, used whole as a flavorant. Seeing as it's a cheese sauce, the dairy will help counteract the capsaicin. After that, keep experimenting!"
spicy,3cnscp,smechile,2,Thu Jul 9 12:02:20 2015 UTC,Wash your hands with dish soap after cutting them. That should get rid of the oils on your hands.
spicy,3cnscp,curly123,2,Thu Jul 9 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"No need for gloves, people are just messing with you. Just wash your hands after. Try a small piece so you know how many to use. Let us know how it turns out, I want to try this later."
spicy,3cnscp,borkborkbork69,0,Thu Jul 9 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"No need for gloves, people are just messing with you.   Or there are a lot of highly sensitive people here. With habs, I just rinse with a splash of water, and it's all good."
spicy,3cnscp,Tsilent_Tsunami,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:06:40 2015 UTC,For  nacho cheese I would probably run some peppers through the mini food processor and chop till fine.  Scoop out the chopped up peppers and mix them into your cheese.  When I make my habanero hot sauce I wear safety glasses and nitrile gloves and open the windows in the kitchen.
spicy,3cnscp,sglville,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:33:54 2015 UTC,Can we get a recipe on your current nacho chili cheese recipe it sounds delicious and i would like to try.
spicy,3cnscp,Water-Truck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"3/4 big block of Velveeta cubbed or a whole block of real cheese shredded. 1\4 can condensed milk. Two cans of chili or just as much homemade chili, either works. Either a roll of sausage cooked and broken up really fine or a half pound of ground beef browned. As many diced black Olives as you have and then peppers. Last week I used refried beans instead of chili but it was a little plain. Just melt the cheese together with the milk and chili on the stove top in a pot then add everything else and let it cook together a bit. Never stop stiring though. The stuff will scorch easy, especially if you use real cheese. If you put too much milk and it's thin just add more cheese."

spicy,3cnscp,burnzio,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:01:59 2015 UTC,"I would just dice up a couple and toss them in, if you want to use more take out the seeds and membrane(white stuff). Keep in mind these are literally 100 times hotter if not more then a jalapeno. Just take that in for a minute. A fresh jalapeno runs from 1000 to 4000 SHU, a fresh habanero runs 100,000 to 350,000 SHU. That being said sounds like you enjoy dancing with the devil occasionally and I think you are going to like what comes out."
spicy,3cnscp,tomkitty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't cook them down. just dice them up, layer some on top of them nachos and voila! delicious. although i do agree with others comments that yes, wear gloves while you're handling them. getting that stuff in your eye hurts"
spicy,3cnscp,Mutasyn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"Well, if I'm not sweating, cursing, and coughing a bit from the heat, I feel like I'm not getting the amount of spice I enjoy.   It's like this burger I had a couple months ago during Burger Week in Halifax. It was called the Hellfire burger and was composed of the meat, scorpion pepper aoli, jalapeño relish and a habanero milk bun. Now, you'd think I'd be dying and screaming for relief, but it just wasn't hot enough for me. The heat was there, but the kick in the face spice I was hoping for was just lacking.   That being said, I love heat and need a lot of it when it comes to certain foods."
spicy,3cnscp,Mutasyn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:49 2015 UTC,It's more or less a precaution for those who might rub their eyes by accident or something similar.

spicy,3cnjgf,JamoJustReddit,6,Thu Jul 9 07:52:04 2015 UTC,"What type of sauce are you making?  What, in general, is your recipe?  There's no sense in just simmering the raw chiles (and other vegetables) when you can roast, sear or grill them first.  When you simmer vegetables, they can only get to about 220F.  If you roast, sear/saute or grill them, they can get much hotter, caramelizing some of the sugars and creating a depth of flavor."
spicy,3cnjgf,Cdresden,2,Thu Jul 9 10:45:14 2015 UTC,"I basically throw a bunch of stuff in a blender with various vinegars then jar it.  Thought goes into everything, but I've never gotten too complicated.  I'll grill the chilies and maybe the onions this time.  Perhaps I'll add some tomato.    Thanks for the tip!"
spicy,3cnjgf,rushmc1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:48:49 2015 UTC,Cook it on the stovetop or microwave it (20 min or so).  Better flavor.

spicy,3cnjgf,ninthinning01,2,Sat Jul 11 13:20:54 2015 UTC,"Grill or smoke the peppers. If grilling, you want a slight char on the skin. Add loads of salt, maybe loads of sugar or bits of fruit. Saute the onions til caramalised. Ive had some pretty good success doing the above."
spicy,3cnjgf,MarshingMyMellow,2,Thu Jul 9 13:24:28 2015 UTC,Try fermentation.   I ferment all peppers before making hot sauce.   This should eliminate the raw flavor.
spicy,3cnjgf,woodsnwine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:32 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are using vinegar, maybe let it sit and ferment for a week or two. Should mellow out the raw pepper taste."

spicy,3cmco3,ch00d,2,Thu Jul 9 00:56:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on how many you have and how much time you would like to put into it, you could dehydrate the pepper and crush it up into a powder. I use powdered super hots (mostly scorpion) on/in a lot of things. Spaghetti with pepper powder is awesome."
spicy,3cmco3,strangepope,2,Thu Jul 9 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"I made ribs with the only fresh hot (higher than habañero) pepper I've had my hands on. I took a bit of rufus teague's 'touch of heat' bbq sauce, put it in a separate jar with the diced bhut, shook it up, and let it sit for a few hours. I cooked a St. Louis cut of pork with a dry rub in the oven for 3 hours at 350F, took it out, then covered the ribs with the sauce. Put them back in the oven on the top shelf with the oven turned up all the way, (about 500F, but leave the door cracked open) and watched until the sauce started bubbling and caramelizing. Awesome."
spicy,3cmco3,Chortsor,2,Thu Jul 9 05:32:30 2015 UTC,I'll have to try this! Thank you!
spicy,3cmco3,Chortsor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:24:43 2015 UTC,"It's super important that you physically stand at the door when they're under the broiler for the last step, and watch the sauce as it heats up. It takes a little while to get to the delicious bubbling stage, but if it spends too much time at that stage the whole sauce part is pretty bad.   One other thing I forgot to mention is that the ribs should be inside a closed foil packet during the 3 hour oven stage. This keeps all the fat in and helps with the flavor (and clean up). Then, you drain the fat from the foil before adding the sauce.  I really like this recipe, it's not my invention, but I hope you enjoy it."
spicy,3cmco3,Cdresden,2,Thu Jul 9 07:27:16 2015 UTC,"Hot sauce is the go-to, because then you can use that in any recipe you want.   But another great idea is hot honey.  Mike's Hot Honey, for instance, is based on a South American recipe.  It's not just a chile honey infusion, it also contains vinegar.    Chop up some fresh chiles and add to honey in a pot.  Heat the honey up to about 180-200F, then turn the heat off.  Let it cool for an hour or two, then cover and let it steep overnight at room temperature.  If you want, you could add some lemon zest, but I'd do that after it comes off the heat.  The next day, in a nonreactive pot, reduce some type of vinegar, maybe about 1/4 the quantity of honey.  Reduce that by about 3/4.  I'd recommend using a lightly flavored vinegar, like cane vinegar, rice wine vinegar or cider vinegar.  To that add a small pinch or two of salt.    Then to taste, add the reduced vinegar to the honey.  Then strain.  Mike's Hot Honey is used as a garnish on a sopressata pizza called the Hellboy at Paulie Gee's in NY."

spicy,3ccv4c,monotonousmaterial,3,Mon Jul 6 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"Here is a spice rub I use for barbecue and occasionally for the grill:  3 Tb salt 3 Tb cracked black pepper 1 Tb brown sugar 1 Tb onion powder 2 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp ancho chile powder 2 tsp New Mexico red chile powder 1 tsp cayenne 1 tsp dried oregano 1 tsp dried thyme 1 tsp rosemary powder 1/2 tsp ground ginger powder 1/2 tsp ground celery seed   It uses pure ancho chile and New Mexico red chile powders.  If you can't find New Mexico red chile powder, you can substitute a good Hungarian paprika like Szeged.  I don't use chipotle powder or other smoked ingredients in barbecue rubs because the food is being smoked anyway, but if you're using the rub on grilled/seared/baked items, smoked chile powders can still have some utility.  If you want to smoke some chiles, the best way to go is to cold smoke them and then dry them in a dehydrator.  If you try to smoke chiles at 200F+, you're limited on the amount of smoke you can put on the chiles.  They can cook quickly and you can burn them if you smoke too long.  Chiles cold smoked and then dried taste better than chiles hot smoked and then dried.  I recommend you get a product like the A-maze-n smoker. It burns chips or pellets, and you can convert any smoker, grill or cardboard box into a cold smoker.   If you don't have a dehydrator, the next best thing is to dry them in an oven set on warm with the door propped open with a spoon handle.  When grinding chiles to flakes or powder, use a spice mill.  Position it on the stove, with the hood vent  turned on.  Unless you have a dedicated spice mill, it will make your coffee taste hot for a couple weeks."

spicy,3cb112,jgonz85,3,Mon Jul 6 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"I don't, but you could start with cayenne, corn meal, flour, and habanero/ghost pepper powder.   I'm not going to assume you know anything, so the basics are that Nashville hot chicken, unlike buffalo wings, use their breading and not a sauce for the heat. It happens that it's harder to make things really hot when they're mixed with flour.   Soak the chicken in buttermilk laced with your favorite hot sauce. Dip in the breading, cover well (maybe have two dips in each for a real good coat). deep fry- probably 350 or 375 for 10-12 minutes. Consult a fried chicken recipe for more details.   This is what I would do if I was cooking in my own kitchen. Feel free to downvote if I went way off the ranch."

Agave Sweet & Spicy has a nice sweet agave flavor with a hint of chipotle peppers.   Heat level is on par with regular tabanero.   Extra Hot has double the amount of habanero peppers and has a nice burn.  Same great flavor as regular tabanero but with a kick.  Highly recommend both flavors and I will definitely purchase a case of extra hot.

spicy,3c56xy,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:50:25 2015 UTC,"Magnesium deficiency (plants):       Magnesium (Mg) deficiency is a detrimental plant disorder that occurs most often in strongly acidic, light, sandy soils, where magnesium can be easily leached away. Magnesium is an essential macro nutrient found from 0.2-0.4% dry matter and is necessary for normal plant growth.   Excess potassium, generally due to fertilizers, further aggravates the stress from the magnesium deficiency,  as does aluminium toxicity.   Magnesium has an important role in photosynthesis because it forms the central atom of chlorophyll.  Therefore, without sufficient amounts of magnesium, plants begin to degrade the chlorophyll in the old leaves. This causes the main symptom of magnesium deficiency, chlorosis, or yellowing between leaf veins, which stay green, giving the leaves a marbled appearance. Due to magnesium’s mobile nature, the plant will first break down chlorophyll in older leaves and transport the Mg to younger leaves which have greater photosynthetic needs. Therefore, the first sign of magnesium deficiency is the chlorosis of old leaves which progresses to the young leaves as the deficiency continues.  Magnesium also is a necessary activator for many critical enzymes, including ribulosbiphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), both essential enzymes in carbon fixation. Thus low amounts of Mg lead to a decrease in photosynthetic and enzymatic activity within the plants. Magnesium is also crucial in stabilizing ribosome structures, hence, a lack of magnesium causes depolymerization of ribosomes leading to pre-mature aging of the plant.  After prolonged magnesium deficiency, necrosis and dropping of older leaves occurs. Plants deficient in magnesium also produce smaller, woodier fruits.

Because at the end of the day, eating spicy is for your own enjoyment, and if eating spicy more and more to build tolerance seems like no fun, don't do it."

spicy,3bvu14,RevLoki,2,Thu Jul 2 16:38:16 2015 UTC,It's interesting to see this because I was already thinking about making a sauce with ghost peppers and honey as two main ingredients. I always put honey in my salsa and it's excellent. I'm just going to have to wait for my plants to grow.
spicy,3bvu14,ruiner8850,2,Fri Jul 3 01:01:17 2015 UTC,That is brilliant if it's hot enough to balance. Next up ghost pepper sugar please. And then ghost pepper sugar lemonade.

spicy,3bvu14,lunarmodule,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I think you want to use ripe chiles rather than green for lemonade (the ripe ones can be dried, e.g. chiles de arbol).  Green chiles have a grassy flavor and are tart and slightly bitter.  Ripe chiles have developed sweetness + converted  that tartness and bitterness into lots of new flavor compounds."

spicy,3bvu14,Mcmacladdie,2,Thu Jul 2 20:41:29 2015 UTC,I think I could really enjoy the flavor this way.. The honey would really subdue the heat and keep the flavor.

spicy,3bvu14,bookfoxx1987,2,Thu Jul 2 17:59:41 2015 UTC,It's quite good. I've been putting it on everything. The honey definitely subdues the heat so it's not painful. I can actually enjoy the heat AND the flavor for once without dying.
spicy,3bvu14,CookInKona,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:02:37 2015 UTC,Is this actual ghost pepper honey? As in honey from bees that only pollinate ghost peppers?   Or is it just a ghost pepper flavored honey?   They're very different things as far as food products are concerned

Like when people say ""how can you taste that food with all that Tabasco sauce""... uhh this is some weak crap but it's all they got at Applebees and all I can taste is vinegar.  Once your mouth gets used to a level of heat you can taste your food. It stays that way all the way up the Scoville scale."
spicy,3bn8j8,avtomatkournikova,2,Tue Jun 30 16:23:53 2015 UTC,Right but it seems like ghost peppers are more neutral than habaneros at least.  I'm wondering if hotter peppers have a more defined flavor than ghost or are also neutral?  I could see putting ghost pepper in ice cream... Not so much with habanero.
spicy,3bn8j8,avtomatkournikova,8,Tue Jun 30 16:28:57 2015 UTC,"Habaneros go great in ice cream, also in cookies... citrus marmalade, jellies and sweet sauces.  Ghosts are different than other superhots, they actually have a good annum-like flavor to them. Once you get into the Trinidad origin peppers (scorpion, 7-pod, etc and their derivatives (Reaper, etc)) they taste more pungent, earthy and somewhat of berries or pomegranate. Fatalii from Africa have a defined citrus flavor.  So no, heat is separate of flavor both in effect and taste. It really depends on where the pepper is from and what family/genus/pheno it is from."
spicy,3bn8j8,blankblank,2,Tue Jun 30 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"This is true, but even when I eat food hotter than my tolerance I can taste it. One time I ordered a dish at a Thai restaurant and asked them to make it as hot as possible (and not just tourist hot, the real deal). It was so hot that every forkful was excruciating, but I ate the whole thing because it was also goddamned delicious."
spicy,3bn8j8,MercilessShadow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:31:27 2015 UTC,"True, but Dave's Insanity is really spicy yet it tastes horrible. Put it in anything but soup, chilli, or ramen and you might only be able to taste the Dave's."

When I was a kid I built a fume hood with friends for fun.  I could always construct one to work with an initial batch, dissolving it in grain alcohol or something, but I think that scares her even more that I would need to be that careful."
spicy,3bn8j8,nuez_jr,5,Tue Jun 30 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yikes! Working with powders in the home is bound to lead to...incidents. Better to start with a liquid or paste, for peace of mind.  What if you make your initial preparation outdoors? You can get away with simpler apparatus that way."
spicy,3bn8j8,mlong14,2,Tue Jun 30 16:31:14 2015 UTC,As is I work with powders and have for the last 2 years... I would really only be willing to make a solution with capsaicin since it would be hot enough to start.   Have you used capsaicin before?  I am definitely interested to hear experiences with it.

Given how even capsaicin extract sauce is strong enough to fire up dozens of servings of food at a time, I'll cheerfully say ""no thank you"" to mixing my own brew out of pure ingredients."
spicy,3bn8j8,mlong14,2,Tue Jun 30 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"Do you grow peppers to grind or make hot sauce? If not, maybe you should. My boyfriend grows Trinidad Scorpions, ghost pepper, and Caribbean Reds in his garden. This way you can mix them up and make your own batch. He dries them in the oven and grinds them in a coffee grinder. I prefer to make them into hot sauce. Of the 3 peppers, I prefer the Trinidad  because of the flavor like the other posts says it does have a fruity taste. The hot sauce is easier to manage. My BF tried making Jerk Chicken with his powder and it was inedible in my opinion. He said he only put one tablespoon but c'mon. Yikes."

Some of the Carolina Reapers will be headed to a local restaurant, a friend of mine is a chef and has a customer who likes VERY spicy food.  Some will be used to spice up other items I'm growing in the garden and plan to can/preserve, such as pickles, purple galaxy carrots, and tomatoes.  The Thai peppers will be made into a homemade Sriracha sauce along with some of the garlic that is growing in the garden.  The Ministry of Agriculture Scotch Bonnets will be made into traditional Caribbean sauce, Carolina Reapers and 7 Pot Primos will be made into their own sauce, and I'll probably end up drying the rest of the peppers to keep. I've also been toying around with the idea of making the White Bhut Jolokia peppers into a white hot sauce, but I haven't found a suitable recipe yet. I also plan on bringing some of the hot sauces and dried peppers to a local food co-op that I belong to.  The members get together once a month to do a 'food swap' to trade homemade food goods."

spicy,3bdfru,dubnobasswithmyhead,2,Sun Jun 28 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"Nice. I find if you dehydrate a proportion it really amplifies the actual flavour (probably the heat too, but definitely helps with the pepper taste) Edit: if dehydrating, deseeded quarter peppers are about right, as smaller slices tends to blanche it too much. After thoroughly dehydrating, use a mortar and pestle to roughly crunch them to a powder. Such a concentrated taste it is incredible."

Specifically, area under cultivation, yield per square foot, research you've done on various growing techniques/spacing/fertilization/and etc.   For example: I assume you maintain a stock/mother room and all the plants we see in the pics are clones? Or you're doing tissue culture? Would be interesting to hear the details of that. What kind of production are you getting from your stock plants? What's the setup like? Stuff like that."

spicy,3b3fol,sglville,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:27:14 2015 UTC,"What is your audience? Are they are ""Buffalo sauce is just right"" kind of people or ""I just ate a whole jar of pickled hab's and loved it"" kind of crowd? You'll need to be catering to a crowd full of absolute pepper heads if you want to consider using this (or if it's a spicy challenge kind of deal)  It wouldn't hurt to use it if that's the case, but use caution. You are in effect putting pepper spray into your sauce. No more than a couple of drops for a full mixing bowl. Honestly in my opinion, extract sauces have a ""chemical"" taste to me that isn't enjoyable."

Yikes.  If you want something that actually tastes like the Wendy's stuff you should go with something like what someone else suggested above -  a 4:1 ratio of ranch to habanero sauce.  If you're going to go the ghost chile route anyway, you should start with maybe half a seeded ghost chile.  You can always add more if you want to."
spicy,3aus54,debtsetradio,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"figures it's mostly a cheap, readily avaialble commercial product they already have.  Try this: Take a bottle of ranch and mix it 4:1 with a hab sauce or other pepper sauce of your choice.  You'll get the creamy taste, texture and flavor of the ranch with some nice heat that won't kill you.  No major fast-food restaurant will risk having a customer sue because ""grandma's mouth got hot"" after eating something.  This is most frustrating because these big companies tell you  you're eating habs or ghosts, but in fact, are eating mostly cayenne pepper or jalapenos with a very, very low lose usage of the actual chile pepper they advertise."

spicy,3aqoun,Tsilent_Tsunami,2,Mon Jun 22 18:59:44 2015 UTC,Not a professional grower as some of the pepper heads here will respond. but I'd expect you'd have to get at least 150$ worth of heating /growing equipment and an entire spare room.  Depending on sunlight availability or if you have a porch.
spicy,3aqoun,Pranks_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"Anyway I can grow indoors?   Of course. The economics are unlikely to be in the positives for pepper plants (vs certain regulated plants), but you could easily have several hundred square feet of hot peppers growing in your facility. Google 'indoor gardening' to get started, and at least visit http://thehotpepper.com/forum/109-grow-tech/ for some fairly amateur discussions.   Had my first indoor gardening store back in the 80s, and have built and installed many indoor setups. Average cost for a professional installation is in the neighborhood of $30-$80k, but with a non-regulated plant like hot peppers, you could slash that to a fraction. (Note there is a certain minimal level of equipment required to maintain full control over your outcome.)  Keep in mind that successful indoor growing requires you to create the optimal environmental factors the plant most desires. The correct degree of heat, radiation, gasses, and chemicals, in the right concentrations, and at the right times, will result in success. All of the equipment, materials, and knowledge necessary to accomplish this are currently available, so to reiterate the above short answer, Yes.    Assuming you don't have a background in either growing or indoor growing technology, there is no short instruction on how to do this. Do a lot of googling, and watch 'indoor growing' videos on youtube. Depending on where you live, there may be a helpful local gardening group that focuses on hydroponics and/or indoor growing. Anyway, good luck, whichever way you go!"
spicy,3aqoun,nagaviper,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:37:14 2015 UTC,As long as your not planning on farming i do not know why this wouldn't be simple enough.

As for eating foods like lemons, lemons have citric acid, but don't increase stomach acidity once metabolized.  I'm not sure if they have the reverse effect (some things I've read say they do) but it's not going to hurt you."
spicy,3atha8,LuckyDogHotSauce,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:28:21 2015 UTC,"Milk is a good one.  Baking soda was already mentioned.  Acidity doesn't come from the capsaicin, it comes from the vinegar and citrus (and some sauces add citric acid as well)   Your negative effects can also be caused, or exacerbated by the kinds of foods you're putting the sauce on. Greasy heavy food can upset your stomach as much as the sauce. Together they're like gasoline and a zippo lighter. ;)"
spicy,3atha8,LuckyDogHotSauce,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:47:43 2015 UTC,I don't eat dairy so that's no luck for me.  And my diet consists of a lot of fried veggies. Maybe some more oven love would work. How is oven + oil vs pan + oil?
spicy,3atha8,theclaw9999,2,Tue Jun 23 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"Frying is much, much greasier for sure.   For veggies, steaming is the best way to combat high acidity - I usually like my veggies al dente (a little crunchy still)   But yeah - if your diet consists mostly of fried food, it's more likely that than the hot sauce that's messing you up."
spicy,3atha8,ethurmz,3,Tue Jun 23 15:11:49 2015 UTC,"Medical student here who thinks spicy food is the food of the gods. So, as far as the actual spicy components causing long term damage or effects, there doesn't seem to be any evidence to support that. As far as the acidity goes, the main thing to worry about is acid reflux.  Its not that spicy food causes it, bit rather can cause it to flare. Beyond that, there are a few over the counter things you could try: any H2 blocker (rantidine), a PPI (omeprazole), or something like taking pepto before you indulge and some glorious edible fire. If you do not have any acid reflux symptoms, ie excessive or longterm heartburn, food coming back up, feeling like your throat is burning especially at night, or rare/ more severe issues related to ulcers such as vomiting blood, severe stomach pain associated with food ... i wouldn't worry about it too much. Maybe try drinking some milk with it? Alkyline water? (Tho most of the benifits they market sound like pseudoscience and BS to me)   So try some things for yourself, have fun with it. Your millage may vary. Consult your doctor if you start spewing fire from anywhere cause that would be bitchin to see."

In the short term you can try some Pepto-Bismal or the like. In the long term you can learn from your mistake!  Start with something light, like a jalapeno. Or a roasted poblano! Better yet, start by adding spicy spices to your food, or using hot sauce, or incorporating mild peppers into your food. As you get used to it then you increase the heat if you like, and eventually you'll likely love using habaneros and all in your diet. There's no need to go 0-100 on this; the goal is to like the food not to force yourself to consume it and power through stomach pain."

A few others like the delicious 'Matouk's' line of sauces are certainly thicker (more gel-like due to the the higher % of xanthan gum, etc..).

spicy,3ajjaa,Disasturbator,2,Sun Jun 21 15:52:13 2015 UTC,That's an interesting idea - it would certainly dilute it a bit and just add some sparse char bits to the chili. Good call - I'd be interested to hear how that turns out.  :)

spicy,3ajjaa,LuckyDogHotSauce,3,Sun Jun 21 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in the other topic about this sauce, i believe it's a regional style - not one I'm particularly a fan of, but in a handful of taquerias I've seen small bowls of this type of sauce on the salsa bars.   To me it's very carbony/burnt tasting - like extra charred.   I have to assume some folks like this style, because el yucateco has been making sauces for a while and this is the only really odd one in their lineup. I was pretty surprised they took on such a niche flavor profile as their ""special reserve"" - while I'm sure some like this stuff, I've yet to actually meet anyone who does."
spicy,3ajjaa,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Sun Jun 21 06:31:34 2015 UTC,The hot sauce itself is black. It is on par with heat with the mayan yucateco. It's smokey and kinda bitter.

spicy,3aek49,homer-pimpson,7,Fri Jun 19 16:26:04 2015 UTC,Incredibly gross. Gagging gross. It must've been something wrong with the sauce b/c others on here liked it.
spicy,3aek49,Daolpu,9,Fri Jun 19 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"It's been ages since I ate PH but the SO saw something on a commercial so we ordered. I was surprised to see a few spicy options on their menu. There are other spicy bread sticks that I'll try next time and something called quepapas which are deep fried potatoes, cheese and jalapenos. At least worth a try. The skinny with a kick pizza has a thinner crust than their pan pizza so it allowed for the burn of the peppers to come through and not get soaked up in the dough."
spicy,3aek49,Daolpu,6,Fri Jun 19 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"quepapas    I get these now and then! They're definitely tasty but the spice is very very mild, at best. That's coming from someone who's maximum comfortable heat is habanero. It's a faintly smokey spice. They're comparable to tater tots in size, but much softer."
spicy,3aek49,Daolpu,5,Fri Jun 19 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"Are they lamer than the ""ghost pepper"" fries from Wendy's? They were a huge disappointment."
spicy,3aek49,rvlution,4,Fri Jun 19 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"It's about as spicy as one or perhaps two droplets of Tabasco on a tater tot. I've not had the ghost fries, but the heat is comparable to their spicy chicken nuggets. I'd think national chain restaurants aren't going to have menu items that alienate a significant portion of their customer base due to the spice. I couldn't see things getting too hot!"
spicy,3aek49,RULINGCHAOS,3,Fri Jun 19 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"The Fiery Doritos Locos have a good kick to them. Add a few packets of the new ""hot"" sauce and I think it's as good as you'll get for a national chain. But man... the first time someone puts a true spicy item on their menu I'll be hooked for life. Or until my buds burn out."

I think maybe a chili recipe and sub chicken broth w/ coconut milk and add curry paste.  Any ideas on a recipe combination between the two?  This is definitely something I'm interested in experimenting with as I fancy them both."
spicy,3agx0o,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Sat Jun 20 05:30:33 2015 UTC,"Mixing chili con carne and curry sounds like an idea with a lot of potential to be poorly executed.  It reminds me of the type of American recipe that mixes Italian and Mexican, yet uses cheddar cheese, an ingredient that's not found in either cuisine.  Adding ginger to chili would be a bad enough crime; adding coconut milk would destroy it for me."

A Mexican booth at one of my farmers markers uses cheddar & jack on their enchiladas and they're phenomenal.    That said, I am in agreement about the ginger in chile con carne - though I could certainly see attempting a fusion chile con carne with a curry undertone - basically a Thai bean & meat dish would be the result. It wouldn't be ""chili"" though."

I am still finalizing everything and the feedback I received (from the survey, PMs, and emails) has all been super helpful. Thanks to everyone for the comments!   Everyone who got samples will get a early release email, and they should be officially on sale by the CA Hot Sauce Expo. I am trying to reduce the sneeze factor (by ensuring the pepper powder particles don't get any smaller than they need to be), and I'm also working on ensuring there is no clumping and that it flows well. There also may be some even hotter ones in the works ;)"

spicy,3abxyq,heathotsauce,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:51:11 2015 UTC,The powders were very good... but... i feel like it was difficult to measure how much to add... and/or..... i felt like pouring the whole package on a single serving of popcorn... maybe meet with some coke dealers to cut the product to last longer (/sarcasm/fact).... maybe worthwhile to incorporate pure capsicum into your product to extend the heat and usability of ur product??

spicy,3abxyq,heathotsauce,3,Fri Jun 19 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"The cheddar flavor is a bit light, but I may need to simply use more of the powder. Powdered habaneros are hard on the nose and make me sneeze easily but this isn't too bad. I wonder if popping the popcorn with the cheese added last second before it popped would aid in liquefying the powder to keep it on the popcorn and not floating around in the air to be sniffed.   Heat is great and I think this is on the right track. As with most powdered cheese, I wish it was more cheesy. Some companies use a bit of bleu cheese to up the flavor profile. Maybe this could benefit. Hope that helps! I haven't tried the Aji Amarillo yet."

Of course, I prided myself on being able to handle spice...so I said ""alright, give it to me!""  Anyways, I bought it, tasted it once, drank about 2 gallons of water, and have now left that salsa uneaten save for the first bite, as a reminder to myself...about something"

I had some time to this weekend so I decided to make it from scratch.  If the process in the album looks too involved for you, you can substitute:   Canned whole tomatoes for the oven roasted tomatoes Canned green chiles for the roasted poblanos and habaneros Chili powder for the reconstituted chile sauce (note: IMHO this is the one step makes the different between OK chili and amazing chili)   Adding ghost chile flakes was a really easy way to dial in the heat level I wanted.

spicy,39z6se,teddywhite11,2,Mon Jun 15 23:48:47 2015 UTC,When you sear the meat would it help to sear the meat in waves almost so you have more surface area and make sure everything sears evenly?
spicy,39z6se,micahmass,2,Tue Jun 16 14:04:05 2015 UTC,"If you want the meat to sear and not steam, yes."
spicy,39z6se,teddywhite11,2,Tue Jun 16 14:19:58 2015 UTC,"Probably.  I'm actually not convinced the searing is entirely necessary.  I think the main function is to render some of the fat.  The meat cooks so long its basically braised, so I'm not sure how much the eveness of the initial searing effects the outcome.    I'll give it a shot next time though.  My grandma's version had you coat the meat in flour and Chile slurry before searing.  I actually forgot about that step."

spicy,3a02c2,Stormygeddon,6,Tue Jun 16 04:17:16 2015 UTC,"Spicy foods are really healthy. The only drawbacks tend to be the potential to aggravate preexisting conditions like heartburn and ulcers (but to be clear, they don't cause ulcers).  Preservatives are a separate issue not really related to hot sauce. The majority of sauces don't have preservatives (vinegar acts as a natural preservative). Huy Fong Sriracha does contain potassium sorbate and sodium bisulfite, so if preservatives are a concern you could easily avoid it. Xanthan gum, a relatively natural thickener, is pretty common in hot sauce but I don't think there are many concerns about its safety unless you have serious digestive issues.   One other consideration would be sodium content- most sauces are completely fine in the 20-60 mg range, but I've seen some go well above 100 mg. If sodium is a concern for you, that's something to keep an eye on.   Overall, you have nothing to worry about :)  Edit: a word"

Almost all the kids in middle school used to slather their square pizza slices (bet most schools have awesome pizza/lunches now days..) with huge globs of ranch dressing. I think most would copy-cat..try to fit in with everyone else with this 'practice'. They would 'butter' the pizza like bread with the ranch. It was nasty looking because it would smear all over their mouths/gather in the corners of their lips and get all stringy, and then proceed to drip down their fat fingers - putrid looking. The smell too- the cafeteria smelled like ranch and bleach..EVERYDAY!! The air tasted of it! I eat ranch (raw veggies or made into a dip..etc..) but not in pizza! To each their own.. Thanks for the memories, even if I cringed.. ;) Cheers!!"

spicy,39nosu,Hallucinosis,2,Sat Jun 13 10:43:35 2015 UTC,"Cayenne pepper:       The cayenne pepper, also known as the Guinea spice,  cow-horn pepper, red hot chili pepper, aleva, bird pepper,  or, especially in its powdered form, red pepper, is a cultivar of Capsicum annuum related to bell peppers, jalapeños, paprika, and others. The Capsicum genus is in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is a hot chili pepper used to flavor dishes. It is named for the city of Cayenne in French Guiana.  The fruits are generally dried and ground, or pulped and baked into cakes, which are then ground and sifted to make the powdered spice of the same name.  Cayenne is used in cooking spicy dishes, as a powder or in its whole form (such as in Korean, Sichuan, and other Asian cuisine), or in a thin, vinegar-based sauce. It is generally rated at 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville units. It is also used as an herbal supplement, and was mentioned by Nicholas Culpeper in his Complete Herbal, 1653, as ""guinea pepper"",  a misnomer for ""guiana pepper"".

spicy,39l397,vbern,3,Fri Jun 12 14:07:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting study, but as the data appears to be correlational (full disclosure, I only read the abstract) there might be a third variable that better explains the relationship, like culture or hormones. European cultures have more puritan influence on female sexuality and eat less spicy food. Increased testosterone influences competitive behavior, which plays a part in some of the reasons why people eat spicy food, and even though women have significantly lower levels of testosterone than men, it's still present and plays a role in sex drive.  I think there's way too many variables to draw any conclusions."

spicy,39l397,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Fri Jun 12 15:03:57 2015 UTC,"Fascinating.   As I personally work 7 farmers markets a week, I can attest that I have an equal or greater number of female customers to male. Further, and contrary to popular belief, I have noticed a trend where women more often can take it hotter than the men who accompany them.   In my experience this also has a lot to do with cultural upbringing - e.g. customers of Indian descent can take it very hot, regardless of gender.   Now, it's certainly possible that the women who can't handle the heat masturbate less frequently....I generally don't get to that level of detail with my customers, so I couldn't really speak on that aspect. Interesting theory though."

Both are excellent showcases for the floral, fruity notes of the pepper.   I've seen some reviewers complain about the sweet quality of these sauces, but in my opinion you need a sweet component to really highlight the flavor of this pepper, and balance the heat.   Both of these sauces are in my fridge and I enjoy them quite a lot.   Best of luck!   (dunno about Amazon - that's not my thing...but you can call around to the hot sauce shops in the country to see who has what - I'd start with Heat in Berkeley since they have great inexpensive shipping options, and you can throw a bottle of my Black Label Moruga Scorpion sauce into the cart while you're there. :D )"

spicy,39h3zv,lunarmodule,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:25:15 2015 UTC,"I tasted them all today on saltines a few times each. Overall they are very much Louisiana hot sauce which isn't necessarily a bad thing if that's what you are looking for. Each has a unique flavor and none were bad but none were complex or my new favorite sauce.  The jalapeño and habanero were my favorites of the bunch.  I like a mild green sauce sometimes especially on nachos and this sauce was exactly what I expected. The habanero had a lot more heat than I expected. Its not Dave's insanity heat but much hotter than standard Louisiana or Tabasco sauce.   The roasted and red chili sauces were similar tasting with the roasted sauce having a bit of red bell pepper flavor. Heat was mild like regular Louisiana as both sauces seemed to be a slight variation of that. edit: the red chili sauce is good on tacos  The chipotle and garlic sauces were also mild heat but the flavors didn't seem as good/bold as other similar sauces. I think Tabasco makes a better chipotle and Cholula makes a better garlic sauce.   Overall still a good buy for $6.99. I will keep a few here and scatter the rest at work, family, and friends houses. Going to taste again tomorrow just to be sure I didn't miss anything. edit: After a few days I am enjoying these sauces a little bit more for what they are, a variety pack with a sauce that can go on anything you happen to be eating."

The hardest part, for me, was to avoid smoking while drinking, but by simply cutting back on time spent in bars and only drinking around nonsmokers for a little while, I was able to overcome that. I still get cravings when I'm drunk, but it's easy enough to avoid picking up a pack. One awesome thing about smoking that you may notice is that food starts tasting a lot better after a few weeks! So even though you have to give up spicy (at least for a little while), everything you eat will become more delicious!  One piece of unsolicited advice is to find a physical activity you truly enjoy (even if you suck at it!). It's all well and good to go to the gym 4x per week and grind out 25 minutes on the stairmaster or a half hour in the weight room, and some people are truly satisfied by that sort of workout. However, for a lot of people, going to the gym feels like a chore rather than a fun activity and is therefore difficult to stick to long-term. I've personally found that I've been much more able to make a commitment to fitness since I started mountain biking. I realized I hated huffing and puffing and wheezing my way up hills while my buddies waited for me (or didn't) at the top. I started running to keep my weight in control and improve my cardiovascular fitness since I don't always have time to ride on weekdays. I still drink a bit too much and could probably eat better, but it's a start.  Lots of people in this thread are telling you that vaping pot is probably OK, but honestly I wouldn't fuck with that if your doc advised against. Vaping may be less irritating but it will likely still be irritating. Doctors aren't the fun police and really do typically have your best interests at heart. I'd suggest exploring edibles instead if you want to keep getting stoned."

And your body has an immune response to irritants that you may not want.  Maybe after the real problems clear up, spicy food can come back"
spicy,391q7b,jadraxx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:44:25 2015 UTC,"Weed? It's probably not. I have GERD, Gastroparesis, and several really bad food allergies. I had to stop eating peppers for a good while because of all if it. The first doctor I went to when I first started getting super sick and was ending up in the ER blamed it on marijuana (mind you I also live in Denver, CO) and said it was a case of cannaboid hyperemesis and literally told me I was wasting her time and she kicked me out of her office. Took another 8 months of absolute misery and pain and about 15lbs of weight loss to go back to another because of how insulted I felt by the first doctor. I'm 6'2"" and I was down to 118lbs. Many many tests and over 2 years later I'm finally back to climbing, hiking 14ers and eating jalapenos and using sririacha as ketchup again. Sorry for the rant, but I just have a really bad taste in my mouth from doctors blaming health issues on marijuana like that.     Get your body running like a well oiled machine, then start throwing the spicy fire back into the mix.    Hammer, nail, head, etc..."

spicy,391q7b,jollyn,3,Mon Jun 8 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"What did the doc say about drinking water, and how much do you drink a day?  I don't have your problem but since I started drinking 1~2 gallons a day I have almost no issues with heartburn or indigestion.  You also need to cut out cokes/carbonated beverages down to one or none per day."

I understand why the Doc would tell me to quit, it's what he's supposed to do. He also said that vaporizing really wasn't much better if at all. I don't really know enough about that to argue with him.   I dunno. I kinda feel like I should just quit all that shit, start running and exercising and become a health nut."
spicy,391q7b,jadraxx,8,Mon Jun 8 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"He also said that vaporizing really wasn't much better if at all.   This statement would lead me to a second opinion, I have a hard time trusting the opinion of someone who is willing to either A. Lie or B. speak on a matter he is uneducated on."
spicy,391q7b,OmnomVeggies,3,Mon Jun 8 19:18:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, it may be what he's supposed to tell you. And that claim that vaporizing is no better... Kinda bogus, shows he's not knowledgeable. It's great you're open with your doc, but I would get another opinion. I've been in the er and urgent care the past few days and have shared my vaporization (for stomach pain relief, and aiding appetite- I might have ulcers or could be a gall bladder issue) with every doc I've encountered and none of them have opposed. They've even so much as said it was ok.  You definitely could become that health nut! That would be great. But don't completely rule out vaporization based on one doctor's word."
spicy,391q7b,sosl0w,0,Mon Jun 8 20:43:04 2015 UTC,From my person experience it sounds like your doctor doesn't know what he's talking about with marijuana. The problem is unless you live in a medical area it's going to be hard to find any doctor that isn't going to shit talk marijuana and use that as a possible excuse of why you're getting sick. What I would try doing is stopping everything while you get back in shape. After a good month or two of good routines pull out the ol' PAX and give it a good rip or two and see how it makes you feel and take it from there. If you have a negative reaction then yea it could be part of the problem. No way of knowing unless you cut everything out at first. Also if you're trying to quit smoking you can always look into e-cigs as an alternative. I've had several friends successfully quit smoking by switching to vaping. I'm not a professional or anything. Just  dude in CO who has a medical card and been through my bouts with GI disorders...
spicy,391q7b,og_sandiego,2,Tue Jun 9 01:41:38 2015 UTC,Do you just have to stop until these ulcers heal?  Or like... forever?
spicy,391q7b,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Mon Jun 8 17:22:58 2015 UTC,For good. Even if this tightness in the chest is nothing more than the result of these tremors then I'm out. Seriously scary pains.
spicy,391q7b,xmnstr,2,Mon Jun 8 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"Why not just get on a prescription acid reflux med like Nexium? My father has the same issue. Very bad acid reflux/heart burn and it was causing his stomach acid to bubble up and burn his throat and cause all kinds of issues. He could barely swallow or eat at all at one point. Got on Nexium and a couple months later he's back to eating whatever the f he wants. Not sure if your in the same boat, but sounds similar."

I haven't suffered this myself, but a friend who did was able to return to the fold after about a year of laying off and allowing his condition to heal (plus eating better and taming the heartburn so it didn't continue to get exacerbated)  I hope you can experience similar results - bland food isn't fun. :("

It takes about two weeks for the eggs to fully become pickled. It's also advisable to impale the eggs (in order to become pickled quicker).

Luckily, I love egg mayonnaise, so the broken eggs still get used, but I was wondering if you had any tips on how to peel the boiled eggs as perfectly as your pic suggests that you have done?"
spicy,38ua3w,keryskerys,3,Sun Jun 7 01:20:57 2015 UTC,"How do you peel your eggs?  I've found that if you use a typical spoon it's much easier. Wack the bottom (fat part) with the back of a spoon and then again 2 or 3 times around the side to crack the shell. Use your finger to just peel off a small section of the bottom -- just enough to get the spoon between the egg and the shell. Slide spoon in towards the top (skinny bit) and twist it to brake the shell and pull it away from the egg. After the first break, it generally comes off like magic.   It doesn't always work, some eggs are just stubborn, but when it does it's supper fast, clean and keeps the eggs looking much nicer in general."
spicy,38ua3w,CookingWithoutWater,2,Sun Jun 7 00:46:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice.  I usually roll them on a flat surface to crack the shell and use my fingers.  I will definitely try the spoon trick.  Much appreciated.

spicy,38ua3w,thedukedog,2,Mon Jun 8 19:02:04 2015 UTC,Eggs that have been in the fridge for 2-3 weeks in the fridge are significantly easier to peel than fresh off the shelf. Putting eggs in ice after the boil also makes it much easier.
spicy,38ua3w,i8dbbq,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:04:31 2015 UTC,My dad says it took him 30 years to get the perfect boiled egg.  He has it down to a science now... And they are pretty damn good hard/soft boiled eggs.

spicy,38xux5,masterkrabban,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"I would recommend trying small batches of as many recipes as you can. That way you get a feel for what a recipe will result in. Once you get the hang of it, you can improvise a lot more.   Definitely refrigerate them. They should last a month or two. I wouldn't worry about making a shelf-stable sauce yet, it gets complicated worrying about pH level. If they are too vinegary for your taste, substitute the vinegar with up to 50% water. Experiment with other acids too - lime juice can be great. Apple cider vinegar or rice wine vinegar add a bit more complex flavor than white distilled vinegar. I personally like thicker sauces, the recipe link you posted called for straining, which will really thin it out. That's ok if you want it thin, but if you have a powerful blender you can just blend it until it's a smooth puree.  Definitely experiment with fruit. Peaches are a good idea, mango, pineapple, etc can all work in certain sauces. Onions and carrots are great in hot sauce too.   Happy sauce making!"
spicy,38xux5,heathotsauce,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"refrigerate them   I think I'll leave one batch in room temp, and the other one out. Smell+taste as I go along.    apple cider vinegar I've been thinking about this, but I'm thinking it's going to overpower it.   Regular vinegar in the US is 5% solution, right? The ones where I live is 12 or 24% most often.   thicker sauces   Maybe I'll just strain some of it. I like the el yucateco-consistency.    fruit   Pineapple is a great idea! I'll probably try pineapple instead of peaches."
spicy,38xux5,heathotsauce,2,Sun Jun 7 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"Regular vinegar in the US is 5% solution, right?   That's correct, so you'll have to adjust recipes accordingly.   I think I'll leave one batch in room temp   If you don't refrigerate them, then make sure they have plenty of vinegar. Botulism is the thing to be concerned about.    strain some of it   Yea, experiment away!"

I had one of their superhots made with blueberry (they didn't have this one at the expo) and it was seriously hot.  They make some great stuff.
spicy,38sgof,1nf1n1te,3,Sat Jun 6 14:55:38 2015 UTC,I have their 'Fervor' reaper sauce. It's really good but super sweet with a lot of citrus flavor. It has the consistency of a hot sauce but the flavor is more like an orange marmalade. It's weird.

I point others to it when they want to go the route of something 'hotter'..it will always be one of my favs. Had some of their uber delicious Strawberry Trails Preserves for breakfast yesterday morning. They are masterful for those who like all things fruity/hot. Big fan!
spicy,38sgof,Captain_Cramp,2,Sun Jun 7 10:20:52 2015 UTC,Their Cauterizer is one of my faves. I mixed Cauterizer/Sweet Baby Ray's last night at about a 35/65 ratio. Blew my mind how tasty it was.

spicy,38ow64,2hardtry,2,Fri Jun 5 23:57:05 2015 UTC,I think you should consider adding the lemon zest to the party as well.  And I think you'd improve the flavor of the chicken if you marinated it in some of the sauce for 2-4 hours before grilling.
spicy,38pecw,basiden,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:54:19 2015 UTC,Did you add salt?
spicy,38pecw,2hardtry,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:52:51 2015 UTC,"So far no, because I kind of like the sweetness of the peppers, but I might once I've tried it a couple more times."
spicy,38pecw,2hardtry,-1,Fri Jun 5 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"I think unless you're on a low sodium diet, it's best to use salt.  You don't have to add so much salt that it's overpoweringly salty.  A conservative use of salt will still allow the sweetness of ripe chiles to shine.  Salt serves several functions in cooking aside from just making things taste salty.  It's a flavor intensifier, magnifying the other flavors of the food, and it rounds out the flavor of a sauce, making it taste less flat."

spicy,38isn7,hotsizzlepancakes,7,Thu Jun 4 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"If you remove the seeds and membranes from the peppers, the heat will be reduced substantially. I've never done it with Reapers, but I've tried the technique with habaneros. AFAIK the flavor is mostly in the skin, heat in the oils on the interior."
spicy,38isn7,xmnstr,7,Thu Jun 4 14:43:30 2015 UTC,If you cook the peppers beforehand (on the grill) or bake them (after you've deseeded them)  Heat will help break down them and sweeten them as they caramelize.  EDIT: JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GOOD VENTILATION!!!

spicy,38ky2z,son_of_the_stig,3,Fri Jun 5 16:01:24 2015 UTC,"I really like to oven roast chiles and then freeze them.  Makes the a great addition to lots of dishes, and the roasting really brings out the chile flavor (though it does sap some of the heat).  I rub them in olive oil and a bit of salt.  Them bake them in the oven at around 400.   Turn them when they start to look just a bit brown/singed.  Stop when they are a nice blend of green and brown, and the flesh feels soft when you prod it with a fork.  If the brown bits start turning black pull them out, they're probably done.  Oh, and do yourself a favor and put some foil on the baking sheet or pan.  If you have a vacuum sealer, use it.  The flavor is much better months down the road.  If not, just throw them in a ziplock, but I'd recommend using them within a month or so to get the best flavor out of them."

It will pass much faster than normal food. Your body naturally pushes high capsaicin content food out of your system with force. Picture a fire hydrant with air in the line and that's what you have to look forward to. The digestive cramping (aka cap cramps) rarely occurs with an all-natural burn as long as you have a good amount food in your stomach. Extracts are much worse.

spicy,38ca1q,Smultronstallet,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:00:32 2015 UTC,I wonder if that's why I don't like it anymore. When I first used it it always tasted really good. Now I can barely stand the stuff. I've got a bottle in my fridge that's going to be there forever because I just don't like it anymore... :(
spicy,38ca1q,AoO2ImpTrip,2,Thu Jun 4 07:41:51 2015 UTC,I cut a teaspoon of Blair's 2 am into a fresh bottle of rooster juice and it's got just the right amount of step up while keeping the signature Sriracha taste. You gotta mark it clearly though for the friends who don't know what they're getting into when they go in your fridge :P

spicy,38ca1q,quazywabbit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:42:11 2015 UTC,I'm only used to habanero. Is it a lot hotter?
spicy,38ca1q,xmnstr,0,Thu Jun 4 06:48:45 2015 UTC,Tabasco is pretty strict in the products they accept from strickly monitored suppliers. They actually make more money off oil rigs than they do from hotsauce. They pretty much make it for fun now
spicy,38ca1q,steve-madden,17,Thu Jun 4 00:38:11 2015 UTC,I just have a hard time believing that.  Although I do love the branding.  I'll try it if I see it around.

spicy,38ca1q,stininja,21,Wed Jun 3 08:59:39 2015 UTC,Does spice level matter?  I just toss crushed habanero on top of anything I put Sriracha on anyway - the flavor is why I go with huy fong over Trader Joe's (I haven't tried the Tabasco one OP linked).

Its texture/consistency is quite different from others sriracha sauces as well - much thicker/gel-gummy like due to the added starch/xanthan gum/corn syrup solids. This could be an advantage if you want it to 'stick' to food! Sometimes I find it has an off/chemical taste to it also.   It's certainly not bad, but I finished my Texas Pete Cha! waaay before it (bought at same time..) I actually still have half a bottle left of the Frank's ..haha.

It took several months past the initial release of Texas Pete's 'Cha!' sriracha version till it was finally stocked at several local stores so I could try it (took a few tries to break away from the Huy Fong ultimate comparing, and I ended up really loving it..was eating some every day!)  I really like that this is 100% preservative free (only other I have tried is the Sky Valley sauce.) I'm only guessing it is a bit more 'vinegary' (the preservative aspect) than the Huy Fong?!?  I did like the initial bottle design-  but this is more 'traditional' and can see why marketing went with this...the bottle design will instantly catch all roving sriracha fiends' eyes when they may have passed over the other bottle..

I think peaches are a much better thickener for habanero sauce than carrots like most people use.   Use 18+ whole peppers for medium heat, 24+ for spicy chopped in a mini prep chopper and grinder.  You can also use less peppers with pears or pineapples instead of peaches to make a sweet and spicy marinade."

spicy,384q6s,KMoneyGT,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:21:55 2015 UTC,The black stuff is too artificially smokey IMO good in creamy soups  the other stuff has amazing flavor and heat.  Yucateco has been my go to for heat and flavor for some time.

spicy,380chp,JLebowski,17,Sun May 31 22:27:29 2015 UTC,I'm a sucker for a good gimmick. I would like to try these. Are they nacho cheese flavor with a kick or a new flavor altogether?
spicy,380chp,SluggoVonPunch,16,Sun May 31 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are correct, the base flavor is the common nacho cheese. The spicy chips are definitely different, tastes like habnero to me.   The heat is kinda slow, no smokiness though. There is no sting on first bite, it takes a couple of seconds to tell if the chip is hot. There is no difference in appearance or texture."
spicy,380chp,feenicks,4,Sun May 31 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"yeah it was a slow burn, built up over time moreso than being a ""oh wow that chip was a hot one"""
spicy,380chp,MrTastey,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:26:43 2015 UTC,Your palette is probably more sensitive than mine but to me they all tasted the same and the spiciness was all heat and not flavoring
spicy,380chp,theREALsquirtle,12,Fri Jun 12 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"Are they actually spicy, not ""I can't tell if this is the chip's flavor, or if it's given me heartburn"" spicy?  Most of the chips I've tasted are more of the latter.  Takis are really the only ones I've tried that were actually spicy.  I really love Takis."
spicy,380chp,Foocup,17,Sun May 31 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're equivalent to Flamin' Cheetos, if you've ever had those."
spicy,380chp,theREALsquirtle,17,Sun May 31 23:13:04 2015 UTC,I believe I was addicted to those during college.  Good to know.
spicy,380chp,JamoJustReddit,10,Sun May 31 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"I would disagree, they are hotter than flaming cheetos, which have a thin, vinegary, stinging heat that dissipates quickly.   I was impressed with the slow lingering heat of the Doritos. They are nowhere near as good as Blairs Death Rain habnero kettle chips though, those are by far the best spicy chips I've ever had."
spicy,380chp,jgo3,3,Sun May 31 23:20:13 2015 UTC,Blair's Chips are the fucking best.  It's hard to find chips anywhere near as good.
spicy,380chp,ChiPhiMike,4,Mon Jun 1 09:25:46 2015 UTC,"If you like the BDR chips, try Route 11's ""Mama Zuma's Revenge"" chips, too.  Route 11 used to make the Blair's chips, so I think they're basically the same.  Zuma's might be a little sweeter."

spicy,380chp,DrJeffard,4,Mon Jun 1 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"""I can't tell if this is the chip's flavor, or if it's given me heartburn"" spicy   This was my experience. I couldn't tell which were spicy very quickly. It was more like Nacho Cheese flavor ones with cayenne pepper or something, so you get that slight sensation of spiciness, but you're not sure if it's really hot.  Except at one point, I inhaled some of the powder before the chip went down, and it hurt like hell. That was pretty spicy. But most of the time, they weren't really noticeably hot. Still tasted good, though."
spicy,380chp,DrJeffard,7,Mon Jun 1 02:29:04 2015 UTC,I didn't think they were anything special personally. I felt like I'd overpaid for a packet of normal cheese Doritos by the end of it.
spicy,380chp,thongerrr,6,Mon Jun 1 02:59:47 2015 UTC,They are the same price as regular Doritos at my local convenience store
spicy,380chp,theREALsquirtle,2,Mon Jun 1 14:41:51 2015 UTC,I'd buy them if they were regular price here! If something is limited edition or different they'll charge more for it in Australia.

spicy,380chp,Glodan,4,Mon Jun 1 01:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are actually spicy, surprisingly so for a mass market chip. Haven't had takis for years, so not sure how it compares."
spicy,380chp,MrIwik,3,Sun May 31 23:23:10 2015 UTC,Good to know.  I'll try to pick some up next time I'm at the grocery store.
spicy,380chp,CoffeeMetalandBone,0,Sun May 31 23:27:35 2015 UTC,"IMO, Takes are hotter. This might be because every chip is spicy, instead of one every ten chips, but still."
spicy,380chp,filmost,6,Mon Jun 1 02:30:21 2015 UTC,"I had a bag of those recently. I did like that you couldn't see which chips were spicy, but I found the heat level underwhelming. I didn't notice any particular difference between chips until a fair way in when I had a mild, but enduring, tingle. The overall flavour was good, but I didn't get the ""OH, That was a hot one!"" experience the packaging suggests."
spicy,380chp,1amathrowaway,6,Mon Jun 1 05:24:11 2015 UTC,"I tried these here in Australia, they were nice but I couldn't individually distinguish which chips were ""hot"" and which weren't. I may have got a dud pack or they might not be as spicy here as it was a bit dissapointing really."

spicy,380chp,GiantRagingBurner,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"Ive bought them a few times. Enjoy it as a snack but wouldnt really describe them as overly hot. I think there are only couple of the hottest ones per bag. Its mostly plain chips, a few semi spicy, and a few mildly hot. I enjoy the gimmick of being surprised by the flavor. Head your expectations tho. Like most mainstream products that are described as ""hot""  theyre fairly mild by a heat lovers standard."
spicy,380chp,Chew55,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I dont find them hot at all. Like maybe a 2 out of ten. I could easily eat the entire bag without getting a real burn. I wish they could actually be painfully hot :/"

spicy,37pdf0,Tiberius666,2,Fri May 29 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed with the wahaco when I tried it, I found the flavour really acidic and didn't go well with many foods."
spicy,37pdf0,Tiberius666,2,Fri May 29 15:55:25 2015 UTC,I honestly thought the opposite. The 2 I have on the pic I refuse to share with my missus..lol
spicy,37pdf0,c0ffeewolf,2,Fri May 29 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"Gotta say though the Tesco near us has stocked up on Franks too.  I normally the nandos extra extra hot from asda because they do the bigger bottle, the flavour on that stuff is mind blowing."
spicy,37pdf0,derekwtg,2,Fri May 29 16:15:48 2015 UTC,if u like nandos...get the Lidl extra hot piri piri..costs pennies and it's identicle if not better and a bigger bottle
spicy,37pdf0,c0ffeewolf,2,Fri May 29 16:17:52 2015 UTC,"Xtra Hot is ok actually..better than the original for me...only a shade hotter..I was expecting ""oh my word"" but nah..but still good."

spicy,37pdf0,liamgb,2,Sun May 31 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"Frank's Xtra is ~4 times hotter than regular frank's. It's in the same neighbourhood as Cholula, perhaps a bit hotter but with basically the same flavour as the original.  Regular Frank's doesn't even register as hot to me anymore, so Xtra is my baseline. I default to it a lot when I just want a bit of heat and I use it to make buffalo sauce to which I add small bits of really hot sauces to get the heat level up somewhere nice and molten.  BTW, making your own buffalo sauce is super easy, no need to use the pre-made kinds."
spicy,37pdf0,OMGimaDONKEY,2,Fri May 29 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"Regular just tastes like vinegar to me I guess.  Sour vinegar with no heat.  I don't even consider my taste buds trained (a habanero would absolute fucking wreck me) but regular franks is such a tease to me :(  I think the Frank's buffalo is practically just frank's regular + butter, right?  At least that's what I've assumed, and I think it's the creaminess that makes me prefer it over everything but sriracha on my eggs."
spicy,37pdf0,RedditRalf,2,Fri May 29 17:14:14 2015 UTC,I think that's the basic recipe.   When I make buffalo sauce I do Frank's Xtra + butter + minced garlic + splashes of hotter stuff like Dave's Insanity or Blair's After Death.
spicy,37pdf0,IMASHIRT,2,Fri May 29 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Same here.. I basically pour Frank's Xtra Hot into a blender, add a handful of habaneros or whatever, some garlic and puree it.  Then, mix with the melted butter before tossing."

I'm sure someone in here or in /r/hotpeppers could probably accomodate your request though, perhaps at the end of the growing season at least.  You might also try any local Farmer's Market toward the end of your growing season. They're becoming more popular. Also, if you think ghosts are tasty, see if you can find some fatalii peppers.

They had plants labeled habanero, tabasco, jalapeno, ghost pepper, and a few others.  I have no idea how Agway handles distribution; it's very likely that they have regional suppliers and don't have a consistent inventory between stores.

spicy,37irsm,KeavesSharpi,2,Thu May 28 04:04:44 2015 UTC,"Its mostly superhots that are expensive like that. They take much longer to ripen and have far less seeds, so I can kind of understand it to a certain degree. I wouldn't pay over 7-8 for a pack myself. Lesser pepper packs are usually 2-4 bucks."

On the Carolina Reapers, I think they're one of the few 'authorized' resellers, but don't quote me on that. If you order any (from anywhere) note that the super hots seem a lot harder to germinate."

In fact, my ghosts easily produced more than any other peppers that I had. They were extremely hot and I have a bunch to people who I know just because they were interested in them. I'm growing a lot more this year and most of them will just be turned into powder if I can't use them all.   I love spicy food,but they are also just a fun plant to grow.

Last year was my first time planting because a friend of mine let me use her garden and I was a bit surprised at how easily the ghosts and thai dragons I planted grew, they both give off a ton of fruit for one plant (ghost at around 20 and the thai at 50+).  Though on the reverse, my tabasco sprouted nothing and poblano gave me one undersized fruit that never ripened. So a lot of it comes down to luck I guess, haha."

spicy,37irsm,KnowsTheLaw,2,Thu May 28 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"I went to a farmers market last year that offered ghost peppers at $3 for a half-dozen, probably because the vendor had a surplus of them and wanted to put them on clearance, and I think they were still green at the time, so they might have still been a bit premature in spiciness. Now I've grown habaneros and Scotch bonnets before for several years (usually alternating between the two) but at that time I was still tentative towards trying a ghost pepper myself. I told them I was worried about buying a full six pack of them and would have even doubled their price (i.e. pay $1) for a single pepper. Unfortunately they wouldn't settle. But considering how hot they are, $4 for a single pepper online probably isn't that bad.  Now this year, I bought a four pack of ghost plants for $3...again, I wish I could have bought just a single plant, but I can't say I won't be excited and a little bit nervous (hopefully in a good way!) when I pick my first this summer."

spicy,37i7n6,Number1AbeLincolnFan,2,Fri May 29 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to make a basic sauce, just put 20 habaneros (or whatever) into a blender with a big pinch of salt, a couple garlic cloves, small handful of chopped onion and juice of a lime.  Turn the blender on low.  It will not blend at first because there isn't enough liquid.  Slowly add apple cider vinegar until the mixture starts churning.  Puree for a couple minutes.   After you've mastered that, try different combinations of peppers, adding a bit of fruit, orange instead of lime juice, different types of vinegar, maybe add in some dried chiles or roast the chiles beforehand, try cooking and reducing the sauce, etc.  Try to only change one or two variables at a time, in the beginning, so it is easier to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.    I hardly ever buy hot sauces any more.  After you start making your own, you'll realize how many sauces on the shelf are crap."

I push all my coals to one half of the grill, and then lay previously soaked woodchips on top of them (skip the chips if you don't want the smokey flavor). Lay down some tinfoil/a pan/a sieve on the side without the coals and then put the peppers on top.  Make sure the vents on your grill are partially opened, to allow for the smoke to travel, and then pop on the cover.   Low and slow works best for assuring you don't end up with burnt peppers. I like to let mine get so cool that I can actually leave it overnight. I also like to slice my peppers in half before I toss them in, but some people don't feel that step is necessary."

spicy,379utl,zombie_overlord,1 point,Wed May 27 16:07:06 2015 UTC,"This was the sauce that got me into hot sauce.  I was visiting New Orleans (pre-Katrina), had a boozy good time, and stopped at a gift shop before I left to pick up a couple of souvenirs.  I got a bottle of some variety of ""Spank my Ass"" hot sauce or something like that, and a bottle of Satan's Blood.  The cashier told me my total, and I was taken aback that two bottles of hot sauce was in the neighborhood of $25.  She told me to look a little closer at the Satan's Blood.  I read the tag & paid the cashier.  Later that evening, walking around fairly drunk in the French Quarter, curiosity got the best of me.  At this point, Tabasco was about the hottest thing I'd tried, so I got it out, opened the little flip top, and just barely touched my tongue on the lid.  I was on fire.  800k su if I remember correctly.  I was licking my shirt, scratching my tongue, and there was nothing for a mile around me that would mitigate the inferno.  Just beer & liquor, pretty much.  It was pretty hilarious.  So that was the beginning of my fascination with real hot sauce.  Edit:  FYI, over time, that rubber lid will literally melt.  Unofficial expiration date of 2-3 years.  I eventually had to throw mine away.  Also, BE VERY CAREFUL of drippage.  I can see some around the bottom of the lid.  Use hand sanitizer after handling.  Especially before going to take a leak.  Funny stories (but not from your perspective) will occur otherwise."

When used in English, it is sometimes spelled (and pronounced) habañero,  the tilde being added as a hyperforeignism (patterned after jalapeño). Unripe habaneros are green, and they color as they mature. Common colors are orange and red, but white, brown, yellow, and pink are also seen. Typically, a ripe habanero chili is 2–6 cm (0.8–2.4 in) long. Habanero chilis are very hot, rated 100,000–350,000 on the Scoville scale.

spicy,37btk3,PhoKingClassic,2,Tue May 26 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of Mango Magnifico from Founders.   But, with respect to the homebrewing, I have done it twice, both with large success. Consider what peppers you are adding, and why.  First, decide what peppers you want, and consider it based on what properties besides heat you want. Do you want it just the ""green"" flavor of a Jalapeno (that may work okay in something pale)? Do you want a ""smoked"" flavor of a Chipotle (goes great with dark malts)? Do you want slight fruit with extreme heat that goes with a Habenero (goes well with stone fruits and mango)? A fruity flavor with good heat from a hot cherry? Or a smooth heat that warms with no vegetal or fruit qualities from a Thai chili?  Well, since I grow Thai Chili peppers in my garden, and deemed I didn't want a real vegetal/fruit taste or a smoked taste in my stout, they were my answer. I freeze what is left over at the end of the year. So, I thawed out 3, rinsed in starsan, chopped (with knife and board having some starsan as well on it) and threw in the secondary and racked onto them. After 2 weeks, it wasn't very hot, so I added 3 more. After 4 days, it had good heat, I bottled. (I left all of the peppers behind, to my knowledge). The heat got a bit more in the bottles, but not unbearable.  The moral of brewing with beer? 1. Find a pairing you are happy with both with pepper qualities and beer qualities. Don't put square pegs in round holes, if it doesn't sound good in a base style, don't do it. 2. Use less peppers, you can always add more, but you can't take away. 3. The carbonation, as well as residual pepper could lend itself to add more heat after bottling, so stop it if it is getting on the low end of what you deem ""perfect"" to stop problem two from happening. Granted, most of us here can take it REALLY hot. Just realize that you may have to drink all of it/drain it if it ends up badly. If you want to test one, just take a base recipe that you like, and add a sliver or five (or more based on heat/flavor) of pepper, let it sit for like 5m, and try it, see if the combination works."

spicy,37btk3,JCrazy84,2,Tue May 26 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"Haha, I lurk there more than anything because since I moved, an equipment mishap has stopped me brewing beer in ~14 months (this weekend I might finally have the time to fix it and get everything up and running).   Anyway, I added them by themselves, but there wouldn't be a wrong answer, you could add them to one of those tea infusers, or a mesh bag/cheesecloth if you are worried about picking up seeds/small pepper flesh. The bigger you chop, the easier they are to avoid/suck up in a cane/siphon, but the less surface area and thus less flavor that gets extracted."

It's not the tastiest sauce but it works well as a heat addition to something else with an overpowering taste. I mixed it in my salsas, sauces and dips and ended up with tasty stuff.

spicy,36p5po,fatdjsin,1 point,Thu May 21 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"I think you can make your own pretty easily if you can score some ghost pepper flakes and some EV olive oil.

spicy,36p5po,muhaski,2,Thu May 21 05:02:09 2015 UTC,Serious question...love making my spiced oil...but i was told not to heat it ...that it would kill it? .....i put lots of chillies and piri piri and wait many month for the taste to infuse :(....can i heat it and be done faster without loosing something?
spicy,36p5po,Cdresden,1 point,Thu May 21 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"I've read that if you do heat it, not to go above boiling. You can also heat it, turn it off then throw in your chili's."
spicy,36p5po,fatdjsin,1 point,Thu May 21 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't actually have to heat it; you can allow it to infuse at room temperature.  But that will take about a month (or more) to fully extract the flavor and heat.    I don't mean to boil the oil.  Perhaps I should have been more precise.  I meant the boiling point of water.  If you heat the oil briefly to just above the boiling point of water, to about 220F/110C, whatever you are using to infuse the oil will begin to release moisture and aromatics.  The trick is to only heat the oil for a couple of minutes, then let it cool back down.  You don't want to heat the oil to frying temperature, because that would begin to denature the oil, and the flavor components of the oil would begin to break down.  By heating the oil briefly, your oil will be fully infused in only a few days."
spicy,36p5po,Cdresden,2,Thu May 21 23:30:37 2015 UTC,Thanks ...thats why im gonna need a cooking thermometer :) humm spicy oil !  .. try that ...spicy oil on bread ...toast em ...and add brushetta ...its sooooo much better

spicy,36owld,proudestmonkey123,8,Thu May 21 00:03:07 2015 UTC,If you want my advice from a wine perspective you want to pair a sweeter wine such as as reisling or guartzemeiner as it is as contrast to the spice.  A nice cold glass of reisling with some spicy Thai food my god...
spicy,36owld,thewun11,13,Thu May 21 01:23:32 2015 UTC,Depends on the food but I enjoy spicy food the most with beer. Specifically IPA's if you want to accentuate the heat a little with the bitterness but still cut through all of the flavors and cleanse your palette with every sip. IPA's are especially good with spicy thai food; the fruity and citrusy flavors in the beer work really well with the sweetness in thai dishes. If you want something to quell the heat as you drink I'd go for something darker. You don't want to go too far with an imperial stout or anything but I think scotch ales have the right amount of malt sweetness and are just heavy enough without going overboard to stand up to big spicy meals.  You also can't go wrong with a salty sour margarita with some good mexican food...which makes me wonder about a gose with some tacos...

Honestly though if 4 drops causes stomach pain that's not the sauce for me.  I would rather have a lot of a good flavored medium sauce than a few drops of stomach ruining heat.

I've lived in the US and Australia, and while not all places can fulfill the level of spicy I look for, I've never lived somewhere where I couldn't find a few places that could do it.

He ordered in Thai, and I said ""I'll have what he's having"" as they never believed me when i said I wanted ""5-stars""  So they bring out the food, which was ""Thai spicy"" (e.g. 5 stars++) and then when they served it they sprinkled about 1/2 C of freshly minced Thai peppers on it.  That is the 1st and last time I ever do anything like that. 4-stars is good by me. That shit was as hot as the devil's flaming anus.

spicy,36fj31,DarkFractal,1 point,Tue May 19 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I'd whip up an enchilada sauce or chili base.   Toast the chiles in a cast iron skillet.  Medium heat, until they just start to get a dark spot or two.  Don't burn them. Remove the stems (and seeds if you don't have a blender capable of emulsifying them), put the peppers into a large bowl and cover them with boiling water.  Cover the bowl and let them stand for 15-20 minutes.  If they're not soft yet, add more boiling water. Put the peppers and some of the water into a blender.  Let 'er rip! Get the paste as smooth as possible. If it's not blending well add more of the water you soaked them in.  Salt to taste.   [at this point you have a nice chili base, use this instead of chili powder in your favorite chili recipe, continue for enchilada sauce]   Add the chile paste to several cups of beef broth.  Mix in cumin and salt to taste.  Either add a bit of brown sugar (add it very slowly, taste after a few minutes, add more if necessary) or some shaved Mexican baking chocolate. Thicken it up a bit with some corn starch."

spicy,36fj31,MisterFuzz,1 point,Tue May 19 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"They are the 2nd most popular chile in Mexico, behind anchos.  They look a lot like dried New Mexicos or Anaheims, but are noticeably spicier.  Guajillos are characterized by having a fruity flavor, as contrasted to anchos more swarthy flavor.  In Mexican cuisine, guajillos are often paired with chicken or pork.  That being said, lots of Mexican recipes combine two or more types of chiles, and guajillos often end up getting combined with anchos...so go figure.  Guajillos are the star of red enchilada sauce.  Here is a really outstanding recipe for such by Rick Bayless.  Bayless does an extra step in a lot of his sauces: he fries them.  He make a paste out of the toasted chiles, then briefly fries it in oil before adding stock to thin it down.   It's important to toast the chiles before rehydrating them.  Usually I will open the chile up and destem and deseed it, then using a metal spatula, press it down against the surface of a dry (no oil) medium hot pan until it gives off a whiff of smoke, then flip it over and press the other side until it gives off a whiff of smoke.  Then into a lukewarm water bath for at least 20 minutes.  Not only does this guajillo sauce make great enchilada sauce, it also makes kickass chile colorado.  Trim some pork butt, cut it in 1"" cubes, then pack it in a baking dish with the sauce, and bake at 350F for about 3 hours, until tender.  Serve with beans and tortillas."

spicy,36bcty,LuckyDogHotSauce,1 point,Mon May 18 02:56:55 2015 UTC,How hot would this be after grilling? Surely not at the level of just eating a raw piece of Reaper.
spicy,36bcty,motionOne,1 point,Mon May 18 11:04:59 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it would be respectably hot.  Some of the pepper would burn off, and you're spreading 1 reaper over an entire pork loin. Serving size is 1-2 medallions of pork, so no - you wouldn't get as lit up as if you ate a whole reaper. But I'm reasonably sure it would be hot, and tasty. :)"
spicy,36bcty,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Mon May 18 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"Basic Superhot Salsa  This is a good test sauce for getting an idea of just how hot 1 superhot chile can be when blended into 2 cups of sauce. It's a good general purpose condiment for chips, potatoes, eggs, etc.  1/2 onion, chopped 3-4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 Tb olive oil 1 fresh superhot chile, halved 1 14-oz can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, with juice salt to taste sherry vinegar, to taste, or cane vinegar   Saute onions and garlic in olive oil until onions are softened. Add chile and tomatoes with their juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, then puree. Add salt to taste, then add vinegar to taste."

spicy,36a27y,Nordoisthebest,5,Sun May 17 18:51:35 2015 UTC,I just bought a bottle of the Ghost Pepper sauce. It's amazing good on McDonald's sausage biscuits.

spicy,36a27y,oxSupra,13,Mon May 18 11:10:48 2015 UTC,I tried a ghost pepper sauce for the first time at a Thai restaurant this last week. It was like a red hot knife was jammed into my tongue. It was glorious.

spicy,36a27y,knigmulls,13,Mon May 18 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"I love that scorpion sauce. It's like a scorpion puree. No crazy overpowering garlic, salt, carrot, or smoky flavors so you can use it for pure heat and pepper fruitiness and add your own garlic and other seasonings. Put a line down a burrito made of seasoned meat, sauteed onions and cheese.  It's hot though. Remember your tongue gets used to it faster than your butthole."
spicy,36a27y,Liquor_in_the_ass,11,Sun May 17 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"Oh god, it burns so much on the way out."
spicy,36a27y,_Dotty_,10,Sun May 17 21:13:09 2015 UTC,Excellent choices. Tropical Pepper Company's Ghost Pepper Sauce is my current favorite — it packs just the right amount of punch without being overpowering with excellent viscosity. I dump it on everything. But I find the scorpion sauce a wee too hot for all purpose use.
spicy,36a27y,Shuang,5,Sun May 17 18:57:02 2015 UTC,Is the scorpion sauce hotter than the ghost pepper? I have both and always thought the ghost one was hotter. I use the scorpion at work for chick peas.
spicy,36a27y,IanLouder,5,Sun May 17 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty convinced that, to a limited extent, heat is a subjective thing.   While Scoville Heat Units objectively measure heat, there seem to be elements that go into the perception of heat that effect people differently, so that two people people might not be able to agree on which sauce is hotter."
spicy,36a27y,heathotsauce,2,Sun May 17 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. I use both regularly and I know the scorpion boats more scoville units, but I don't the ghost to be way hotter."
spicy,36a27y,J_Briarwood,1 point,Sun May 17 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd say the scorpion is hotter. But due to the lack of overpowering flavors — it's just bold, clean heat — adding a few dollops to another sauce really helps kick up the heat to blast furnace intensity without sacrificing the flavor."
spicy,36a27y,Shuang,3,Mon May 18 12:31:21 2015 UTC,I found the Ghost Pepper sauce at a local supermarket and have to have one open in the fridge and one sealed my cupboard as a backup. I end up giving one away to a fellow heat lover and also you literally cannot have too much of this sauce it's so good.
spicy,36a27y,tikituki,3,Mon May 18 01:47:39 2015 UTC,"So, the other night, I came home from work, pretty wasted, and decided to make myself some food. I fried up some bacon and vegetables and chopped chilli and garlic and whatever other shit I could find and threw it on two tortillas. On the First one, I threw on a load of Valentino, this nice hot sauce from a local Mexican place, real tasty, never too hot, and on the other, I threw a similar amount of this scorpion pepper sauce. I'd never had it before, and didn't bother to look what it actually was. The pain hit me like a sack of shit. It was one of the hottest meals I've ever had. Lesson learned; it's a great sauce, but not to be fucked with."
spicy,36a27y,knigmulls,3,Mon May 18 01:59:33 2015 UTC,Scorpion Pepper sauces are so much better than Ghost Pepper

It seems like it's seasonal or something, but my favorite sauce from them is called Rasta; it's not the hottest thing in the world so I usually mix in some of their ghost pepper sauce, but goddamn if Rasta isn't the tastiest thing ever. I may or may not have bought a gallon jug of the bastard a while back and finished it in what seemed like a week. Pretty sure I have a problem, but I don't even care, I'll just die happy and drowned in hotsauce.  Also, obligatory ""/r/hailcorporate"" post, whatever.

spicy,36aont,Emperor-Tamarin,1 point,Mon May 18 12:32:13 2015 UTC,I actually came here to give a warning about that! That freaking mustard is so tasty but it caused both my mouth and my friends to blister up really bad the first time I ate it.  I liked it so much that I figured I would try again just to make sure it was the mustard that caused the blisters.I did this about a week ago and things went wrong. The whole left side of the skin on roof of mouth came off after I tried again. It was like a giant blister that covered a full 2 inches of my mouth.  The worst part is that I freaking love the mustard and I have a full bottle of the stuff just sitting around now.
spicy,36aont,Emperor-Tamarin,1 point,Mon May 18 19:25:28 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the horseradish or hot mustard? I don't know how anything spicy(capsaicin) would do that because capsaicin doesn't cause any direct physical damage and is only sensory stimulation. Maybe you are allergic to some other chemical? Because that is not a common occurrence. I almost drink the stuff.
spicy,36aont,Emperor-Tamarin,1 point,Mon May 18 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man, no I love spicy food. My body is fine with that. I actually just got done cutting up two jalapenos, a habanero and a cup of Tabasco to make myself chili beans tonight!   Its that hot mustard.

Also, someone posted about secret aardvark here the other day (and I had just been exposed to it that same week), get you some of that stuff. It's got a little bit of sweetness to it (which I don't usually like, like, at all, but, damn this stuff is good) so it may not be perfect for everything but where Sriracha goes that Aardvark should fit well.   Oh, shoot, also, you should try Gringo Bandito if you can. I'm told it's the brainchild of some rock and roll band member (I cast no aspersions on that account) but it's fairly mild (heat - wise) with a great taste."

spicy,363zu9,LuckyDogHotSauce,1 point,Mon May 18 23:15:18 2015 UTC,Why is the name in Spanish if this is a Portuguese sauce? Is chicken one of the ingredients or I can only eat it with chicken?
spicy,363zu9,LuckyDogHotSauce,1 point,Sat May 23 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"For the name, two reasons:   More people know what Pollo means in the U.S. than Frango.  Partly this reference.    As for what you can eat it with, put it on your food and try! Its very good with proteins like eggs and chicken (Chicken Piri Piri is a national Portuguese dish, some places make hot wings with it), but I've also been enjoying it with pizza, starchy foods, and soups.  I haven't used it with most asian dishes, but its a garlicky sauce so some other sauces are probably better to compliment them. Though, I enjoyed it with the red curry I had last night!"

spicy,361lx7,LuckyDogHotSauce,3,Sat May 16 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"Not to self-promote (ok, maybe a little) but my sauces aren't very vinegary. I have more and less acidic sauces, by design. The more acidic sauces are the verde with tomatillo & the mustard chipotle - in both of these the acidity is more of a tomatillo or mustard than a vinegary taste. Mostly with my products the fire-roasted peppers and other ingredients are more forward on the palate.   Others I love that aren't that acidic, in no particular order:   Rhino - the mustard peri-peri sauce is terrific and very full flavored. Nice balance and well rounded sauce.   Redhawk Premium Peppers Grounds for Divorce XXX - sweet & delicious, and not very acidic at all.   CaJohn's Tiki Lounge - this stuff is amazing. A very Polynesian-style sauce that screams egg rolls & Chinese food. Really tasty - tried it at the ABQ festival and had to have it.  The sweet notes are phenomenal in this product.   Crazy Good makes some killer sauces - all very flavorful, not very acidic. The one with prickly pear cactus is insanely delicious.   Hot Line - they have a great line of fire-roasted sauces, many with hatch chiles.   Secret Aardvark was already mentioned, but deserves another. Great stuff - not very vinegary at all.   There are many many more - these are just off the top of my head.   :)"

spicy,35zpzg,bayrea,5,Thu May 14 22:07:12 2015 UTC,The only Dave's sauce I've enjoyed the taste of has been the Scorpion pepper one. All the others tend to have a very chemical taste to me. I tend to only use the Insanity sauces for mixing in with something like ketchup/ranch/bbq to dilute the taste and spice it up.
spicy,35zpzg,pickboy87,1 point,Thu May 14 22:48:05 2015 UTC,"The scorpion pepper sauce is amazing. I feel like they add too much extract to the others to maintain hotness, but the scorp is nice and thick and flavorful. I haven't had a bottle of it last me more than 2 weeks."

Yucatan sunshine is a good none too spicy habanero sauce (great on fried cubed steak.)   But really even your superhots can be everyday sauces if you cut them with the right condiments. I have a scorpion pepper mustard-based hot sauce that takes barbecue sauce to a whole other level. Vicious Viper cuts into mayo to make an amazing sandwich sauce.

spicy,35um0b,Crookmeister,1 point,Wed May 13 22:49:22 2015 UTC,Are you guys going to get the yellow bird sauces? Because I'm not paying them $16 for one bottle with shipping.
spicy,35um0b,baseacegoku,2,Wed May 13 22:37:21 2015 UTC,They are $16 plus shipping for 2 bottles. And are big bottles. I bought two from them back when they had free shipping and I have to say it was totally worth it.
spicy,35um0b,Crookmeister,1 point,Thu May 14 03:21:32 2015 UTC,It would be $26 for me to buy 2 bottles from their site.
spicy,35um0b,baseacegoku,1 point,Fri May 15 06:29:25 2015 UTC,Not sure where you live but I just looked and its $21 for two bottles shipped to me.
spicy,35um0b,Crookmeister,1 point,Fri May 15 07:38:16 2015 UTC,"Ya, it seems the shipping price is location based. I'm in California and the price for shipping two bottles is ~$10."
spicy,35um0b,baseacegoku,1 point,Fri May 15 09:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think you're doing something wrong then, I'm also in California and my shipping price is $5 and change."
spicy,35um0b,Crookmeister,2,Fri May 15 16:34:11 2015 UTC,Nevermind you are right. I was just putting two bottles separately into the cart instead of adding that two pack to the cart. Their site shows up very shittily on my mobile so it's hard to see all of their products.
spicy,35um0b,baseacegoku,1 point,Fri May 15 20:36:40 2015 UTC,"Ya, grab the 2 pack. I know its only a $5 difference. But in my opinion its worth it. I got the jalapeño and Serrano and would recommend trying the Serrano and the habanero. The jalapeño, while good, wasn't as good as the Serrano and I feel like the habanero would be better still"
spicy,35um0b,Crookmeister,2,Fri May 15 21:56:08 2015 UTC,"Ya, I'll probably go for the Serrano and habanero then. Thanks."
spicy,35um0b,Crookmeister,1 point,Sat May 16 00:29:02 2015 UTC,Ya that is also my price for one. But when I add one bottle the shipping doubles to around $10.

As far as our Hot Sauce of the Month Club goes, we've been doing it for a little over 2 years now, and I've found that the best packages have a lot of variety. So for example, one month I might feature a green sauce, a smokey sauce, and a superhot. Or scotch bonnet, a fruit based one, and a garlicy one. Basically, I try to give you as much variety as possible each month. One cool thing we do occasionally is give our members early releases on sauces. For example, we gave our members Lucky Dog Brown Label about a week before it was available anywhere.   So yea, let me know if you have any other questions! And if you ever find yourself in Berkeley, be sure come by the shop :)"
spicy,35um0b,LuckyDogHotSauce,0,Sat May 16 22:11:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words - I'd suggest adding a pinch of ghost pepper powder to the Pink Label as you use it. That shouldn't impact the flavor too much.

I plan on making spicy vodka from my reapers, since I am in no way hardcore enough to eat them raw, and infused liquor sounds a lot easier than making hot sauce.   Best spicy booze I've ever had was 'Ghostface Killah' by Twisted Pine Brewery. It is insanely hot and tasted just like fresh peppers. Beer snobs would probably consider the overwhelming heat a negative, but if you love hot peppers, it's awesome."

They also make a Sriracha brew. My curiosity hasn't gotten to the point where I've tried it... anyone had this?  A brewery here in Mississippi makes a Mariposa with jalapeño. Now that is a great beer. I think it was Crooked Letter Brewing.  Another MS brewery made what I think was a one off pepper beer that was SUPER spicy for a beer festival I went to. Everyone at the fest hated it but I couldn't get enough."

spicy,35rtld,KeavesSharpi,1 point,Tue May 12 23:55:38 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome!  I got a smoker for x-mas last year and my favorite thing by far to make has been wings.  It's a blast to try all of the different sauces.  Luckily it's hard to go wrong combining butter and hot sauce :-).
spicy,35qqb8,Poppin-Quells,3,Tue May 12 18:58:26 2015 UTC,Butter in a sauce? Don't think I've seen that before; what purpose does it serve?
spicy,35qqb8,Terrance_aka_Magnus,2,Tue May 12 20:51:37 2015 UTC,"It can add butter or browned butter flavor and richness.  The problem is that this is a sauce that can't be stored at room temp, and when you refrigerate the sauce, the butter will congeal.  Not too much of an issue, provided you didn't use very much; it will thicken the sauce slightly in that case.  But if you use a good amount, you might need to reheat it to get it to thin out again.  In general, it's a better idea to use oil if you want to fry some of the sauce ingredients."
spicy,35qqb8,2hardtry,2,Tue May 12 21:49:01 2015 UTC,Mine is not congealing and I used a considerable amount. Its rather thick but I didnt process it much as evident by the habanero seeds and bits of japones's (sp?)
spicy,35qqb8,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Tue May 12 23:02:31 2015 UTC,Traditional wing sauce = hot sauce+butter.   ;)

spicy,35j4a6,cadencehz,4,Mon May 11 00:16:49 2015 UTC,I like this idea. Except I would take the roulette to the next level and put some stupid hot sauce on one and get surprised at lunch one day.

spicy,35j4a6,KeavesSharpi,1 point,Sun May 10 23:07:10 2015 UTC,It's not my favorite chipotle actually. I like chipotle sauces with a little sweetness in them but this doesn't have much. Their habanero sauces are much better. The yellow exotica bottle I picked up today is from Barbados and is very good.
spicy,35j4a6,pacificspecific,2,Sun May 10 23:36:02 2015 UTC,It's one of my favorite hot sauces!

Your chicken here looks like it was boiled or microwaved.  It boggles my mind how anyone who had a choice would eat that.

spicy,35gi69,bennypapa,1 point,Sun May 10 14:16:21 2015 UTC,"the chipotles are wet, the Arbol and New Mexico chiles are dried."
spicy,35gi69,KeavesSharpi,1 point,Sun May 10 14:42:26 2015 UTC,The canned version is made with smoked and dried jalapeños that have been rehydrated. So they were indeed dry at some point.    I ended up getting a pillowcase size bag of dried on Amazon.com because I like rehydrating them myself.
spicy,35gi69,urnbabyurn,0,Sun May 10 16:46:10 2015 UTC,"All chipotles are dried jalapenos. Even if they're canned in a sauce that rehydrates them, doesn't change the fact that they were dried before!"

spicy,35ejc0,TH3C4NN4BL3C0W,3,Sat May 9 16:00:20 2015 UTC,"Raw will give you a good sense of the heat of the pepper you have (not necessarily indicative of every pepper of that variety since heat varies according to a number of factors).   First 4 on the left are going to be mild. Probably good with stir fries or stews.   Those to the right are likely to decrease in heat if subject to heat, unless cooked in oil in which case the heat will probably rise.  Try a bite of each if you're supposed to sample them. A mild cheese and a cracker is a possible solution--the cheese will dilute the heat a bit, but cheese is also a complex flavor so you'll likely be able to better note the specific flavors of each pepper.  Then dice and apply to whatever. Really spicy one's are good in chili's, or on pizza. All of them would likely respond to a light pasta (as in, with a bit of olive oil).  Unless someone has a super mean chili recipe, you can just add these to whatever it is you want to add a bit of spice and flavor to. The first 4 are going to be a bit sweeter while the others have their own distinct flavors, though, depending on the size of the dish you make that might get washed out.  If you really want to be scientific about it, pick a single serve dish (or one that can be portioned into single servings like pasta or slices of pizza) and try with each one. You don't seem to have enough variance to try multiple cooking styles, so it seems like raw, baked, or sautee would keep some consistency if you prepared each accordingly (each are going to respond differently to different cooking mechanisms).   Most of those peppers you can get at any mega mart, so take a bite, see if there's a taste/spice threshold and continue on later."

spicy,356gyv,kalitarios,9,Thu May 7 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"I Got this bottle 2 years ago as a gift.  I'm unsure of the cost but I'd bet it's on par for other mass-produced supermarket brands in the $3-4 range.  Appearance: Bottle looks neat, wide-neck 5oz woozy with a black cap, fancy ""genuine"" tear-off shrink band and smallish label.  Brown sauce with specs of spices can be seen behind the shiny glass bottle.  No perforation on the tamper-evident seal, so I had to find a knife to open the bottle.  Not the end of the world but it's annoying when packages don't use perfs.  Nose: Honestly, it smelled like wet cardboard.  I'll clarify, wet pizza box from the night before that got soaked and left out all night.  There's some subtle hints of cayenne pepper but for the most part, something stinky is in there.  I'm thinking the bottle was pushing the age limit for it's ""butter flavor"" and it just turned.  Either way, I'm pouring it into a spoon to try it.  Palette: Something is definitely off in this sauce.  I'm not tasting bourbon or 'wings.'  The aroma of wet pizza box has now taken over the actual taste of the product.  There's some tingling of the dry spice but the aroma and taste are definitely that of cardboard.  Body: About average for a wing sauce, maybe a tad less sticky as some others, or if you make your own by cutting it with oil or butter.  The taste doesn't linger but there's no bourbon taste at all.  It's also a bit salty.  End Note: Forgetful.  Literally forgetful, because within 20 seconds, any taste it had has disappeared.  If this were on chicken wings, it would look like a glaze without adding much more than the equivalent of a dusting from the cayenne pepper shaker, minus the black pepper.  Cost:  right in the supermarket $4 wheel house Value:  low Would I buy it again?: No Would I recommend it?: No  Thoughts: Normally I like to give every test a fair shake.  At least 2 tries, maybe I had a bad day or maybe the bottle wasn't the best... so to be perfectly fair I'll have to try and find another like this, but I'm not paying more than $3.50 for it.  This is an easily forgetful sauce, which, in my opinion, is simply coasting on the ""Jim Beam"" name for sales."

You wouldn't ordinarily use this as your frying oil; you'd still use peanut oil, canola oil, etc. as your base oil.  The main reason you wouldn't use this as your frying oil is that your dishes might become too hot for a general palate.  I think there are lots of fusion possibilities for this oil, for instance, in marinades.  One fusion idea you might try is using this in a dip.  Blend 2 parts sour cream and 1 part mayonnaise, then to taste add your roasted chile oil and some crushed fresh garlic.  To this you could then add some minced green onion and season to taste with salt and lemon.  Use this as a dip with potato chips and/or thinly sliced cucumbers and other crudites."

spicy,353c8p,Arturo_the_Wise,0,Thu May 7 14:24:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't had the sauce you're referring to so I can't comment specifically, but I believe the flaw with many fruit-based sauces on the market is that instead of making a fruit-based hot sauce, sauce makers make ""hot-based fruit sauces"". When a sauce is too fruity you lose adaptability/versatility.   my Black Label is a multi award-winning hot sauce - 5 first places in TX & NY over the last 2 years, including a 2015 Golden Chile.  It has fig & Apple, but it's a savory sauce with strong garlic, onion & scorpion pepper notes - it's not super fruity. I've entered it in the ""fruit-based"" category at several events and have been skunked in favor of the super fruity sauces.   maybe I'm off base, but I have a hard time finding uses for super fruity sauces. People say ""use it on ice cream"" - I'm old school - I like caramel or chocolate on ice cream.   The fruit-based sauces on this list I've had have been very flavorful and useful. BigFats stands out to me as a savory and useful hot sauce. HBD and High River's as well."

spicy,351bub,brett1,1 point,Wed May 6 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think lime or salt is going to help much.  Eating tortillas can help a bit.  The problem is the capsaicin oil is coating your tongue and the back of your throat, and water won't wash it off.  Starches can help by absorbing the oil, and colloids like milk or yogurt can help by dissolving the oil."

It's a great flavor on a simple burrito, but I can see how it wouldn't be as good on something more complex. There's not much heat. The longer I eat it, the more it reminds me of a sweet version of their old fire roasted one that I used to love."
spicy,34yurr,nits3w,2,Tue May 5 22:39:39 2015 UTC,Could somebody post an ingredient list?  Any extract?  I usually use the hot over the fire because it tastes better... I definitely prefer taste over heat.

spicy,34yurr,nessx007,2,Wed May 6 07:35:02 2015 UTC,What state? Was at a Taco Bell recently here in FL and didn't see this advertised (nor the ghost pepper burrito I've heard about).
spicy,34yurr,Baramos_,2,Wed May 6 09:29:01 2015 UTC,"Not actually very hot, if you ask me. In fact I thought it was less hot than the Fire sauce, but tasted a little different so it was maybe interesting to try. Examining the ingredients, it didn't even appear to have any peppers in it? Whereas with Fire sauce jalepeno is at least listed as the second ingredient in the list.  Honestly I was underwhelmed. And I even tried it pretty much straight, as the thing I bought was mostly tortilla (what a surprise), so it's not like the flavor or heat were masked. I will probably try it again sometime, but I think I will stick with Fire sauce for the most part if I ever go to Taco Bell again (I've discovered that their prices have gone up a ridiculous amount lately, and I'd rather go to a real Mexican place or at least an alternative fast food place with that in mind...the other day I would have had to spend about 9 dollars to really get everything I wanted. I might as well go to Chipotle, or an actual Mexican place at that price)."

spicy,34yurr,ExEvolution,2,Tue Jun 2 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"Late to the party, but I thought I'd chime in because I was pleasantly surprised by this sauce. It still wasn't close to what I would call a 'good' hot sauce, but the heat is at least noticable, whereas the fire sauce isn't even as hot as tobasco. The new sriracha quesaritos (sp?) are good too, check them out if you haven't already."
spicy,34yurr,LaserTycoon27,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"Necropost, but I think I'm immune to it, everyone keeps saying its hotter than they expected, but I literally can't feel it.

spicy,34zila,Tsilent_Tsunami,1 point,Wed May 6 02:07:16 2015 UTC,It was like 3 months ago or so.  I'll have to consider his honey.
spicy,34zila,MrDonamus,0,Wed May 6 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"He took a short break while he moved to my old stomping grounds (in the shadow of three mile island), then restarted everything shortly after. I recently got some of his Killer Swarm, and have my eye on that Atomic Purple (heh, TMI... ).  Also, don't worry about not sending those Carolina Reaper seeds. I ordered a 10 pack this year, and they sent me 6 extra packs and three other kinds. Something about ordering on Feb 14. Oh, and a big sample of the Carolina Reaper Mash, which forced me to go back and order a big jar of it. Whew. Hot stuff."
spicy,34zila,Tsilent_Tsunami,2,Sat May 9 01:47:35 2015 UTC,Holy shit I completely forgot about that.  I feel like an ass now.  That mash looks awesome.  I might have to get me some.
spicy,34zila,MrDonamus,2,Sat May 9 02:20:55 2015 UTC,"Haha, no problem. Worked out in the end. Plants are about 4"" tall now, and ready to move to pots from rockwool cubes.   Yeah, that mash is probably the best heat per $ value I have."
spicy,34zila,Smultronstallet,2,Fri May 15 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"Right on man.  I got some Jigsaws growing and a couple ghost/scorpions as well. I had a few other things planted, but dumbass me left them out in the sun too long and killed them all.  Just planted orange scotches.  Jawala fingers are next.  Hit me up in a few months and I'll be sure not to forget about you this time lol."
spicy,34zila,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Sat May 16 04:46:47 2015 UTC,"If all goes well, I'll have some Aleppos, Trinidad Chocolate Scorpions, and Urfa Bibers to exchange. (besides the reapers)"
spicy,34zila,Terrance_aka_Magnus,1 point,Sat May 16 19:25:36 2015 UTC,Huh.  Never heard of urfa biber or allepos.  They sound pretty tasty.
spicy,34zila,LuckyDogHotSauce,2,Sun May 17 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now if the ocean fog would go away so I could have night temps above the low 50s, that would be great. This is a downside to living in a beach town. *sigh  ¯\(ツ)/¯"
spicy,34zila,Tsilent_Tsunami,2,Sun May 17 22:54:18 2015 UTC,"Haha damn that sucks.  I live in the deep south, so temperature here isn't much of a problem."
spicy,34zila,LuckyDogHotSauce,1 point,Sun May 17 23:02:42 2015 UTC,His website and facebook page are still active. I have no idea what happened to his reddit account.
spicy,34zila,Tsilent_Tsunami,1 point,Tue May 5 22:39:25 2015 UTC,"Still a mod here. And still in business. Didn't know he was missing.   Now I'm wondering how many accounts he has.  Wouldn't it be weird if there were only 4 unique users in this forum and the rest of the 23,201 were KoP?"
spicy,34zila,LuckyDogHotSauce,5,Wed May 6 03:07:17 2015 UTC,this entire sub is just KoP having conversations with himself  like this one right now
spicy,34zila,heathotsauce,-1,Wed May 6 20:29:28 2015 UTC,Lmfao
spicy,34zila,Tsilent_Tsunami,1 point,Wed May 6 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"His ""Poon"" account is shadowbanned, but mods can overrule a shadowban in their own sub. Regardless, that account has been replaced by the ""pods"" account."
spicy,34zila,LuckyDogHotSauce,0,Sat May 9 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry - forgive my ignorance, but what is a ""shadowban""?"
spicy,34zqw1,VegetableRights,1 point,Tue May 5 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"yes, and yes, and yes, and yes"
spicy,34zqw1,Babelfish-,1 point,Tue May 5 23:24:32 2015 UTC,So you don't like it?
spicy,34zqw1,Babelfish-,1 point,Tue May 5 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"I don't like naga, I love it."
spicy,34zqw1,The-Chilli-Geeks,1 point,Tue May 5 23:36:40 2015 UTC,"Spread that on some cheese on toast, it's amazing!"
spicy,34xk4a,MissBanknote,2,Tue May 5 11:53:57 2015 UTC,That Da Bomb is ridiculous. I barely had 1/10th of a teaspoon and was in agony for about 10 mins.
spicy,34xk4a,omen2k,1 point,Wed May 13 10:01:08 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. They say that stuff is about 120,000 Scoville units, which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Gets those endorphin's flowing though."
