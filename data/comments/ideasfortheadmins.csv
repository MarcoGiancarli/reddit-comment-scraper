ideasfortheadmins,3e2jkp,Muchoz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:32 2015 UTC,'Use subreddit style' is an RES feature.
ideasfortheadmins,3e2jkp,bsimpson,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"And IIRC the next version of RES has a few new useful body classes slated (woot!), some of them probably have to do with the style as that'd be useful and likely suggested in /r/enhancement.  (Although on the reddit side there's the 'Show this subreddit's theme' checkbox for gold users... That one's AJAXey though so it probably wouldn't add a body class till after a page reload anyways)"
ideasfortheadmins,3e2jkp,noobit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm. How would this interact with user themes or such?  I noticed you also maintain subreddit CSS, it might be worth pointing out on your page that gold users can set their theme to a subreddit's that uses that theme, as that makes pages load more nicely (and with a bit less overhead than an extension).  For now, since subreddit stylesheets are maintained as their own files and loaded in a fairly predictable way, it probably wouldn't be too tricky for you to test whether any subreddit CSS was loaded onto the page, via JS - this would handle checking for the reddit-side preference at any rate.   Checking if the user has picked a stylesheet with their 'use subreddit style' is, as bsimpson pointed out, RES-related rather than reddit related."
ideasfortheadmins,3e2jkp,noobit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:32 2015 UTC,Thank you and /u/bsimpson for pointing out that checkbox is an RES feature. I have used RES ever since I became a redditor a couple of years ago (I create a new account now and then). I guess I will have to use JS which I tried to avoid as it doesn't provide that nice of an experience.

We'd love to do it but at the moment we don't have the resources to dedicate to it. One day hopefully!"
ideasfortheadmins,3dyes0,gooeyblob,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"Could you simply hide .collapsed form.usertext using a method other than display: none;, maybe witha hidden overflow instead?  It would at least allow the ctrl-f searched to point us in the right direction.    Or even better, if not trickier to implement, recreate the ctrl-f function via JS and expand the comments when the words are focused on via the search bar. At least that way you're naturally constraining the search to the thread and offloading the work on the client.  Just a thought.  I'm happy with ctrl-f behavior currently."
ideasfortheadmins,3dyes0,WorseThanHipster,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:21 2015 UTC,I'm not a frontend guy so I'm not totally sure what you mean - are you saying to load all the comments but place them in the page so they are hidden from view but searchable?
ideasfortheadmins,3dyes0,gooeyblob,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"On phone sorry.  Just saw' trainwreck' , it's a hoot.   I mean, when 'display:none;' the browser doesn't render them at all., so you can't search the text. That's also why you shouldn't use it to cache images either. If you just hide overflow or some other technique (ask your front guys, there are a few), the html is still rendered, therefore searchable with ctrl-f or JS, without having to send any requests to the backend."
ideasfortheadmins,3dyes0,WorseThanHipster,5,Tue Jul 21 00:12:52 2015 UTC,"The issue with that is we want to limit the number of comments we actually put in the response, both so we don't have to process so many on the backend (i.e. retrieving from storage, sorting and applying filters, etc.) and also so we don't send back an enormous chunk of HTML. That's why we have the 'load more comments' links around, so we can do paging. So unfortunately I don't think putting all the comments in the page will be an option.  There's no great way to do this at the moment so we'll just have to wait and see if we have the resources to do it in the future!"
ideasfortheadmins,3dyes0,gooeyblob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm fine with your pagination and I totally get it.  I am only referring to collapsed comments.  It'd be nice if we could still search them with ctrl-f, although it'd be clunk and unintuitive so n/v."

ideasfortheadmins,3dyes0,gooeyblob,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"Since they've said that they don't currently have the resources to do so, the next best thing is to use RES's ""never-ending scroll"" to load all the comments in a thread by simply hitting the ""Pg End"" key/combo a few times along with the ""load more comments"" button. Then you can Ctrl+F through all comments, although it excludes comments that are hidden due to downvotes.  Never mind! Sorry. Loading the whole thread manually doesn't take that long, though."
ideasfortheadmins,3dyes0,magicwhistle,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"RES never ending reddit doesn't apply to comments, just post listings.   Maybe invest in Reddit gold so you can load more comments at once."

If you're going to limit the time in which a title can be changed to a very short period, then you might just as well have the OP delete their post and resubmit it with the corrected title."
ideasfortheadmins,3dy6ay,pauliedigi,5,Mon Jul 20 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"IAmA would (and still does) farm a lot of content out to other subs. A rising tide raises all boats. We worked really hard with Victoria to make sure the tide rose across reddit and that AMA as a brand across the site was strong.  You get better talent if they see AMAs all over as strong.   The PR teams that run socials for people are generally posting on the person's behalf. That paradigm doesn't work with reddit because if you don't post as yourself you get lynched. The talent that comes here doesn't really have the time or interest for social media. They just know it as one of those things you're supposed to do.   The best way to introduce them to the site is to have them for an hour or two for an AMA and walk them through it. That's how you build relationships across that industry. They're all friends and work with each other - if one has a positive experience they tend to share it. Peter dinklage did one because a kid who worked on set with him said it was fun, for example.   Facilitating AMAs the way Victoria did also brought in scores of new users. Everytime a celeb or public figure tweeted or promoted their AMA it was free advertising for people to come become redditos and they got to feel like they really connected with someone they adored.   Those are the kind of interactions that build the site."

If celebrities were forced to learn the platform themselves (or hire their own help), they will be more likely to make a long-term commitment to the reddit community.   What percentage of decreased AMAs is worth this to you? Because so many celebrities that would do a Victoria-style AMA won't do this."
ideasfortheadmins,3dy6ay,zck,0,Mon Jul 20 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"valid point... I guess reddit can't turn away major celebrities if they need help.

I'm lucky that I can be. But there is a huge difference between browsing casually, and writing comments every now and then, and spending hours upon hours on the phone teaching people reddit or providing the assistance they require. Even though I enjoy providing the assistance, it is just not feasible to do it as would be necessary.

No one would have protested if management had someone else to fill in rather than leaving everyone in a lurch.   If AMAs bring in money, then they should hire at least 2 people to do that job. Admins should also be more responsive to the mods,  which was another reason Victoria being fired resonated with the mods, and caused shut downs. She was the only admin who actually cared or for back to anyone.   The fact of the matter is that the Admins have been terrible. Hopefully, they understand what they did wrong, and learn to anticipate the users and mods reactions to their actions.   If you expect AMA hosts to adapt and care about reddit and how it works, you will be leaving lots of money on the table.   If you expect a 3rd party PR firm to not try to maximize the benefits of the AMA, regardless of how truthful it is or if it hurts reddit, then you do not understand PR.

ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,AsAChemicalEngineer,7,Sun Jul 19 04:15:14 2015 UTC,"Lol, I knew that quote would start getting around. Saw it this morning. I'd rather just kick them off and whether the storm for a few days, FPH's steam ran out, so will these people. Rip the bandaid off, take a shot of vodka and wait for the pain to blow over.  Anyway, if that's your intent, I doubt the admins will go for it. They've decided to not kick hate-speech off their platform, I don't think they're going to cowardly try to squeeze it away."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,noobit,6,Sun Jul 19 04:18:57 2015 UTC,"They should give all hate speech subreddits the ""streamlined posting"" feature from reddit mold: http://www.redditblog.com/2011/03/reddit-mold-is-now-live.html"
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,justcool393,4,Sun Jul 19 04:58:19 2015 UTC,Since they're not here to misappropriate the quote I'll do it for them   First they came for the confederate flag cursors...
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,noobit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:02:31 2015 UTC,"...and I did not speak out, for I hate annoying cursors.  Then they came for the CSS, and I did not speak out, for I have styles globally disabled.  Then they came for the self post text limit, and I did not speak out, for I only link things.  Then they came for me. And there was no one left to speak for me."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,Arkyance,2,Mon Jul 20 05:14:49 2015 UTC,FTFY

ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,Arkyance,5,Tue Jul 21 05:19:28 2015 UTC,"Nobody is being enticed into racism because of neat CSS, there's no cool, edgy factor to it like cigarettes ever had. Cunts will be cunts, no matter how you make them cunt about."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,noobit,8,Sun Jul 19 10:47:38 2015 UTC,"there's no cool, edgy factor to it like cigarettes ever had.    That's actually completely wrong. It's so universally despised that, among some youth, it can be an edgy, rebellious thing to be/do. High Schoolers are little shits, after all."

ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,aqua_zesty_man,4,Sun Jul 19 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"I have to admit to a fair amount of bias, as I'd rather just see them pay for their own hosting rather than mooch reddit's (especially when reddit already has load problems and plans to cut those subreddits' ability to donate to them), but I like this idea.  Actually. Since they're not paying for reddit's server load, I could see a fair argument being made for taking away stylesheets and even (say) lowering the text cap to back to what it was for subreddits with links enabled - basically, taking measures to reduce those subreddits' impact on reddit's server load.  I know from my own experience (and common sense) that it's a marginal reduction, but it's one that would be justified in that those communities can't and won't allay server costs at all."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,TRVDante,4,Sun Jul 19 14:09:18 2015 UTC,Intolerance means nothing if you only tolerate what appeals to you.
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,TRVDante,0,Mon Jul 20 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"You tolerate speech that doesn't appeal to you, right? You support the right of those speakers to publish newsletters, converse on mailing lists, and so on, right? But, does consistency with this philosophy require you to host their discussions in your living room, or to pay for distribution of their pamphlets? Of course not.  Just like you can be a free speech supporter while telling unappealing speakers to pay for their own pamphlets, to hold their chats in their own living rooms, it's no abrogation of free speech obligations for reddit to tell hate-speech forums to conduct their discussions somewhere else."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,TRVDante,3,Mon Jul 20 02:20:53 2015 UTC,"I was not questioning the validity of the property rights of Reddit's owners, or their free speech rights. I was pointing to a different important issue. Goodwill and reputation must be earned. It is okay to take a stand on an issue as a private entity and it is okay to take no stand as an entity who explicitly has no opinion. But if Reddit wants to be thought of as impartial and vaguely libertarian in its approach to the world arena of ideas, then it cannot talk out of both sides of its mouth.  That is what suggestions like these are putting on Reddit, to wear the mask of impartiality on certain opinions, if they are mainstream and palatable to Redditors (a broad spectrum of tolerance to be sure), but then to go back on that same philosophy when a certain group still manages to offend the unoffendable."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,TRVDante,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:35:23 2015 UTC,"If you don't like that you have to share a site with these people, why don't you just go somewhere else and found a ""hate-free"" alternative to Reddit?"
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,CuilRunnings,3,Mon Jul 20 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"I believe the reddit leadership wants to find a way to bring back the original no-hate-speech policy, and so I'm hoping to demonstrate to them that the vast majority of the userbase of this site would support such a decision -- in particular, the vast majority of the moderators of non-negligible subreddits."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,tyrroi,0,Mon Jul 20 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping to demonstrate to them that the vast majority of the userbase of this site would support such a decision   Even though most of them don't? The average redditor right now will always err on the side AGAINST deleting content. If you want to get rid of Coontown, you need to convince most of Reddit that some content needs to be removed for the greater good, otherwise shit will hit the fan again and again. The average redditor is not impacted by Coontown. Coontown does not ruin their reddit experience. And the latest moves from the Admins make it even harder for Coontown to potentially ruin their experience. You need to find a way to convince the average redditor that Coontown and the hateosphere are actively a problem for Reddit, because so far they really aren't convinced."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,MyNameIsOP,3,Mon Jul 20 19:51:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I think you're out of touch. If you'd like to prove me wrong, start a ""don't ban coontown"" campaign, and see how many default subreddits you can get to endorse it."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,Measure76,0,Mon Jul 20 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying people are going to actively defend coontown. I'm saying that people just don't see it as being so awful that it HAS to be deleted for the good of Reddit as a whole. That being said, I'd love to start a ""We don't give two shits about coontown and meta-reddit drama, don't talk about it here"" campaign if I wasn't stretched thin enough with personal projects already- I suspect that would catch on fairly quickly given how everyone and their mother is tired of the drama and the infighting."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,hamfast42,3,Mon Jul 20 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Sincerely, I hope you do start such a campaign -- everyone who signs it would be an ally in the message of, ""hey reddit management: your users won't revolt if coontown is banned"", which is really the point I'm trying to convey in all this."
ideasfortheadmins,3dspli,lalala253,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:28:18 2015 UTC,Why are you even so hellbent on getting Coontown banned? How does it affect you?

ideasfortheadmins,3duhpd,Belfastlad1,4,Sun Jul 19 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"incidentally - only the last 1000 posts/comments are actually indexed on your profile, meaning this wouldn't necessarily show your first posts on the site.  Someone recommended allowing users to read their first comment ever (which I thought was a neat idea) and I've requested a download feature a la google's Takeout (mentioning it could be a paid thing to offset any costs it might incur), hopefully reddit will give us something in terms of retrospection when more pressing issues are out of the way."

ideasfortheadmins,3drl9b,OneRedSent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:54:23 2015 UTC,Reddit Enhancement Suite. You can download it as a browser extension that provides more functionality to reddit. And it does include subscribing to threads but you have to click each one manually.
