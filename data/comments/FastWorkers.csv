If somebody doesn't wash their hand properly, I'd assume they don't keep their gloves sanitary properly.

Ammo guy stands around, guy to the left of the gun checks (I assume) that there are two bags left on the string -> others are in the casing, thing has the right amount of oomph. Gives the all clear to the whole crew. Loader loads, tells the firing dude it's loaded and he's clear of the backswing, left side dude tells him he's alright, dude fires (sometimes on an exact second mind you), if the gun fires normally, repeat.

FastWorkers,3bppln,XM525754,16,Wed Jul 1 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"Powder bags, the round comes with 7 bags inside.  Depending on how far they want the round to travel/arc the gun is informed by the fire direction center how to build the rounds and where to aim for each fire mission.  I don't remember all the elements but it's the   Round (i.e. High Explosive, Illumination) Charge (# of powder bags to leave in the shell) Fuze (whether or not to set the fuze to explode the round on impact or mid air [X.X seconds after the round leaves the tube]) Quadrant (elevation) Deflection (left-right)"
FastWorkers,3bppln,JIGGLY_BALL,2,Wed Jul 1 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, But why are they going from one guy to the next then getting thrown? Are they just in case they need to adjust something? Also, It seems a bit reckless to just be throwing bags of propellant over one's shoulder though I am unfamiliar with what they use to push shells down range so it could be more stable than I'm assuming."
FastWorkers,3bppln,LORD_ZARYOX,24,Wed Jul 1 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"So there are 7 bags all connected by a string, if the fire mission calls for charge 5 then the ammo man will prep the round with 5 bags in the shell and 2 hanging outside.  This allows the chief to verify the powder charge (7-2=5), so he knows if 2 bags are hanging outside the shell then the ammo man has correctly prep'd a charge 5 round. Army regs state that the section chief must verify every setting on the gun before it is fired. These guns can fire up to 7 miles away (and thats without a rocket assist), so if the gun is slightly off then a small deviation can be very dangerous to the forward observers at that distance.  The powder bags are being slung because it is not traditional gun powder in those bags, and it is quite stable. The propellant is these little pellets filled with holes that look and feel kind of like small pieces of hard plastic.  Anyway, on our gun we always had a trash can in the truck to store equipment, and after we laid our gun we made sure to empty the trash can and set it aside to hold unused powder bags.  The powder bag trash cans were usually lit at the end of a live fire exercise (LFX), and when it was cold outside it would keep you warm.  Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3cWfT60bIw  Edit: I should also clarify that these howitzers do not spit out flame from the breech.  The only flame you can see will come out of the business end of that cannon.  One part of this set that you don't usually see is that there is a very small ammo station right next to that gun.  This is the area where the ammo man preps each round for a fire mission.  Since he's sitting over there with shells/powder bag readily accessible, it is very much prohibited for there to be any open flame near the firing line.  No cigarettes, no camp stoves, no propane heaters."

FastWorkers,3bppln,watchoutacat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"The guy loading the gun always stays in the trails. His job is to load the round, and then put the backs of his legs up against the sides of the trails, that is when he indicates to the section chief that he is ready."
FastWorkers,3bppln,JIGGLY_BALL,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:15:14 2015 UTC,That is the primary danger for the guy in the trails.  And that right there is why he is required to be up against the sides of the trails before the gun is fired.  People have had their hands shattered because they didn't move it away from the breach before the gun was fired.
FastWorkers,3bppln,JIGGLY_BALL,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what scenario you are describing.  The entire process for loading a 105mm round (i mention this because loading a 155mm round is different) in the breach is:   Receive round from ammo chief Hold round with both hands until given instruction to load the round in the breach Load the round in the breach and keep the round from falling out by pushing your fist up against the base of the round, keeping your body out of the 3-foot-long recoil zone.  Say ""close, close, close"" over and over until the assistant gunner closes the breach. Assistant Gunner will close the breach forcing your hand to move up along the base of the round (you'll notice in the original gif that there is no a-gunner, he would be sitting by the wheel on the far side of the gun, so in this gif the loader is closing the breach himself, as they appear to be a man short of a full crew) Once your hand is clear, make sure your legs are pressed against the trails, body facing inward toward the gun perpendicular to the recoil zone, making sure that all your limbs and gear stay away from the recoil. When the gun is fired the assistant gunner will open the breach, ejecting the round, grab the round and toss it in the pile, usually right behind the Assistant Gunner.   In order for a round to be fired off without the lanyard being pulled would require a spark inside the shell or something hitting the firing pin."
FastWorkers,3bppln,JIGGLY_BALL,19,Mon Jul 13 18:34:26 2015 UTC,It's candy. Risk reward bro
FastWorkers,3bppln,Theeasy6,4,Mon Jul 13 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"The M119 uses ""semi-fixed"" ammo. Semi-fixed means you have the bullet and a casing that looks like a giant bullet shell, which are loosely coupled together- you can just lift the bullet out.  At one point in the GIF you can see a guy handing  what looks like a big bullet with some sacks hanging out by a string to the guy on the left. That's the explosive round and the shell casing for it.  Inside the brass shell casing, at the bottom, is a primer- it looks like a long tube with holes in the side. When the primer is struck, it shoots jets of hot gas out the holes into the casing.  The distance a round will travel is based on the amount of powder behind it (charge) and the angle of the gun (quadrant).   Since there is no way to know how far a shell will have to go when making them, they're all shipped with a full set of charges. These are called by numbers (charge 3, charge 4, etc). The charge used is basically the cumulative bags for that charge- so charge 5 uses the charge 5 bag and all the ones before it, but the ones above that charge are discarded.  When loading the round, the ammo guy will be told the charge via  a command (from me! well, relayed through the gun chief), like ""CHARGE FIVE!"". He'll load the charge into the shell, put the round into the top, and will leave the excess charges attached, but hanging outside the shell.  When the gun chief or the responsible NCO is ready to load the round, he'll inspect it- you see him do this and then rip off the excess charges to be discarded. This is to make sure the round being fired has the right charge behind it, which makes the difference between the round landing on the target or two kilometers further than it should.  The excess bags of charge are burned when all is said and done."

FastWorkers,3bppln,steggun_cinargo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:41:36 2015 UTC,The excess bags of charge are burned when all is said and done.   Why not make new strings out of them?
FastWorkers,3bppln,asr,2,Wed Jul 8 03:36:00 2015 UTC,"The charge increments are not all the same size, and attempting to reuse them would result in someone screwing up somewhere and then someone getting killed because a shell had the wrong charge. Also, every shell is shipped with a full set of charge bags so you'd end up with a lot of excess charges that are dangerous to haul around- even though it's pretty stable stuff, it's still flammable and could cause explosions if ignited in a confined space.  When I was in the military we never moved excess charge bags by vehicle; imagine you're hauling a bunch of excess charge bags in a hostile environment and your convoy is attacked- that's a hell of a risk to be carrying the stuff.  Rounds are shipped in crates with their casing and charges. Fuzes are separate because they can be of a variety of types depending on the mission- timed, point detonating, proximity (""VT""), and other kinds."

It's incredibly dangerous to work with a knife in that manner, not just for his fingers but people within throwing distance of that wet knife. Also, he isn't paying attension to anything around him, he's ""in the zone"" if you will, but I don't think attentive of his surroundings, and the waste on the product alone, it's inefficient. Nothing is proportional, he is actually taking the lazy way by blasting through this, if corrections are made then it's added time. Idk, from a scientific management standpoint, it isn't very productive, even if he does it in record time. One accident and a lost thumb will quickly set-back any gains made in labour or other inputs of production."

FastWorkers,3bhn6x,JaFFsTer,3,Sun Jul 5 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"He isn't fully capable of preventing an accident, as I outlined, because that encompasses more than just cutting himself, it's coworkers in the vicinity and product handling, on top of his own safety. Sure, it's a niche and he got really good at it. If he was doing that in my kitchen, it would end real quick. Flash is insignificant when safety is an issue, save your flair for the product you put out, why not try to refine your cuts (instead of blasting through at an uncontrollable pace) and ""wow"" your guests with food that has effort put into the plate, not wildly pacing through prep items in an effort to ""wow"" your coworkers.

FastWorkers,3bhn6x,WarrenPuff_It,-10,Mon Jun 29 22:54:41 2015 UTC,"So, you're wrong on pretty much every aspect of what you just wrote.  I'm guessing you've never working in a volume kitchen before.  1) It's not 'incredibly dangerous' to work with a knife in this manner.  The guy obviously has extensive experience working with his knife and clearly can operate it safely - seeing as he has all his fingers and he's still allowed to use it that way.  The man has good grip and a technique that allows him to safely work quickly.  Literally the dream of every restaurant owner.  2) Time cost associated with cutting that many lemons is normally huge compared with the 5 or 6 dropped/missed lemons this guy had.  He's DEFINITELY saving bossman money by doing it this way.  3) He's 'in the zone' because he's experienced and confident.  He didn't just pick up that knife last week.  He's got the ability to do this after a long time practicing.  4) The cutting of these lemons is most likely for juicing, in which case he's not wasting anything and he's incredibly efficient.  What do you mean by proportional, either way?  He's cutting them in half, most likely for use in a press juicer.  Not uncommon for bars or places that sell lemonade.  Again, he's clearly not inexperienced, this method works for him and he's quite good at it - and most assuredly not ""lazy"".  5) ""Added time"" for the 5 dropped lemons would be approximately 8 seconds, including the time to bend over and pick them up.  Far less time and it would take someone to cut them on a cutting board.  Again, the exact word to describe this method is 'productive'.  6) He is clearly experienced enough that he's going to simply make fewer errors than a less experienced person.  He will most likely not cut himself.  He probably has, but he probably won't again."

This method is speedy, efficient, relatively safe and involves as little wasted time and material as you could possibly have when processing lemons.  I'm not going to argue the point with you because you clearly don't understand even the most basic idea of what this guy is accomplishing other than cutting lemons quickly.    I mean, look beyond the culinary aspect of it and you clearly can tell this isn't the guys first rodeo - he uses this method because it's all the things I described it as.

FastWorkers,3bhn6x,AnotherGoAtIt,2,Mon Jun 29 20:23:11 2015 UTC,"Basic, day 1 fundamentals, lesson numero uno, you take care of the knives. If chefs bring their own, you don't touch someones knife unless they tell you you can. That also goes in line with lesson 2, don't wildly wave a knife around. That's just basic common sense, not even for restaurants like why even do that at home?  One cut would contaminate that entire load. At the speed he is going there is no time to stop a flying lemon when you've just cut your finger in half, thus ruining the full load, but... it's probably a safe assumption that something like that has happened before, seeing how his colleagues aren't bewildered or trying to stop him.   Which would lead me to believe that blood has gotten in a batch at least once while he learned to do that, and that's a conservative guess. You don't learn to cut without one day cutting yourself by mistake, usually really good. Plus his coordination would take some time to hone, so 1 is just for the sake of logic, it's hard to tell without first hand accounts. Your cuts are like war wounds for the BOH. Everyone has a story of either themselves or someone else getting hurt really bad.   As examples, over the years after working at various establishments, I myself have cut my fingertips by mistake a few times, nothing too bad. But I always tried to work in places that had legit staff, you end up shopping around for names and sliding into places based off word of mouth. As a result, you see some crazy/stupid people do some stupid stuff. I have seen it live or worked with someone who:   Coworker deep-fried their hand grabbing a watch.  Coworker frontflipping off a ladder because they stood on the top step to reach a bin of food.  Coworker full-body belly-flop on a running flattop covered in oil.   Coworker sliced their palm open end to end cleaning a knife. First thing at noon, start of a lunch shift, one coworker poured scalding broccoli-cheese soup by mistake down a coworkers back, inside their jacket. Coworker pulled a stock shelf down on themselves being lazy and not using a ladder for counts. Meats, sauces, all gone. On like a Thursday night, so just imagine that Saturday. Coworker didn't have space for a rice-cooker while they were using a meat slicer, so they put the rice cooker on the stock shelf above the station. The cord though, hanging in between the outlet and the cooker, which was right in the middle. Not paying attention and trying to power through a prep list, they meat sliced the cord when it got yanked by the slicer-arm. Basically I can describe it as sparks, lots of blue sparks, oh and the breaker flipped.  One guy had to carry roughly 100 20oz water glasses, all stacked in racks, into a basement storage room. The stairs are a precarious obstacle at this place, they turn 90* halfway down. The racks of glasses fit together like Lego, super easy to carry but the weight adds up with each tray. When you're busy, sometimes guys will try to carry 3-4 racks at a time, which makes seeing anything in front of you impossible, like moving a small futon by carrying it. One guy tries to power through the job, takes one step on the stairs with 3-4 racks in arms, and then trips and surfs the broken glass all the way down the stairs with his hands and knees. The replay on the security cam was fantastic.    I got more, from some of the looser places I've worked. One common denominator with all of them is someone involved was either fatigued (hung over, stoned, overworked rocking doubles) or not following proper safety guidelines for big jobs (cleaning hot fryers, flat tops, doing prep shifts, cleaning or storing product, etc.). Taking shortcuts. Having to go back and correct mistakes because someone wanted to take the easy way in life, instead of picking bean shells they'd rather smash a whole box but waste 20%. Food cost alone would call for them to be fired if it's that wasteful. Blatant waste of the product.   Restaurant margins on some items are killer, but not everything and not every restaurant. Some places even lead-loss items, i.e. deliberately netting a loss because the margins on their compliment items or substitutions covers the loss. If you waste all the profits for the sake of speed, other factors start to slip because you have less profits shift after shift, day after day, year over year. It all goes in the garbage by ruining it or improper portion control. There is nothing controlled about what he is cutting, other than speed. Those cuts aren't equal sizes. Cleanliness always goes in the beginning. You might find your establishment in a bind, and labour budgets start to slip, or you don't hit food cost/labour cost, whatever it is... so you don't pay people to clean when all you focus on is getting the food out the door and then cutting their shifts under 8 hours (I'm summing up some bigger issues here). But you have to do it, the salaried positions carry a lot of load, and when they get tired it starts the cyclical death-grip that burns chefs out.   You are always working, in a fucking hot place next to big metal sharp things that can ruin your face/hands/body permanently if you aren't careful, with a lot of people who didn't go the ""traditional"" route in life. Lots of characters, lots of talent and inspirational figures that you would have the craziest time with, if it weren't for hating each other when you're working in a miserable place with people who aggravate you. Don't get me wrong though, there are a lot of fantastic individuals who make working in hospitality worth it while you're inspired. I would have kept going if I didn't burn out young, but that is beside the point.   TL;DR: smart people cut away from themselves with a knife, holding the tang properly and food guided by either the second knuckles of your other hand or carefully with fingers away from under the knife. You never need to wave a knife around ever, there is no benefit to how he is cutting those lemons other than flash.  Does that count as a better argument?"

Remember every decision a company makes is based on an idea that revenue can be generated from the idea. No one puts man hours into projects for ""the better good"", but for potential revenue opportunities.  So with that basic principle out of the way, Upvoted Weekly is a test project to see how much traffic a link placed on the newsletter can generate traffic to an otherwise stale post. So if they linked this particular post out of the other 9, they will see how much traffic it can generate to a post by being on Upvoted Weekly.   Or, and now hear me out,  It was just a random choice to pick one of out the 10 others.  The analytical side of me hopes its reason A the Redditor side of me hopes its reason B."

Seeing more of the bill is especially effective at rooting out raised notes, lower value bills with boarders indicating a higher value note. More security features will be visible and in general it will be easier to notice bills which aren't as finely detailed. In addition to this the method shown in the video uses contact with one finger to count each note, whereas the 'Western' method moves a bill from the top of the left stack with a thumb to the bottom of the right stack moving over that hand's four fingers. Five fingers touching the bill makes it easier to detect notes printed on counterfeit stock.   This being said, what is shown in the video would certainly be useful counting inventory of already screened bills, especially if there is no money counter available."

In what I've seen (and breifly experienced but I was horrible at it), you're on uneven wild dirt, littered with deadfall, hauling 50 lbs of saplings, and you need to be constantly mentally calculating where you're going to put your next sapling. And it's not just one type, you're likely planting a mix in some given ratio (1:3 spruce to pine), and you're trying to hit a density target as well as picking good spots for the type of sapling you're putting down. Some are more particular about moisture than others. Someone will come up periodically and spot check your densities and ratios and that you're putting the right types in the right place. Also they'll dig a few up to check that you've been careful with the roots at your break neck pace. All this extra stuff, and they're still going as quick as this guy."

FastWorkers,34ev53,bluecado,18,Thu Apr 30 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"Here you go:   1,200 Japanese workers convert above-ground train to subway line in a matter of hours On March 15, 2013, the Shibuya Station Toyoko Line above-ground train quietly shut down for good, to be replaced with a new section of subway track connecting Shibuya Station and the nearby Daikanyama Station. Converting the line from above-ground to underground was a massive operation, requiring a grand total of 1,200 engineers and countless man-hours.  But, even if you’d been living in Tokyo at the time, you probably wouldn’t have noticed the construction, because it all occurred during the train line’s off-hours… over the course of one single night.  In just one night, Tokyu Railways put their proprietary, somewhat clunkily named STRUM (Shifting Track Right Under Method) tech to the test, mobilizing all 1,200 engineers at once to slowly lower the existing tracks along a pre-built incline to connect it with the subway tracks below.  Building the incline required holding the tracks up on temporary scaffolding as the company dug out the earth below, which kind of makes us doubly glad the method held up. In all, with the Tokyu railway’s last train arriving at the Shibuya Station at 1:00 am, and the first train the following morning departing at around 5:00 am, the army of engineers had a vanishingly short four hours to put everything in place and send a few trains on a test run before morning commuters arrived. It’s almost a miracle that everything went smoothly, as with so many boots on the ground and such a short time to accomplish the task, it must have been a logistical nightmare; each engineer required to know exactly which bolt they were in charge of turning.  Thanks to Tokyu’s incredible organization and the commendable teamwork of the engineers, the new section of track from Shibuya to Daikanyama was ready to roll overnight, giving us a renewed respect for Japanese engineering."

FastWorkers,34ccs3,seniorredhat,2,Sun May 3 22:46:11 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they fail a lot.   From east Texas... brother in law is a roughneck/oil field trash, does lots of meth, lost his 3 sons... Every time he comes home he gets clean... every time he goes back to the field he gets back on the shit... Until that one time he brought some back and now I have a meth addicted sister in law."
FastWorkers,34ccs3,fersheezy,2,Tue Jun 9 11:13:46 2015 UTC,"They work HARD for that money. Most weeks you're into OT by the third or 4th day of the week. When I was in the oil field we got job bonuses for each site you worked on. Often times we hit multiple sites per day. New hands got $25 site bonus, supervisors got $250 site bonus. Starting pay for someone with no experience was 12.50 an hour. Seems like small potatoes but when you work around 100 hours a week a thousand dollar paycheck for the lowest guy wasn't uncommon. Once you get up to an operator position a couple of thousand a week was easy.  As far as the drugs go, how do you think they're able to work those long hours? There was more coke than meth floating around where I was. Don't know how they got away with it though, the safety guy was a hard ass and was always popping randoms on us. It was a fast paced lifestyle that only allowed for work. I couldnt take it. Much respect for these guys tho, they are good yet very salty people."

Use of this gas (over compressed air) meant that the guns could spin faster, thus saving a few 10ths of a second.

Second, what does it matter if the average joe gets used to it? That board is objectively dirty and likely to develop bacteria. It doesn't matter that someone living there can handle it.  I've gone to other countries that are traditionally thought as ""dirty"" and never got anything because I ate at places where people didn't fuck around with food like this guy. Contrawise, I've gotten food poisoning from poor hygiene here in the US. Social relativity arguments are bullshit in this situation.    Third, what if they sourced their beef from some other country where even the locals wouldn't be exposed to the bacteria in the beef. Then, even your average joe wouldn't necessarily be protected from food-borne illnesses.    So yeah, I get the point you're trying to make but it's meaningless here when you're dealing with food in this location.

If someone doesn't wash their hands after going to the bathroom and then serves me food, I don't care if that's their standard."

I couldn't tell if there was cycling from the video. I worked in a grocery store when I was 16 to 18 years old. I never stocked the can goods, but had extensive stocking in meat, dairy, frozen, and produce. All of those required constant daily cycling. There was an old man that scoured our store for expired goods. The meat and dairy manager had a side deal with him to sell them at a steep discount. The old man said he rubbed the dates off the merchandise and then sold them for a profit to a homeless shelter."

FastWorkers,2pkh0f,coraal,28,Wed Dec 17 12:20:15 2014 UTC,"What I think is the most amazing thing about line cooks is that there is zero paper trail for the orders - waitresses are yelling out 3-10 pc orders from all corners of the restaurant, and he just stacks it onto the other 20 he's got lined up in his head. I knew a guy - janitor at an elementary school I did some summer work at - couldn't read for the life of him, mostly because he couldn't remember what any of the letters looked like / corresponded to. But he was a line cook on the weekends and he could simply process all the orders like it was nothing at all - blows my mind. You could throw him a list of multi-piece orders, then go back and selectively change things to random pieces throughout the list, and he'd just nod, never once looking up from his workspace (which, of course, was the length of the waffle house), and everything would come out just as you asked for it, no issues."

FastWorkers,2pkh0f,Zanedude,6,Fri Dec 19 00:15:55 2014 UTC,I've never worked in the food industry but is this a common cook surface size for a restaurant that seems so busy?  It seems insanely small for the amount of food they are able to cook all at once.  To me that's the more impressive part of this.
FastWorkers,2pkh0f,cmhdave73,9,Wed Dec 17 15:50:24 2014 UTC,"Yes...yes it is.  Often it depends but you have to adjust as a cook with how many pans, cook surface, oven space whatever to get the job done.  It's a pain but in the end the expectations are still there and people don't give a shit on whether you don't have space or not.    All things considered probably the longest things that needed to be cooked on there are the burgers and the pancakes.  The pancakes will take up the most real estate.  Everything else could be cooked far faster and thus free up space.    If you want to see a more insanely small space, look at the documentary ""I like to kill flies""  Now that space is tiny."
FastWorkers,2pkh0f,orangek1tty,3,Wed Dec 17 17:56:15 2014 UTC,"Generally, one cook will work the flat top and the fryer. There's two people working the flat top in this video which is strange to me. I think that's why is seems so cluttered. As for the size, this is pretty standard. It has to be small enough to minimize the amount of walking that a line cook has to do. When I work, I pretty much just stand still and spin in circles between the refrigerator and the grill. That's kind of how it should be. Also, a cook can only be cooking about 8-10 items at once depending on what they are. Any more than that and things will get burnt, service won't be able to keep up, and the hot food window will fill up way to fast."
FastWorkers,2pkh0f,EatsRedditors4Lunch,2,Wed Dec 17 20:16:28 2014 UTC,"I wish I had it on film for the Karma, I was faster than this guy and most of you are right his eggs do seem very overcooked pancakes too.

Notice how he dances with the tongs, instead of actually piling food on the bread.  Notice how he tries to follow the rhythm when he adds chili and dressing.  Two kebabs in one minute. This isnt a speedrun, its a dance show.  I like his folding technique though. And the spin on the bag in the end. I´m sure he could assemble the kebab faster if he tried."

FastWorkers,2mtxgf,Flobblem,45,Thu Nov 20 14:11:03 2014 UTC,"This is one method that is used in large, time-dependant operations like this one;  The workers do dry runs of all the processes they will need to go through to complete the work.   Each dry run is recorded and timed, and each worker has a number on their back which corresponds to which team in which process they are in, and where they are in the overall order of work that needs to be done.   Each team watches the recording to see how they can streamline their movements or improve their placement while other work is going on. The workers then work on the speed of work.   After months of each team painstakingly improving their times they have each mastered their individual team process, and then the teams come together to master how they interact with each other.   The workers learn how long everything should be taking them, how long other teams are taking and how long each operation should take, e.g. at 2hrs 5 mins team A should be in place B while team C moves thing D to place B, where team A can fix it in place etc etc  After a while such a level of organisation is achieved that the workers can pull off a huge task like the one in the video with extreme precision and speed.  It's all about individual workers and their teams knowing exactly where they need to be and what they need to be doing at any given time."

FastWorkers,2fmmnj,derpotologist,26,Sun Sep 7 00:54:15 2014 UTC,"Don't ever, ever take your typing speed for granted. I attained a modest 100wpm, 110 on a really good day where I was amped without jittery mistakes, and my favorite pastime was just writing. Didn't matter where -- reddit, facebook, my shitty fantasy story on tumblr I hardly update.  Then one time I fell asleep in my computer chair after a night of partying for a friend's birthday. No biggie right? I'd fallen asleep in my computer chair perhaps hundreds of times in my 28 years on this planet.  Well, the way my left arm was on the inside and pressed against the arm/armrest of the chair, I was severely pinching my radial nerve with nearly all of my body weight. Only about two, maybe three hours later I woke up and I was simply unable to move my left hand. It felt like a phantom limb; I could feel my muscles and fingers moving, but looking down.. nothing.  After extensive research (a call to my dad, who'd been an O.R. Tech for 30 years and father was a respectable doctor gave me my answer) I learned I'd developed Radial Nerve Palsy. My left hand had to be kept in a cock-up splint/brace 23 hours a day and I couldn't open one bit.  Imagine then going to try to type.. and your left hand is stuck in a fist.  I was okay learning how to do everything one-handed, but nothing crushed my spirit as much as sitting down to post on reddit and realizing my effortless 100wpm turned into a struggling, sweat-inducing 30wpm.  I had to wear that brace every day from July 20 to my birthday, Feb 13. My birthday present was finally having a full range of motion back -- strength would still be a while, but I could extend my fingers all the way to Shift+6 again. (Compared to around the halfway point, I was excited when I could Shift with my pinky and space with my thumb without accidentally hitting unnecessary Cs or Zs.)  Anyway, obviously it's September now and the most recent typing tests put me at about 90-95. I tell every person I know now not about Radial Nerve Palsy and if they've ever fallen asleep in a computer chair, to consider just how close they may have been to falling victim to the same thing. It only took a couple short hours of a bad position to put me at the typing level of a high schooler (admittedly with mostly one hand doing the work for a long, long time)"

Also, I think people (maybe not you, just in general) tend to think that bodies have a lot of blood loose in the body and that it will just flow when a body is cut. But once the heart is no longer beating there is nothing to move the blood but gravity, so you will usually only see the blood that was in the immediate area of the cut.

FastWorkers,2bg4m4,peanutismint,9,Tue Sep 23 11:17:55 2014 UTC,"On the one hand, this reduces the art of sushi to fast-food. I cringe seeing those pre-portioned nigiri pats lazily slapped with whatever fish is at hand. Considering how our fisheries are doing right now, the last thing we need to do is make customers think high-quality fish comes cheap and easily.  On the other hand.. the lazy seatdweller in me wants every restaurant I work in to be like this. No dealing with customers AND I effortlessly fill hundreds of covers a day? damn."
FastWorkers,2bg4m4,TheAnyKeyIsBack,3,Wed Jul 23 05:55:28 2014 UTC,"I cannot agree with you more.  This does feel like ""fast food sushi"" and I think it does chip away at the art of sushi making.  Then again I don't feel like I even know enough to even make that claim.  I would be interested in seeing trained itamae's opinions.  Any actually, they don't even have to be strictly sushi chefs."
FastWorkers,2bg4m4,BlueKnight8907,7,Wed Jul 23 12:42:33 2014 UTC,"I think it would be best to compare it with BBQ in the south. BBQ could be considered an art as well because of the skill and patience it takes to prepare it. But with a higher skill and labor to prepare it, the price will also be higher. Not everyone can pay for high quality BBQ, and I assume it's the same for sushi in Japan. The same reason BBQ chains pop is the same reason these fast food sushi place exist, there is a demand for a faster and cheap version of the good stuff."

FastWorkers,2bg4m4,itonlygetsworse,1 point,Mon Sep 8 10:04:04 2014 UTC,3-6 hours? You mean 12-15 hours right?  Source: I have my own smoker and I'll be damned if I eat a 3-6 hour pork butt or brisket.
FastWorkers,2bg4m4,H00T3RV1LL3,1 point,Thu Sep 11 02:26:29 2014 UTC,"Whoa, timing depends on many factors. 12-15 hours is a really long time unless you're going with ultra low temps or a lot of meat. I don't want to get into the specifics but you can do smokes at 7 hours max depending on your smoker and many other factors. So certainly you can do it faster than that. Also longer doesn't mean better."
FastWorkers,2bg4m4,itonlygetsworse,2,Thu Sep 11 04:04:17 2014 UTC,"Yes, yes you can. Ribs can be done in 4 hours, chickens as well. You'd be pushing it if you tried to finish a large brisket in 7 hours though. Sure you can crutch it, or crank the heat, but experience tells me that taking my time will produce better Q.  We're still getting away from the high quality BBQ that BlueKnight8907 was referring to."
FastWorkers,2bg4m4,H00T3RV1LL3,0,Thu Sep 11 05:38:03 2014 UTC,"My point is longer != better. You want to assume length makes something better outright or suddenly makes it high quality makes me laugh. Without details I can't tell if your just some BBQ snob who's entire life has revolved around BBQs that take extreme amounts of preparation and taste awesome, or someone who actually understand timing on meats and how temps works and can give an example. Anyways, I don't really care much for this conversation as I don't care about proving you wrong. Yes, some BBQs take a long time. Has nothing to do with quality but more about style of cooking."
FastWorkers,2bg4m4,itonlygetsworse,2,Thu Sep 11 12:12:35 2014 UTC,"Wow, perhaps it's because I just woke up, but you come across as a total dick. I'm not a BBQ snob, but you said ""3-6 hours"". You didn't even specify what you'd be cooking. I did, however, specify different meats and how long they might be done at. BBQ isn't about when the food is cooked, it's about when the meat is ready. On a smoker, cook times vary and tend to be on the long side."
FastWorkers,2bg4m4,fdy,0,Thu Sep 11 17:23:02 2014 UTC,"You also come across as a total dick which is why I responded to you that way.

Now that's my neutral way of leaving this conversation but if you want to shit on me some more because we still ain't talking specifics AND you and I both know its not really worth our time, go ahead."

FastWorkers,27myy5,RegonaldPointdexter,10,Mon Jun 9 02:59:46 2014 UTC,"Warehouse jobs are typically exactly what theyre doing, all day. Occasionally you do it in reverse, but theres really no other duties. Trust me, I currently work at one."
FastWorkers,27myy5,HungryThought,5,Mon Jun 9 03:10:39 2014 UTC,Oh. Well I worked in one too and it was usually handling a load for a few hours and then spending the rest of the time managing loads and sending. Doing exactly what they're doing in the video was close to what we did but it only included a small portion of our days.
FastWorkers,27myy5,Cinnamon_Boots,3,Mon Jun 9 03:43:11 2014 UTC,They're offloading and sorting crates of empty beer bottles. That's usually done in specialized facilities so I'd guess that this actually is what they do all day.

FastWorkers,27n0ep,Mormoran,3,Mon Jun 9 10:07:25 2014 UTC,"It's probably because he's concentrating way hard, trying not to mess up, and he's showing off instead of just doing his job."

FastWorkers,27ip5k,itsJonQ,12,Sat Jun 7 01:42:01 2014 UTC,"Heya guys!  TLDR; The show is called 생활의 달인 (I think) Here's the YouTube search for it.  Sooo, I recently found out there was a Korean show dedicated to super talented workers. The first I saw this show at this Korean restaurant I visited (delicious food by the way.. the owner is super nice!).  The show featured a super fast Takoyaki cook and a girl who was lightning fast at calculating large numbers with a calculator (2 handed as well!)  I asked the owner what the name of the show was.. She didn't speak English very well.. but she said he was called ""Masters"" in Korean.. and it featured workers who were masters in their field of work.  The show is sort of formatted like this..   Show the person do their work super fast/awesomely They demonstrate how they do their work and talk about how they got started (I think.. ) Challenge time.. The might do something time sensitive.. put up against another ""master"", do their job blind-folded.. or all of the above.   Even though I could barely hear the TV (not that it matters anyway.. I'm not Korean).. I was still thoroughly entertained.  I went back today, and I was lucky enough to get one of the servers to type out the name of the show on my phone.  She typed this out on YouTube:  생활의 달인  (Sorry, I'm not Korean, so I don't know what it means).  Jackpot.  I looked this up as soon as I got home, and there they are!  From what I see, not all the clips have fast workers in them.. but some of them definitely do.  Hope this helps guys!!!  P.S. I'm from Toronto. If your curious, the Restaurant I went to is called Ho Shin Tang in the Richmond Hill area. Enjoy :)"

FastWorkers,23xhu7,shrayas,31,Fri Apr 25 15:01:28 2014 UTC,"Huge F1 nerd here. Those two look like they doing a quick inspection of the front wing this time but they usually do 1 of 3 things during a stop:   If the driver is asking for more or less downforce on the front wing, they'll carry a manual wrench or powered wrench (depending on the team budget) to change the angle of the wing. With the latest formulation of tire compound, tire wear usually creates debris called marbles. How bad the marbles are depends on a couple of things like track temperature, surface, high speed turns, driver style, etc. but if they're particularly big, they'll often get jammed between the elements of the front wing severely compromising the aerodynamic efficiency and they'll have to be cleaned out. The other thing is if the front wing is damaged they'll have to replace the entire nose cone."
