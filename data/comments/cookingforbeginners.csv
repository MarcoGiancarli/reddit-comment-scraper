But overall, I view freezing as ""pausing time"", so in theory, yes you'd still have a month left. But why thaw it a month ahead of time?"
cookingforbeginners,3e3512,cryogenetik,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"This right here. Easiest and safest way to handle it is to freeze until day of or day before you need to use an ingredient. I've run into situations where I thaw something with the plan to use it and then life gets crazy and generally it lasts as long as it would when properly stored. However, it's really unreliable to base something off of how much time was left on the expiration before you froze it.  What I'd really like to know is where you're getting chicken or sausage that can be left out for a month."

This is a pretty uncommon thing, though.  Fresh herbs are almost always better.  Dry is just more convenient and cheaper for most folks - and in some circumstances, decently good for the purpose.  (E. g. if a soup recipe calls for just a bit of thyme I can reach into my spice drawer and use up 2 cents worth of a jar that will last me a year or I can go out and spend ~ a buck on fresh, most of which will end up rotting in my fridge until I throw it out.)

I often host dinner parties for friends and one person is hypersensitive to salt. I don't know whether it's psychosomatic or what, but it doesn't matter: part of being welcoming means accommodating requests. The guy basically won't eat anything that has a noticeable level of salt. Hey; it takes all kinds. So my biggest challenge is trying to make things tasty without using any salt.   edit: I love cooking because it takes a bunch of individual, sometimes poisonous, ingredients and it somehow combines them into something that can be just fantastic!

I can't comment on the flavouring as typically shop bought BBQ sauces are too sweet for my pallette. Your chicken may be overcooked though if you are doing it for 35 minutes. I would check after 20 then every 5 mins or so thereafter. It will be dependent on your cut of chicken, the size of it, and how much sauce your pour on.

It might be best if you use the spices and add the sauce once the chicken has been cooked (heat the sauce before applying).   Several people have commented on the oven and bake time.

Lay the foil over the top and push it in the pan about halfway and then pinch the foil around the edge of the pot.

cookingforbeginners,3cotsn,kuntnal,2,Thu Jul 9 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult to mess up stir-fry, IMHO. If you're 'super klutzy,' you just need to have your prep completely ready before you tackle it. This is called mise en place and is a very useful technique. Once you are ready, cook everything in order from longest cook time to shortest.  Slice and prep all of your ingredients first and lay them out in prep bowls on a tray. I find that slicing everything into roughly even strips helps with cooking evenly. (Zucchini and squash, I'll slice into medallions at a bias, just for shape contrast).  Have very hot oil in your pan and cook your meat first.   Take out the meat, add a bit more oil, and start cooking your veg, starting with the one that will take the longest. Season lightly with salt and pepper every time you add a new ingredient.   Finally, when the last item hits the pan, reintroduce your meat to warm. Add your final season with salt, pepper, and a little oyster sauce and you're good!  If you have something like broccoli that needs to be steamed, add a splash of water to the pan and put the lid on after introducing that ingredient. Leave it closed for about 2-3 minutes and it'll be perfectly steamed!"

cookingforbeginners,3cih96,SwagginShire,6,Wed Jul 8 04:09:51 2015 UTC,"OK first of all, how about you try a regular curry, with no weird additives or colorings first. If you've never had it before it seems weird for you to be set on it having to be jet black and extra spicy.   Otherwise, narrow down the regional style you'd like to try. Indian? Thai? Those are in my opinion the most common and well loved styles, and each has a lot of variety in spice blends, meats, and vegetable ingredients. Thai curries tend to be very bright tasting, with ingredients like cilantro, lemongrass, green onion, coconut milk, and chilis, and seafood flavor from fish sauce (essential and tasty, don't be discouraged by the smell it won't make the food taste like it smells). Indian curries tend to taste rather robust and heady, tomato, cumin, onion, garlic, cilantro, garam masala, etc.   There are lots of decent packaged curry mixes or pastes you could find in most major grocery stores. Better if you can get to an Asian supermarket, cause they'll have the really good imported mixes and pastes, not just the ones intended for domestic audiences.   First though, since you've never had curry before, just go to a well loved local restaurant that has it, and try it out. Tell them you've never had it before and that you want something exemplary.   And stop trying to make it black."

cookingforbeginners,3cf0xo,mkj2016,3,Tue Jul 7 12:06:15 2015 UTC,I use them in burritos and omelette rices!

cookingforbeginners,3cf0xo,MarcellusTheWalrus,2,Tue Jul 7 15:53:02 2015 UTC,Make soup: Dice an onion. Heat up some oil in a pan and sauté the onion. Dump in the bag of frozen veg and 2-3 cups chicken broth or water. Add salt. Simmer until veggies are tender.  You can also add them to ramen noodle soup.  Or just steam/blanch and throw it on top of spaghetti.
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,Kirean,9,Mon Jul 6 10:53:48 2015 UTC,Did you put the lid on the pot when it's being heated?
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,Oooh_Friend,3,Mon Jul 6 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"No, but I've also never had to in the past."
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,Oooh_Friend,6,Mon Jul 6 12:10:13 2015 UTC,"Try it this time, the heat won't escape as much and you'll have your preference of boiling water."
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,PeskyAustrian,4,Mon Jul 6 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"Some induction hobs react badly to steel pans by cutting off, it's bloody irritating. You can get special pans and induction hob converters that should help your problem. I had the same issue in my new place and still mourn my gas hob whenever i cook."
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,Wibble201,2,Mon Jul 6 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"This, if it's an induction hob then some pots and pans don't really work well with it, that could be it."
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,dinosnoores,2,Mon Jul 6 22:30:24 2015 UTC,Any specific recommendation for pans? I'm moving to a new place with electric burners whereas I'm currently living with gas and not sure what to expect.
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,PeskyAustrian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:24:02 2015 UTC,"Not really, I picked up a cheap non brand set and they seem to be fine. Amazon is a pretty good place to ask some questions if your looking to buy a more expensive set I'd think. As for the cooking I don't like electric very much if I'm honest. Gas is a much more controllable. Electric hobs take a lot longer time to heat up and cool down which is a bit of a pain. I find myself having to juggle pans around a lot more and remove things from the heat If I'm attempting to time several things to come together at once."
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,BATman5401,6,Tue Jul 7 08:51:13 2015 UTC,"Also, salt, to the best of my knowledge should make the boiling point of the water slightly higher, which isn't a problem normally, but with a lower heat stove top this might be an issue.    And you should be keeping your lid on too! Less heat escaping"
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,tangomango13,7,Mon Jul 6 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"The amount of salt typically added to boiling water is much too low to make a difference in how long it takes to boil. And although you're right salt does raise the boiling temp of water, it also lowers the heat capacity, which means it takes less energy (and less time) to bring the water to boiling temp. I do agree about lidding the pot though.  (Not trying to be an ass, just trying to debunk kitchen myths)  Source: http://www.swri.org/10light/water.htm"
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,BATman5401,2,Mon Jul 6 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks, I love the explanation!"
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,tangomango13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:35:55 2015 UTC,Have you tried different burners?  In my stove each one has different strengths and water just will not ever boil on one of them.
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,lotr818,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:36:27 2015 UTC,I've tried three of the four.  All three match the pot size exactly.
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,ginlas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:02:36 2015 UTC,This happened to me once and it turned out that my pot was warped and there was only a tiny portion of the pot actually touching the heating surface.
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,cameronsheart,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"That may have happened in the move, but I've used these exact pans on both a flattop and a traditional coil stovetop with no issues before."
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,tinabeansy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:53:07 2015 UTC,My glass top does this too. The minute I throw something in the water it boils properly.
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,thrownormanaway,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Is the element heating all the way all the time? I realize that would be difficult for you to personally test, but I have a pretty ancient stove. It will heat all the way sometimes. Other times, it will only heat up a little bit if at all. I would ask your complex to check the calibration since you're not having a consistent cooking experience just in case there's an electrical issue.  I don't know if this would have anything to do with anything, but does this area have a different water supply or different type of water supply than your previous places? Maybe the contents of the water are causing the difference in boil?"
cookingforbeginners,3cafht,DerTanni,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:37:23 2015 UTC,Your comment about superheating intrigues me. Have you stuck a thermometer in this magical water?
