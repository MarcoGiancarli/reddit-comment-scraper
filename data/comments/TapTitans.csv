TapTitans,3e4cb2,FingersFellOff,2,Wed Jul 22 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"Use Yatto's DmgE calculations to best find out how to invest your relics into artifacts. All Damage % is just a number, it's not always a good benchmark of how good someone is. Also, as Yatto.me will tell you, Tincture shouldn't be leveled till you level up your normal artifacts, because it's a multiplier. 10% of 50k% All Damage, is a 5k% boost. 10% of 5k% All Damage, is only 500. Better to spend relics effectively to get to 50k and then upgrade tincture, rather than upgrading tincture first and then the base stats."

TapTitans,3e4b87,Mebas88,4,Tue Jul 21 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"Forget about the relic cost. What is perma clone's purpose? To save you hours and your fingers, and to only need attention every 5 minutes. Great for when you can 1 shot all the way 2000+ and just check in once every 5 minutes to level heroes.  If you're only getting 1.2k relics per prestige, you're below stage 1k. Once you break the DL evolve wall, that's when you can 1 shot through quite a bit of stages when you prestige, so that's the optimal time to start thinking about getting DL."
TapTitans,3e4b87,FingersFellOff,2,Tue Jul 21 21:37:59 2015 UTC,Its a 35k relic investment to get it from 1-90. I'd focus on raising your wall and getting more relics per run before you make the jump.  At 1.2k relics per run would take you roughly 29 runs before you'd get it. I'd try to get that down to somewhere in the 4-5 run range tops for it to really be viable. Its a quality of life thing so you may value it a more than others.
TapTitans,3e4b87,sakux2002,2,Tue Jul 21 21:21:00 2015 UTC,What stage are you maxing at? Sounds to me like your at the Chester wall. Don't even worry about getting permaclone until after you've unlocked Dark Lord. For the time being just try to get your DmgE (on yatto) higher and worry about permaclone later down the road. It's not efficient or worth it at the point your at right now to waste ~25-30 prestiges on SC
TapTitans,3e4b87,datwhiteafrican23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:16 2015 UTC,I am exactly at Chester wall :) I can get to about 510 before I can't kill a boss faster than 5 seconds.

(might be too hard to accomplish right now. Will take some time.)  If you can max Death Seeker at lvl 25, upgrading Drunken Hammer and Heroes Thrust will give a huge boost in damage. (Follow YATTO DMGE for the specific levels.)  Chest of Content + Crown Egg will also help. Use YATTO for this. Don't lvl Crown Egg past lvl 245, which is perma Chesterson. (definitely too hard for you right now. Will take about 377k relics just for Crown Egg)"
TapTitans,3e5dsm,NytmareChaos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"Using yatto to get past your wall would be a better option. But I'd say prestige 2 - 3 times and pump up your relics to UA first. Well that's for me though. But again, use yatto."

TapTitans,3e3784,Jeunepoire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're using the DmgE setting in YATTO, it will never tell you to upgrade UA. That said, you should be putting 1-3 levels into UA each priestige. The reason YATTO doesn't tell you to upgrade it is because it doesn't increase AD by much, and doesn't increase gold gain at all, which is what the DmgE setting is meant for. However, it multiplies the amount of relics you get from priestiging, which is always valuable.   TL;DR: You can never go wrong upgrading Undead Aura."

I don't know the acronym for the category I was looking for in YATTO, it is the mix of gold and damages I think ... I read it was the most effective category when you're not looking for something in particular. But in evey category, upgrading UA wasn't advised if I remember well. Thanks fir your answer again, I'll do as you said :)"
TapTitans,3e3784,BossL1K3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"UA is not listed, because it gives a shit amount of damage and the cost is just over the roof. I currently have UA on 188 and i need for 1 level 25k Relics, compared to AoR at level 589 and the cost to levle it by 1 level is 27k, so its just too much to upgrade.

Since customizations are multiplicative, anything that can multiply your All Damage % by a % is huge. This is a rough order for me, but it went   All Damage > Crit Damage >Tap Damage>Chest Gold>Gold Dropped > Critical Hit   That's how I went through to buy them all, although it's not all just about power. Critical Hit is more important than gold dropped and chest gold, but the returns aren't huge till your HT is a higher level. Critical Damage, while maybe less important than tap damage, is cheap."

This trick is mentioned in the FAQ over at TT_Tourneys, and there are people near 3k over there, and I think Cal said he's tried it, and last time I checked, he's still in normally tournaments. The cloud one getting you caught for cheating will happen when they make the 1 diamond skill glitch a cheating offense."

DmgE = Damage Equivalent... is a calculation this website does. It means that based off the Gold bonuses you get from artifacts(CoC, CEgg, C'sE) and the damage that extra gold can get you is factored into the equation along with the straight up damage from the damage based artifacts(TotM, HT, DH).  It is considered the best way to break  (Edit: didnt finish my thought lol) walls."

Hit Calculate and then scroll down to where it says Steps and look at you will see DmgE in the list of options for steps to follow.
TapTitans,3e2cfc,showyodo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:02:05 2015 UTC,"So again, I only read part of your post, now I've read it all. You would do very well for yourself if you made a YATTO account.   CEgg you should get to level 245 for 100% chesterson chance, Ammy of the Valrunes is useless once you get CEgg to 245 so its not that important.   Elixir bonus works as long as the game is open and running on your phone. If you leave the game you are no longer getting this bonus. Nevertheless it is a very important bonus while you are playing.   FF works always and is a straight bonus to gold, but this one has larger bonuses over the course of levels. My FF is 112 and that's where YATTO has me keeping it currently for the past 25 prestiges.     KS is decent damage bonus + it gives you more gold every time you kill a boss. This is good for lower stages but not so get once you hit your walls. Again, it is still good."

TapTitans,3e0m6y,savastan0,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"People say Make It Rain is temporary. That's mostly true, expect I'm of the belief that if you can break through it once with assistance, 2nd time and every-time after that, you won't need assistance, just time. However, now with artifact seeds and customization seeds, You can't afford it as a free player. You need to spend gems on artifacts first and foremost, then save up to 15k diamonds for every customization, and then atleast 200 diamonds a week on GS unless you do the day 3 dungeon cheat, which isn't even a huge cheat, just depends on your morals.   That said, I spent $200 in my first few days, and with make it rain, I pounded through the walls, and it does help, so if you're a nice sized spender, do it, if not, you can't afford it."
TapTitans,3e0m6y,FingersFellOff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"So if I intend on not spending any money on the game, it would be recommended to save my diamonds for other uses?  Also, could you help me break down my understanding of artifact seeds. So I was able to obtain my artifact number, inputted that onto yatto, and found out the order of which I would receive my artifacts. From there, I toggle around, check how the list would change if I were to salvage a certain artifact, correct? I tried salvaging my tier 4/5 artifacts, but Worldly Illuminator just went further down the list, so my best option is just to keep prestiging until I have enough for it right? It's currently 4th in the list, an accumulated cost of about 3.3k relics which equals 10 or so prestiges if I get 300 relics, which I'm usually getting, per prestige."

Your first set sort of sucks, I think a good number to shoot for is 80, but when we look further, we see you get 2 sets in 132, which is only 66 weapons per set, so that's great. However, your 3rd, once again, sort of sucks. I know the setless masters didn't get their 1st sets in the time it'll take you to get three, but you should try to see 500 weapons in and see if you can get atleast 5 sets by then, preferably 6 or more though."
TapTitans,3e02w1,FingersFellOff,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:17 2015 UTC,sheesh by 500 ill end up with 11 sets and 15 DL weapons :D

I just wish it were someone else---that bird is mocking me!)"
TapTitans,3e02w1,Calrabjohns,2,Mon Jul 20 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"Well, not to seem hopeful, but if the devs do come back, I think there's a real money making opportunity for them here. Add in something like Psychocane's idea, where you go 1v1 a titan and hit them or whatever. I'll explain how they could make money from this, but this would add more weapon drops and make seeds much less terrible if you need 200+ for a set or something.   This is based off of something in Monster Warlord, A game I quit but is a great example of money making. You add in a 1v1 titan, and you fight him, and it's maybe like a world boss. Weapon chance like 0.5% or something even lower, per hit, and then weapons by ranking. But then, you limit the amount of times you can hit it, like a stamina thing, 100 attacks per hour. All you have to do is make a simple option.   You are out of stamina. Would you like to spend 50 diamonds for 100 more stamina?   The numbers obviously can change, but this would be huge. Veterans would have another diamond sink, and newbies would inevitably fall into the trap and blow cash. Hell, even some veterans would spend to keep up with GS+this.   Then, if you really want to do a cash grab, make a wheel or lottery or something. Weapon Upgrades,Guardian Shield, maybe some custom customizations as prizes, and like 100 diamonds to spin it. Game is all RNG anyways, why not?   Anyways, excuse my suggestion rant, they might be bad, I don't know, but I do think there needs to be more weapon upgrade chances, as I, getting my RNG blessing, am on par with people 2x my AD, sometimes more, just because of RNG. Make it a bit easier for them?"
TapTitans,3e02w1,FingersFellOff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:25 2015 UTC,I'll have 10 sets by 501 :P Sadly it's DL holding me back at that point though.

TapTitans,3e02w1,FingersFellOff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:59 2015 UTC,Yeah 2970 is the farthest I've pushed but that was a while ago without using a GS so I'm sure I could hit a bit higher if I really wanted to grind it out.

Echo got lucky this tourney with a top 10 finish, hope we can do it again.   Edit: Lol, just thought it was weird, I got like 25 karma in my first 7 days here, I just got 10 karma today.

TapTitans,3e02w1,FingersFellOff,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's very good, that's just 64 weapons per set, something a lot of people would kill for. In an incremental game like this, your next set never matters, it's your next ten. For example, I got my first set in 50 or so. Amazing, right? No, what's amazing is that at my 500th weapon, not 500 more, exactly 500th weapon, I'll have 13 sets with 35 DL weapons or something. If I ever quit and uninstall and give up my godly seeds, I'll probably never come back no matter what.  But you, you have also been dealt a good hand, so don't fret, your sets will roll in soon enough."
TapTitans,3e02w1,Awesup1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:31 2015 UTC,Actually I was wrong I wrote a wrong seed number (0 rofl) So I now I got the right sequence after using save file viewer: It's gonna be 8 sets @433 and 17DL weapons @473  1st set-67 2nd-148 and 3rd-152.  Now this seems to be really solid indeed.
TapTitans,3e02w1,wooflekat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:56 2015 UTC,Very very long term I have an ok seed.  After 176 I get a weapon set.  After that I think I get a set after in reason able amount of weapons.  By then I'll get 4 DL weps.
TapTitans,3e02w1,wooflekat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think a good number to shoot for is 80   What do you mean? Are you suggesting that people repeatedly delete their save files (how do you even do that safely?) until they get a good seed?  Furthermore, don't weapon seeds start at 0 and only change after the first weapon? If that's the case, then someone has to either play for five days straight in order to get one from a Daily Dungeon, or Prestige once then wait for a tournament day and rank in the top 150.  ...then if the weapon seed is terrible, delete the file and do it all over again.  Even if weapon seeds are determined at the start of a game, it's still very tedious to reset over and over until you get an 80-and-under seed."

You evolve Pixie, then get DL, and just put your money into him.   Only way to break this wall is grind at it and prestige, but maybe I'm stupid, I think you should NEVER invest in UA at a wall. People say it's good because you're getting more relics every time you get stuck and prestige, but, you need damage, not relics. I recommend using Yatto's DmgE tab for the perfect mix of damage and gold artifact leveling, and grind this wall.   I left my UA at level 60 till I broke the wall, and maybe that was too low and extreme, but I see no point in a level 100+ UA till you break this wall, DmgE will be much more useful. And I'm saying all this assuming you have most or all of the t1 and t2 artifacts. If not, please post your artifacts, as those make a huge difference."

TapTitans,3e06vh,Jay_Rizz,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"Evolving DL is your next goal. I evolved Jackalope en route to DL for quite a while. The first time I evolved DL, my AD was 71k%, but your mileage may vary based on your gold.  EDIT: Note that the first time, I had to grind significantly due to my AD. I also evolved Jack as I had 6 Jack weapons, 0 DL weapons, and only 1 Pixie weapon. (The damage per gold invested was skewed by the weapons.)"

TapTitans,3dztyn,George-Dubya-Bush,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"You should be levelling skulptor to 25 then sterling to 25 for their damage boosts.  Once they are levelled buy next hero then go up to your earlier heroes and see who you can level cheaply for perks.  This is the method I use and it works well, you want to level your strongest hero to 10 or 25 depending on if the perks are good or not (best perks are gonna be ones that say ""increases hero's damage by ~%"", ""increases tap damage by ~% of DPS"" and ""increases all damage by ~%""), then buy next hero, then level earlier heroes, then repeat.  Once you get up to around hamlette, however, things will change, you're gonna want to be levelling your strongest hero much more because the amount of money to get to the next hero is gonna be big, these are the ""walls"" that you see people talking about.   Hope this helps!  Edit: Forgot to mention, when you're going back to level lower hero's for perks, ignore the ones that increase that specific heroes DPS, as this isn't useful at all once you have more powerful heroes."

This is huge for that game as it's online only and proved that an OO model is a terrible idea which I hope they won't use for a possible TT sequel :\  Sometimes the cloud save doesn't always work or it reverts to an older one. What platform do you use to play---Android, iOS or Windows Phone?"
TapTitans,3e0h8z,Calrabjohns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:10 2015 UTC,I use iOS. It was fine about an hour ago. Since then it's only the old version. Super odd!

TapTitans,3dz2gy,AMoonGust,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"This really depends on where you are in the game, though generally with the way gold scales (every 4.4 levels the amount of gold you get doubles) it's usually more helpful to level up your highest hero until you get enough gold for the next one up. Again, really depends on where you are in the game in terms of your prestiges, max level, AD%, artifacts owned, etc."
TapTitans,3dz2gy,procrastinarian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"Well i always buy like the first 15 heroes with level 1. Then theres a point where i need to upgrade that hero around 100 or 200 to get the next hero and that goes so on until i need to get everyone to a level where 100 level of that hero costs almost the same as the next hero. E.g. to get pixie with 1 hit perm clone i need to upgrade the past hero to almost x116, and to get Jack i need to upgrade him to around 500 too with around x136 and then get DL. I dont mind the gold at the beginning at all, since the gold is kind of nothing compared to x200 :)"
TapTitans,3dz2gy,BossL1K3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:36 2015 UTC,Depends where you are in the game but usually i would level a hero to 50 then move on to next until you get to Eistor. Only going back to get hero skills (with stars) when the costs don`t really effect your gold amount.
TapTitans,3dyyja,Nek77,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Holy... you don't have CoC or CE.... I applaud you for making it to DL evolve wall without those.. missing 1 is understandable..but both. That's crazy. You need CoC and CE, Ring is junk, but what can we do. If you can afford your next artifact in one prestige, that'd be best, but I think you might actually want to save relics across multiple prestiges, which I know breaks the general rule of never saving relics, but you neeed that gold combo.   Other than that, if you get those, just follow DmgE on Yatto, it'll balance gold and damage artifacts to give you the best balance."
TapTitans,3dyyja,FingersFellOff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"Ok i'm going to save relics... I need 277.7k relics... GOD ! Usually I win 60k relics/Prestige, so I have to past 5 prestige. Thanks you for your help :)"
TapTitans,3dyyja,BossL1K3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"More UA thats what everyone needs here. Around 120 at least, but going up to 140 or 150 isnt too bad too."
TapTitans,3dzriw,Carusun,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:52 2015 UTC,Use wiki please.
TapTitans,3dzriw,BossL1K3,2,Mon Jul 20 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"Like they said use wiki,  but go ahead and level it once or twice,  get a couple others.  It only goes to 5. So you can max after after three or so prestige without really focusing on it."
TapTitans,3dzriw,devoidz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:36 2015 UTC,"Use the wiki, but also get familiar with YATTO  It LOOKS daunting, but it really isn't. Familiarize yourself with it, and it'll help you get what's most efficient for your seeds.  On the seeds note, if you're on Android (not sure about iOS), search the app store for ""Save File Viewer for TT"". It'll read your save file for you, and give you your seeds and other info."
TapTitans,3dxu05,daerellin,4,Mon Jul 20 12:38:17 2015 UTC,"Well---all of the artifacts you have left are valuable imho.  RoWC- When maxed, hero purchase is 50% less than your current costs. So Dark Lord will be like 2.28E+156 iirc instead of around 5.7. And the evolve will come down in price too. I don't know why this is ranked middling but whatever. It has a cap at Lv. 25. I'd get a couple levels in each prestige or whatever you can afford until it's done.  UF- War Cry stinks but the AD is good and eventually---very eventually, a permed Cry when triggered with a Perm. Crit and 15 min. SC and left off Hand of Midas can simulate Perma Zerk which takes 5.9M relics in total (Lvl. 1-590). Perm for Cry and Crit is Lvl. 290 each respectively. Why not just dump all that into Zerk? You'll probably need to grow out your AD but maybe it's something to consider (though I do find Crit useful despite having a little over 80% chance of getting it without the skill).  You know what good CoC will do but your gold is suffering due to no CoC. If if were reversed and you had no CE (Crown Egg), that could be surmounted with stopping at XXXX stage and Chesterson farming. It's a little monotonous but such is the TT path on occasion.   The tired but true adage: Gold gets you to the wall and Damage helps you Kool-Aid that sucker or in your case (mine too) it helps you push that wall back and make room for the breakfast nook you always wanted :p  I'm stymied as to any practical advice to give you to up your gold right now though. Just pump into Crafter for now with UA and buying your way toward CoC. Don't level Crown Egg anymore or if you do, do it sparingly until your CoC can catch up. PermaChesterson might be harmful for you atm.   Question to anyone else that might offer advice: Would it actually be good to pump into Amulet and DC on path to CoC or should he/she just prestige-climb toward CoC?  Edit: At time of writing, there were no comments except one >_<. To people who have already answered, question above. Thank you!"
TapTitans,3dxu05,Calrabjohns,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:53 2015 UTC,"Lol, yeah looks like we posted the same suggestion(ish), but you with better detail ;)  To answer your question posed about Amulet and DC, they are very cheap, but I think he would be better off saving up his relics and buying the new Artifacts ASAP. In ~3 prestiges at 76k relics each he could have the next 2 artifacts and if he gets ring as one he can max that out with 1.1k relics that he will still have left over. going from there as long as he gets chest and ring he could work on those until they are at a respectable level and then get his final Artifact later down the line.  Alternatively, in another 3 prestiges (total of 6 now) he could get the last artifact as well and never have to worry about that anymore."
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah heh :p  I didn't think it'd be a great plan but Amulet and DC see almost no use and this is such an edge case that maybe it could've been a good idea? In reality, I want to smack YATTO whenever it recommends either of those artifacts so probably not lol.  Mind is fuzzy but the information sounds right! Ignore weird Amulet/DC thing."
TapTitans,3dxu05,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"I could actually do all of that pretty easily in a day or 2, so that's a really good plan.  It's going to be obnoxious at first but at least I'll finally have all of the artifacts afterward.  I'm curious to see what gold income looks like with CoC o.0"
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  I think you've just swayed me.  Since I've seriously been playing like 12 hours a day lately, I'm just going to save some relics from one prestige into the next to buy RoWC.  At the moment I have to tap furiously for about 15 minutes to get the last bit of money for Dark Lord's evolution.  Sounds like RoWC would just let me permaclone my way to happiness until I am able to solve my gold dilemma."
TapTitans,3dxu05,wooflekat,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:47 2015 UTC,12hrs a day... I like the devotion ;) I too am crazy and have averaged 2.5 prestiges/day since day 1.
TapTitans,3dxu05,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:29 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest, if I didn't have permaclone I probably wouldn't be playing at all >.>  I just let my phone do its thing while I'm at work, stopping to prestige and go upgrade shopping when necessary."
TapTitans,3dxu05,wooflekat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:58 2015 UTC,"No, it won't. Don't save Relics across Prestiges."
TapTitans,3dxu05,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:56 2015 UTC,I don't know that RoWC will solve that much but it will cut down on time during your prestige runs to upgrade everyone as the opportunities arise. I don't know. I like the ring heh. It was my fourth or fifth artifact---had no idea what I was doing (although CoC has the worst description ever for clarity) but it helped me push when pushing was hard.
TapTitans,3dxu05,wooflekat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know why this is ranked middling but whatever.   It's T3 because that 50% reduction only translates to about a 4.4 stage advantage. In other words, gold drops double every 4.4 stages."
TapTitans,3dxu05,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:09 2015 UTC,"It does more in fewer relics than the Chesterson combo though. Even if the gold drops level out when viewing it against others, it's a modifier in the same way that Crafter's Elixir, FF and Tincture are for their respective categories. The big difference is it has a cap. So far as FF and Ring go, I'd take Ring."
TapTitans,3dxu05,FingersFellOff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's still something, but certainly not as great as some people make it out to be. I wouldn't save Relics for it. 80k of Relics put into DmgE recommendations will probably be more than enough to get 4.4 (or, rather, 5) stages ahead."
TapTitans,3dxu05,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:32 2015 UTC,I guess the utility becomes phased out but it still seems like a time saver for long term investment. Maybe it shines more early on but it helps cut out early stage chaff too throughout. Ehh...
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:01 2015 UTC,"Well,you've already got a great amount of comments, so I doubt I'll be adding much in terms of information, but here's my 2 cents.   -I evolved Dark Lord at 36,000% AD. I didn't break it, I crawled over it. Low AD% doesn't make sense, no worries, just get better and better.   -Like just about everyone else says, your biggest problem is lack of CoC. Without it, your Crown Egg is sort of like Humphrey Dumpy, worthless. Your lack of RoWC isn't really concerning, the amount of relics it'd take to just buy it at this point isn't worth it since it only gives you a 4.4 stage boost in gold, meaning it'd let you evolve DL at 2355 instead of 2359 or whatever.   Focus on DmgE, yes, and maybe focus on UA every 3 prestiges or so. My UA is only level 80 but I'm hitting 2750 right now, so we sort of took opposite paths. Your UA is fine, no need for a higher than level 100 UA till you can break DL evolve wall.   No, you do not need weapon sets or DL weapons to progress. However, they sure damn help. I know someone named Linkxxxx can hit near 2900 with no weapon sets, but he has over 500k%+ AD, so yes, they do help. Cal I think has even less AD% than Link, but with his, I think, 3 sets, he can push to 2940, so if Cal can beat Link by like 50 stages with hit set(s), imagine what it'd do at your level. But, Link, as well as others, are proof that progress is possible without sets, just harder.   I know the general rule is to not save up multiple prestiges for artifacts, but uhm, screw that for now. You need CoC, and UF, while t5 in it's skill duration, is I think the cheapest, or one of the cheapest, source of AD%, and is very helpful when going for raw power.    So, while I know I rambled and said some random stuff, A basic summary I guess. Weapon sets are helpful, but not needed. While I wouldn't normally suggest this, save the prestiges you need for CoC and, in extent, UF. If RoWC is your last one, that's okay, you don't need that really anyways. After that, just follow DmgE on Yatto, and you can either focus on UA 1-2 levels a prestige or dump a whole prestige into it every X amount of prestiges.    Hope this helped and I didn't just restate everything that's been said."
TapTitans,3dxu05,wooflekat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:22:48 2015 UTC,Have 4 sets and currently 591.xx in AD but god damn---2900 with no sets...I thought I pushed >_<
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,0,Mon Jul 20 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"It was mostly reiteration, but important nonetheless :)  I'm definitely going to be getting at least 1 more artifact before I continue on, as YATTO is suddenly telling me that CoC is my next artifact (it was UF before acquiring RoWC)."
TapTitans,3dxu05,wooflekat,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:00 2015 UTC,Ah much better I can see what you have now!   So you're 2 BIGGEST PROBLEMS!  Chest of Contentment(chesterson gold) and Ring of Wondrous Charm(reduce upgrade cost by up to max 50%).   You are hitting this wall and failing where others succeed becuase they need 1/2 the amount of gold that you do to get there and are getting A LOT more gold from Chestersons.   Universal Fissure is also a big one as it adds the MOST +%AD per upgrade(not counting the artifacts that have limits) next to Tincture (which upgrades ALL other artifacts AD).
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:20:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, glad you found your way back :P  Thanks for the info, I think between what you and the others have said here, I've at least got a few solid near-term goals to work on."
TapTitans,3dxu05,wooflekat,2,Mon Jul 20 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"The typical AD for evolving Dark Lord is about 100k%, so your 149k% is still within the same general range. The people who evolved DL at a much lower AD probably did so with great difficulty, even with CE and CoC, so it does no good to compare.  Right now, I'd suggest raising UA to about level 200, while buying a new Artifact whenever you get enough Relics in one Prestige (I got the 29th at stage 2,775 with 225 UA). It looks like you can still get around 10 levels per Prestige, so that means it's fairly low compared to your max stage (for comparison, I normally Prestige at 2,820 and can only afford 3 levels of UA each time).  Unless you find it very difficult to even evolve DL, get as many UA levels as you can with every Prestige, then put any leftover Relics into whatever DmgE suggests. If you want to make evolving DL smoother, follow DmgE for a couple of Prestiges, then pump UA."
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:37 2015 UTC,Him not having RoWC and CoC are his biggest issues. When I first broke the DL wall it was at stage 2681. Nowadays I evo DL around 2650.... which is his current max level.
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:38 2015 UTC,"That's not possible. DL is normally evolved at around 2,385; even with 331 Chest of Contentment, 245 Crown Egg, and 224 Crafter's Elixir, I still do it at about 2,362."
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"ROFL I ment 2381 and 2350, wow you've caught me on all my mistakes this morning. 10min SC normally stop on a boss around 2350ish and by the time I hit again boss failed so I let it farm Chests till it's ready to evolve. That probably slows me down but I got SC running all day anyways."
TapTitans,3dxu05,showyodo,2,Mon Jul 20 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah, I'm particular about details. :p  Hero death isn't very nice, so I always save a Berserk to get from 2,300 to 2,360. That won't be necessary anymore after the first weapon set, I hope."
TapTitans,3dxu05,BossL1K3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"Just finished another prestige.  I evolve Dark Lord at 2398, which is only slightly painful.  I got the RoWC and maxed it out though, so we'll see what kind of impact it has, if any."
TapTitans,3dxu05,DotBaphomets,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:14 2015 UTC,2398... ouch. They say it only has a ~4.4 stage equivalent which means you should now get DL at ~ 2393 maybe? For some reason I feel like every guide I saw about DL Evo said you should get him between 2380-2390 with Ring Maxed... Let me know when it happens I'd like to see how accurate this is.
TapTitans,3dxu05,wooflekat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that since my gold bonus modifier is so abysmally low compared to ""everybody"" else's, maybe I'll get more mileage out of it.  Either way, shaving 4-5 stages off of the final push is huge when bosses are starting to break the 5 second safety net."
TapTitans,3dxu05,DotBaphomets,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"Just evolved Dark Lord again, stage 2388 this time with RoWC.  I also gained 14000% all damage with the last carryover prestige so that might have factored in to it being a little sooner than expected.  The best news about this is that RoWC has completely eliminated my tough grind point there.  All it takes now is a few taps at a time after permaclone loses effectiveness.  Really awesome.  After the next prestige I'll have CoC and enough relics to get it to level 101 and put it on par with my egg.  Hopefully I'll be seeing some awesome gold gains at that point.  I'd really like to get a new personal best on the next tournament."

For example:   Say you are playing Tap Titan's and you hit SC. Then, for the sake of this example lets say you get a phone call and answer it. During that phone call lets say you have a task killer that kills your background tasks every 1/2 hr... and magically kills TT while on the phone. Go back to game 2mins later, game starts up and boom you active skill is on 3min CD and SC is gone.   I curse the TT gods every time I make this mistake cause I kill my tasks every time I switch apps, cause I have problems."

TapTitans,3dy58i,Cestical,2,Mon Jul 20 14:24:47 2015 UTC,"In your case, I didn't level ogre's gauntlet very high yet. I think I only made it to last for 1 minute. Crafter's Elixer is a good choice to level on your situation. Also, don't forget to salvage artifacts you will get next unless they are on tier 1 or tier 2 for those artifacts will greatly help you on your journey"

Max is around 2825 and starting around stage 2805 I switch from 3 finger slow taping to tapping my brains out with 4 fingers in order to get to 2825. I've heard the argument that tapping with 2 fingers is just as good as four but 2 will tire your arm out like WOAH after 10-15mins of it.

You still have to manually enter the number of relics in the top to calculate where your spending them anyways.   YATTO is a tool and will never be 100% perfect unless you tweak it every time you prestige. Personally I find that to be a waste of time...   The only important things to be 100% accurate are your Artifacts  before calculating where to spend relics, but that should be obvious :)"

I think you might be prestiging too quickly. From what I've read, the rule of thumb is that if you can't kill a boss in 5 seconds with shadow clone and beserker's rage on, you should prestige."
TapTitans,3dw56d,Skuhdoodle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:27 2015 UTC,I follow that rule too. Even when I'm around stage 60-70. If I still can't kill the boss within five seconds I sit and just afk farm for awhile. I afk farm a lot before I try and move on but I only progress two to three stages from doing so. I never fight a boss if I can kill it within five seconds. I'm starting to think It's the way I level heros and such.
TapTitans,3dw56d,Fe4st,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:41 2015 UTC,Its the way you are leveling heroes right now im on 7th prestige and currently slowing down at 500
TapTitans,3dw56d,FingersFellOff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty obvious what you need to progress fast. T1 Artifacts are so damn important I can't even emphasize it, makes this game so much easier. You need to read about yatto and artifact seeds on this subreddit, then find your artifact sequence. If a t1 is in your future, the best one being WI, you're in luck. Not only will you get more All Damage to progress higher, it will cut your grind time by about 45%. I know I say this but you have UA, which is supposedly the best artifact ever. And it is, end game. At your level, it's basically t3. Obviously, keep it, you will love it soon, but right now you need dmg and gold, HT+DS would help, or DH, and if you get some more good artifacts, use the yatto calculator to find out how to level most efficiently."

I think you should just follow the guide for now, without any artifacts I got to Stage 105, I'm sure you can get there too.

TapTitans,3dwt2z,gillyheartsyou,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:41:13 2015 UTC,Well bassicly all artifacts that increase durations for skills are useless except for ogres gauntlet and overseers lotion.  I would try to salvage those if possible.
TapTitans,3dwt2z,Awesup1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:32 2015 UTC,"Uh, not really. Early in a run, OG and OL matter more than the others, but when you're trying to break walls, Axe of Resolution and Barbarian's Mettle are extremely important. The Crit ones are also decent.  Among those in the list above, Amulet of the Valrunes, Ring of Opulence, Saintly Shield, and Hunter's Ointment are quite bad, but, depending on when they were obtained, they might be too expensive to salvage. The primary effect of Universal Fissure is terrible, but at least it gives a lot of AD."
TapTitans,3dwt2z,wooflekat,2,Mon Jul 20 06:13:26 2015 UTC,"I was trying to say all the duration/cool down artifacts he has currently not the ones he will get in the future.  I understand that artifacts for berserkers rage are amazing for breaking walls.  UF is ok for its damage but not its buff.  Also in my statement I put if possible,  I know it would probably be to expensive to salvage some of them.  I don't really have an opinion on crit ones.  I find them useful every once and a while for taking down some walls and bosses.  I would still salvage them in my opinion.

TapTitans,3dvr4p,Arnao,3,Sun Jul 19 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"This is solid advice. Also, 150 is a relic break point. If you can get to there, prestige.

TapTitans,3dvr4p,FingersFellOff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:14:55 2015 UTC,"Idk, is UA worth it at stage 150? Of course it'll help, but the more base relics you have, the better RoI you'll have on UA. Since I only got mine to 80 and I'm hitting 2.7k+, I basically made all that back really quickly, but if the OP has to put in 500 relics to level UA once and is only getting like 300 base relics from their current stage, doesn't seem worth it. Of course, later, it's godly, and I'm working on pumping it right now.   I think your WI advice is spot on, and yes, you're right. OP, you should find your artifact seed and see what's coming in your immediate future. If there are any t1/t2 artifacts coming up, try to get them and use the yatto calculator to level them the best you can. I personally don't think UA is a good RoI besides maybe the first few levels till you break the Mohacas Wall. Thinks like HT+DS combo or CE+CoC are so much bigger then. Maybe I'm wrong though, I didn't do any numbers."
TapTitans,3dvpm7,Calrabjohns,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"tldr: To answer your question, it's best to use two YATTO screens.  Ummm....I'm not going to answer your question, I'm just going to explain how I've come to understand the mechanics of YATTO and YATTO's weapon sequencer.  On the main page (the calculator), you can input all the hero weapons you currently have. This list will also populate the list on the sequencer page. The calculator uses the current weapons to determine your total DPS, and to give you a sum total.  On the sequencer page, you can click on the checkmarks next to the weapons in the upcoming sequence list, and all the weapons up to the checkmark will be added to your list of current weapons, but only on the sequencer page. You'll still have to update your weapon list on the calculator page separately.  edit: The only decent reason I can see for keeping the sequencer list up-to-date is because it updates the weapon seed when you click on the checkmarks. I think if the list is updated from being populated from the calculator page, it won't update the weapon seed. But I might be wrong about that, I've never put it to a test.  (Sorry! Your question confused me at first, but after writing all this explanation, it made more sense.)"
TapTitans,3dvpm7,Xaxafrad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:47 2015 UTC,That's actually how I update the sequencer list lol. I update the calculator page and changes move to sequencer.

TapTitans,3dtct4,cloudmist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:40:07 2015 UTC,Depends on how many relics its needed. If you can get it in 1 to 2 prestiges then just save otherwise it would be better to upgrade existing artifacts.

The auto-use of skills, though, is probably something the dev's wouldn't want since it would allow minimal involvement once you got permaclone.

TapTitans,3dql1f,NoID621,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:25:58 2015 UTC,So you'll have 3 by 155 total or you need another 155 on top of 120 for first...
TapTitans,3dql1f,Calrabjohns,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"No, at my 155th Weapon drop I will have my 3rd Set completed, so, 35 Weapons after my first set, this seems really lucky/happy to me... although I have to wait 99 weapons for my first set!"
TapTitans,3dql1f,Link7787,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:02:47 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good seed :)  My first was like 106 or 8. And then the next two were within forty or fifty. Chasing the fifth currently with better results than I thought I'd average.
TapTitans,3dql1f,Arnao,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:15 2015 UTC,After i level UA to 400 it`ll take me 15 prestiges to get Axe of resolution from 290 to 590. Id look into getting permazerk when your in the 2900s.

TapTitans,3dpwf7,Metaphorical_Lurker,4,Sat Jul 18 08:07:32 2015 UTC,"you were in the new player brackets for the first few tournaments.  Now you're in the bracket with everyone else.  If they bracketed by # of prestiges or max stage.. there would be less motivation to push farther.. as you could just sit low, and get same rewards."
TapTitans,3dpwf7,ellanox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:57:03 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks so much! I feel better with rushing through prestiges now :)

TapTitans,3dq0zl,EpicRevolution,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:25:40 2015 UTC,Welcome! for your artifact seed there is a great guide at the top of the page or follow this link https://www.reddit.com/r/TapTitans/comments/399jeo/artifact_and_weapon_seeds/  I'd start by checking which you'd get next once you find your seed and decide afterwards
TapTitans,3dq0zl,Halfaren,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:39:51 2015 UTC,Didn't Apple block users from looking into the app files?
TapTitans,3dq0zl,Halfaren,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:45:02 2015 UTC,I use an iPhone and I had no issue finding mine :)
TapTitans,3dq0zl,Halfaren,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:45:38 2015 UTC,I tried a couple days ago to no avail
TapTitans,3dq0zl,Halfaren,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:10:50 2015 UTC,What's the issue you're having? At which step do you get stuck?
TapTitans,3dpmwu,Awesup1,3,Sat Jul 18 05:52:47 2015 UTC,"Darn, that stinks. However, how many DL weapons will you have by the time you complete your set? That makes a bit difference if you're lucky and get a good amount, because there's some math on this reddit that basically says 6 DL weapons or something is worth the same as one set, so that could change things. Also, after you get your first set, how many weapons will it be till you get your 2nd or 3rd? Long term, your seed might turn out to be quite good in fact.   However, gratz on the good artifact seed, WI is a great help. Are you getting any other t1 artifacts soon like UA or HT or DH soon as well?"
TapTitans,3dpmwu,FingersFellOff,2,Sat Jul 18 06:03:05 2015 UTC,I'm replying to this at 12 pm so keep that in mind.  Well I got heroes thrust.  I think death seeker was in around 10 more artifacts.  From what I can remember it's all t2's and t1's for about 10 artifacts :)  about the dark lord weps it would be 4 I think.
TapTitans,3dpmwu,FingersFellOff,2,Sat Jul 18 07:26:43 2015 UTC,"That's great, t2 and t1's for the next 10 artifacts sounds nice. 4 DL in 177 weapons sounds good enough to me, sure the set will take quite a bit of time, but those DLs will come in handy in tournaments. Now, I just feel bad for the person who has to grind anywhere near that amount, with DL as their last weapon."
TapTitans,3dpmwu,ellanox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:10:36 2015 UTC,I know imagine the grind to get a 1 DL wep after 200 weps.
TapTitans,3dpmwu,ellanox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"The weapon sets do mean alot =)  but if it makes you feel any better, i'm at stage 2800 and still rising without one. (have 80, need another 131 for that first set)"
TapTitans,3dpmwu,Makeshift27015,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:32:13 2015 UTC,Well I guess now that I think about your situation for me at 180 weeps I get my first.  For you that would be around 210 weapons.

TapTitans,3dmt15,HarrietBeadle,6,Fri Jul 17 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"The best advice I read here, was prestige often. Basically if you're taking more than a couple minutes per stage, or if you have to have all cooldowns to beat a stage, prestige instead. You'll get back to where you were and then some."
TapTitans,3dmt15,EuphoriaGrowing,2,Fri Jul 17 17:27:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! I will do my first prestige the moment that I can (or when I hit level 90 if I'm close to that)
TapTitans,3dmt15,chennyalan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"I think my first was around level 110, and my rule of thumb was whenever a boss takes more than 5 seconds to beat. Exceptions around certain walls though"

TapTitans,3dmty6,ruizbujc,3,Fri Jul 17 15:32:08 2015 UTC,"From what I'm reading, you don't know about sequences and such. Read up on seeds and use YATTO to find your sequences.   The artifacts don't matter as much; keep going. The first 2-3 weeks are brutal-ish before you get the artifacts and start coasting; I feel like all of us always get 2+ tier 1 artifacts VERY late.  Take a look at your weapons in YATTO. If your first set is around 100+, restart; in the longish run, it'll be worth it. In the immediate, you'll be like... wtf am I doing with my life."
TapTitans,3dmty6,Unaufhaltbarr,2,Fri Jul 17 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up.  I read through the seed stuff, but don't fully understand it.  My seed is 2401 (since I see ""nextArtifactSeed/"":22401,"" I'm assuming that's it).  I punched that into YATTO with the ones I already have.  It seems like I'll get the other T3 one next, then my last T5, then I'll get Worldly Illuminator (so, given my existing pace, probably a week?) ... but undead aura is 8 away (third to last) ... and drunken hammer is even after that.  As far as weapons go, Pixie will be my last one and that will be after another 94 more weapons (I get about 2 per tournament).  So, is that close enough to warrant resetting for new seeds or should I plow through and just hope to be able to do something in another 2-3 weeks?"
TapTitans,3dmty6,Unaufhaltbarr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:40:24 2015 UTC,"You should be able to type in the priority of the artifacts you want (Worldly Illuminator and Undead Aura would be the only MUST HAVE in retrospect) and how many diamonds you'd be willing to buy/use in ""Max diamonds"".  I'd restart and hope for a faster first weapon set (50 weapons or less), but that's me; do as you wish. The tournaments are only getting tougher, and hoping for top 20 is the best I'll be getting for a long while (been playing roughly 1.5 months)"
TapTitans,3dmty6,Unaufhaltbarr,2,Fri Jul 17 18:08:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help.  I did restart.  The only problem I've encountered is that I can't figure out my heroWeaponSeed value - it just shows up as 0 in the .adat file.  Do I have to get a weapon before it will give me my seed number?  Thanks!
TapTitans,3dmty6,Unaufhaltbarr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yes; when you get the first weapon, it'll generate a random weapon value. Kind of a pain."

TapTitans,3dmty6,Mbdking,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:50:03 2015 UTC,The problem is exactly that I'm that far along...salvaging is around 450 to 500 gems.  I just don't have that to throw around with the hope of a new artifact :/

TapTitans,3dmeso,canadianschism,3,Fri Jul 17 13:26:15 2015 UTC,"Tap titans is not a game you should play seriously. I did and ended up getting bored too fast. This is a time waster which should be treated as such, so goals in such a game is of no standing. What i do recommend you to do is check out your artifact seed, See what your sequence is, get all the tier 1 artifacts + all the nice seeming tier 2 artifacts and go crazy with what u want to level. In tap titans, no matter what path you take you will always end up on the same result, which is breaking a wall and proceeding to another one. I personally find leveling artifacts as a wish them to be, very much more satisfying than following an efficiency calculator which will tell me what is best for me.   On a side note, more relics put into UA is always good, i prefer to raise it till a full prestige put into UA does not raise it by 10+ levels. Have a good game :D"
TapTitans,3dmeso,Mbdking,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:38 2015 UTC,"I completely understand about the time waster ;) I have an addictive personality, sadly, so it's tough to NOT take it seriously."

If not, then dump it into UA.  Side note: I got Crown Egg, Overseer's Lotion, TOTM and Drunken Hammer in the last 2 play throughs.

Your current artifacts are pretty good and you might break Chester quicker than I did. Maybe level UA to 20 then D. Hammer to 25 and try buy some 2 more artifacts if you can afford them. Don't forget to evolve Teeny Tom and level him to 1025 on your way to Chester! :)"

TapTitans,3dle7q,FingersFellOff,2,Fri Jul 17 09:20:42 2015 UTC,"You should check out the artifact list on this subreddit, which you can search for. This should show you the best artifacts to shoot for. LINK: http://redd.it/2vv2l9  Now, find the article about finding your article seed, and do what it says. Now you know what the best artifacts are, and how to find your weapon seed. LINK: http://redd.it/399jeo  Next, go on to yatto.me, a website which helps optimize your TT gameplay. Go into the sequencer part of the website.   Here, enter your priorities for artifacts you really want. you should aim for the best artifacts on the list, such as Worldly Illuminator, Drunken Hammer, and to couple with your Hero's Thrust, Death Seeker. In the top right corner, after picking your priorities, enter your four digit artifact seed number, and the amount of diamonds you're willing to spend on salvaging. Don't be stingy if you have diamonds, in my opinion salvaging at your level is the best use of diamonds by far, even better than customizations.   Now, to the far right, you'll see a list being generated. This is calculating which artifacts you will get next, which to salvage, and which to keep, to fastest get the artifacts you want, while staying within your diamond limit.   That should help you get the best artifacts. I know I still havn't directly answered your questions yet. You asked if you should salvage any of your artifacts. At your level, laborer's pendant is one you want to salvage. However, experiment with yatto.   At the far left is your priority list, and the far right is the best salvaging sequence, but what about the one in the middle? This is a list of artifacts you want to/are willing to salvage. This will change your sequence drastically. Experiment getting your sequence without using the middle list, then find your sequence with check marking laborer's pendant.   If you find you get a better sequence with more tier 1 and tier 2 artifacts earlier with salvaging laborer's, go along with the better sequence. if not, just keep it.   Think I covered everything you'll need, hope it helps and isn't confusing, but if it is, just respond with specific questions and I or someone else should be able to clarify.   EDIT: I guess I'm tired today, don't salvage Axe, it's a good, T2 artifact, but laborer's if needed, do it in a heartbeat. Also, added in the links for artifact tier list and seed article to make it a bit easier for you."

After that, get UA to 100 and boost your ALL DAMAGE % to atleast 90K in order for you to break the DL-Evolve.  Just my opinion.  -you're lucky you had UA earlier :)"

TapTitans,3diuie,colblitz,2,Thu Jul 16 17:47:23 2015 UTC,It's possible but the circumstances seem unusual. The fact that they reached 2775 in 4 hours makes it likely that they moved quickly enough to be subbed.
TapTitans,3diuie,ness839,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:43 2015 UTC,reaching 2775 in 4 hours is easy tho... I get my clone at stage 7 and just keep hitting it every 10 minutes while leveling up heroes.
TapTitans,3diuie,Qratos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"So I'm happy there's been responses, and you seem the most knowledgeable, but I don't think I understand what you're talking about lol.   Ghosting, is that like playing offline mode or something?   Just to make a statement: /TT/Alvery was in 1st up till ~stage 600 then he just disappeared off my list when I checked back at stage ~750 and I was in first. When I hit 2775 in 4hrs exactly, 2nd place was only at 2200, but Alvery and that other guy both seem to be tied with me at the exact same time according to his picture.   Im worryed because now I am in 5th at 2820 (pretty much my max maybe +5stages) with 3hrs left and if there are a myriad of people I am not seeing who could be at their max (1-2 stages above me) how will I know?  EDIT: Sorry despite my stage max im still a noob thats only been playing for about a month and 1/2 lol"
TapTitans,3diuie,wooflekat,2,Thu Jul 16 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Ghosting is when people vanish from the list because the system suspects them to be cheaters; that's one of the reasons why you don't see as many 3,500s these days."
TapTitans,3diuie,ness839,2,Thu Jul 16 18:17:28 2015 UTC,"This is the best we can figure based on our experience at /r/TT_Tourneys. (We schedule join times so we have threads of people in the same bracket.)  If someone in a bracket is climbing ""too fast"" they are placed into a sub-bracket in which they cannot be seen by other players but they are still visible to themselves. So, in your case, Alvery must have triggered this condition when he reached ~600. He can still see everything as normal but others (you) can no longer see him. It's something like a Reddit shadowban...to the ghost, everything is normal but he disappears from everyone else's bracket list.  We aren't 100% sure exactly what causes this ""ghosting"" and why it happens, particularly since there are no negative consequences. The lack of developer input is also not helpful but I've basically written them off. We are still collecting info on the ghosts that appear in our brackets to try to figure out the situation."
TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,2,Thu Jul 16 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Ghosting is what we call someone who moves so fast that they leave the tournament they joined under (this happens frequently to /u/Enigma07). But we aren't 100% whether this is the cause of someone getting shunted to another leaderboard or a more closely adhered to ghosting of still being within the joined tournament but invisible.  Even before we did these hosted joinups, there were weird instances of people appearing in two separate LBs while they really only receive any results from one. If this is a case of you, showyodo, appearing in different LBs, the only reliable one is the one that you see when you are playing and not in a different screen capture.  Or maybe I'm not understanding clearly what is happening."
TapTitans,3diuie,Enigma07,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell from it happening to me a few times now, all it does it make you invisible to everyone else in the bracket. You still see the leaderboard like everything is normal but nobody else is able to see you there. When this happens the only reliable leaderboard on where you stand is the one you see. No matter what place you would end up on someone else's leaderboard, you will still get the prizes from the place that you see yourself in at the end.    It always seems to happen when I play straight through so my best guess is that there is some line that if you pass before a certain time then you get ghosted. I'm going to try to slow climb a bit in the next tourney to test if I can stay in but I still don't have a very good understanding of why this keeps happening to me."
TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:08 2015 UTC,And it's happened to you even after a few hours right? I think there was one time you phased out after 4 hours elapsed?
TapTitans,3diuie,Enigma07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:37 2015 UTC,As far as I can remember it's always happened on my initial climb. I'm pretty sure it's been in the first hour or two.
TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"That's ""good news"" for the tentative advice on how to avoid ghosting I'm postulating in FAQ. If it had happened in 4 hours according to your memory too, advice wouldn't apply."
TapTitans,3diuie,Enigma07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:58 2015 UTC,I'll keep testing it during tourneys since I seem to be able to make it happen anytime I push straight through it should be simple enough for me to try different ways to keep it from happening.
TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:38 2015 UTC,"Way I'm proposing for now is how I spend my first hour or two:  Tap first 10 stages. Use some gold to get to 100 and then trigger SC. As gold becomes available, level MH (Main Hero) by 100 level increments and buy skills as they become available. Don't trigger any. Continue leveling MH as gold is available until your SC triggered at beginning of Stg. 11 ends. For me, the SC terminates at 160s with MH at 1100. Once that occurs, buy up heroes which will probably terminate at Eistor (did for me anyway). Get whoever you can to 1K but halt on leveling until you can go straight from 1-1K. So with my current set up, I get Takeda-Charlotte (maybe Jordaan) maxed. From there, it's 1K as available until Flavia and Chester where you resume semi-normal leveling.  My Stages Per Hour with this method---at least as far as 1st Hour goes is in high 600s/mid 700s. You'll probably go to low 800s. It might be too much babysitting and you might be good with just purchase and Lvl 1s. That method served a different purpose for me but I figure it might help your speed problem :)"
TapTitans,3diuie,Enigma07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:15:19 2015 UTC,I think the problem is on that first tourney run since they let your SC keep killing while the loading screen is up I get 937 stages/hour as opposed to the normal 805/h that I usually get. My guess is that is above the line where they start to suspect a speed hack even though I'm just using an iPhone 6 with no other apps running. My thought is they probably put a specific checkpoint to monitor where people are at and if you're over the stage that they set as the highest you should be able to attain by that point they ghost you out.    It's just a theory for now but I'm going to test joining and not advancing for the first hour. Then I'll progress at my normal pace to see if it will still ghost me out. The tourney after that I'm going to try taking a 5 minute break every 30 minutes or so to see if that changes anything.
TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:45:14 2015 UTC,You know what. That sounds like a plan and I'll hold off on ghost protocol since you're the only one who can confirm one way or another :p
TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:26:14 2015 UTC,So you're staying I should just go by what it says on MY LB and not worry about people magically showing up out of the blue?   (We were in the same tourney till about stage 600 then he just vanished off my list)
TapTitans,3diuie,Unaufhaltbarr,2,Thu Jul 16 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"For better or worse, you have no control over the people who disappear. Almost all of the time, they can't affect you and you can't affect them once they've Caspered. I actually can't think of an instance where someone who has ghosted still held any influence, positive or negative, in the tournament I was a part of that he or she exited.

TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,2,Thu Jul 16 17:51:56 2015 UTC,/TT/Alvery posted the first picture showing he was tied with me at 2775 after 4hrs along with the other person /TT/bjlapp. Neither player has shown up on my top 10 list (15hrs later) where I am  #6 at 2796 and #8s are at 2737... o. O
TapTitans,3diuie,Calrabjohns,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:35 2015 UTC,So they seem to have ghosted mid-tournament...did they move up at all or was that the agreed tie point?
TapTitans,3diuie,Unaufhaltbarr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:24:26 2015 UTC,2775 was the initial agreed point. Then someone else went to 2792 and then following that I saw the person (now in first) at 2880 come out of nowhere in a matter of 30mins.
TapTitans,3diuie,wooflekat,2,Thu Jul 16 18:29:15 2015 UTC,I guess the 2880 person could have been slow-rolling...waiting to get to a max stage where it'd be unlikely for anyone to catch up but it's equally possible the person just stopped and knew he could pick up at the tail end of tournament. But this person's MS would probably be in 3Ks to just poof.  Did you see this person at any point when you were climbing that you can recall?
TapTitans,3diuie,bjlapp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:23 2015 UTC,I typed that last post a little fast... Deiter (the guy in first in 2nd pic) I saw him the entire tournament and saw him climb to stage 2913 after /TT/AaronExp hit 2885.   /TT/AaronExp (stage 2885) I didn't see at all and showed up from no where on my list to stage 2885 in a matter of 30mins of me driving to work.

TapTitans,3di1rn,Koreial,4,Thu Jul 16 13:13:01 2015 UTC,"Koreial's method is good. Attempt to tie twice (the second tie is to give them the benefit of the doubt, in case they accidentally went over or just wanted to hit the next Relic checkpoint), but if they try to one-up you again, go up to your max.  I'm in a similar position right now. There were five of us tied for 1st at 2,789 (no idea why the first person to reach that stage didn't just push to 2,790 for the extra Relics @.@), but two of them went up to 2,800 a couple of hours after the tie had been in place; I've since caught up. Not sure what to do if they move up again, since the other two (who are still at 2,789, but will probably catch up soon) are /TT/, and I don't want to mess up their standing needlessly."
TapTitans,3di1rn,wooflekat,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I just caught up to the 2772. 6 hours left, let's see what he/she does"
TapTitans,3di1rn,wooflekat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"If you have a lot of free time in the next six hours, it's entirely possible to do a full Prestige in that time (it should take between three and five hours straight, depending on your AD%, weapons, and device performance).  If they do decide to break the tie, the extra AD% or Berserk duration you get from that Prestige could help a bit. But, if you can't guarantee that you'll be able to get back to 2,772 and have at least 30 minutes to spare before it ends, don't risk it.  Good luck! :D"
TapTitans,3di1rn,Signumite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:07:27 2015 UTC,Directly go to your max and prestige if there is 5-6hrs left then wait for the final rushers

TapTitans,3di0t2,rcpcdude,2,Thu Jul 16 13:04:40 2015 UTC,I always get nervous when I'm in a tie.  I compulsively keep checking the standings with one finger on the Doom spell just in case my the people I'm tied with jump at the last minute.
TapTitans,3di0t2,The-Turing-Test,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't get any better. Last tournament I placed 11th with 2738, but the 10 above me were all within 20 stages or so. I had a lot of relics to spend, so I decided to hold onto them and spend them after joining the next tournament to give myself a boost.   Joined the tournament yesterday literally last minute as I almost forgot about it. Lucked out and got into the final bracket with 4 other dudes, only 5 of us in total. Decided to relax and let them set the upper limit, and went to bed early. Woke up and checked to see how far they got: I was in 79th place with 3 people tied for first at 3500. I'm at 2700 now and 21st. Fuck tournaments."
TapTitans,3difeg,rcpcdude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:04:46 2015 UTC,1) Mix UA/dmg until evolve DL wall is passed. 2) UA to 400 (this is my recommendation to you atm; don't stop at 200! Are you in for the long haul?) 3) All the DPS (level artifacts every 3-4 prestiges with YATTO recommendations)
TapTitans,3difeg,Unaufhaltbarr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"depends again on how far i set my bar for dmg and leveling 1-2 UA per prestige instead.         Some simple math not 100% guaranteed to be accurate but will be pretty close would put me at approx 72 prestiges to go from 153-400 UA. At lets say 2 prestiges per day which is approx 7 hours of play time per day for over a month of time just to hit the OK you can start leveling your dmg up point.         Will I be playing for over a month? Sure, I like the game. Do I want to be stuck at 2750 for that long? I dunno, would like to maybe get a set first and at my current pace thats around 6 weeks of tourneys and weekly's so maybe you have a good point. 6 weeks of farming UA and farming for my first set, then stop UA altogether?"
TapTitans,3difeg,Unaufhaltbarr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"6 weeks of farming UA and farming for my first set, then stop UA altogether?    That's my plan. The wee bit of dmg I'll be getting doesn't justify going up 5-10 levels; it'll make me ""feel"" stronger to reach 2800 instead of just 2750, but it all comes down to how many relics I'd be getting.   At this point, it's all about weapon sets and DL weapons; it's a waiting game. ~6 weeks is what I'm looking at for my first set (first DL wep in ~4 weeks) . I'm saving up for 400 UA then going for the 1m AD which should be easy. Then I don't know; I'm a little jealous of a guy's post I was reading that stated he was at ~564 UA. I might go after that.  Hopefully someone else answers."
TapTitans,3difeg,wooflekat,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:53 2015 UTC,"True. I guess my point is, If it takes us both lets say 10 weeks to get a set, hit 400 UA and then get to 1m AD and one does it by leveling only UA and the other does it by level UA once or twice per prestige, its still 10 weeks of play one way or another."
TapTitans,3difeg,wooflekat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"But UA will ""pay for itself"" quicker the earlier you put levels into it. It ultimately depends on how many Prestiges you plan to do before quitting the game."
TapTitans,3difeg,Calrabjohns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:58:22 2015 UTC,I refuse to give up until I've at least broken 3k stages and have all the achievements to answer that directly lol

TapTitans,3difeg,wooflekat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:07:01 2015 UTC,"Ooh I don't know who would say it makes things go ""faster."" That is definitely not true past a certain point. But it helps you progress ""farther."" Matter of fact, I get and still am frustrated at leveling UA because my progress seems to halt while leveling UA. So in my pursuit of Lvl. 300 UA (for now) and PermaCrit/Cry, this is my current thought.  During tournaments, after I've hit my MS (assuming that is the tie point decided on), those are the primary prestiges I will make UA only since I can usually spin off at least one more on top of reaching tie. Given that tournaments are two times a week, this is at least on average 4 dedicated UA runs.  What of the other 5 days? Days immediately following tournaments will be dedicated to building up durations, Tincture runs, DmgE/DH-HT/CoC-CE/sundries runs. So that's 2 days of no UA whatsoever, whether it be one or two prestiges respectively in a day.  The other three days? Divvy them up as needed for getting to whatever benchmark you may have.   Sunday: No UA Monday: Maybe a little UA Tuesday: No UA/UA dependent on join-time Wednesday: UA/No UA for reason above Thursday: No UA Friday: No UA/UA dep. on JT Saturday: UA/No UA dep. on JT   Monday is a swing-day based on positioning for where it lands on tournaments.  This is a rough guide I'm going to begin trying to follow after I get UA to 300 (269 right now) but I'll likely feel that I could be earning more and then fall back into begrudgingly leveling UA. -_-"
TapTitans,3difeg,Calrabjohns,2,Thu Jul 16 19:53:22 2015 UTC,i like this idea and will follow it
TapTitans,3difeg,wooflekat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:58:11 2015 UTC,Glad I could be of help :)
TapTitans,3difeg,Calrabjohns,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"My method is the exact opposite. :p DmgE on tournament days and UA/skill durations the rest of the time.  It's been working well, too. UA is currently 315, all skills except Midas are at 15 mins (level 290), and AD is 560k%."
TapTitans,3difeg,wooflekat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the above thinking is predicated in large part on mentality that it is not worth breaking a tie for a higher position even if somehow you can get it with a handful (single digit) of stages as the win because it hurts others in tie and it's just not smart---at least one person in the tie is probably agreeing to it because he or she is similarly trying to be considerate of others but could probably run with the whole ball of wax.  If you've hit max during a tournament, you don't need the AD/DPS/Tap Dmg./Gold at that point. The only thing you consistently need is relics and more of them. But maybe this is weird semantics on my end lol.   I just feel like there must be some good path to take for end game progression that won't feel like ""I'm losing ground here because I'm building there."" And DmgE never includes Tincture, which I've been investing in other than UA or durations for now. So---yeah. Word diarrhea lol."
TapTitans,3difeg,Calrabjohns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:49:10 2015 UTC,"That's true; at this point, it seems like AD barely does anything anymore. I've been maxing at ~2,800 since AD was ~225k%, and now, even with 560k%, getting to 2,850 still takes three 15-minute Berserks. I really need that first set. ._.  Following DmgE on these days is pretty much just an excuse to not put everything into UA all the time. The three Prestiges each tournament day only come out to about 30-40k% AD, so that's not even really enough to make an extra 5-stage climb appreciably quicker.  DmgE actually does include Tincture - you just need to input a higher ""Relics to spend"" amount."
TapTitans,3difeg,wooflekat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"I'm in opposite position. I have a few sets now but my AD is such that the fourth one did not budge my MS like the others did. AD is about 574K and I figure I need at least 600 for it to kick in but that's a farfetched theory I'm bouncing in brain for set/AD complementary function. How far away is that first? Makes the biggest impact. Particularly when DL is the last weapon needed (as it was for my first three---he is a big ol' troll lol).  Since our ADs are essentially the same, this should give you some perspective. 4 sets/4 DLs (5 since conclusion of tourn.) has me prestiging at 2880 w/out fear of HD on regular days and 2940 as MS to win with huuuuge pushes during tourn. First set will conservatively give you 40 stages and preceding ones will either give you 15 stg. increments or they will make your prestige run through much smoother. Fourth made 2700s with triggered skills a breeze but no discernible impact for getting to my tourn. max any easier.  I haven't followed DmgE for awhile but it doesn't surprise me. However, I did not realize I was the one preventing Tinc. from showing up by my omission >_<  I just assumed it phased Tinc. out for not being economical in a DmgE formula."
TapTitans,3difeg,Link7787,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not sure that's how it works; either way, raising AD% will be good in the long run.  The first set's 52 weapons away, but I might finish this current tournament in 1st place (along with two others). :D  My regular Prestige point is 2,820 after one Berserk (starts at 2,775). Only one DL and no sets."
TapTitans,3difeg,wooflekat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:47 2015 UTC,Yeah it's probably most wishful thinking re: theory lol.  That's not too bad then! Let's hope this and the next handful are high placing then 😊

I don't think more animations would help my phone to survive :P lag would become a pain."
TapTitans,3dfleb,BZamora92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true that. I put the lag and the loss of battery life into account, those are the major cons. That and then, if we had Universal Fissure as a damage generator.... all our heroes attacking at thousands of percents... Explosion imminent."
TapTitans,3dfleb,Awesup1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"This seems like such a cool idea but, the big question is what would the level cap be and if it would affect shadow clone (probably not)."
TapTitans,3dfleb,BossL1K3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"I think SC is SC, it's a cool entity in it's own :) But a level cap at 10 should be pretty good, or else your phone will explode, haha. And... The Power of Holding perk would be totally useless if we had a cap at 30, seeing as the perk gives 30 taps per sec already, meaning people spending less diamonds on that perk.  Sh.....iieet. If you had the maxed out matrix artifact at, let's say, level 10.... And PoH perk will give you 30 taps. That'd mean... 30 x 10 swings per tap, 300 damage-inducing swings! Dayum! OP."
TapTitans,3dfleb,BossL1K3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think it is one of the best things in the game. It gives so much damage potential, compared to tapping..."
TapTitans,3dfleb,Calrabjohns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:43:39 2015 UTC,I think I must've underestimated that perk a little bit :P Can't say no to 2 minutes of damage potential and letting the fingers rest at the same time.
TapTitans,3dfleb,fAEth_,2,Wed Jul 15 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"Since it also crits it is mostly a double or triple damage output for 2 minutes just for 50 Dias, perfect for getting over walls :)"
TapTitans,3dfleb,Drunk_Wizard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:47:32 2015 UTC,"I just used it twice in current tourn. run. It got me past two particularly annoying spots in my wall and it's more cost effective than a Doom as well as possibly carrying past a Boss and into a couple mobs. PoH is bad-ass :)  I've thought about a PoH artifact. Rather than something that mandates a permanent change to the MH character, what if it were a modifier to the pre-existing PoH. So in addition to X AD per level, it would add +3 seconds to a purchased PoH with a cap of 1 extra minute or maybe more. I know it's unconventional and maybe leans toward a P2W model but 50 diamonds is really easy to make up.   But yeah I'd like yours too. Probably more heh."
TapTitans,3dfleb,fAEth_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:36:17 2015 UTC,"yea, even if you had an auto-clicker clicking once every milisecond, the game only registers 10 taps per second (so once every 100ms).  Power of Holding is 3 times that. :P"

TapTitans,3dffyr,nwpoll114,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"yes, everything that increases damage of your heroes also increases your tap damage thanks to skills ""+x% of DPS to tap damage"""
TapTitans,3dffyr,disebodnout,0,Wed Jul 15 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"Skills that read ""+0.4% of DPS to tap damage"" will increase your tap damage based on your heroes amount (not the 'main character').  When you get one full weapon set, all your heroes, from Takeda to Dark Lord, do x10 damage.  Therefore, that x10 to your +0.4% is now increasing your tap damage by 4% instead of just 0.4%.  The weapon set will not INDIRECTLY affect tap damage, not directly."
TapTitans,3dffyr,Unaufhaltbarr,2,Wed Jul 15 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"I am having extremely hard time to break 2850 stage right now. I have all artifacts, 160k% AD, 1 WS and 5 DL weapon. I can easily go up to 2770, but starting from then, I cannot pass any single stage without Berserker rage skill. Right now, I am at 2828 in the tournament, so I just want to find out the minimum ad% requirement to break 2850. Can you also give me the answer for this question? Thanks a lot"

TapTitans,3dg00k,Viiet-,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"Order doesn't make a difference for leveling both of them, but if you're trying to decide between leveling one or the other, check out the first question of our FAQ  Generally, Tincture is pretty expensive, so you'll spend most of your relics leveling other stuff."
TapTitans,3dg00k,colblitz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"Well if you use something like Yatto, it'll tell you if leveling tincture if worth leveling at the moment, but it's essentially just a modifier of your entire all dmg. If you're All Dmg is 30k%, and your tincture boosts it by 50%, it'll be 45k%, so obviously the higher your AD% without tincture, the more tincture's boost will help, but the % is always the same. But yeah, no point in really focusing on it till your other artifacts AD is good, for a great RoI."
TapTitans,3dg00k,FingersFellOff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:12:18 2015 UTC,"for what it's worth, yatto.me takes this into account when telling which artefacts to level."
TapTitans,3delmd,Tamlol,4,Wed Jul 15 17:45:46 2015 UTC,at low levels the impact is not very strong but when you break the Dark Lord evolve wall and the high 2000's stages thats when Weapon Sets and DL weapons become your main source of dmg
TapTitans,3delmd,FJFLICK,2,Wed Jul 15 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"Take it as this,  All weapons for heroes which are necessary to break some walls are a good boost to beat the wall faster ( Master hawk/elistor for flavius etc ) Weapons for Dark lord are the most worth ones since they will help you throughout the end game By the time you reach end game , all weapons except dark lord will just become nothing except some parts which are needed to get a full set providing x10 damage (and its multiples) And no, It is easy tidings for everyone after getting mohacaws carrying to jaqlin till u hit the mini pixie wall."

So jealous, stuck at stage ~2350 right now, but I only have 36k%AD so I don't expect to break it for quite a while. I am curious, is that his price with a maxed RoWC? I recently got RoWC and hope it paves a road a tiny bit. Also, how much did it help? What stage did you prestige at?"
TapTitans,3dcpgm,InfernapeGamez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:24:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is the maxed RoWC. It helped alot in walls cos it cut almost half of the time you need to grind for gold.

TapTitans,3ddrld,zarbi55,3,Wed Jul 15 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"If this is a question for TT_Tourneys, I'll give you an answer that I hope addresses your concern.  We use IGT, In-Game Time, to coordinate our join-ups. Before that, players mention their blackout hours---hours where it's impossible for a person to join. So if I write that the Join Time will be T-18, this is how it should display ideally as you're joining.  You'd click the blue tournament button like normal and wait for the Join Timer to display ""18:00:00 To Join."" It doesn't have to be that close to work. As long as you look in on timer with 10 or so minutes and actually click when it's around 1 Minute or so near- ""18:01:00"" as an example.  We get the ideal join times from everyone in the respective group and then land on a time that works best for most people. There have been issues of coordination for people in a timezone that isn't favorable to them.   One thing we can begin to do when we have more people or conflict of interest is create a registry of users and their general timezones and try to organize groups based on that.  Does that answer your question or is it of a different nature than I understood it to be?"
TapTitans,3ddrld,Calrabjohns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:37:00 2015 UTC,Yeah it was what I needed thank a lot know I understand these t-18 stuff.   Your reply gave me another question If multiple player coordinate to join a tourney at the same moment are they 100% guaranteed to be together?
TapTitans,3ddrld,ness839,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"As long as everyone joins at the right time, our success rate has been very high. I want to say 100% but I certainly could be wrong.   Most of the time someone doesn't make it in a planned bracket the reasons are user error like ""forgot"" or ""messed up time conversion"". We have a thread in /r/TT_Tourneys with a table to help sort timing issues out."
TapTitans,3ddrld,Calrabjohns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:42:06 2015 UTC,We just had a weird experience in Alpha. I don't know when they joined exactly but RM and I did before the appointed hour (me by 40 seconds) and the rest joined after though I don't know by how much. Enigma ghosted. Syndera is MIA presently. It's a fractious group of 2 and 2 presently. Worked out for best this time but it makes me question how exact we need to be or if something else is happening :\
TapTitans,3ddrld,Mbdking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"It was RM and cal joining 40-30 seconds before T-7 and me,cloud and enigma joing 10 seconds after T-7. Syndera never replied.

There have been players that evolved DL the first time at 50k% AD, but they obviously spent a LOT of time farming chestersons.  I am currently at 111k% AD and i farm chestersons for ~5 minutes at stage 2375, then evolve my DL and go right up to stage 2645 where i use BR to go to 2670 (can reach 2680 but no point in doing so since the next relic stage is 2685 and i dont feel like wasting time farming gold just to get another relic stage).  I have spend quite a few prestieges on my UA and gold% tho(gona spend my next 2 prestieges on getting perma chestersons, im in love with the idea to only have chestersons :P), so im sure you can do without farming at 100k %AD if you invest in %AD when you prestiege mixed with some DmgE."
TapTitans,3dd4wy,Miothan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:55:10 2015 UTC,I am currently at 110k% AD and always use DmgE to spend relics. It takes me 3 BR to evolve DL right now without farming chestersons.

TapTitans,3dd4wy,wooflekat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:06:46 2015 UTC,Do you have an Axe of Resolution? It'll probably be a lot cheaper to increase Berserk to 3x its current duration than to get enough AD. I think you'd need 200-300k% to be able to do it without Berserk.

I think, sticking with the rule will be fine for you, but if you want, just eyeball it and prestige whenever you think you're going slower, just make sure to hit your next relic checkpoint if you can, which is every 15 stages after stage 90.   5 second rule: Kill a boss within 5 seconds with all your skills, or get out. Good because A. this is very efficient, if you can't do it, you're not being really efficient and B. your heroes can't die in the first five seconds of a boss fight.   Hope that helps."

TapTitans,3daurs,Repen,2,Tue Jul 14 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"Took out my explanation, was junk. I just recommend you to use Yatto as it will automatically determine if your KS is more efficient or CoC+CE combo. But, if you want to know the math, I linked it below.   The Mathz"
TapTitans,3daurs,FingersFellOff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:56:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for this! Didnt realize boss gold scaled like that
TapTitans,3daurs,blitzkit,2,Tue Jul 14 22:21:01 2015 UTC,it's better to have both gold generating rather than one is not. :D it's good for the long run imo
TapTitans,3daurs,PanicPeach,2,Tue Jul 14 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"There is an explanation somewhere that Knights Shield increases boss gold at a comparatively higher rate early on. So if you have egg, chest, and knights shield, it's pretty efficient to level up knights shield first. I think around lvl 90 or 100 knights shield gets easily outpaced by the egg+chest, but it is really good early-midgame."
TapTitans,3daurs,KobeBryantReeves,3,Tue Jul 14 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I have with KS is that it doesn't help AT ALL when you are stuck at a wall. When you're stuck, it means you can't pass the current boss, and in this case, CE + CoC will be much better since farming that will help you pass that boss stage. KS is only good in the early stages of the game when you either don't have CE+CoC or they aren't high level enough. Since the tier is supposedly based off of end game, I think it should be tier 3 or even 4."
TapTitans,3daurs,FingersFellOff,4,Wed Jul 15 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"Idk, from what I've read, gold isn't meant to help break walls anyways, damage is. Gold gets you there faster, not through it. Because of that, if we think of KS as bringing our walls down to lower,manageable levels, it does it's job well. Once you max CoC+CE, maybe it loses some effectiveness and maybe goes down to the top of the t3 list, it is very,very effective. Right now, a level 70 KS makes it so that the boss on stage 2340 gives me just enough gold to level DL so I can hit 2341, and that keeps going till I hit my wall. So maybe end-game maxed CE+CoC is better, but KS is definitely not to scoff at. Bottom of t2 MAX imho."
TapTitans,3daurs,KobeBryantReeves,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:40:09 2015 UTC,"I agree that damage is to help break walls, but when you're grinding away for the last bit of $$ to get a specific hero or evolve dark lord, KS doesn't help much. The list was tiered based on end-game results, at which point KS isn't nearly as beneficial as the rest of the T2's. If it were based on early/mid game, then I would argue ring of wondrous charm helps more since it can drastically lower the amount of time grinding to achieve [hero] or evolve DL."
TapTitans,3daurs,FingersFellOff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:45:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're right here, but I still feel like KS can't be ignored. I mean, there's no argument to make to say it's bad, even at end game, up to a point. If you get it early, up to level 90, it's going to be so helpful, and then on the road to perma chesterson, still helpful. It's just once you get to that goal or pretty close to it that it's deemed worthless. I'm still only hitting stage ~2.3k and my CoC+CE combo is only like lvl 60 and my KS level 70, so right now KS is my premier gold artifact, so I think for the OP, who is restarting it'd be a great help. But yes, you are right about it depreciating in value at end-game, but I think there's good arguments for KS's importance to someone starting out. Think that's it, and thanks for a nice discussion about this, made me think a little."
TapTitans,3daurs,BossL1K3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:10:03 2015 UTC,"KS is only for the bosses, since you get 10x more Mobs  than Bosses you will get more money with CE and CoC than with the same level of KS worth of both."

TapTitans,3daurs,Dr_LordBastion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:21:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen the math before. In a nut shell, just level KS to 90 ish, then don't worry about it. A level 90 KS is the same as a level 54 (or maybe it was 53) CoC and CE, and it's cheaper. Around end-game, KS is pretty much useless, so the earlier you get it, the better."
TapTitans,3daurs,Koreial,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:16:43 2015 UTC,"Knight's shield has a high damage modifier, cheap to upgrade, and it doesn't have a max level. The gold modifier is an added bonus and a good one at that which is what makes it tier 2. Egg, chest, chalice, and amulet don't affect bosses making this one of the only items that increase boss gold and it does so by a good amount. If your chest and egg are only at level 15 you should get the shield and put some levels into it.  Edit: FYI, I am still regularly upgrading Knight's Shield (currently at 260) due to it high modifier. I'm at +631k% AD and 11 sets."

TapTitans,3dc3qr,zarbi55,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:03 2015 UTC,"The game autosaves once every ~15 minutes, so you might have just been unlucky that it saved right when your hero died. If you save manually right before a boss, then you shouldn't have any problems."
TapTitans,3dc3qr,wooflekat,2,Wed Jul 15 22:23:10 2015 UTC,At that point it's just more worth it to revive or prestige right away.

TapTitans,3d9uv7,CarlosSz,2,Wed Jul 15 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"I was also appalled at people so readily admitting that they're using autoclickers. But thinking about it, it's kind of like using power of holding. At some point of time you will still hit a stage where you cannot kill the boss even with power of holding.   I guess if anything, it's like cheating the devs of their diamonds. Not that anyone really buys diamonds just to use power of holding anyway."

TapTitans,3d9wgr,blitzkit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:27:12 2015 UTC,"they literally don't tap to push thru levels. instead they only tap like once every 5 mins (with the overseer lotion + ogre's gauntlet combo) you'll get a 300 sec Cooldown + 300 sec duration. the shadow clone will cover it's cooldown. you'll still tap but once in 5mins (it'll lessen if you upgrade your ogre's gauntlet)  and perma clone alone isn't enough for reaching 2000, you need high AD% + high tap damage."

I got my undead aura to 56 (280% more relics) and then went from there. Anyways, here are some advantages to shadow clone:   You can progress meaningfully and get through much of the banal and less challenging point of the game with only a few clicks/taps. You can leave the game running while typing a report at work or watching a television show. You won't have any finger pain from tapping like a lunatic trying to break the 2220-2250 wall.   Again mathematically it might be better to get other things but I would go for it even if it takes you like 3-4 prestiges. I raised mine kind of gradually, i.e. didn't go for 90 levels of the ogre's gauntlet at once."

Once you do, then getting perma clone will be your priority since perma chesterson is extremely expensive to get and will require you to be well into the 2600s stages.

TapTitans,3dadvz,PanicPeach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:25:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend getting any permas until after the dl evolve wall. I would recommend giving UA lots of love and following damage e on YATTO. Once you pass dl evolve wall, you can get the permas in much less prestiges."

If Game Hive is anything like my former company, there is only one person devoted to community outreach and communication.  The wonderful/frustrating thing about community is that we form groups on whatever social media we use the most, so there are a lot of vocal groups in many different places.  The are ~5000 of us here, but there are 1,072,050 likes on the Facebook page.  When having to chose where your limited time can be spent interacting with users, it makes sense to pick the place that will have the biggest impact.

TapTitans,3d7q45,CherrySunic,2,Tue Jul 14 04:10:42 2015 UTC,"You should probably be prestiging more if you have time to play. Since you're still prestiging before stage 1000, it should only take you max 2-3 hours of non-stop playing to hit your 'wall'. Once you cannot kill a boss within 5 seconds just hit prestige and use YATTO to figure out which artifacts to invest in. Only if you're really close to getting a new hero then you might want to spend some time to grind the money for it.   In terms of artifacts, I would recommend getting new artifacts if you can afford one within 1-2 prestiges. But you might want to try and see if you can find your seed first and check out your sequence. Cause if you want to salvage artifacts it's better to do it earlier while it costs less diamonds.  Have you tried using the instructions on this post to find your artifact seed? It worked fine for me when I tried it with iOS8.3.   Are you stuck at any one hero in particular? There are several guides you can use, e.g.: for Flavius, Chester and Mohacas, that involves evolving certain heroes to help you.  Hope this helps!"
TapTitans,3d7q45,cloudmist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:01:04 2015 UTC,"I've looked at the guides. The one for Mohacas (who I'm stuck at) talks about different artifacts I just don't have.   I didn't realize I could use the backup to find out my sequence. I'll definitely be doing that tomorrow and try and get a Crown Egg and Worldly Illuminator.   And part of the problem is I don't play much. I have a busy life, and really only get to play when watching something on Netflix. It's hard for me to get time to play as much as I want."
TapTitans,3d7q45,cloudmist,2,Wed Jul 15 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"Ah I see what you mean. You probably don't need the exact same artifacts as the guide, what is your total AD% from your current artifacts?   I think the important points are getting chester to 520 and evolving flavius. Once you can do that it should be much easier. I think the artifacts you currently have aren't too bad. Crown egg is good but you won't see that much of a difference in Chesterson spawns until it's like level 60 or something like that (25% spawn rate). I recommend focusing on your knight's shield instead for early game gold, check out this post for some maths.   Lastly, worldly illuminator is cheap AD and helps cut your play time in half. If you've checked your artifact sequence and it's coming up in the next 2-3 artifacts, I say go for it and get it quick! If it's quite far away and you cannot salvage anything to get it sooner then I recommend just leveling your current artifacts and getting past this wall first. Once you get Mohacas it should be relatively easier to go all the way to Dark Lord and you should get a huge increase in relics from that.   Unfortunately this game isn't that idle, once you've progressed further and gotten permaclone it should be much better so don't worry too much about it!"

TapTitans,3d66d9,KobeBryantReeves,3,Mon Jul 13 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"Get it to 140 for now and then you might want to tweak your other artifacts before leveling further. Bring your artifacts up until you can get to 2715 as that's the next relic point. While there's no hard and fast rule on how often you should level UA, it's generally accepted as the thing to do to put 1-2 levels in every prestige.  One method of leveling you could try is 5 levels into UA for every new relic point you reach. So you'll go 145 by 2730, 150 for 2745---if the returns feel too slow, adjust upward. If it's too much of a grind, adjust down. Go with whatever moves your wall closer to 3K than being stationary.  And you should make a YATTO as people will click on it and offer more in-depth advice the more info is available. I would anyway :)  Edit: There is also the thread linked to above to consult. Still think it might be premature to use when fatigue hasn't set in but---math is math."
TapTitans,3d66d9,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Is the difference in slightly boosting to the next few relic points worth it in terms of relic gains? Let me make a Yatto account, will save a lot of time typing out my specs haha, thanks!"
TapTitans,3d66d9,Calrabjohns,2,Mon Jul 13 21:13:28 2015 UTC,"It depends. How often are you prestiging in one day and do you always go to your max comfortable prestige stage or about 100(ish) below. For now, I've been going to my max comfortable stage (2880/2895) even though I can reliably hit 2925. Eventually imo, the time you spend per prestige will matter more than the relic modifier. If you can prestige more than once a day, it should be better to cut the MS you go to by 100 or so stages---whatever requires you to have to use Berserk, Crit and Heaven Strike. My thinking is those stages require anywhere from 1-3 hours of wait time for your skills to refresh depending on your duration levels and how often you can cool down your skills as well as the time you have even if you can afford with game resources to do all of this.   I've yet to put this to the test though.   The reason I suggest you consider leveling UA as you move your wall up is I'm assuming you'll be playing a little while. If you're going to continue playing for awhile, it's worth investing in UA. That's what the formula will tell you concretely that colblitz linked to (and he made YATTO so I almost always defer to his recommends)."
TapTitans,3d66d9,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:29:28 2015 UTC,"On average, I prestige once a day... maybe twice on a good day / tournament. My prestige level (2670 or so) can be achieved without having to wait for any skill refreshes. I zerk once at 2355 or so to get DL Evolve, and then one more zerk at 26xx to push a few more levels before I prestige. After the second zerk, I prestige right away and don't bother waiting.       Sorry I'm not very good at math and the formula is confusing lol"
TapTitans,3d66d9,colblitz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:53 2015 UTC,"I'm terrible with executing math and slightly better at puzzling my way through it when it's already been displayed so I completely relate heh. Would have been a disservice to not mention though that the formula does work.  Once a day (which I am going to say is normal---my playstyle as a whole is not), UA will give you more returns in conjunction with slowly getting your wall up bit by bit. I would finish up permanent shadow clone before anything else though. When Ogre's Gauntlet gets to 90, you'll have that skill available for good for the duration of that prestige. It's 5 minutes, click, 5 minutes, repeat. That will save time long term which makes it more important than consistent UA leveling until you get it.   My connection has started to go to sh*t again so I'm not able to comment more right now :\  But I will say that because you're at point where you are pushing your wall a little bit by little bit, you can probably afford to go CoC/CE/CrE as your focus and then shift to DH/HT/Tincture when the struggle returns. In-between both of those groups, put levels into KS as it's a budget item that gives good AD and gold in comparison to cost. If you're really not struggling, buy remaining artifacts as you can. Other than Amulet, they all have a use besides the AD and they have a level cap so you can eventually level to cap and then return to tap. Particularly Dark Cloak as those bosses are a PITA to fight when your wall comes.   So, get UA to 140, OG to 90, Gold/Dmg---use the DmgE tab for YATTO if you want to balance the approach consistently and fill in other tabs when you can. The weapons you have and the hero customizations you've bought---it affects the recommendations you'll get when using YATTO. Click Calculate to prompt the tab suggestions.

TapTitans,3d6bnz,sakux2002,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"Oh its boring as hell to do. Just depends on how long you see yourself playing. I'm just saying the leveling in one bout like that is the most efficient way to do things. A lot of UA comes down to personal preference. Getting mine to 500 was a huge grind, but seeing 400k+ relics a run was well worth it. (currently working towards 600 and thats slow. (2 lvls per prestige generally, with the occasional third when leftover relics add up)"
TapTitans,3d6bnz,Benlarge1,3,Tue Jul 14 22:31:52 2015 UTC,"What I do for artifacts is I first level Undead as much as possible, then level artifacts that have a level cap (until they're maxed out) then I level whatever is left. Repeat as needed"
TapTitans,3d6bnz,killerparrot6,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:52:40 2015 UTC,"I was in the same position, I dumped all into UA for about a week and a half, now im getting 200k a run at 2775ish.. my ua at about 280 now, im still dropping atleast 1 level per prestige into it now, sometimes 2 or 4 depending on my mood.. i wish i had pumped it up sooner.. it will take about 30 prestiges to pay for itself"
TapTitans,3d6bnz,Melmelcom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"You could also be like. Every tournament prestige you do UA only, then throughout the week on non days, you do your regular artifacts. For me, I figured I might as well pour all on my UA..i'm only prestige 118 and its level 304."
TapTitans,3d6bnz,wooflekat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:56:14 2015 UTC,"The way I made UA leveling feel more ""rewarding"" was by coupling it with other Artifact goals.  For every 25 levels of UA, I'd upgrade Crown Egg and Chest of Contentment 25 levels (all 25 of UA first, then 25 each of the other two; it was typically possible to do both the CE and CoC upgrades in one Prestige because of the Relic increase from those extra 25 UA levels).  For example, once UA was 100, I got CE and CoC to 120 (50% Chestersons); by the time UA was 225, both CE and CoC were at 245 (100% Chestersons). A good starting point for this system is UA 25 and CE and CoC 45 (20% Chestersons).  Once UA reached 250, I coupled it with the skill duration Artifacts. For every 50 levels of UA, I'd upgrade the skill Artifacts by 100 levels (5 minutes).  For example, at UA 250, I raised the Clone/Crit/Cry/Berserk Artifacts to level 190 (10 minutes); at 300, I raised them to 290 (15 minutes). By the time UA is 450, those skills will all be ""permanent.""  The gold and tap damage upgrades can be squeezed in whenever; I normally spend tournament days following DmgE on YATTO."
TapTitans,3d6bnz,-Alvery-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:33:06 2015 UTC,"Excellent post, thank you. My max is 2820 and since 11 prestige I only leveling my UA. My CE is 245 CoC 235 DH and HT is nearly 200.  Right now UA 179.   My plan was 200, but after this post:)  Thank you again:)"
TapTitans,3d6bnz,BossL1K3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:25:12 2015 UTC,I say you should get every 2nd run a full prestige into UA to around 200 for now. Then get some more damage and then get your UA slowly to 250 and then 300. With 400 you need more than 1 run to get 1 level of UA where it makes little to no sense to keep leveling it up then.
TapTitans,3d6bnz,BossL1K3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:03:52 2015 UTC,so i should do dmge-undead aura-dmge-undead aura and so on until its 200 for now ? and when to level it to 250 ?
TapTitans,3d7jb5,weissis,5,Tue Jul 14 03:12:45 2015 UTC,"Without knowing your next artifact, I would recommend leveling your current artifacts, but here's some tips that might help you.   Use yatto. me to level your artifacts as efficiently as possible, as well as other things.   -According to the dmgE tab,the one most people use for the most balanced increase in dmg and gold, this is what you should level.   Crafter's Elixir to 14, Death Seeker to 9 and Hero's Thrust to 17. Later on, I'll detail how to find your next artifact, but bar maybe 1 or 2, no matter your next artifact, these are really good artifacts to level.   A rule of thumb, is that if you can get enough relics in one run, buy the next artifact. However, there's more to this.   You can find out what artifacts you'll get next, and also put in your priorities for the ones you want next. You can find the best priorities from the artifact tier list you can search for. Just looking at your artifacts, I would recommend Crown Egg to couple with CoC and Knight's Shield, as those are both very good, tier 2 artifacts for gold.   We can see your next artifacts by finding your seed, and you can find the thread for that as well through search.   After you find your seed, just plug it into the sequencer part of the yatto.me website, your priorities, what you own, and then it will try to find sequences in where you can salvage upcoming artifacts to faster get the artifacts you want/need.   From here on, it's up to you. Plug in which artifacts you want, try to save up the gems for them, and you'll be on your way to the artifacts you want. Then, everytime you prestige, go over to the calculator to find out how to best spend your relics.   Hope that helped and wasn't confusing."

TapTitans,3d7jb5,BossL1K3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:30:05 2015 UTC,Since your UA is just 10 level it to around 20 then 40 then 100. Besides leveling UA you should buy an artifact when you can buy it with 1 prestige. Use yatto to get the best and most effiecient leveling path.
TapTitans,3d8t85,eXclurel,10,Tue Jul 14 12:01:08 2015 UTC,"It's called an incremental game. Here is what Wikipedia has to say about it:   An incremental game (better known as an idle game) is a video game that focuses on the player performing a simple and repeated action to gain a form of currency which can then be used to buy or upgrade characters and abilities inside the game. A common game theme is to have sources of time-based income displayed as ""buildings"", such as factories or farms. Some incremental games require players to collect multiple currencies to progress through the game."

TapTitans,3d8t85,FluffyPhoenix,3,Tue Jul 14 12:38:23 2015 UTC,You just described most video game RPGs.
TapTitans,3d6oqn,Miothan,2,Mon Jul 13 23:09:56 2015 UTC,"Well, everytime you get a new weapon your seed number changes but the order of your weapons will not.   For example: Your first seed is 1234 and the next weapons you get is ABCDEFG. After you get weapon A, your seed will change to say 9876 and if you put it into the sequencer the next weapons will become BCDEFGH.  Hopefully that's what the confusion is!"
TapTitans,3d6oqn,cloudmist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:33:09 2015 UTC,"Link/username?  What was wrong? From what you said I could get   You got your seeds, put them into YATTO, got a prediction  Got a weapon from daily dungeon  Weapon was not the predicted next weapon  Looked at seeds again, they were different from before  Put in new seed, got a different weapon sequence   One possibility is that the old seed was typoed or something, and the new seed correctly predicts things from here. Another possibility is that you got a weapon in between 1 and 3 and forgot about it without inputting into yatto, but that's easy to confirm with you. The other two possibilities are that yatto has a bug, or that something changed with weapons (I hope not >>), but without getting another weapon it's hard to test..."
TapTitans,3d6oqn,colblitz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:22:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm could very well be any of the things you mentioned, ill just wait until the next tournament is over to check it and ask for assistance if its still broken for me by then :P  Atm i have 27 weapons and have triple checked my weapon number so i know that its correct now at least."
TapTitans,3d588n,canadianschism,5,Mon Jul 13 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"Slow and steady is the way to go - a lot of people look for shortcuts where there are none. (This is an incremental game, what'd you expect? :P)  With that said - it's true that getting UA early on will be pretty helpful. Check out this post to find your seed and one of the sequencers to find your sequence/see if you can get a better sequence. It's up to you if you want to use that, some people choose not to since it does take away from the excitement somewhat. The difference later on between getting your tier 1/2 artifacts early on and leaving it up to chance is pretty large, however, and it can make your life a lot easier to try for a better sequence.  In terms of leveling artifacts vs. getting new ones, general rule of thumb (for now) is to buy an artifact when you can afford it with what you get from one prestige.  Personally I don't feel like UA is the best first artifact to have, but you definitely would want to try to get it within your first, say, ten artifacts or something (aka, not top priority, but definitely try to get it early)  To check your prestige, click the gear in the top left, then click statistics"
TapTitans,3d588n,colblitz,3,Mon Jul 13 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this. Exactly what I was looking for, to be honest.  I'm not looking for a shortcut, just a bit of a better path towards getting better. As long as I know that I'm not behind the curve because I'm not hitting level 100+ at this point in the game, I'm good with that :)"
TapTitans,3d588n,colblitz,2,Mon Jul 13 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"No problem, feel free to ask anything :D  And yeah - it's a bit hard to judge early progress because it depends a lot on your first few artifacts (since you only have a few the differences are more significant)"
TapTitans,3d588n,Calrabjohns,2,Mon Jul 13 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"WI for justice. What is the AD for it without Tincture? Either way, you'll want this one before UA imho. 119 relics to max, cuts your prestige time in half almost universally and gives you thousands in AD (mine has gone over 5K but Tincture afaik works retroactively in addition to normally increasing AD for future levels so I don't remember non-Tinc. rate)."
TapTitans,3d588n,colblitz,2,Mon Jul 13 17:23:03 2015 UTC,"Without Tincture it starts at 300, then +150/level  And yeah. I think for early artifacts a lot of people underrate WI, RoWC, and KS."

TapTitans,3d588n,Calrabjohns,2,Mon Jul 13 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would make everyone cringe. On the bright side the 3 artifacts you have are very good and you should keep them.   If you are running the game on Android get this APP:   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siddworks.android.taptitanssavefileviewer&hl=en  It will show all info like the weapon/artifact seeds you will need to easily set up an account at the website:   http://yatto.me/#/  Which will show you how ""salvaging"" new artifacts will change your order, if at all."
TapTitans,3d588n,Miothan,2,Mon Jul 13 17:55:49 2015 UTC,"Tincture is great but it's super expensive. I actually am not sure I would go out of the way to get it. By the time you are buying artifacts on the regular, your AD should be beefy enough that Tinc. will do its job of enhancing everything you have.  On its own though? It looks super confusing to a new person and upgrading it doesn't seem to have discernible benefit. For me it didn't feel that way. Eventually, I learned what it did. So---I never salvaged and I still leveled it late relatively speaking.  Trust me when I say you've done nothing irrevocable and you already are ahead of the curve by getting advice here :) (Not referring to my own necessarily but---perfect TT think tank here as a whole, we are!)"
TapTitans,3d588n,Miothan,3,Mon Jul 13 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"Before your diamond cost to salvage artifacts becomes to much for you, you want to have acquired Worldly Illuminator and UA, without those 2 you are going to have a much harder time in the game.  Diamond cost to salvage goes up for every artifact you own, so early on is when you should salvage bad ones and only keep the most esencial artifacts.  As an example without UA: At stage 2300 (which you can reach quit fast if you play actively enough) you get 10100 Relics   While if you have UA at level 50 at stage 2300 you get 35500 relics"

TapTitans,3d588n,showyodo,4,Mon Jul 13 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"Universal Fissure is one of the worst ones that only becomes good once you hit the ""end-game"" which consists of stage 2600+  Drunken hammer is great and a keeper, Ring of Wondrous Charm is well...decent.  I would salvage Ring and Universal Fissure if i were you, that way the diamond cost to salvage wont shot up drastically and they are also rather bad for starting out, have you looked at the artifact tier list?  About the Ring: It sounds good, but if you cant get the gold for the next hero anyway it doesnt matter much, it gets good once you have a solid foundation in the game, but as a starter artifact its terrible."

Motivation to stamp out the last opponent who can kick your teeth in.  2880/95.   Yeah I'd be curious to know your wep. seed. I'll put it in a blank form but you must have done well early on in tourns. too. You and Psychocane and Raymond and Okin and Karrash and Raffish...so many peeps. I couldn't break the Jaq wall when tournaments first popped up as she was last hero during the 2500 days (as I'm sure you know). Was so happy to get Mohacas then. Every hero was a mystery. I think the increased cap and new heroes was what finally got me Jaqulin. Either that or I'd barely broken wall before the update came.   Do you remember how many weps you got when they first introduced DDs and Tournaments? I remember getting six or seven as intro to the feature.
TapTitans,3d2yal,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:01:39 2015 UTC,"I'll check my weapon seed again when I get home, work computer doesn't let me install anything and I'm on the iPhone :/  If I remember correctly, when tournaments first came around the cap was still 2000. I don't remember if I had Jacq then but I remember not being able to get to 2000. Jacq was really Jacqulin the Unknown back then! Probably took me awhile before I could hit the cap. But alas, that didn't last too long, they raised the cap to 2500 4-5 tournys later. Then there was the infinity Takeda but I never got to that point before they released the new heroes. I remember not having any weapon sets yet when they released the new heroes cause people were complaining about having to collect new weapons to complete their sets again. Eventually I managed to hit 2500 and placed first in quite a few tournys before they raised the cap to 3000.   I don't recall having any introductory weapons though! I know the first one I got was through the daily dungeon and I had to wait till the 5th day to get it :(  Believe it or not, WI was my last artifact so that's probably why I have an play time of 2603hrs :O  EDIT: Found my seed: 1064735592.

TapTitans,3d2yal,Calrabjohns,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:32:24 2015 UTC,That's right. I definitely couldn't get Jaq then either! I think maybe when cap raised to 2.5 I could but I recall still having issues for a little while even then. Yeah I remember hearing about Inf. Takeda but that got squashed quick or quick enough that I couldn't attempt to use him. But you must have been close to a set before change right? I was nowhere near it. Had maybe 50 total.  Hmm. I gotta try and find a record of it in old posts at some point.   Ouch! WI last >_<. Had Death Seeker last. Yeesh.   You have double total I have for weps so I can't be too surprised but that still seems like a damn good seed. Twitterella hates me :(

TapTitans,3d4cve,involvex,3,Mon Jul 13 12:53:30 2015 UTC,This is my current dilemma. Crown egg is my 28th artifact. I have 25. It'd cost me a pretty penny to grind it out at 40k relics per prestige.
TapTitans,3d4cve,ModKnight,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"Guess I got lucky, Crown Egg was my first and Chest of Contentment was like my fifth, but I had to prestige a lot just to get my damage up :(  People where saying they busted walls with 5k% AD but I needed like 10k%."
TapTitans,3d4cve,youarejustanasshole,2,Mon Jul 13 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"Well, personally I favor stopping at crown egg level 225 just to get a little variety since I don't like just staring at Chesterton, albeit it may sacrifice a bit of efficiency.  Also for best efficiency I would not just concentrate on raising alone until you reach the desired level.  Not a big fan of Yatto because I have a personal build strategy I think works better, but it's still got the right idea overall so I would suggest using something like that."
TapTitans,3d4cve,misogichan,2,Mon Jul 13 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"I felt that way too for awhile. Probably should have stopped leveling CE where you did when I was feeling sentimental but I left it at 180 for the longest time and then 200 and then I just said F it and went full Chesterson. Occasionally miss the variety.  What sort of level schema do you use regularly? Since there's no Duration tab yet on YATTO (if there ever will be---not sure how to incorporate it), I've been diverging from recommendations while chasing Perm. Crit/Cry. I also tend to level Tincture independently as the AD tab keeps pushing me to level DC and Amulet and I don't wanna :p"
TapTitans,3d4cve,Calrabjohns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:18:36 2015 UTC,Very much so!
TapTitans,3d4cve,Mbdking,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"Depends, but if you get like 100k each prestige its worth to buy it, if you get a relatively low amount its not at all."
TapTitans,3d4cve,BossL1K3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:34:49 2015 UTC,Looking at you're previous posts it seems like your max stage is currently around 2300? I would assume that means you have about 90k%AD?   I got Perma Chesterson (Crown egg@250) around +380k%AD following Yatto's suggestions in DmgE.
TapTitans,3d4cve,showyodo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:30:16 2015 UTC,I'll let another user's math do the talking.
TapTitans,3d4cve,Unaufhaltbarr,2,Mon Jul 13 15:59:22 2015 UTC,"I knew the combination was powerful but I didn't know it was that powerful, especially the returns from CoC. Gonna pump that up some more after 300 UA and 15 min. duration investments. Thank you :)"
TapTitans,3d50n4,dhoft,3,Mon Jul 13 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"i would check your seed on yatto and see where it is next in line, if its the next artifact push for it. Knights shield at even a couple hundred is no comparison for even a 50% chesterson spawn rate"
TapTitans,3d50n4,rcpcdude,3,Mon Jul 13 16:21:33 2015 UTC,Found my Yatto seed and Crown Egg should be my next artifact. Woohoo. So after my next prestige I should get it and will invest quickly. Should help with the DL Evolve wall immensely I would assume.
TapTitans,3d50n4,rcpcdude,2,Mon Jul 13 17:13:21 2015 UTC,"yup my first dl evolve i pushed to 2370 and farmed for chestersons for a good 10 minutes during a tourney, the more crown egg i got after that, the faster that grind became."
TapTitans,3d50n4,wooflekat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"Crafter's Elixir is also important. As with most other Artifact-related questions, YATTO is where to go to check how high each should be leveled.  You could also use that site find out when you'll get Crown Egg (though it's almost useless information at this point, since salvaging is very expensive and saving up Relics will take a while)."
