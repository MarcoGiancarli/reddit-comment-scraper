SRSDiscussion,3durh5,Taytethegreat,51,Sun Jul 19 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"I work with felons daily, helping them re-integrate into society, primarily with jobs. I think I have a unique input into this.  For me, the biggest issue for felons reintegrating is finding work.  Some jobs toss applications with the ""felony in the past 7 years"" box in the trash. These tend to be companies that are white-collar. These also tend to be just about any high paying job.  Some jobs consider it case-by-case. The most common example is retail and stockroom work - a lot of companies will hire a murderer or a drug addict way before they hire someone with a larceny conviction. Drug use doesn't really put the company at risk, because at worst they lose some hours of labor and replace the worker. Murder doesn't put the company at risk because most people know that murders aren't off-the-cuff things - most murderers are from people killing people they know intimately. Not really going to happen in a work environment. Larceny puts the company at HUGE risk because they either have to waste manager hours watching their own employee for theft, or risk letting the employee walk off with thousands of dollars worth of crap over the course of the employment period.  Some companies DGAF at all. These tend to be companies that are run by small teams (land-scaping - you're literally working on site with the owner of the company a lot of the time) or are otherwise not concerned with risk (agriculture is another one - what are they going to do, steal millions of dollars worth of tomatoes?). Kitchens also tend to not care - if you refused to hire cooks with felony convictions, you'd never fill all your open positions.  There are always exceptions to all of these rules. Some white collar jobs will still consider you. Some blue-collar jobs have had bad experiences with asshole ex-felons and chosen to wash their hands of the whole lot, but this is the overall trend.  Now, there's merit in using a felony conviction to screen an employee. I won't argue that it's wrong to refuse employment to someone with a history of stealing when they're working a cash register. But, by and large, felonies bar people from jobs that they shouldn't, and the jobs that they bar people from tend to be the highest paying.  If you were faced with the choice of living paycheck to paycheck until you can't work anymore, then hoping you can live off your meager SSI, or selling drugs for some sweet, sweet comfortable income, which would you pick?  I don't think there's an easy answer to ""What should we do to fix this?"" It's useful to know if someone has a felony conviction and it's certainly relevant to a lot of jobs.  If I were in charge of reforming the criminal justice system and helping felons reintegrate, I wouldn't necessarily ban asking if someone has a felony. I think that a bigger part of it is making sure that employers are using it as a reasonable step for consideration rather than a ""[Yes]/[No] Eligible for position"" check. I think a big part of that would have to come from a true shift in how we think about our criminal justice system and how we think about felons.  It shouldn't ever be a badge of honor or respect to have a felony conviction or have been to prison, but it also shouldn't be a life ruining event. The US criminal justice system right now doesn't do enough to make people feel comfortable about giving felons a chance, and that makes life very hard for people who have already demonstrated that they need help dealing with adversity."

Since a big deal is usually made whether someone will be charged with a felony or less.  With drugs or stealing, qualifying for a felony seems very arbitrary. Even for some kinds of sex crimes (especially since they're hard to prosecute and it seems kind of frequent to try to convict for a lesser misdemeanor even with a victim of felony). Anything sexual, even ""light"" by legal standards would be problems waiting to happen in the workplace (probably same logic for harassment).  The USA needs a reform in that regard, or at least people willing to look past just looking at ""felonies""  The only way I see it recognized is that the only non felonies that can prevent you from gun ownership are domestic abuse misdemeanors.

SRSDiscussion,3durh5,carbonmonoxide,3,Mon Jul 20 08:41:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The government already places many restrictions on the lives of ex criminals, especially ex felons. Many of these are regrettably necessary, like not being allowed to own a gun. Others are absurdly cruel, like not being allowed to vote.   The ability to filter out ex criminals who have already served their time is not one that any business should have in a healthy society. Most criminals who are rehabilitated will have a much lower risk of recidivism if they can get work and begin taking part in society. Disenfranchisement is probably the biggest cause of virtually all crime.  That being said, making them a protected class is probably too simple of a solution. There are legitimate cases where we might have concerns about a criminal working for a particular business. Violent criminals would likely be a risk if allowed to work with vulnerable people, for example. As to how or where exactly to draw these sorts of lines, that's too murky for me to see."

My friend went through a college sexual assault process a bit ago and she was incensed by how tone-deaf the proceedings were (All-male committees interrogating the victim, expressions of sympathy towards how ""difficult"" this must be for the accused, the standard stuff).  It feels like rather than trying to make the process cleaner and less traumatic for the victims, which would require a great deal of work and difficulty, colleges are going for the quick-fix methods that make good PR, but just make things worse for everyone."

Given that you acknowledge the bias of criminal courts towards the accused in rape trials, what do you think colleges should do? Just ignore sexual assault allegations unless there is a criminal conviction?  I totally agree with you about the first part though. I think college age male Redditors very sincerely believe in a massive trend of false rape accusations, and it scares them.

Try to make it reasonable for the alleged rapist to not cross paths with the accuser when appropriate. Essentially make it so that the accuser can attend that college without worrying about happening upon the alleged rapist, without putting an undue burden on the alleged rapist.

Going off the report, it factors in the 54% of rapes that go unreported, something the justice system can't do anything about. It seems like an unfair criticism to lob at the justice system for failing to prosecute rapists that have not be reported to the police.  As for why college tribunals are often seen in a negative light, they often have severe consequences, both academically and socially, for both the accused and the accuser, without giving them the same rights that are present in criminal trials. There are no lawyers in college tribunals, so students who don't know the legal system must fare for themselves, and what's worse is that if this does go to a criminal court, their testimony in these tribunals where they didn't have a layer may be used against them.  Another issue is that colleges often have other interests in play that can bias their findings in a case. Colleges may try to downplay cases of sexual assault in an attempt to make their campus appear safer and encourage applications to their campus. This is much less of a problem in a criminal court where juries can be selected to have the least amount of bias as possible.  Put simply, the college tribunals do not have the rigorous standards that are present in the criminal justice system designed to protect both parties, and with rape being such a serious crime, it's a joke that we are leaving punishment in some cases solely in the hands of colleges that have no legal authority or training."

The decision to report can be partially based on reasonable expectation of how the case would be handled. To use extreme examples, a police department that never pressed charges of rape would likely see reported rapes drop to zero (since it would be a lot of emotional trouble for nothing), while one that somehow automatically got every accused person imprisoned would see reports rise hugely (thanks both to victims assured they would get justice, and to people wanting to convict an innocent person out of spite)."

I don't know if this is common, but my school often offered deals to the accused. The accused student agrees to withdraw from the college, or transfer elsewhere. Since the college wants this problem to go away more than anything, they expedite the process by not including the words ""sexual assault"" anywhere on the student's information. Sometimes, the accused has also been eligible to return to the school once the accuser has graduated.   I have mixed feelings about this process. If the accused is in fact guilty, this seems like an incredibly generous offer, and the only punishment is the inconvenience of transfering or taking time off. But if there was a false accusation, the accused student's life has not been ruined. Victims' advocacy groups on campus are divided; some feel that this barely qualifies as punishment, while others are satisfied with getting perpetrators away from campus so the victim can move on with his/her life."

This is literally a way if you are potentially an unpopular minority to eliminate your presence (as rape was historically used as a lynching cry for black men) from the college.

Then only in cases with outrage or media attention they want to seem like they are taking things seriously by just punishing the accused with out a real investigation.   Also as /u/ReNoLuK said, college tribunals/courts aren't really equipped to handle a victim. In criminal court, a victim will probably face some trauma when being questioned by the accused's lawyer. But I would say having an entire ""court"" of college students, or even professors questioning you and poking and prodding your story according to their own bias is a lot worst. I would say a lot of college students aren't much better than teenagers when it comes to things like this, they just aren't mature enough. Even with all of the problems with the court system, I would feel a victim would be much better taken care of by going to the police.

Mainly I think, it's just easier for them to empathise with accused because in most high-profile cases they see someone just like them, and if someone like them can get his life turned upside down without doing anything wrong, could it also happen to them? People say that there aren't criminal cases, but still - imagine trying to admitted to another university with ""expelled for raping someone"" in your papers. Imagine explaining to all your friends and (even worse) families that you in fact did not rape anyone in quite hope that they believe you. And if your case is ""hot"" enough it may attract internet lynch mob that from now on will make your name easily google'able for a long, long time (seriously, see Adria Richards on google, one twit couple of years ago and it's still top result) - finding job won't be so easy... So, yeah - it's nowhere near to be as bad as rape itself, but I can understand while even innocent man may be against those courts.  Also it's new for them to be scared of something, that they have very little effect on in context of sexual assault - they never before felt what we feel when we're warned about rape, when we constantly watch our back when walking home at night, when we have to be extremely careful at parties and other events to not drink even a little bit too much (or getting drugged). Now they know how it's like (while still being, very, very mild version of real deal) and they don't like it.  On the one hand, I'm all up for doing something to reduce rape counts and increase conviction rates, but if the solution is to just throw innocents under the bus with all the others, I may understand why they are trying to fight back."

The system is often abused, and while crowing about ""false accusations"" is often hurtful and derailing, those also happen.   I don't think it's useful to brand all the opposition as ""cis white males crying tears."" For one, a significant amount of detractors are concerned with treatment of accusers, who are probably not cis white males. More broadly speaking, it's an issue that's serious enough that it stands on its own. You don't have to dismiss the idea of opposition to make the case that rape is an urgent, endemic problem.  Lastly -- strengthening the ""actual"" legal system's protections against rape would benefit the people in this country who are at most risk for rape: sex workers, trans people, and prison inmates. Add homeless as a multiplier.  Focusing the country's attention solely on the concept of ""campus rape"" ignores perhaps the most significant population by design."

There will be a few false positives, yes, but when the consequence is ""you need to go to a different college,"" I'm willing to tolerate a much higher false positive rate than when the consequence is ""you go to jail."" And again, as I said above, if you stay well clear of the gray area, I think it's pretty unlikely this will ever happen to you.   My feelings go out to the tiny fraction of truly innocent dudebros who suffer under this policy, but much more of my feelings go out to the women who have not gotten justice or even relief from constant threats of their rapists over the decades and the centuries."

SRSDiscussion,3dbzyg,Shablone,5,Wed Jul 15 02:19:54 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. The hate subs are awful and I'm happy to see them go, but what I find to be almost worse are the more subtle stormfront copypastas you referenced. Stupid, overt r/coontown-type racism is easy to point to and say ""this is bad"" but the stuff masquerading as statistics and facts that gets upvoted in default subs is dangerous because it has the power to actually influence opinions. And it's a huge grey area, so I don't think that type of stuff will be (or can be) deleted. That stuff is, technically, citing some legit sources, they're just doing so in a hugely biased way that fits their shitty, racist narrative.  So I agree with you, I don't think much will change. I'm glad they overtly established that reddit isn't about freezed peaches, so that will shut up some of those ""I'll defend to the death your right to say it"" people."

It's small and large biases that get voted on by the social and numerical majority of white, cis, men (and even others).   But on Reddit, what subs are allowed to exist is up to the admins.

SRSDiscussion,3dbzyg,thefinestpos,3,Wed Jul 15 03:04:06 2015 UTC,"I think the thing that actually makes reddit so much more vile than other places is that the hate speech isn't coming from actual hate groups.  Yes, there is genuine hate mixed in, but they don't tend to have the seriousness that actual hate groups have. They're just dicking around, for the most part, and plenty of them justify it by telling themselves ""I'm not an actual racist, I just make jokes"". What they don't really get is that most of the racism out there doesn't come from KKK members and neo-Nazis. It comes from normal people who just don't think beyond their own sphere of experience.  Stormfront, for example, has an agenda. So keeping the ""we don't hate anyone, we just think all the races need their own space"" kind of narrative from actual hate groups serves a PR purpose. Coontown doesn't care about PR, and it doesn't give a shit about how they come across in the media. They're just there to be juvenile dicks, and there's a mix of people who think they're actually discussing some suppressed truth about black people, and people who think saying offensive shit is a substitute for wit. They don't really strive to accomplish anything beyond maintaining their rights to be diarrhea fountains."

As far as Scientology, I think they've made it abundantly clear you can't really be a moderate and still belong to it, so it's a little complicated.

SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,UncleEggma,22,Tue Jul 14 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"On the face of it, I think it will be worth it. This is a situation which is unique to Germany because (as far as I know), people like priests and doctors aren't legally required to divulge confidential information, unlike in other countries.   These organisations cant right the wrongs of the past, but they can prevent more children being abused. If they reported people who've done things in the past, less people will seek help and in the end, more children might get hurt.  I don't know whether this does work out overall. Maybe it would be better to take these people off the streets and try and prevent child abuse that way, but I suspect that this plan has been adopted with a good chance of being more effective than the current methods.  I was listening to the radio the other day, and in light of this new legislation, they interviewed someone in Britain who went to a doctor for help. According to him there is no state funded help available unless YOU'VE ALREADY OFFENDED. How on earth is that going to stop child abuse? Apparently the authorities here don't care about prevention. The man's doctor was nice enough to research options with him and eventually they found a UK based group called STOPSO which tried to give free therapy, and its been relatively successful.  The only thing the doctors are obligated to do are report you to some authority, then that's it. I assume Germany is much better, but as you can see, the situation in the UK cannot possibly help prevent child abuse in the long run.  Perhaps when there's less stigma attached to it, and more people seek help, we can go back to arresting all perpetrators, but our first priority is to protect the victims and this seems to be, at first glance, a good way to do that.  Edit - to try and make my grammar less awful."

In a more perfect world, the concepts of pedophilia and child abuse would be completely decoupled: it is imprecise to say all pedophiles are child abusers or all child abusers are pedophiles. A lot of social activists agree that we shouldn't criminalize neurological ailments, even those that are dangerous, but there is a hesitation when it comes to open pedophilia. Our politicians have exploited the ambiguity of language so that society has become more concerned with hunting pedophiles than protecting children."

I'm not interested in making a claim about the rectitude of this, but SRS has consistently put forth the position that pedophiles should be chemically castrated or imprisoned. Repeatedly it has been stated that pedophilia is not equivalent to other sexual identities which are considered innate and not chosen by the person. Maybe some social activist groups feel differently, but the consensus here seems to be overwhelmingly the opposite.   In this way, I'm having difficulty following the logic of condemning some neurological pathologies while simultaneously righteously condemning the condemning if other neurological pathologies. I usually find myself following the social justice party line here on SRS, but this legitimately baffles me."

The horror about the kind of pedo that posts in that thread for glory and validation is absolutely reasonable. The insistence that every pedophile should be murdered, even those in treatment, is absolutely unreasonable.  I have been banned from SRS for saying that pedophiles are humans who need treatment and not hatred, because apparently you can't empathize with victims if you empathize with paraphilia-sufferers as well.

I am not an idiot, so I fully realize that being spermjacked (and the other silly threats SRSers occasionally make) is not a real concern.   For a mentally ill person, being threatened with death is a real concern. SRS would never tolerate redditors telling mentally ill people to kill themselves, and they wouldn't expect anyone who called it out to play nice either. I don't hate SRS, I love it. I post there regularly. But that doesn't mean I'll accept ""My bigotry is just a joke!"" from SRS posters. Especially when they don't even offer that excuse in the first place.  There are posters in SRS who seriously do believe that being a pedophile means you should be murdered on sight. It's not a joke like dildz or spermjacking. Many use of them think a diagnosis of pedophilia should come with mandatory chemical castration or imprisonment. Some repliers to my comment (which initially did not break the jerk at all) insisted that pedophilia isn't a mental illness and that pedophiles are just terrible people. This is patently false, and the idea that anyone would choose to suffer from a paraphilia is ridiculous.  The community can be great. I am more aware of its brand of humor than you think.

I wasn't banned from SRS because I have never posted there, but I've seen obvious joke posts suddenly deleted and with a reply saying ""BENNED"" or something like that  I've also seen plenty of serious posts (but advocating a SJW-accepted viewpoint) without the authors being banned (or at least the posts aren't deleted - I think in SRS this usually means the person wasn't banned)  This makes it absolutely clear that it isn't about humor.  Edit: ah now I see you asked about being banned from SA... Nope never banned. I did post there, unlike in SRS, but I stopped posting as soon as it started being SJW-ish instead of ""make fun of anything in any way you want""; if I was posting today I would probably get banned. The peak of SA quality was when 9/11 happened and SA forums reaction was to immediately start ridiculing it. If that mindset was still there I would still post but it's not. These days (well, a few years ago, I have no idea what it's like today) you have threads that are hugboxes for trannies and people get banned for trolling them. 15 years ago these people would get trolled into killing themselves for the amusement of the forums (but they wouldn't post pathetic shit like that in the first place). Everything else was secondary to having fun, these days it is more ""tame"".  Funny fact: nobody will see this post because it is an old thread, but if you want you can report it and they will ban me for it from this subreddit or at least delete this comment due to it being anti-SJW/offensive (the exact same thing SRS bans people for), and that's what the expression 'feels' you incorrectly used means... oh no I said ""tranny"" and I didn't even use the TRIGGER CODE lol"

Like I said before, there's a lot of knee-jerk disgust for pedophiles, and here's another thing that seems to true to me (but might not be true - I have no stats): the social justice sphere seems to include a lot of people who have suffered sexual abuse, and a lot of those people suffered it as children.

SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,Tidorith,2,Fri Jul 17 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the project to medicalise child abuse by saying that those who abuse children, or who think about abusing children, suffer from a sort of illness is a dangerously distorting one. If we could locate and 'cure' 50% of paedophiles (which seems wildly ambitious), I am not convinced that it would affect the rate at which children are abused very much at all.  The mistake, in my mind, is to treat the abuse and rape of children as separate to the abuse of other people, and to imagine that the abuser or rapist of children is a conveniently othered individual, rendered dissimilar from 'normal' folk by dint of an abnormality of the brain. This removes the abuse of children almost entirely from its sociological context, rendering it a matter of individual psychologies and tragic, but atomised personal histories. That broader sociological context is the widespread systemic incidence of rape and sexual abuse against vulnerable, minority or disenfranchised groups; women, queers, prisoners, mental patients and others, children included. Children are an interesting case because they are a group of people who, for more or less sensible reasons, we treat legally as less capable than other people, though their generally less well-developed physical, emotional and mental capacities make them vulnerable as well.   The majority of child abusers, from what I can make out (the research is poor and flawed) are not clinical paedophiles, and certainly not exclusive paedophiles. The number of child abusers who can maintain (albeit often abusive) sexual relationships with adults demonstrates this. Most of them are opportunists, and the situation will continue as long as the situation of adults having unsupervised power over children continues.   That said, I do think the German approach is fairly sensible, especially when compared to the reaction toward child abuse in the UK and US, which is almost completely backwards. Such is the fear of children being groomed, attacked or abducted by strangers (when in fact strangers account for only 10% of victimisers, with abductions being incredibly rare) that the police are, in the UK, quite literally offering abuse tips to parents in the form of classes on how to covertly monitor children's internet and telephone usage, and GPS tracking devices for children are being sold.   As for the 'paedophiles', obviously it is optimal that, if someone feels they have an urge to abuse children, that they don't. Whatever methodology is used to control this urge, as long as it is broadly ethical, doesn't I think matter much. I don't believe that there is such a thing as an uncontrollable sexual urge. Paedophilia is simply an alternative arousal pattern. As someone who has a strong paraphilia myself, I feel like I have some perspective on this. The idea that paedophilic urges are uncontrollable is a comfortable lie to assuage the guilt and shame of the perpetrator. More than this, it is a dangerous, enabling ideology. I do however acknowledge that people who feel they are suffering from such urges or desires deserve decent, dignified treatment, the same as anyone, and they should have the help they need, both for their own mental wellbeing and for the wellbeing of others. The difficulty of finding therapists prepared to be properly sympathetic is a serious concern. I do not think that people deserve praise for not abusing children directly or indirectly (ie child pornography), and I do not think that it is necessary to completely expunge the urge (probably impossible) or to undergo chemical castration or something along those lines for this not to be the case. Nor should people with such desires be treated as pariahs; whilst paedophilic desires are an obvious risk factor, I think it should always be remembered that, potentially, anyone can be a child abuser. It would be good if we had a situation where it was possible for people to openly acknowledge their desires so risk could be managed more effectively."

More than this, it is a dangerous, enabling ideology.   Well, the idea behind treating it doesn't have to be that it's ""uncontrollable"" so much as a significant source of distress. And people who seek help are unlikely to make excuses for themselves, IMO."
SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,oskomena,3,Wed Jul 15 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"And people who seek help are unlikely to make excuses for themselves, IMO.   Perhaps, though I think the tendency to try and portray ourselves in the best light is fairly universal. I would point out though that, currently, the medical thinking about paedophilia is heavily shaped by the fact that, in the English-speaking world at least, almost all those who reach medical attention do so through the criminal justice system, either for possession of child pornography or for direct sexual abuse. They're not necessarily there voluntarily, even if their distress and guilt is very real."
SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,Quietuus,4,Wed Jul 15 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"Pedophilia is a medically accepted paraphilia disorder. It's not an excuse, but it is a mental illness. Do you know better than those who wrote the DSM V then?"
SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,WizardofStaz,2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:03 2015 UTC,"The history of the inclusion of paraphilia in diagnostic tools like the DSM V is not an auspicious one. The early versions of the DSM categorise all sorts of paraphilia along with homosexuality as 'sociopathic personality disorders'. In later versions, paraphilia has been somewhat redefined. DSM IV made it clear that paraphilias were only a mental health issue if they were also associated with   clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.    DSM V renames the various conditions as 'disorders'. In the case particularly of sadism and masochism (which are the particular two I've looked at) I understand that the intention here is to separate clinical cases and your friendly neighbourhood kinksters. Paedophilia has gone along with the other paraphilias, being renamed 'Pedophilic Disorder' in DSM V. The implication is the same; not all people who feel some sexual attraction to children, even by the DSM's criteria, are mentally ill. It is only those who experience distress or impairment; I would argue that so-called 'uncontrollable urges' are more or less external to the attraction itself, and probably arise from a combination of pervasive rape culture ideology and from recurring maladaptive thought patterns."
SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,Quietuus,2,Wed Jul 15 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"This is not true. Specifically a paraphilic disorder is one where the sufferer experiences distress at the attraction outside of the shame placed on them by society or one where the attraction involves violence or nonconsensual sex. This includes sex with partners who are incapable of consent, even when the nonconsensual aspect is not necessarily a part of the attraction.   I would argue that so-called 'uncontrollable urges'   The lack of control is external to the attraction, but the urges are not. Through therapy, a pedophile might gain significant control over those thoughts and urges and thereby keep himself from doing harm or becoming fixated on bad fantasies."
SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,WizardofStaz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"outside of the shame placed on them by society   I find it difficult to imagine how this could be separated out. Also, I do not believe that even under the DSM, an attraction towards non-consensual situations is treated as a paraphilic disorder automatically. People with rape fantasies are not automatically considered to have a disorder, for example. I think some of our disagreement may hinge on the definition of the word 'urges', and particularly on what constitutes an 'uncontrollable urge'. Remember that many (possibly the majority of) acts of child abuse are far from spur of the moment things; they involve a lot of planning, grooming, forethought. Even seeking out child pornography, especially in this day and age, is hardly an instant thing."
SRSDiscussion,3d93w8,Quietuus,15,Wed Jul 15 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"Being a pedophile does not require you to have done any of those things. Urges and actions are different. I don't believe in uncontrollable urges as a concept, since an urge is a desire. Pedophilia is not a condition characterized by compulsion, it is one characterized by urge. A pedophile who does any of the things you listed is not doing them out of an ill compulsion, s/he is doing them out of desire and lack of willpower. This is why I have no problem saying such actions undertaken by a pedophile are still unforgivable.  http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Paraphilic%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf   If you don't believe what I've told you about the DSM V, read it there. As for being unable to tell the source of a patient's shame, I'm pretty sure that's entirely what a therapist is for. Virtually all disorders require shame or difficulty to be felt by the sufferer outside of pressures from society. If this metric displeases you, you're at odds with far more than just the definition of a paraphilia."

This is why I have no problem saying such actions undertaken by a pedophile are still unforgivable.   Then I'm not sure what you are arguing with me about, as we are essentially in agreement? Although I still do not see how shame can possibly be seen as anything but social (except perhaps if it is religious), but that's a problem for therapists. I will point out that the DSM is far from uncritiqued; also, at the end of the day, it's a set of common professional guidelines created by the American Psychiatric Association for its members. Though it does have global influence, most other countries in the world use the World Health Organisation's ICD-10 (which is now seriously outdated) which broadly agrees with the DSM IV. It would be perilous to treat these documents uncritically though. The clinical study of paraphilia is extremely distorted by the sampling and by the historical and current clinical goals of many people working in the field."

The SRSsphere is still fine with being grossly ableist when it comes to paraphilias.  People don't consider pedophilia to be treatable, even though evidence shows that it is. From a utilitarian perspective, initiatives like Germany's will likely save many lives and protect countless children. I hope the work they do can be used to help other people with paraphilias as well."

The biggest problem I have seen so far in this thread is that there was a user that posted a very personal and vulnerable comment about how he feels as a person being attracted to children that has been erased either by mods or the person themselves.  As far as I could tell, there was nothing rule-breaking about it, it was just kind of sad. He explained that the world doesn't look at him like a person, that the world sees him as a monster and even in circles like this where we are trying to have a calm and honest conversation about the difficulties surrounding the topic, people like him are treated as specimens without volition.  What he didn't recognize is that fact that there is a very good reason for not treating pedophiles like everyone else."

I have seen people on SRS say that pedophiles cannot be treated and shouldn't be given a chance to live in society peaceably. That they are all molesters or molesters-to-be and should just die. This flies in the face of psychiatric evidence-based approaches. It is an argument from hatred.   On the one hand, I understand wanting to push back against reddit's gross worship of pedophiles. I find it absolutely reasonable to hate pedophiles who take joy in victimizing children, as well. But I think even here there is hate for the ones seeking help, and that actually stands in the way of progress.  People, no matter how openhearted, just don't want to empathize with them or be connected to them in any way. I've seen mentally ill people say that they don't believe pedophiles should be allowed to call themselves mentally ill, presumably out of a feeling of being insulted by sharing the term. As though treatment and humanity should be granted only to people with pretty illnesses. It's no better than when making fun of people with schizophrenia was the in-thing.  We are past the age of leper colonies. What Germany has done is a step in the right direction, and I hope more countries follow suit. There is a lot of hope, particularly for non-exclusive pedophiles, that psychiatric care may be able to make their condition manageable."

But the fact that I was banned and others were not seems to indicate to me that this is not just a subconsciously accepted kind of bigotry, but an officially endorsed one.  I feel like if a person truly tries to empathize with everyone, they can reason their way out of virtually all bigoted beliefs. Problems arise when people allow themselves not to empathize with certain others, and this is incredibly common.

You don't have to forgive people for doing harm to you, and you don't have to be nice to them, but we as a society will be better off if we can help alleviate illness and educate ignorance. Fighting against those causes, for whatever personal reason, is ultimately fighting against a safer and happier world.  It's very difficult to let go of one's sense of blame and justice, especially when someone you hate is being done a good turn.

People want paedophiles arousal pattern towards children removed completely, which just isn't going to happen, short of chemical castration, libid-lowering drugs, surgical castration or whatever, none of which, I'd argue, should be anything but options of last resort. Arousal patterns are formed during childhood and early adolescence, and I don't know of any clinical evidence that says they can be reliably removed. It is entirely possible, though, for people to live completely happy, normal, productive, social lives with unusual or unpleasant desires of all sorts; the end goal is not to act on one's paedophilic desires by directly or indirectly harming a child."

Even if you can receive therapy that renders you outwardly a productive and wholesome member of society, you'll still have to control yourself. The fear that a pedophile may lose control even after treatment and hurt someone is not an irrational one, but it's also not a good enough reason to deny them their personhood or convict them of a crime they haven't committed. Ultimately we all have the potential to harm others, and society is built on the trust that we won't."

If I lack that internal obligation, what can I do? why should I be different when you would act the same if you were me? Can you empathise with that?"
SRSDiscussion,3d4vc4,interiot,2,Mon Jul 13 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"tldr: belief that empathy can't be taught appears to correlate to lower capacity for empathy.  eli5: if you don't think you can develop empathy, you don't even try. If you do think you can develop empathy, trying seems to make a difference.  I found this to be really interesting, from  http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/511  ""Empathy is often thought to occur automatically. Yet, empathy frequently breaks down when it is difficult or distressing to relate to people in need, suggesting that empathy is often not felt reflexively. Indeed, the United States as a whole is said to be displaying an empathy deficit. When and why does empathy break down, and what predicts whether people will exert effort to experience empathy in challenging contexts? Across 7 studies, we found that people who held a malleable mindset about empathy (believing empathy can be developed) expended greater empathic effort in challenging contexts than did people who held a fixed theory (believing empathy cannot be developed). Specifically, a malleable theory of empathy—whether measured or experimentally induced—promoted (a) more self-reported effort to feel empathy when it is challenging (Study 1); (b) more empathically effortful responses to a person with conflicting views on personally important sociopolitical issues (Studies 2–4); (c) more time spent listening to the emotional personal story of a racial outgroup member (Study 5); and (d) greater willingness to help cancer patients in effortful, face-to-face ways (Study 6). Study 7 revealed a possible reason for this greater empathic effort in challenging contexts: a stronger interest in improving one’s empathy. Together, these data suggest that people’s mindsets powerfully affect whether they exert effort to empathize when it is needed most, and these data may represent a point of leverage in increasing empathic behaviors on a broad scale."""

SRSDiscussion,3d4vc4,PikaKyri,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, empathy can be learned, I've seen it myself firsthand. The best example I can give you is abuser education courses. The good ones that work are founded on what's called a cognitive-behavioral model, where they teach (mostly) abusive men how to think correctly and respect their victims. Key in this education is the abuser's learning empathy for his victim, the lack of which allows such cruelty.  In fact, to expand on this example, one of the real problems with abuser education is that real change requires learning empathy for the victim. Recidivism rates remain high because of this. Ultimately, learning empathy is one of those things that may seem like one of those ""I guess we'll never truly know for certain"" type deals but I think it's straightforward. It's just tough to teach effectively."
SRSDiscussion,3d4vc4,penis-in-the-booty,2,Mon Jul 13 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"the lack of which allows such cruelty   I'm very skeptical of this.  We assume that when we use our empathy to understand someone, we are averse to feeling their pain.  That is not always what I have encountered.  Many (most?) abusers know both roles in an abusive relationship.  They have been abused, and being abused stimulates a huge amount of empathy because of the desperate attempt to understand and please the abuser.  A person who is abused becomes obsessively empathetic towards the abuser and is highly attuned to their every emotional ripple.  When these people become abusers themselves, they don't lose their ability to empathize.  The scariest person I know has a very keen understanding of the psychology of people around him, and it isn't entirely intellectual.  He isn't a savant who computes people's emotional reactions like a computer; he uses his empathy like everybody else.  But he does so in a sadistic way, and he gets satisfaction out of inflicting pain on people, presumably because it means he's on the right side of the relationship.  I don't know what this means about empathy, but I'm pretty sure that some people can apply their empathic abilities to another person without being bothered by that person's pain.  They can ""feel"" their pain and not care, or even enjoy it."
SRSDiscussion,3d4vc4,PikaKyri,2,Mon Jul 13 18:37:11 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to feel empathy and not care. They're synonymous. What you're thinking of is something different, more related to understanding suffering but not caring. Empathy inherently means having kinship and solidarity and that's where we run up against those walls, as I was saying. I've seen men change, accept responsibility for their violence, and feel real empathy. It can be learned and we can make this world better by it, demonstrably."
SRSDiscussion,3d4vc4,oskomena,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"I think the word ""empathy"" is overstretched, and people assume the different aspects of its meaning are psychologically inseparable.  Part of empathy is the ability to intuitively understand other people's emotions.  As human beings, we develop very complex and subtle abilities to understand other people's emotions and respond to them appropriately.  Another aspect of empathy is sympathy and compassion for other people, motivated by feeling what they are feeling.  There are plenty of people in the world who are incredibly accomplished at the former and utterly lacking in the latter.  If you assume they are the same and inseparable, then you're pretty much a sucker for people who can convince you that they care by demonstrating that they understand.  Okay, it turns out (no surprise) that I'm not being original in the least.  Wikipedia says there is a distinction between cognitive empathy (the ability to understand other people's emotions) and affective empathy (actually giving a shit) and says:   Psychopathy, schizophrenia, and narcissism have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy   So what you're seeing, maybe not in every case but certainly in some of them, is people downplaying their cognitive empathy to seem innocent and then ""learning"" it to convince you that now with their new ability they are incapable of knowingly being cruel to people."

I've had some really fucked up beliefs in my time and it took a really long hard look at myself and how utterly callous it was to really get empathy. I'm sure I probably still have some odd things lurking in there but I'm a lot more active in examining them and seeing why they're not good.  I honestly hope I was never someone who had derision when presented with ""imagine yourself in that position"" but it can be easier to present a hard outside when contradicted. I'd take that away with me and end up thinking about it more when I didn't feel quite so directly confronted with my lack of empathy and what it means.  I'm sure there are likely people who can't learn it but I'd like to believe that most people without empathy simply haven't learned it yet or have been too much in their own personal bubble to really get it yet."

I have seen people learn empathy, and I have seen people who came off as cruel turn soft when their human core is reached. That being said, attempting to teach empathy is such an exhausting and often disappointing endeavor that I can't recommend it as a strategy for anyone dealing with derisive or abusive behavior.  It is far easier to ""other"" people than to connect with them, especially if you feel victimized and insecure. Many people need a scapegoat on which to lay their own perceived sins, and hate is a wonderful distraction from shame. Most people I know who lack empathy are motivated by a sense of shame or a belief that others wish to shame them. By foisting this shame onto a different group, they can absolve themselves.  I would guess that most cruel people are fundamentally hurting and in need of help, and they likely won't stop being cruel until they receive aid. That being said, if you're the recipient of their vitriol, it's unwise and usually impossible for you to help them personally.   Lack of empathy is like anger. Sometimes you're angry because you're hurt. Sometimes you're angry because you want to be angry. If your problems are solved in the latter case, you'll still be angry. So helping people may teach them empathy and humility sometimes, but many people will doggedly continue to hate until they don't want to do it anymore."

So my perspective and opinion is very limited to put it nicely.  That said, it seems like the most important thing to do is to make sure your friend is safe and comfortable. What that entails, I'm not sure, but this webpage seems like a good start.  In terms of dealing with the community, I honestly don't know. You could engage in your own campaign of subversion against the abuser. Recruit friends and acquaintences to sympathize with the victim and question the bullshit the abuser has been spreading. Challenging the abuser outright without any support will not work.  Doing this seems tricky because you're going to need to act as an advocate for your friend which, while being a full-time job, is going to risk putting your friend in harms way via scrutiny (""Really? Abuse like how? What did [abuser] do? I can you prove it?""). Challenging the abuser's reputation and safeguarding your friend are almost mutually exclusive, as you probably already know, seeing as how the abuser can identify your friend at any point, therefore dragging them into the spotlight and turning the community against them.  If you decide to do this, people you'd need to approach (at least at first) are people who are close to you, but not particularly close to the abuser. You need people who will listen to you and keep their mouths shut until you get enough support (ie, people who won't go blabbing to the abuser, therefore risking your friend's safety). The two things you can achieve by doing this are either 'dethroning' the abuser, or getting a sufficient amount of people to splinter away and make your own, safe, activist group.  Anyway, I just realized that the victim is not your friend, but a friend of a friend, so please feel free to dsregard everything I've said. Even though this comment likely comes across as some deranged internet person giving you weird advice, I hope it's at least somewhat useful.  Good luck, and remember that the least that can be done is making sure the victim of abuse is safe and taken care of.

Imagine neonazis being able to surf SRS and then create giant lists of activists and outspoken PoC or GSM.   Remember that access to technological instruction and information tends to be distributed on a privileged basis. Some angry white boy in his parents' basement is more likely to be deeply technologically literate than a PoC in a low income neighbourhood. The former person would definitely be subsequently more capable of circumventing restrictions, while the latter would be open to even more victimization. All de-anonymizing the internet would do is raise the bar of tech-literacy for safely being online, which really only benefits white, middle classers.  There has to be a solution somewhere between.

They should have stood with Ellen Pao, but instead they chose to stand with fatpeoplehate and coontown. This is what happens when you have a myopic and naive perspective."

No doubt the whole blackout thing was stupid as shit, but putting it in a black and white way seems to leave no power to the moderators, who are ultimately doing the most important job for the users and for the admins."

Once you figure that out, then you'll see the ""help us get better moderation tools"" angle was a farce. Reddit has no interest in stopping brigading. They've pretty much said as much multiple times.   They see mods as free labor. Reddit is no different from other exploitative firms like Uber and AirBnB, who pay rock bottom (in reddit's case, $0) to the workers who do all the heavy lifting while taking the majority of the proceeds from said labor.

Actually it looks like it probably is an MRA poster, at least according to SRD. https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3cwc1f/unpopular_rape_awareness_poster_makes_the_front/  A woman certainly can rape a drunk man at a party, although it does happen less than men raping drunk women at parties.  If both are very very drunk and both consent at the time than no rape occurred, even if both would never consent sober. Of course this makes rape even harder to prosecute, which is of course terrible (how can you test that someone was drunk enough for mutual drunkenness consent).  But the problem with this whole debate is the massive amount of miscommunication.  A lot of MRA's and random people think that ""drunk"" means one or two drinks, when people can obviously consent. They say they would sleep with a ""drunk"" person and that would be fine under that definition.  A lot of feminists read ""drunk"" as almost passed out/unaware of their actions. A state where they are obviously not capable of making a decision. In this scenario an non drunk person sleeping with a drunk person is obviously rape.  Most MRA's would agree that having sex with a passed out-clearly incapable of making decisions girl is rape.

Don't get confused; it's easy to assume that the ""opposing group"" are some sort of Bizarro World people who are evil monsters or complete idiots who get everything wrong. Opposing political groups (like Democrats and Republicans) like to fall into this trap too.  Your issue is not with Men's Rights Advocacy, the philosophy as a whole: its core tenets are absolutely compatible with feminism. Your issue is with misogynists who use the philosophy as a shield. They spout their toxic views, and when attacked, retreat behind the bulwark of respectability.  Unfortunately, misogyny is extremely common in MRA circles, and I'm pretty sure the movement as a whole is poisoned at this point. These battle lines didn't have to be drawn, but they were. But don't fall into the trap of automatically taking the opposing side of everything MRA is about, because some of it is absolutely feminism-friendly.

SRSDiscussion,3cx7st,ginger_root_and_tree,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:32:13 2015 UTC,"But ""but I was drunk too"" is exactly what rapists will file as a defense. Or it will be a race to the police station.  A couple of key points I mentioned in another post (and I realise this will be controversial on reddit, of all places):  1) Women absorb 30-40% more alcohol per drink.  2) Men use alcohol as a tool to get women to have sex with them  3) We live in a patriarchy that conditions women to fulfill others needs before their own, sexually and otherwise. Now without taking away anyones self determination, I dont think its unfair to say that socially we are conditioned a certain way, and as such our judgements are determined a certain way.  Now considering these:   Sex offenders are overwhelmingly white males. Nearly 99% of sex offenders in single-victim incidents were male and 6 in 10 were white (Greenfeld, 1997). Men are more likely to commit sexual violence in communities where sexual violence goes unpunished. (National Sexual Violence Resource Center, 2004). Sex offenders minimize their number of victims. Speaking with 99 male sex offenders, court records showed 136 victims between them, but later during treatment, they eventually confessed to 959 victims between them (Slicner, 2007). Sex offenders are experts in rationalizing their behavior. (Slicner, 2007)   It really makes more sense to have laws that favor women & gender minorities. I think when it comes to this stuff, many men on here feel threatened by these kinds of conversations. Remember that in many other SJ discussions, we put aside equality in exchange for justice. Why not in this case? The aim of the law is to protect the most vulnerable, the most abused. Why do consent laws need to be 'fair'? Especially when most rapists are not even reported. And continue to rape and terrorise other people and we're living in a world where 1/4 women will be raped in their lifetime. More will be sexually assaulted. Why would we even want to aim for 'fair'?"

I still clearly have control over my sense of right and wrong and what is a good or bad idea.     I think defining when someone is too drunk to consent poses a lot of very tricky problems. People handle drink differently, some can drink a lot and not be as intoxicated, some can only drink a little. Some people are still mostly in control of themselves, some are not.    ""drunk"" does seem to me to be a very vague term. And nailing down ""too drunk"" seems equally challenging because of individual factors. Either way it seems like a difficult thing to define."

I used to get pretty drunk and while some of the time things could be hazy and I'd be impressionable and impulsive there were other times where I was completely lucid and in full control, inhibitions and all. I wouldn't do anything like driving in that state because I knew and was aware I could slip back into the other state at any time.  I think that's why laws related to alcohol consumption can look like they're all-or-nothing at times, because there is no line beyond drunk/not that wouldn't have a ridiculous number of exceptions."

Maybe change the wording slightly so it says ""Jake convinced Josie to hook up"" and ""people who are intoxicated cannot give their legal consent for sex.""  Maybe a better approach would be something that highlights how alcohol impairs consent, generally discourages drunk sex, and warns that you could be charged with rape for it, without saying that all straight drunk sex is rape on the part of the man. I don't think anyone on this sub would want to prosecute all couples who have drunk sex if they were equally drunk and clearly expressed a desire to have sex to each other, even if consent is technically compromised."

I agree that that would provide more context/make more sense, and I wanna bring up how this was explained to me by an ex-cop and a sexual assault counsellor. They stated that the person who initiates/propositions sex is the one who can be held responsible for the encounter. It is the initiator's responsibility to make sure that the person they are propositioning is capable of consenting and is consenting. So, yeah, if person A and person B are both drunk, and person A is the one who initiates the hook up and/or convinces person B to hook up, A is the one who can be charged with rape."

Nearly 99% of sex offenders in single-victim incidents were male and 6 in 10 were white (Greenfeld, 1997).     Most sex offenders were not sexually or physically abused as children.  In one study of 114 convicted rapists, 91% denied experiencing childhood sexual abuse; 66% denied experiencing childhood physical abuse; and 50% admitted to having non-violent childhoods.

I still have such a hard time explaining cultural appropriation even though it makes sense to me, but I'll give it a go.  Imagine you were an ethnic Indian Sikh man, wearing a turban for religious reasons, in post-9/11 America. Can you imagine how you must have been treated? If not, I bet you could find some stories. Anyways, there's no one coming up to you trying to learn about the Sikh religion and the turban's significance within it. Most see a brown guy in a turban and think ""terrorist"". So people are non-accepting of you. You're marginalized.  Suddenly some white kids decide that hey, a turban actually looks pretty cool, and they start wearing them. Retail stores catch on and start selling all these gaudy-looking turbans with logos and graphics on them and suddenly everyone has one. Meanwhile, you're still getting dirty looks, still being discriminated against, still being thought of as a terrorist. Even though everyone's wearing a turban now, nobody still knows anything about the Sikh religion or the significance of the turban, and nobody especially cares that you're not supposed to put logos and graphics on it either. Essentially they've taken your turban, stripped your culture from it and re-branded it (literally, in this case) as a consumable fashion accessory in their dominant, western consumer culture. Despite this, YOU still can't wear a turban because you're not a part of this dominant culture! Meanwhile each and every one of those people wearing this forcibly re-branded product of your culture (which you're no longer allowed to take part in) just see it as ""wearing what they want"".  That's basically what cultural appropriation is, as near as I can understand it. The re-branding of part of a marginalized culture as part of the dominant culture, without the consent of, and to the detriment of people belonging to said culture."
SRSDiscussion,3cwanb,Neil_DeSpace_Cosmos,27,Sat Jul 11 11:50:48 2015 UTC,"I've read criticisms of cultural appropriation similar to yours and it still doesn't make sense to me. In the example you mentioned, it seems to me that the real issue is persecution of someone elses religion (or perceived reliigion). The white kids wearing the turban are not the ones doing harm to the Sikh man, the ones calling him terrorist are. Sure, he may think the kids are being tacky but so what. Shouldn't we be working towards a society where anyone can wear a piece of clothing without being insulted/criticized for it?

SRSDiscussion,3cwanb,Borachoed,10,Sat Jul 11 13:12:04 2015 UTC,"Here's another example. Black appropriation in White culture. Blacks in this country have been enslaved, segregated, persecuted and shot in their own safe havens. A month ago, a White man walked into a historically Black church and shot 9 people and injured others just because they were Black. At least 6 Black churches have caught fire with suspicion of arson since the shooting. I could go on about racial discrimination against Blacks here but I'm sure you all know.   Anyway, here is this society that has people literally killing a section of its population in cold blood due to their skin color yet loves White girls who ""act Black"" (Iggy, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus). Twerking is cool and edgy when you're White but it's ""ratchet"" and ""ghetto"" when you're of the actual race that created the dance.   The idea behind cultural appropriation, as mentioned before, is ""you hurt us and you still profit from our culture. That's not cool"".   Hopefully that explains it a little better.   Also, if someone is telling you ""hey, don't wear a Bindi because I'm Indian and that's disrespectful"" or ""don't wear an Native American headdress because you're wearing it in the wrong social context/your ancestors murdered my family"", why would you keep doing it?

I won't use 'twerking' since I don't think it's a particularly valuable contribution to our culture, but let's go with jazz. It is an art form that was invented by Black Americans, but unfortunately many of the early black artists like Scott Joplin died penniless while white artists like Dave Brubeck enjoyed great acclaim.  Now, having said all that.. it was not wrong for Brubeck to play jazz. He was a great musician! The world is better off because he played! So for me, I don't think that 'cultural appropriation' is, in and of itself, a bad thing. Undervaluing black artists for their contributions is.  As for whether I would wear a bindi/headdress if someone asked me not to..

Like gyrating your hips, why does the fact that it happened to catch on in black culture first somehow prevent other races from gyrating there hips? Or for instance, why does the fact that soloing in certain scales improvisationally (like jazz) happened to first become popularized among African Americans who happened to be an oppressed minority somehow give them a monopoly on soloing in those scales improvisationally?  I suppose what I'm getting at is that the concept of culture as a whole is just kind of...arbitrary?(Not sure if that's the right word). Ultimately ""culture"" is just ""things that people like to do"" in a certain geographical area or among a certain group of people with a bonding characteristic (race, hobby, ethnicity). If soloing in those certain scales and gyrating your hips in a certain fashion happened to catch on in white communities first it would be part of ""white culture.""  So I don't understand why people are so obsessed with ""maintaining the purity of an oppressed culture.""

Most people in pop music see this as an unavoidable problem, but it isn't.   The issue is that making pop music that reads as ""white"" limits your American audience. Even racist, bigoted white Americans demand black music -- ever been to a wedding? A few people might like the polka part, but most people want to hear hip hop, R&B, swing, soul or jazz.  American pop music is racism. Any white success within pop music is oppression.

Many times these kids, who are primarily white, will speak in a ""black"" (read rapper-like) way, etc.  If it's poor kids really in gangs...I mean...it's not really appropriation in my eyes. I mean, yes it is, but not in the way that it's characterized almost every time I see this discussion online.  Of course we're talking about the harsh realities of some groups of young white and black people in different areas of the country, and nothing we celebrate about any culture. This is all a weird sidebar, I guess. But, like, there's just this zone where online SJ stuff and my reality don't mesh. Thug life isn't exclusive to a race, is one of them. I don't think a lot of people online are aware of how many really poor white people there are.

There are people who are persecuting the man, and then there are the white kids who are disrespecting his religion by wearing the turban when they are not Sikh. Furthermore in my example they are wearing it in such a way that is explicitly disrespectful (with logos and graphics and stuff). Since they are part of a culture that actively repress this man, their disrespecting of the religious significance of his turban adds to that.   Shouldn't we be working towards a society where anyone can wear a piece of clothing without being insulted/criticized for it?   Not necessarily...We would find it weird if you wore, say a doctor's lab coat or a veteran's uniform without being either of those things...Some things have cultural, religious, or practical significance bestowed to them by the person or people who created them.

I had short hair, a trim beard, and wore only western fashion, but that doesn't change the fact that I look vaguely middle eastern. There may have been others for whom it was their pagg which drew the notice of racists, but that wasn't really my experience.  So when I see a white person wearing a kurtha or chappals or turban, or any other number of Indian articles of fashion, just as a matter course in their daily life I embrace it. I'm happy because either my fashion or my identity is being accepted by my country, because what kind of idiot will incorporate into their wardrobe racial or ethnic signifiers of a group they hate?  Racists caricatures are still a thing, but that's just racism, not appropriation.  I think that we also might not be the best group for you to use as a highlight of this phenomenon, since I get a ton of professional respect afforded me that sometimes isn't even given to the white guy, and India is often seen as this exotic land of highly educated, very spiritual people who eat amazing food. Benign exoticism is way easier to deal with and normalize than the negative stereotyping that goes on towards, say, the Arabs."

Really can't agree. Okay, you shouldn't wear a police uniform, but that's a different issue, you aren't allowed to impersonate a police officer, so you'd need to make it obvious you are in fact not a police officer. But wearing a lab coat? Sure, knock yourself out. Wearing a uniform that doesn't represent active duty? Sure, knock yourself out.  You're going to step on toes, but doctors aren't entitled to lab coats and the cult around military paraphernalia is just disgusting. It's wrong for glorifying war, not for disrespecting veterans. In essence, yes, things have cultural significance. But they usually have a different significance for different people and you cannot respect all of those. You cannot respect a veteran and a pacifist at the same time, one wants the uniform to be respected, the other wants to burn the uniform. And both have good reasons for that, rooted in the cultural significance of uniforms.  Also, keep in mind that your argument has been used to justify the confederate flag during the past month. In that case, it's easy to decide who to side with, but what about the U.S. flag? More atrocities have been committed under that banner than under the confederate flag, it basically represents 300 years of genocide against the tribes of North America. Should I really have to respect that because someone identifies with it? Because genocide is part of your culture?   ""It's part of my culture, you have to respect that"" is literally the first reaction you get whenever you criticize historic revisionism, archaic practices and religious discrimination.  P.S: that's not supposed to deny cultural appropriation is a problem, of course it is. But tradition and culture aren't a shield against criticism grounded in reality. Not everything that is part of a culture deserves respect."

I use Western stuff all the time and I don't care whether Westerners approve of the way I use them, and that's OK. Don't tell me it's about power, because we occupied much of Iberia for some 800 years.  The world is too small and too connected for this concept of cultural appropriation.

Look at Italian food in the general US mind right now, you basically get a mixture of pasta, pizza, Olive Garden, and meatballs. Now any person from Italy would probably shit themselves laughing if you showed them any of that food, but to the average American that is what Italians eat (the fact that most of Italy never actually had access to tomatoes being a small oversight), and to Italian kids born in America guess what?

Think about a hobby, sport, activity, etc... that you love immensely, it's your passion and something that is very dear to you. Now you are going to have to translate everything I'm about to say into terms that work for what you are thinking of, because I'm gonna be vague.  Imagine this thing that you are thinking of caught on in the mainstream, and got huge and popular, but it took the form of something that was at best, vaguely similar to the thing you love. Like... you really love jazz, but like basic pop music was just being called jazz because it had 8 seconds of saxophone in it. Now everyone says they love ""jazz"", and ""jazz"" is super popular, but none of the things that make jazz the thing you love are there.  Now apply that you are getting actively hated in certain groups for liking the true jazz, but every day the bastardization of it is praised and consumed by millions, and the hatred is, if anything, more in the spotlight than it ever has been before, and you can't even talk about the thing you love because what everyone else loves is not that. Now you have a small idea of what appropriation does. It is the use of anything with no regard or care to it's origins, or anything that makes it what it is, to sell or present an image. And honestly people hate this type of thing all the time, people love things for real reasons, and deep reasons in a lot of cases, and when that catches on and gets bastardized everyone hates it, but it's hard for people to translate that to culture if it's never happened to them.

The structural change I am proposing if that we first need to show we care. And there's a duality to it. The side of the consumer and the side of the investor. If everyone wants low prices and high ROI's then you push companies to make exploitative decisions. That's a short summation of how we go here.    The exploitation gets unseen because no one sees the social cost of the insanely cheap goods we consume. Once we can show that we care it's easier for structural change to happen. You see this happening in China right now. More labor rights are being officially protected by the government, and the only labor party -- which was considered a farce and a government puppet -- finally criticized the government for not doing more.   On the other hand if you want tell H&M and Uniqlo to treat their workers better they're going to throw the data at you that the average consumer doesn't care and thats the problem.  There's plenty of structural changes to help this issue, I don't know the best ones because we haven't had any in place in the modern age. but I know we cannot even get to them without changing the mindset of the drivers of this behavior (consumer wants for low prices, and investors wants for high ROI.)  I've seen your video many times. The whole point is to make decisions where you aren't exploiting in the first place, thus you can actually give real charity.   The problem with this entire conversation is no one wants to reflect, that a closet full a cheap clothes = slave labor and that we help it get that way because we want it cheap. We need to accept that fact that we contribute and demand better.  This entire argument is rooted in Robert Reich's Supercaptialism, something I suggest reading.   And this doesn't get into the economics of the whole thing.

I am sorry if I implied it, but this is the sad fact of the world we live in. If you take China for example, one of the reasons it happens is because all parties involved want it to happen. Textile is not even the best example of it. Coal is.  You look at people illegally mining coal in China. The business starts because people want cheap Coal. They employee works who know the risks but they don't care because they need the money. The government turns a blind eye because of bribes and they want to develop. How do you fix that? Well we've got to fix intense poverty and thats an insanely hard thing to do and I'm still trying to think about that.  I'm not talking about boycotting. I'm talking about realizing that if as a consumer we want the lowest price and as a investor I want to make as much money as possible I contribute to slave labor.

Capitalism in this day and age is extremely good at giving us what we want.

If continue to want low low low prices and want all of our investments to return as much as possible then we push companies to exploit.   It's capitalism that causes that. Nothing else.   We can make choices now.   Which are dependent on how much money you have. It doesn't matter how  “ethical” you are; if you can't act on it, it's futile.

One thing for me is I am deeply invested in this, and I want to do things now that are more moral. They're not the perfect, practical at best. I could make my own clothes, but I don't it's to much struggle. So I choose the buy quality because you cannot force people to do a good job. It's why Starbucks cannot give you a great espresso on the regular but a local independently owned coffee place can. I don't mind paying more for that. Apple os the best socially among the electronic companies I've found I my reading. They're aren't without issues.  I choose this way because it makes sense logically and it's what people who work in compliance have suggested.  And yes I am insanely privileged to be able to do that. I recommend it on reddit because there are many privileged folks on here.  Systematic change is hard and this will probably not change in my lifetime and it's why I want to make more moral decisions now.  But the route I find to start changing that is to get people to realize that in our current form of capitalism we are contributing to slave labor by wanting low prices and high ROIs. This theory is rooting in Robert Reich specifically Supercapitalism if you want to give it a read.  Once we can reflect we build big enough base of support for people to enact policy and companies to hedge their risks.  And I think solving the bigger issue at hand, poverty is much more complex. It's bigger than both socialism and capitalism. That's why I think you're right to criticize about a ""wrong form of capitalism"" because of this.   I wanted to simply point out what's happening now and what I think a good portion of us can do now to be more moral and ethical."

So, I still have the belief that counteracting the ills of capitalism requires supplanting capitalism in revolution.  (And this completely ignores the fact that inputs of garden production will somehow be traced to the capitalist mode of production, so the attempt to ""farm ethically"" is a non-starter.

I think the abuse of children is one of the worst moral crimes, and that sexual exploitation/assault is another of the worst crimes, and, when put together, I would struggle to think of something more individually abhorrent.  While the exploitation of labourers is unjust (for it is to fail to give them their due in the creation of value) and I wholeheartedly push for a system which ends this sort of exploitation and economic dynamic, I would recoil against considering it alongside the sexual abuse and exploitation of children.   Now, to answer your question, I'd again re-iterate that neither forms of exploitation are ""okay"", but that one (the exploitation of labour) is fundamentally simply a form of economic injustice, whereas the other (sexual exploitation of children) is not only a form of economic injustice, but assault of the worst kind, amplified in its moral wickedness by being addressed towards the most vulnerable."

What makes child porn so exploitative relative to other kinds are the facts that children may not have the capacity to consent to that arrangement in general and that there is a hierarchy of age.

Working with the child porn analogy, an attempt to be an ethical consumer of child pornography is, of course, ridiculous. It doesn't matter how nice the pornographer is to his victim; it's an unethical process. Since we don't need child porn, the best solution is to condemn it and eliminate any incentive to create it. Similarly, an attempt to be an ethical consumer in a capitalist system is also fruitless, but as we need many/most of the things capitalists sell, we can't just abstain.

I mean, most people understand that there isn't really a justifiable ""scientific"" reason to be anti GMO. The food isn't irradiated or mutated or whatever. It's higher yield and more nutritionally dense. Those are qualities were been encouraging through selective breeding since the advent of agriculture. This is just a process to do it at a molecular level.   Any criticism based on it being ""unnatural"" is just junk science.   Much leftist criticism of GMO comes from the economic consequences of patented organisms that out perform competitors. e.g.) I am Monsanto, I patent this corn, it produces better than other corn, so now the corn supply is high and the cost of corn goes down. To compete, everyone needs to grow the higher yield corn.  But Monsanto owns the genetic code of the corn, so you need to buy your corn seeds from Monsanto. Monopoly, exploitation, bad feels.   The ""GMO is unnatural"" crowd are the ""vaccines cause autism"" crowd are the ""homeopathy cures cancer"" crowd, and their opposition is not political, so their political position (left vs. Right) is irrelevant to the question."

First you need to understand what a monopoly is and why they are bad. A company being the primary or almost only seller of a product does not make a monopoly. A monopoly is when they are the only possible vendor of a product, not just the best product.   A monopoly is bad because they can charge whatever they want for a product and people will have no competitor to buy it from. This is called ""monopoly power"". If Monsanto suddenly tripled the prices of their products they would immiediately lose a massive amount of sales as people would buy the old seeds that are now comparably cheaper. This shows that Monsanto has no monopoly power.   Another comparison would be Google. Google accounts for the vast majority of searches on the internet but they do not have any monopoly power. Of Google started to charge 1$ a search everyone would switch to Bing or Yahoo. Monsanto is simply the best at what they do, that doesn't mean they are a monopoly.   Also Monsanto does not own the genetic code of all corn, but of their specific variant. A competitor is welcome to create another GMO variant of corn that might be higher yield and cheaper. They simply cannot sell the identical product as Monsanto. The same way you can't sell an exact replica of the IPhone but you can create a smartphone that is inspired from it."

Correlation is not causation certainly, but meanwhile, more and more people are having IBS symptoms, non-celiac gluten intolerance, leaky bowel syndrome, etc. Another study I saw recently confirmed Bt being detectable in the fetus of pregnant women (caveat being, my attempt to find and link the study ran into paywall.)

They have sued for seed saving. As they should. When you buy Monsanto seeds you must sign a contract saying that you will not seed save. The seeds are a subscription, not a one time sale.

He pulled the seeds from the local grain elevator, which is usually used for feed crop, and planted them. The court decided Monsanto’s patent extends even to the offspring of its seeds, and the farmer had violated the company’s patent.   I don't see what the issue is. Bowman intentionally copied patented material. It's no different than buying a book or movie DVD secondhand and then making thousands of copies.

From GM mosquitoes to control malaria to salt and drought resistant crops.  They also offer hope for environmental problems, since agriculture consumes so much water and land and because GMOs can reduce reliance on pesticides and fertilizer.  I come from a poor African country with malaria and food shortages - I have a very low opinion of Western hippies who aim to restrict GMO R&D or adoption because naturalistic fallacy superstitions or pothead paranoia, and those who spread this kind of nonsense.  Though OP has asked to avoid discussing capitalism, there are many possible implementations of captialism.  A major limitation on the potential good GMOs can do for the world rides on intellectual property law and the ownership of genes / organisms.  This is powerfully and negatively affected by transnational companies pushing trade agreements which would enserf peasant farmers.    Issues of intellectual property also limit availability of potential medical advances to richer people in the developed world if companies are allowed to artificially increase prices through copyright or patent monopolies on GMOs.  Thinking transgenic pigs, yeasts which produce medicines, quinine bananas, etc.  It's hard to discuss the risks and benefits of GMOs without considering who will own them and how they will be used."
SRSDiscussion,3ctdi6,lordairivis,15,Mon Jul 13 02:08:14 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying that personally, I have no problem with GMOs and engineered food. As far as I am aware, one of the biggest arguments against GMOs is regarding the possible adverse health effects, despite the fact that there has not been a definitive causal link established between GMOs and health issues. However, I feel that consumers do have a right to know where their food came from and how it was produced, so for that reason and that reason alone I support the labeling of products containing GMOs. nope  I think the problem many people have with GMOs is not so much the fact that these plants are genetically modified at all as it is about how they are modified. The response to this argument is that humans have been selectively breeding livestock and crops for millennia, so what's the difference?  The difference to many people is that in one case the plants are selectively bred over many generations using the natural processes of cross breeding and splicing with each successive generation inheriting traits to make the plant increase yield or become more resistant to infestation or disease, whereas with GMOs the genome of the plant has been analyzed and purposefully modified by humans by replacing bits of the genome in order to make the plant yield more, or be more resistant to infestation or disease. To many people this seems ""unnatural"" (despite being functionally identical and faster). This sense of the food being ""unnatural"" helps to fuel a lot of the conspiracy theories and concerns among health-conscious-but-not-completely-informed people and additionally you have sites like naturalnews.com (notorious for their anti-vaccination, anti-pharmaceutical, and anti-fluoridation agenda) fanning the flames. They hear ""disease resistant"" and ""infestation resistant"" and think that somehow there are pesticides and/or hormones or other ""chemicals"" being added to their food and it reminds them of the actual real issues caused by insecticides like DDT.  It's symptomatic of the amount of distrust many people these days have for multinational corporations and the government, and this distrust occurs in equal amounts on the left and the right. It's chemtrails for liberals and it's hogwash."

That's fed into a lot of this ""natural living"" panic as well because of ""toxins"" and ""chemicals"" (""if you can't pronounce it then you shouldn't be eating it"") as well. Should uneducated consumers also not be allowed to know whether the meat they are buying is coming from a local free-range farm or from an industrialized factory farm because they don't know about agribusiness?  It doesn't really matter the consumer's level of knowledge on the topic because the consumer has the right to know where their food comes from.

SRSDiscussion,3csyah,AshrifSecateur,19,Fri Jul 10 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"To expand my views on this:  I think that when we shut down discussions on important, sensitive subjects such as CP just on the basis of moral repulsion, we don't help our cause. Sure, moral repulsion from CP is perfectly justifiable but it helps when you explain why exactly it is justifiable (and why getting involved with CP should be an offense) in a way the other person cannot object to on the basis of m'logics.  Also, I was reading the local news today and I thought it relates to CP in a way. In India, where I'm from, someone just filed a PIL in the Supreme Court calling for a ban on regular adult porn claiming that it leads to rape and other sexual crimes. Do I think porn should be banned? No. Would I change my mind if there was reasonable proof that porn does in fact encourage people to rape? Probably.  In the same vein I think of CP like this: Does making (or watching, which encourages the making) CP lead to child abuse? Undoubtedly yes. So CP should be banned. However, we can have animated CP which doesn't involve exploiting kids. So before I get repulsed by this because of the very idea of CP, I'd like to consider this: Would allowing animated CP lead to a decrease in child abuse or an increase in it? I think our opinions on the matter should be decided on the basis of answers to questions like this, rather than moral repulsion."

They've said as much in interviews, they urge people not to watch it for that exact reason. (It's disgusting that people do. Little kids film reaction videos of it.)  So my question, why is any of it legal? The argument of re-victimization doesn't just apply to survivors. It can apply to families of victims too."

Seeing a video where someone was killed does not make me feel pleasure. It also generally does not revictimize the victim. Beating off to a video where someone is sexually assaulted for someone else's pleasure is taking pleasure in their suffering.   The robbery example isn't comparable at all because robbery is not nearly so fundamental a violation of someone's bodily autonomy as sexual violence.

I just wanted to know what I could respond to someone who goes ""well watching videos of people being murdered is legal""  Is it because it's very legally obvious in that case? In the case of CP, once you find out that the victim is under 18 at the time of recording, it's always, absolutely, 100% CP?   Whereas in a case such as murder, while logically you could know 100% that the victim got murdered, it's not provable? (i.e, they could have died later, it was staged, etc.)"
SRSDiscussion,3csyah,PiscineCyclist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"I think the big difference is that CP should more be compared to a drug than to other types of videos/media.

There is definitely a market for snuff films and the like, but I would argue that it really isn't on the same level as CP. On top of this, many CP victims have come forward and said that they feel re-victimized by the fact that more people look at the media depicting them.

Although I do think that the way we handle those who have CP is wrong.

Classical music and fancy pastries are heavily associated with with Europeans and the wealthy. Dodge is selling a sports car that is in many aspects technically outclassed by European competitors.

Stereoptypically ""European"" behaviours are often characterised as feminine in American and British culture, such as drinking wine instead of beer. Same goes for class; the ""metrosexual"" meme is the derision of metropolitan men taking particular care of their appearance by framing as some sort of intersection between homosexuality and heterosexuality. The relationship between gay stereotypes and gender policing surely doesn't need to be explained.

The Dodge ad is a bit fuzzy (I'd say it's anti-intellectual and anti-'upper class' as much as it is gender policing) but there are plenty of other ads that show that keying in on masculine anxiety is perceived as being effective by lots of advertisers.

Check the wikipedia link /u/Shazz_19 posted, that goes into detail on explainatons why it's higher (counting statistics differently, broad definition etc). To further refute this has nothing to do with multiculturalism: In 2005 the definition of rape broadened, which is the main reason for the big increase of reports. If you look at the swedish national survey ""Nationella trygghetsundersökningen"" (I think it's very similar to the ""national crime victimization survey"" in the US) you'll also notice the estimated number of sex crimes has been about the same during 2005-2013, which would strongly indicate that it's the number of reports that has increased, not the number of victims/crimes. Surveys on sexual harassment/assault has also shown very similar numbers in the nordic countries where, for example, Denmark had slightly higher numbers.   Edit: Source on the last statement. Disclaimer: haven't looked at it further than the results."

There's a part about it in my first link, roughly translated into:  ""The number of reported rapes has increased since 2005. This increase can be partly explained by a new sexual offenses legislation entered into effect on 1 April 2005. This means that some acts previously classified as sexual exploitation are now classified as rape. The effect of change in legislation reflected in the statistics in that the number of reported crimes relating to sexual coercion and exploitation reduced in the coming years after the amendment, while the number of reported rapes increased. From 1 July 2013 the legislation on sexual crimes changed again; rape was expanded to include cases where the victim reacts with passivity.""  But that wouldn't necessarily explain the gradual increase of reports from say, 2007-2012. I unfortunately don't know how legislations and such work, I've read some reddit comments (great source :/) saying those changes take time, which could explain the gradual increase.  Original text that I translated:   Antalet anmälda våldtäktsbrott har ökat sedan 2005. Ökningen kan delvis förklaras av att en ny sexualbrottslagstiftning trädde i kraft den 1 april 2005. Den innebär bland annat att vissa gärningar som tidigare rubricerades som sexuellt utnyttjande nu rubriceras som våldtäkt. Effekten av lagändringen slår igenom i statistiken på så vis att antalet anmälda brott avseende sexuellt tvång och utnyttjande minskade de närmaste åren efter lagändringen, medan antalet anmälda våldtäkter ökade. Från den 1 juli 2013 skärptes sexualbrottslagstiftningen återigen; bland annat utvidgades våldtäkt till att omfatta de fall där offret reagerar med passivitet."

For example, the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey estimated that 1,929,000 people were raped in the US in 2011 (a statistic which doesn't include men who were forced to penetrate someone else).  The total US population that year was about 312 million.    That gives us an estimated ""rape per 100,000 population"" of 618 in the US in 2011, if we're not restricting our attention to reported rapes.    If anything, it's possible that Sweden's relatively high prevalence of reported rapes is a good thing, it could be a sign that rape survivors find it easier to report their experiences to the police in Sweden.

Narcissists love having authority over others which, given current social norms, is often easier/most expedient for male narcissists to accomplish through their career path or physical intimidation while, for women with NPD, the most direct route to long-term authority/narcissistic supply is often to get themselves into the caretaker role.  As a result, I'm not overly surprised that a sub specific to narcissistic caretakers would skew towards women - I don't think the gender disparity in criticism is a sexist thing, I just think the skew itself (if I'm not off-base here) is the result of how gender roles interact with NPD."

Just like how LGBT+ groups attempt to organize even though they face different issues and different levels of oppression. If we just constantly focused on who has it worse, Homosexuals, Bisexuals or Transgendered people than we wouldn't get anything productive done. And by uniting under the LGBT+ banner we can combine influence to really make a change.  The same is true of POC. If we constantly debate which race has it it the worst than it will be difficult to get any real change done. If POC unite under one banner then it will be far easier to get real change to happen.  I personally think it is debatable whether or not this is the right strategy as the problems that POC face are more cultural and there is less the government can currently do, unlike the LGBT movement which has been focusing on specific discriminatory laws.

I suppose it seems like there are cases where using the term ""POC"" does more harm than good. And can serve to generalize experiences that aren't necessarily the same.  People who are bi, pan, or polysexual, have a degree of privilege that homosexual people don't, that I feel like many of us should admit to, which we don't. Certainly, bisexuality(or the better word is pan or poly, since not everyone fits into the gender binary, and probably most people who people call bisexual, are attracted to more genders than just people in the gender binary) is oppressed, and it many ways, differently from what other queer people go through. But it seems to me like we have it easier fitting into heterosexual and heteronormative society. Many gay people wish they had the option to have attractions and relationships that weren't oppressed. Bi/Pansexual people have the option to date people of another gender and be accepted. While for lesbians and gay people, that's not a choice.  And yet, many Pansexuals have argued that we have it worse or at least just as bad as homosexual people do. I find this to be not fair and not true.  A lot of LGBT people are biphobic, but that's within the LGBT community. Being not accepted within the LGBT community is no fun, but it doesn't mean we're just as oppressed or more oppressed.  Just the same, a lot of people forget the T in LGBT. And I think that transgender people are probably the most oppressed right now in the Western world. Though that isn't true in all cultures, and in some places people are actually more accepting of transgender people than homosexuals. Definitely here in the United States, though, transgender people seem to get the worst treatment of anyone in the LGBT, both inside and outside of the LGBT community.  I wish we were all a big happy family like the acronym ""LGBT"" implies. Or ""LGBT community"". And bickering won't help. But I think we should all be sensitive to the plight that others go through and not assume we have it the worst or even just as bad as others.

This is especially helpful for the Transgender community because without the outrage from the LGB side the transgender community would be even more ignored than it is now (and they are already incredibly ignored).  The same is true about race. We need the Hispanic community to be outraged by racism towards to black community. Right now politicians are terrified about offending the Hispanic population, but not the black community (they know where the black community will vote and the Hispanic community has far more swing voters).  We need to make it so that an offense towards the black community is also seen as an offense towards the Hispanic and Asian communities, this way each community has more power and it is more costly to openly be against any of them."

Transphobia in the LGBT community is slapped down pretty hard, but it seems almost normal-ish to be biphobic.  Overall though, more oppressed than Trans people?  Definitely not.    More oppressed than gay/lesbians people?  Of course we fucking are. We're a minority amongst minorities.  We're already seen as ""those gay people"" by straights, so we get all the regular hate that gay/lesbians do, and we're hated by a good portion of both gays and lesbians who think we're going to cheat with everyone in sight.  When straight/lesbian people come out, many of them have their morality questioned by straight people.  When bisexual people come out, we have our moral compass questioned by straight people and our own allies--we're automatically suspicious fence-sitters who need to choose a side before we hurt somebody (apparently).  How exactly are gay/lesbians more oppressed than bisexuals?  I think the mistake you're making in thought is that we don't get shit from people as long as we act ""straight"" (that we somehow have straight privilege) and don't come out, but guess what, so do homosexuals who don't come out.

Because that means being seen as ""part straight"". I'm not sure how much that happens with lesbians, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was common, too.  And it's true that we're seen as gay or at least kind of gay. But I feel like less so than monosexual queer people, homosexual people. I feel like we're looked at by straight society as also kind of straight, especially when we're in straight relationships.  And one of the genders we're attracted to is totally accepted by society. And having the ability to be attracted to people of another gender and be accepted by society is something that many lesbian and gay people wish they could have. And I feel we do have a bit of straight privilege because we're seen as more straight by society, and can be fairly accepted when in straight relationships. I feel that we have a degree of straight privilege, even after we come out.  Biphobia and the assumptions about bisexuals from both gay and straight people, that we don't have sexual morals is hurtful.

SRSDiscussion,3cdxje,gianttribble,9,Wed Jul 8 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"While I broadly agree with you, I feel there are a couple of broad areas where Asians are disadvantaged versus blacks  1- Asians are see are more foreign than blacks. Most people know blacks have been here since practically the beginning and have their own contributions to American culture, such as jazz, hip hop, etc. But anything Asian is automatically seen as foreign. Asians' loyalty to the U.S. is always suspected. Even the New York Times publishes articles about how the Chinese government is blackmailing the families of Chinese Americans, implying that we need to be worried that they're going to spy on us. And obviously, after 9/11 every Middle Eastern or Indian looking person has had suspicion cast on them of being a 'terrorist' or fanatic whereever they go. This seems to be the case moreso with Asians than with blacks.   2- Secondly Asians are seen as passive, unaggressive and generally submissive compared to blacks. This is really bad for Asians because sometimes Hollywood will include anti-Asian racism with impunity in major films like the Hangover and not get worried about it. Generally, I think a lot of the supposed positive things that are thought of about Asians that you mention are really just an extension of whites not feeling threatened by them. Asian men are heavily emasculated in this society, and we know a big part of Dylann Roof's hang up was sexual fear of black men. But I would say it's less respect towards Asians than it is a patronizing attitude of condescension. Is that really a good thing? I would think not.   3- With every supposed positive stereotype, there is a negative backside. Asians are good at math- okay, then if you see an Asian, their job is to be the nerdy math guy/gal while white people make art, start business, engage in law and politics, and generally do the things that make you seen as a human being.   With regard to the term POC, I think its value is that it encourages us to see racism not as some sort of unidimensional point system or hierarchy where different types of people are on a ladder of oppression, but as a wholistic system that oppresses all POC of different ways. The point is we are not just people in different positions of privilege/oppression in the map of society, rather we are dealing with a unified system of racism that preserves itself by its own logic and locks up each POC group in its way. The same goes if you extend the analysis to gender/sexual orientation/identity, etc. If we see ourselves as just a bunch of different groups, then we'll never be able to fight the system. Because if it's ""Asians"" I'm fighting for, then it's just group chauvinism and why not use my ""model minority"" status to step over blacks? But if it's ""POC"" that I'm fighting for, I have a better understanding that the former path is a dead end for Asians because it only traps us in a different form of inferiority. It clarifies that the real enemy is the system of racism itself, and a black struggle is also my struggle."
SRSDiscussion,3cdxje,gianttribble,3,Tue Jul 7 23:02:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that Asian people have their share of problems. Some things in some areas are worse for Asian people, or at least different.  Though I would say that the overall oppression of black people is more extreme and dehumanizing. That doesn't mean that other oppressions that aren't as extreme don't need consideration.  I remember watching The Cat in the Hat movie several years ago. To be honest, I was not impressed by that movie and thought it did much worse as an adaptation than The Grinch. I can't say I'm a big fan of it or was very impressed by it.  And one of many thins about the movie that bothered me was the extremely racist caricature of a Chinese person. It seems like Hollywood and many other facets of society seem to treat Asian people as 'acceptable targets' for racism, that they would absolutely not consider with about black people.  People need to realize that this is not okay. And in general Hollywood is extremely racist against Asian people and leaves Asian people invisible and seems very disinterested in representing Asian people. Black people face a lot of struggles in American entertainment, but I would argue that what Asian people face is even worse. The desire that Hollywood seems to have to make Asian people invisible, and represent Asian people horribly when they do, is incredibly saddening.  Hollywood seems to view Asian people as too studious, uncool, and passive to represent them. Which is completely horrible. I don't think this is anywhere near as serious as what black people face. But is still frustrating and still needing to be addressed.   I feel like entertainment and coolness in general can be highly overvalued. Representation is certainly important. But I feel like entertainment isn't as important as many people give it credit for. I mean, you wouldn't argue that Japanese culture is represented by anime or that Korean culture is represented by Kpop. And most people who are knowledgeable about Asian cultures like that, would take an effort to downplay the importance of Japanese or Korean or Chinese entertainment in relation to their cultures.  I think the same is true of America. Certainly it's a part of our culture. But I think it can be overstated how much it is, or how important it is. And I feel like there are much more important pieces of oppression than the state of our entertainment.  Hollywood's fixation with hypermasculinity, treating black men as the epitome of masculine coolness, and mistreatment and underrepresentation of Asian people is certainly problematic. But I also think there are more important aspects of our culture where there is privilege and oppression than out entertainment.  What I mean by that is, representation matters and this is certainly a problem that should be addressed. But I wouldn't say that this is the most serious angle of which to gauge oppression in our society. Just like I wouldn't approach oppression in South Korea by examining Kpop. I'd be more interested in looking at things like education, bullying, grade school, colleges, employment, immigration policy and police treatment than something like Kpop or Kdramas.  Just the same, while Hollywood certainly has problems. I think a more serious measure of oppression and privilege here is the state of our college campuses, our jails and prisons, the disparity of the way police treat people, our public education, and our general workforce and treatment of workers.  This different form of inferiority seems far less extreme to me when it entails things like entertainment rather than the police and prisons, college campuses and education in general, and general employment and worker treatment.  Perhaps this is wrong of me. But it just seems hard for me to treat entertainment, like in our country, Hollywood, with the same seriousness as other aspects of our culture and society, in relation to oppression and privilege or other serious parts of our society and culture.

A POC immigrant who faces a microaggression of someone who asks them ""where are you REALLY from?"" is not the same as someone being killed for being transgender. Being underrepresented in Hollywood is not comparable to being physically abused by an officer of the law in terms of magnitude. In general, the oppression faced by dark skinned blacks in America weighs more heavily than for East Asians, and there are similar patterns around the world, such as in South Africa, of 'coloreds' being treated better than blacks. I think it's important to be aware of this and acknowledge it when it comes up.   At the same time, in social justice circles, there can be this counterproductive urge of one-upsmanship wherein whoever can prove that their pet issue/group has it the worst 'wins'. This can get divisive because no matter how carefully you talk about, it always feels a little dismissive to say that one type of oppression is ""worse"" than another. By definition a part of your argument relies on minimizing someone else's pain. And I don't think that's right. I mean, it's not as if there's some trade off that says, fewer black men would be beaten by the police if Asians would just accept more stereotyping and invisibility. Nor does it really help anyone to understand the nature of oppression to simply say that one is 'worse than' another or 'more serious' than another. Racism doesn't become any less wrong the moment some other racism somewhere else becomes even more extreme.   With regard to the Dylann Roof manifesto of East Asians being 'white allies' and other white supremacist literature trying to make Asians as allies/or saying Arabs are white, maybe we need something among Asians similar to the 'Not in My Name' article written by a white woman in response to the Charleston shootings. Just as white women have historically been used as a reason for/abetted white men's violence against blacks, so have Asians been used by white supremacists as a 'model minority' to claim that they aren't racist, which many Asians historically embraced and perpetuated themselves. This is something that has to be acknowledged, both historically and still going on, and repudiated. The result of this is a long history of distrust and lack of solidarity between the black and Asian communities."

SRSDiscussion,3cdxje,ModestMaoist,3,Fri Jul 10 04:09:10 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, that antiblackness is the fulcrum of white supremacy in the US and UK. But, there are different ways in which various groups are discriminated against and it does not always fall on a straight line.   A lot of oppression that Asians, Africans and to a lesser extent Hispanics face is not really race qua race, but comes from geopolitical issues in trade and warfare, for example ISIS, outsourcing, the Cuban Missile crisis, the Gulf War, the Vietnam War. A lot of oppression that African Americans and Native Americans face comes from domestic issues relating to class and the sequelae of colonialism.   Most neo-Nazis live in rural areas and have never met an Asian outside their Chinese food deliveryman, and they have an idealized view of Japan - only Japan, a country that has very little emigration to the West. Some of them used to fetishize India because the Nazis ripped off cultural elements (the swastika, the word Aryan), but with the panic about outsourcing, this has gone away.    The reason they read Mishima and fetishize Japan is because they erroneously believe that it is a homogeneous society with no minorities. Nazis' favorite authors, like Julius Evola, heavily orientalized places such as Japan, India, and even indigenous American nations - where they have never been - portraying people there alternately as elves/Vulcans and as orcs/Romulans. Japan was also an ally of Germany in World War II. Most importantly, it's no longer seen as a geopolitical threat by the West because the US bombed it out of the water.   Actually a lot of stereotypes of Asian countries outside of Japan parallel stereotypes of Africa and Latin America, especially stereotypes of China which is seen as the evil empire taking US jobs. Japan is OECD but people born in China, India and Pakistan have some of the harshest passport travel restrictions.   The main stereotype against African Americans, is that they form a ""sub group"" inherent to American society. For other POC the stereotype is that they form an ""outside sub group"" like a foreign element that is competing with locals for jobs, and is a geopolitical threat; a fifth column plotting spy and terrorist actions. The media discourse also ignores Native American people afaik.    You've also mentioned that Ralph Nader is of Lebanese descent. He is also white passing. A guy who looks more typically West Asian and may come from a Muslim background is going to get a lot more crap than Ralph Nader.   Nader also grew up during a time period when there was much less bias (like the terrorism stereotype) against West Asians than there is today. The sharp turn against Arab-Americans and people perceived to be Muslim is eerily parallel to the sharp turn against Japanese Americans during WWII."

SRSDiscussion,3cdxje,farfarawayS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:27:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry for so much focus on white supremacists and their ideas of who is more or less white. I was partly inspired to make this topic because of Dylann Roof and reading his manifesto. And seeing yet again that he was another white supremacist who respected Asian people, and treated Asian people as superior to black people.  There's a lot more examples about things like education and police discrimination that I wanted to go into about privilege and how, for instance, police tend to assume the worst of black people but not of Asian people. And how in multiple parts of life, studies show how light skinned black people are treated better than dark skinned black people. Or how black, curly hair is treated in a much meaner and more dehumanizing way that straight hair that is common among many Asian people. And many other examples like that.  But I was a bit afraid of making the topic too big and giving people too much to read.  People like Dylann Roof are extreme and not a perfect example of privilege and racism in general. Though I do think they are far more examples than many white people, white culture, and white society would like to admit. It's another white privilege, that, if a murderer like Dylann Roof were black, people would call him a thug and want to start a conversation about black culture having problems. But since Dylann Roof is white, people were quick to blame mental illness. As to keep challenging problems in white culture and white society taboo, and not let white society and culture take responsibility for leading to horrors like what Dylann Roof did.   And the case of Dylann Roof seems to me, just like an extreme example of just how white supremacist American society is. People like to say that people like Dylann are extreme, and they are, but they're also just a more extreme version of what's already there, a deep problem in our society. That people are uncomfortable with admitting. Dylann's opinions are held by many, many people, if to a more mild degree, people who aren't murderers, but still do harm.  Some other examples where I feel that Asian people are more privileged now, or have been more historically privileged than black people are:   Being treated as having a civilized culture rather than an un-civilized culture The disparity in education in black people and Asian people. Many are quick to blame scores and achievements and things like that on differences in black culture and Asian culture. But it seems irresponsible to me to just say ""Asian culture is good and makes good students, and black culture has problems and leads to poor achievements"". There's a lot of privilege here that Asian people have in our education system. And there is a divide in how black students are treated and how Asian students are treated. In apartheid South Africa, Japanese people and Chinese people were not seen as people of color, but ""honorary whites"". Asian people have historically been treated much better in South Africa and other white supremacist countries than black people. This doesn't seem to be unusual within white supremacists states at all. While being a ""model minority"" is still a minority, and not privileged. And many are right in frustration with this treatment. It's still better than the way black people are treated. Being stereotyped as being good at math is bad, but I think I would take that, any day, over being treated as a bad learner, dangerous and violent. One is a frustrating stereotype that might not be true at all, one is going to lead to being mistreated by the police. While mildly straight, mildly curly hair might be idealized in American culture. Standards of beauty in America definitely err on the side of straight. What black people have to deal with in terms of hair and other parts of standards of beauty is much more extreme than what Asian people have to go through. Straight hair is pretty normalized in America. In almost every instance where interracial relationships were criminalized, Asian and white relationships were exempt from this rule. Meaning that the interracial relationships they wanted to discourage were between black and white people, not between white and Asian people. The ""one drop rule"" has never applied to Asian people as far as I am aware. Most people see people who are part black as black. While most people see people who are part European and part Asian as mixed, and often are mistaken as white. White society seems to be much more normalizing of Asian heritage than black heritage.   In general, Asian people seem to get the opposite stereotypes than black people do. While white people are in the middle. I've seen some people talk about this in a context of oppression as white people seeing themselves as ""the grand middle"". In between all these stereotypes and not being seen at either extreme. And they're certainly both stereotypes and do harm. The extreme stereotypes about black people seem a lot more harmful and dehumanizing. Positive stereotypes are unhealthy and not fun for those enduring them. But it's much more threatening and dehumanizing, I think, to be seen and treated as a macho, violent criminal who isn't good at learning or studying. Negative stereotypes create much more harmful oppression than positive stereotypes.  And there are so many facets of society I feel this is a part of."

I think it touches on the notion that privileged women are special targets of resentment because they are these special objects of both value and pampering that have everything handed to them. I think Rihanna in this video is casting herself and her friends as people who, like the accountant, must actually work for his/her spoils and the real competition is between the two of them. But I concede that's only a small part of what's going on. Race, gender and class all play a role here."
SRSDiscussion,3cd9f5,papermoon1,18,Tue Jul 7 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"I think that it is a shitty song that glorifies violence in a fantasy world. This is not that outrageous as many songs glorify violence. I'd consider it similar to pumped up kicks, except the music video makes the glorification of violence more explicit.  Let's say we reversed genders entirely. Make it a male kidnapper and a male victim. I think the song would be equally bad and equally glorifying of violence. I don't think the fact that Rihanna being a woman makes the message any better as she still kidnaps and tortures someone. And her being a minority is also irrelevant, her fellow criminals were white and I don't see how race played much of a role in the message.  I think that the accountant being a bad guy is entirely irrelevant to the conversation as she still kidnaps and tortures his innocent wife.   When artists make songs that are based around their reality that may have been violent then that is entirely different than making a song that is essentially ""hey, wouldn't it be cool to kidnap and torture people!?!""."
SRSDiscussion,3cd9f5,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,19,Tue Jul 7 01:25:14 2015 UTC,The song and video is somewhat based in reality in that it's a revenge fantasy about her former accountant who left her nearly bankrupt. (She sued him later and won for $1 million more than he lost her.)

She chose to make something that is violent and mean because maybe that is how she was feeling when she wrote it. We are, of course, completely allowed to disengage with that song, or even stop listening to that artist if we disagree. This is related to my first quote about artists and catering.  2) It's likely Rihanna specifically chose to use the sort of iconography and imagery that would be eye-rollingly regressive if she were a man. This is a suggestive and transgressive choice, one that we should be applauding, not circling the firing squad around her for not being a perfect feminist at all times (and indeed, since White Feminism has failed black women for so long, it's likely that she rejects the support ""feminism"" has to offer her, as the BlackGirlDangerous article linked here suggests)."

He wants respect as an individual, which is admiral. However, when someone hates an entire minority of people, they don't see you as an individual.  What he is really trying to say is that people are too sensitive and set themselves up for being offended. Fine, that's his opinion. However, as others have pointed out, that's a bold opinion coming from someone who is cis male and white who otherwise tends to blend in. He's also living in a major urban area where the acceptance of sexuality is higher. I don't wish anything bad upon your friend, but I doubt he's experienced any real discrimination if he holds this opinion. Ask him how he feels now that couples of the same gender can marry in the United States. Gay and lesbian people did not earn the right to marry in the by being quiet, trying to appease the bigot, and not trying to ""bring discrimination upon themselves""."

I think there are, broadly speaking, two kinds of bigotry. ""Soft"" bigots are bigoted because of ignorance and absorbing bigoted cultural messages; ""hard"" bigots actively seek out ""evidence"" and create/advance bigoted cultural messages.  People like the man in the picture have probably gone through life making friends and then later revealing they are gay. Most soft homophobes are okay with this. Either the gay person is ""one of the good ones"" because it's their friend, or the soft homophobe stops being homophobic partially/completely upon actually meeting gay people. Even some hard homophobes wouldn't openly discriminate (as evidenced by the existence of people like Christon Scriven, a black friend of the Charleston shooter) as per the first reason.   The thing about broader activism is that it needs to prove even faceless, unknown gay people deserve rights. Because activists lack the ""friend status"" with the people they're engaging with, they're going to experience more discrimination. Is this technically ""bringing discrimination upon yourself""? Maybe. But it's absolutely necessary because no amount of ""hey, I'm your friendly gay neighbor!"" is going to stop the vast majority of hard bigots. The real threat of hard bigots is that they work to normalize bigoted ideas and make soft bigots worse, and hard bigots work on the class level. The gay man in question has benefited from activism on his behalf because without it, his friends would have absorbed entirely negative messages about gay people. Instead of being ""okay with it"", they might fear he, like all other gay people, would give them AIDS or prey on their children. Activism for gay people as a class kept soft bigots from accepting the most harmful stereotypes about this particular man, making it possible for his friends to feel safe around him."

I'd argue that the majority of the blame is on Germany as they can now see the direct consequences of their actions yet continue to refuse to bail out Greece.  The situation in Greece is like if America did not give any money to Louisiana. Some areas are just poorer and the larger government must constantly give them money.

Bad policy that is ridiculed by economists has very little to do with capitalism.    Rich countries and banks telling the Greek government they need to fuck over their workers and implement austerity policies that objectively won't work, to prop up their bourgeoisie notions of order and prosperity (for the already-prosperous), is absolutely capitalist extortion.

That may not be an end to capitalism, but it would be without a doubt a step in the right direction - it'll show to the masses of Europe that they can resist, and more importantly, it's through mass struggle that they can win.   The other question is what will it mean for the Greek working class movement? After years of struggle and countless general strikes the movement in the streets seemed to have died down in 2014.   However, with the pictures from Syntagma last night show that the movement is alive as ever - indeed, it was the biggest rally since the fall of the dictatorship.

Consequently people who are socially conscious resist Y on its face, even when people may be arguing in good faith, and often respond with a thought-terminating cliche. This makes sense as a survival mechanism (if time is given to Y the proverbial levee might break and, amidst the flood of people talking about Y it might be impossible to talk about X), but can be counterproductive as the solutions and viewpoint associated with Y might still be valuable or constitute something beneficial as long as they don't become the sole focus of the discussion or implications associated with Y don't taint discussion of the broader issue X.

SRSDiscussion,3c0xd6,TheLunaticFringe,7,Sat Jul 4 04:34:46 2015 UTC,"The thing that seems encouraging to me about this particular program is that it emphasizes not just physical self-defense skills, but emotional/social/cognitive skills to speak up and get out of a situation that starts to turn creepy or coercive, and to break out of the ""freeze"" response to dangerous situations.   I don't like advice that seems more concerned with restricting the ways a person can live their life than actually preventing rape. And I'm not super fond of advice that's predicated on being able-bodied and reasonably fit. But I am very pragmatic when it comes to advice that works. And having been the sort of young woman prone to freezing and playing along in emotionally charged situations, I think learning the skills to not do that is super important -- even if it doesn't prevent a rape, I think it can prevent or ameliorate a bunch of other bad-news situations."
SRSDiscussion,3c0xd6,MeAndLazarus,12,Sat Jul 4 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"Paper here for those with journal access : nejm  I gave it a brief read. Some thoughts in no particular order:   The control condition seems really anemic and boring compared to EAAASAR. Women in the control group are offered brochures to read, then offered a brief Q&A session. EAAASAR sessions involve games, practice, and other involving stuff - maybe any engaging prevention class would work. Similarly, the study is not double blind (probably could not be?) so I would expect that the research assistants might be more enthusiastic in what they know to be the actual treatment sessions. Also I did not see how long the control sessions were - surely they must compare x hrs of EAAASAR to x hrs of control? Effect looks big. Good. Adjusted tests to account for instructor within groups. Good. Used preexisting tool to measure assault frequencies. Good. Did not see multiple comparisons adjustment (they tested for multiple categories of sexual assault). Search of document did not turn such up. Bad. They say that they coded all incidents of sexual assault, but then produce figures only for the number of women suffering each kind at least once (I think? They used a survival test) in the year. Since one woman can be assaulted multiple times, this seems potentially very misleading.   So ... this study is promising but maybe flawed and that more and better studies would be nice (i.e. standard science).   I think that reducing the incidence of rape, which is the dehumanizing theft of another's body, is more important than protecting against hypothetical victim-blaming or onus-putting, which are also bad but less so. Who knows though, maybe implementing this method on a large scale would increase victim blaming and thereby increase the incidence of rape by way of promoting rape culture? Seems wildly speculative.  EDIT: Thank you for posting this. It was interesting. EDIT2: Fixed typos."

Can’t we, in other words, do both? Teach men not to rape, and teach women to fight back against rape   Loved this part to start off to discussion. She's a brilliant writer. While it was obvious she was hot about people attacking the saints she works with (and with good reason), she made some fantastic points about the different points people made against ESD. If you're interested in the discussion, this is a fantastic read."
SRSDiscussion,3c0xd6,papermoon1,2,Mon Jul 6 03:19:37 2015 UTC,"So, a couple thoughts.  First, I want to say that this gets at what interests me most about the situation. It's easy, in practice, to justify the use of these tactics as a stopgap because it seems to works, and reducing instances of rape is good. I'm more interested in how this strategy fits into a theoretical framework--or, in other words, how it fits into my feminism as anything other than a necessary evil.  I do, however, find this statement a little disingenuous:   These rumors and myths about women’s empowerment—the same ones being promulgated by self-proclaimed feminists on Twitter—provide a convenient excuse to re-direct funding. “We must teach boys not to rape,” after all. Where will we find the money to do that? Why, we’ll take it away from programs that serve girls. Programs like this one.   Anecdotally, I have worked with enough unscrupulous university administrators whose goal is, one and only, to reduce the rate of rape in their institutions. And if this study pans out--if the strategy is as effective as suggested--I could absolutely see them dropping other efforts in favor of this one--other efforts aimed more directly at the root causes of sexual violence.   Most circumstances are falsely portrayed as zero sum games, but funding for sexual violence prevention is closer to zero sum than conventional wisdom might indicate. I work for a small community-based agency serving six counties. We share a home city with the flagship campus of the state university system. They are, compared to us, the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and if they even cursorily gave a shit about the community around them, they would dominate the hell out of all our funding streams. The university's nearsightedness is basically the only reason my program still exists.  But unlike the university, I am part of an agency that doesn't have to market itself to potential students. The university's goal is to prevent rape, because it looks bad to potential students. My goal is to end sexual violence, because that's my agency's mission. And on a purely practical level, my agency can, without a doubt, be priced out of that mission by a system as efficiency-focused and results-driven as a university. So what I'm getting at is this: what's gonna happen isn't defunding ESD to fund primary prevention. They're more likely to defund primary prevention for the sake of ESD, and in doing so limit their scope of prevention efforts dramatically.  That went on longer than I intended, but as far as a theoretical framework goes, I am interested in the role of risk reduction as a strategy mobilized by those who typically lack the social capital to create the kind of large-scale sweeping changes needed to resist and destroy rape culture. For example, your average person lacks the time/energy/resources to dramatically change the culture of a police department, but we would never fault parents of color for discussing with their kids how to manage interactions with cops, even though that is itself a risk reduction/""victim-blaming"" strategy, in that it puts the onus of self-preservation on the oppressed.  Anyway, maybe more later, but I'm tired."
SRSDiscussion,3c0xd6,gepeg-libre,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"It's times like that I wish these issues could be quantified more easily. I think what organizations like universities need to realize is that ESD is a mitigation program as you said, and even though it has been shown to reduce sexual assault/violence in the area, there is no guarantee that this sort of behavior will stop altogether.  I am curious, though, as to the success of rape prevention programs out there. Is prevention limited primarily to a change in society, or do things like SHARP classes actually help? I know that for us we have sexual assault/harassment classes twice a year every year mandatory no matter what the rank is. I assume that this is especially drilled into the minds of new Airmen coming in, as often times education on sexual assault/harassment is not well funded in places where these guys and gals hail from. However, it's not all too uncommon for a case to be between a male officer and an enlisted woman, as the rank and power does a lot to a man's head... I'm rambling now, but back to my original question. How does one help to change society and rape culture? I especially ask this as a person that does not have the effort to be an activist on any cause like a lot of people."

In places where a woman that doesn't wear a hijab or other covering is at risk of harm or death, it's obviously not a free choice to do wear one, when they are being oppressed by a threat of violence for choosing otherwise. But in the United States, England, etc. there's a widespread, predominant view that Islam is a religion that oppresses the women that follow it, so there's a societal pressure to shun its practices, including wearing a hijab.

SRSDiscussion,3bvqie,rmc,5,Mon Jul 6 08:11:10 2015 UTC,"In places like the US they used ""race"" only. In the EU and UK, ""racism"" is defined as being based on ""colour, race or ethnic or national origins "", and has been that way since the 1960s. Ethnicity can be defined based on a person's religion. So yes, it can be racist to go after Muslims."
SRSDiscussion,3bvqie,rmc,3,Mon Jul 6 09:30:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't say ""every time you hate on a religion you're being racist"", I said ""it can be racist to go after Muslims"".   The context for many places must be considered. In some places, ethnicity and nationality is tied up with religion. To be Irish, meant to be Catholic. If you were non-Catholic Irish citizen in Ireland, you could be treated as ""not fully Irish"" and maybe ""a bit English"". An ethnicity label (like ""Catholic"" or ""Muslim"") can be often just as much about someone's heritiage and 'race' as what they believe. There's the joke about an atheist in Northern Ireland who's apprended by some thugs who ask if he's Catholic or Protestant atheist.  A simple test, is to see if you hold all religions to the same standard, or if you hold Muslims/Islam to a higher standard. Sometimes people will say ""I'm not being racist, I just think Islam is dangerous because it's anti-LGBT rights"", and that person will align themselves with anti-Islam political parties/groups. But Christians, and Christian organisations, are by far a much larger threat to LGBT laws and acceptance in many places in Europe/the West, but these groups don't target them at all. This person and groups are often afraid of The Other, of the foreign threat, of those darkies.  ""Muslim"" (or ""Catholic"") as a word, can mean many things. It can mean the religion, or it can mean the ethnicity. Hence it can be racist to go after Muslims, the people, the ethnicity (as opposed to going after the religion).

However, there are so many women who choose to wear the hijab (like the one in the video you linked) who are clearly intelligent and independent and it would be very paternalistic for me to say that they are all brainwashed.  I think it's possible to disagree with someone and still respect their choice (on certain issues, at least)  EDIT: Also, I think it's important to note that the Muslim religion does not actually require head-scarves. The Koran requires 'modesty', but different people interpret that differently. I know many Bangladeshi Muslim women who are religious but don't wear it."
SRSDiscussion,3bvqie,Khaligula,9,Mon Jul 6 13:42:02 2015 UTC,"Not really. 'Choice feminism', which I broadly agree with as a concept but can be dubious if overextended, implies a sort of inversion or denying of feminist principles or ideas purely on their own terms, if that makes any sense. An example might be when objectification is defended because a woman has the right to choose to be objectified. It's a way of nulling feminist critique. However, when it comes to Islamic head coverings, things are much more complex; there are issues of culture, race, family and a lot more going on, and these intersect with gendered issues. 'Choice feminism' is something I associate with liberal feminism, and wanting to rescue Muslim ladies from their head-scarves is pure liberal feminism."

When they see their white buddy wearing some ethnic garb they can immediately understand the motivation behind it.  He's wearing it to ""represent"" some culture, or because it looks cool. It's more or less just a fashion thing and it's a relatively shallow motivation and fairly easy to digest.  When you (or whoever) wears their own ethnic/traditional cultural garb the motivation becomes far more complex and much harder to digest.  You're not wearing this because it looks cool, you're wearing it because you have deep ties to an ancient cultural tradition very different from their own, and to some it makes them think about the wide gulf between said cultures.   And they may have little to no understanding of that culture and then attach negative connotations to it, which is not something you can easily do to somethig superficial like a simple fashion choice.

SRSDiscussion,3bqno4,Hellkyte,28,Wed Jul 1 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry this happens to you. I experience it regularly and it's both painful and infuriating. I continue to practise what I have left of my culture (there's been an incredible destruction by settler regime of knowledge, language, and culture) but it's considered primitive. It's also very difficult for me because I don't have many traditions readily available to me due to the dying out of the older people who knew and practised these things. So to learn something and be able to do it properly is very meaningful.  It kind of hurts because I grieve constantly about the loss of these things and worry about not profaning a lot of the more sacred stuff accidentally, but the majority of outsiders don't go through that kind of dilemma at all. There's a heavily voyeuristic element for them and it's something they can pass through at will without thought or regard to respect for it and feel cultured (or worse, get laughs) while continuing to mock us when we do it.  The more important thing to me is continuing it and ensuring it gets passed on, but these people actively make that harder by perpetuating illegitimate myths.  It also really sucks because here a common trend is for people to do art 'inspired' by the art style of my people for commercial purposes (selling to tourists), while many (very poor) indigenous artists struggle to access these markets. And the problem with that is that a lot of motifs and elements and stories are precious to particular peoples, but these people don't even know the history behind that stuff, they just think it's all meaningless patterns. And it's really a lot more complicated than that and that's another way knowledge is lost.  Another thing that is not really just appropriation but disrespect is profaning sacred mountains. Actually there is one you really shouldn't climb but it's not illegal to do it, it's just the law of the local people, but tourists take shards of it, walk all over it, etc. because it's a really impressive mountain. It hurt when my school took us there and organised a climb for the grade. I refused to participate, one of about three in over a hundred.  People can't really understand why them doing that is harming anyone but it's both destructive to something sacred and disregarding well-advertised traditions on traditional land, which would be upheld strictly if it weren't for the invasion of settlers, and which really hurts to watch. A lot of people know and don't really care because they don't see why they should respect a culture or religion if they're not part of it. But it's also causing physical damage to the mountain which is visible over time. I can't even imagine quite how much it pains actually because I am not part of those people or privy to all their knowledge so I cannot appreciate the full significance of this mountain to them, but I think it's something that hurts many of our people because it represents a wider disregard for us. And some of the things people do to the mountains actively harm the people there on a spiritual level because through the publication of certain media they cause the people to violate their taboos inadvertently.  Sorry for the long comment but it's a topic I feel really strongly about and the concept of cultural appropriation is really contentious in this subreddit so I wanted to try to explain my perspective from the start.

The bar tends to be frequented by LGBT customers, but that doesn't make it an LGBT space. I mean, the bar wasn't advertising itself as such, right? It's just another bar. That's the difference, IMO - plenty of bars hang rainbow flags outside and bill themselves as a queer space. Other bars... don't. Even if they're frequented by members of the LGBT community, they're not gay bars.  Even if it is historically queer, I really can't fault you from being there. It's not a queer space, just a space with lots of queers."

In fact I've lived there since before it was Virgil's so hopefully I can provide some specific context here. I wouldn't say it's a ""historically gay bar"". It's not ""historically"" any kind of bar, since it's only been there for about 1-2 years. It's not explicitly a gay bar to my knowledge. Just like El Rio next door, there is definitely a queer crowd that goes there, but not exclusively.  Virgil's is in Bernal Heights, a historically lesbian neighborhood (although, much of the Lesbian population has left, partially due to astronomical housing costs). And the city recently lost it's only explicitly lesbian bar, the Lexington Club in the Mission. So I'm sure you can understand why people might be a bit sensitive about loosing queer spaces.  That being said, as a gay guy myself, I don't think you've done anything wrong. It's a low-key neighborhood bar that's not even explicitly gay, and you were just there on your own being friendly. It would be different if you rolled up to an actual gay bar with a pack of straight friends, or if you were to go to a place like Virgil's when they were having a specifically gay or lesbian event."

That's rude, and inappropriate without the proper context. Secondly, who is she to essentially make this decision for the entire bar? If this was supposed to be a totally gay space, that would be made apparent, and you'd be wrong for violating that. But it seems as though that's not the case, so if that's what she's looking for she can go somewhere else instead of trying to mold the bar to meet her own personal needs."

It can be frustrating going to a gay bar and seeing spaces dominated by people that are exclusively flirting with heterosex partners. I went out last weekend to celebrate pride and the only people that were dancing on elevated spaces (literally) were only people dancing with the people of a different presented gender. I'm bi, so I get that we need to respect different-sex paired relationships as not necessarily being between two heterosexual people, but everyone up there was avoiding people of their same gender like the plague, and I think there's something to be said about only straight people feeling comfortable enough to be audacious in queer spaces. Also if you're trying to find someone to flirt/hook up with it can be pretty frustrating having to try to sort through who's going to be into you."

Bars aren't exclusively for sexual encounters.   Queer spaces are for queer people regardless of intent. This is something that bugs me, and I've pretty much given up on bars (hetero, queer or otherwise). A public space is mine to do what I want with, and no one has a right to make me feel unwelcome if I'm not sifting for a fuck. Nonetheless, I have definitely been given the evil eye for turning people down or explaining that I am not cruising at a bar. Why can't I just be out to dance?   And from a practical standpoint, policing these spaces is absurd. Despite my identity, I still don facial hair. If I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt, with facial hair, is it on me for not appearing androgynous enough? Should my identity be discarded because I don't conform enough to someone's preconceptions of it; their coded aesthetic rules? When you're dealing with a room full of people, each one of them will have their own set of visual expectations, too. Ultimately it is no one's right to dictate whether your appearance conforms to your identity, or what your identity is. Otherwise you are accepting a TERF-like concept of ""infiltrators"" and ""pretenders"" who are diluting ""true queerness"".  This really turns me off from some queer spaces, and I have been turned away for not appearing  queer enough. Which is obnoxious, as I am regularly made unwelcome by non-GSM people, presumably for not being cis/hetero enough to make them comfortable with my presence."

It's been around 5 years since I've seen him, and the idea was his, so I don't see that there is a problem with it. He said he was excited to introduce me to a lot of people, and damn it if that's where he meets them then I see no problem going.

I know that's not a direct answer but maybe it would help if you're in this situation again.  In a broader context of straight people in gay bars, I totally understand her sentiment but I think it's so dependent on context.

But if you go in, be respectful, don't become a drunk asshole who thinks what he has to say is so important the whole bar has to hear it, tip your bartenders well, and don't get offended if a gay man hits on you - then I think you're fine.

SRSDiscussion,3bpw52,Designthing,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"My personal view as a gay man: it's fine to go to LGBT spaces but it's not fine to overwhelm them or dominate them. Drunk straight people making a big spectacle of themselves in gay spaces is annying.  Like, if you go to a bar just to have a drink, chat and quiet snog with your (same-sex) partner and a whole hen (US: bachelorette) party turns up with giant inflatable penises attached to themselves and talking about how ""I love my gays"" (etc.) as if we are nothing but fashion accessories, that's fucking annoying.  Especially back when marriage wasn't legal for same-sex couples: like none of them thought ""hey, going into a bar full of people who can't get married to celebrate my marriage might be rubbing it in somewhat"".  For me, the reason LGBT spaces are needed is two-fold: firstly, because they are safe. Lots of people throw shade at ""safe spaces"" now, but given the boring normality of homophobic abuse, having a place you can go where you can relax and know that homophobia won't be tolerated is great.  Secondly, because in wider society, our lives are considered support acts, amusing and cute diversions from the real meaty drama of heterosexual life. Even well-meaning straight friends still seem to subconsciously think that gay love isn't quite real in the same way as straight love is—they don't say it, but you can pick it up in the different attitudes they have to gay and straight relationships. In queer spaces, the events and dramas of our lives can have a stage to play out.  I don't have a problem with straight people in queer spaces, so long as the queer spaces can continue functioning as queer spaces. So long as we can continue having a place to be ourselves and live our lives without fear or (self-)censorship."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,chromablitz,24,Tue Jun 30 06:21:07 2015 UTC,"Amy Schumer is right about comedy.  Part of the frisson of her act is the ambiguity about how much of her self-loathing, self-destructive personality on stage could possibly be true.  I think some people assume she's letting herself off the hook for all the behavior she owns and acts out onstage, but that's clearly a mistake, and she doesn't make it an easy one.  A lot of times a bit of hers will start at one place where everyone is thinking ""Ha ha, yes, we're all like that and we're talking about it so it's okay"" and by the end of it they're thinking ""no, this is too far, it's not okay.""  Then you look back and you can't tell where she intended to cross the line — she doesn't do you the favor of drawing the line for you.  She catches us looking to her, the star, the one on stage, to draw the line between socially acceptable and unacceptable, and she flat-out won't do that for us, because that would let us off the hook.  Of course no matter how far she goes, some people are going to take her comedy as an endorsement of every behavior she describes or acts out, but she goes far enough that it isn't a reasonable interpretation.  Way past that, in fact.  She couldn't possibly make it more clear that she is vacating the field of critical judgment, so to speak, and challenging the audience to fill the vacuum.  To be clear, I don't like artists who accommodate sexism (and racism, etc.) by condemning sexism out of one side of their mouth and reassuring people that their sexism is understandable and acceptable out of the other side of their mouth, trying to have it both ways.  I don't think Amy Schumer does that.  I think it's especially clear when she's talking about sexual behavior:  you can see that there are two sides of it, that she delivers compassion (which is a huge part of her appeal) but makes it clear that self-compassion has to coexist with an awareness of destructive behavior; otherwise the result is more sad and disturbing than hilarious.  Lena Dunham is a different story in my opinion because a lot of what comes out of her mouth manages to piss me off or disappoint me in some way.  However, she's a mixed bag, because the success of Girls  carved out a larger, freer space for discussion about sex.  She obliterated the mainstream unspeakability of some aspects of sex and women's sexuality.  What she herself has to say about those things (and other things) has not always been such a good thing, but the space she created has allowed other, better voices to enter the mainstream.  That her privilege was crucial for accomplishing that is a common irony in social progress.  On the bright side, virtually the the only time I hear about Lena Dunham these days is when people are lamenting something horrible she said."

I never cared much for Girls, but I do understand and appreciate the cultural impact it's had on women in the media (although not all of it has been positive). But Dunham's personality is abrasive, excessively self-centered, and when confronted with the reality of how traditionally racist her strain of feminism has been, she tries to get out of it easily by placing that responsibility upon other people.   To be clear, I don't like artists who accommodate sexism (and racism, etc.) by condemning sexism out of one side of their mouth and reassuring people that their sexism is understandable and acceptable out of the other side of their mouth, trying to have it both ways.

I do agree. I take back my earlier comments about Schumer to some extent; in the replies to her tweet someone had mentioned that Schumer's new film had offended her, and Schumer was very sensitive and understanding about the whole deal and patiently asked this person what she found egregious and wrong, and promised to address these issues more tactfully in the future. I thought it was very sensible and didn't stray into the ""i'm white and people think i'm funny"" territory that we see when white comedians get blasted for their jokes about PoC and have to defend themselves *cough*Seth MacFarlane*cough*. But I wish her initial tweet had been just as sensitive to begin with. The fact that it wasn't sort of illustrates how her mindset doesn't really take into account PoC and minorities until someone directly tells her ""hey, this offended me because of x and y reasons, maybe you might consider resolving them by doing z."" I feel like someone with her breadth of talent could really help spread a more inclusive message, quoting and using minority voices to illustrate systemic racial divides instead of speaking on behalf of these minorities without consulting them directly.  And just a disclaimer: I absolutely love Amy Schumer. Her stand-up shows are always absolute riots, and she's done a substantial amount to help break down societal taboos and to promote women's sexual and personal freedoms. It's just the exclusive factors at play in the specific brand of feminism (also the brand that Dunham is part of) that she embodies that make me disappointed. White allies can be very helpful in spreading the message from PoC to the mainstream, but to do that we need to be able to have conversations where the discourse isn't dominated by exclusively white perspectives, or minority perspectives appropriated by white people in incorrect ways."

She is legitimately diagnosed with OCD and is a chronic masturbator to the point of seeking treatment and being unable to even leave the house or sleep at night because of the compulsion to masturbate continuously. To the point of fear and pain. This isn't even a joke story. If someone has the overwhelming compulsion to continuously masturbate as a child or young person, especially a young girl, wouldn't that be a pretty terrifying situation for that person?

I didn't read this comment as a declaration of abuse, fwiw. I was just genuinely curious if that added context changed anyone's thoughts on any of it. Especially because the excerpts that were leaked were meant to paint as bad of light as possible and lacked context that maybe changed some of the nuances, you know?   As for good reasons to not like her, in my opinion: Well, like you, I have a lot of issues with mainstream white feminism and she actively feeds into a lot of those problems. She really isn't great about inclusicity and diversity. I don't think she considers her areas of privilege when people bring up issues that they have with things she has said or done in real life or on the show. She speaks over people of color and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds quite often. She isn't really all that willing to reflect on her actions or accept responsibility when she fucks up.  And she has chosen to identify as an ally for various groups and as a feminist. She wants those roles.  But she fails to realize that she can't just decide to be an ally and call it a day. That status is granted to her not something she can just claim. And she has done shitty things to groups she is supposedly an ally of and then, again, doesn't listen to members of those groups when they speak up. And since she has decided to be a public feminist, it is fair to hold her to higher standards, I think. But she seems to be mostly interested in advancing or talking about issues that specifically impact her. Her feminism has been exclusionary instead of inclusive and intersectional."

Still weird, but only because the sister seemed intent on sharing the bed. 13 year olds masturbate and she waited until the sister was asleep before doing it."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,sibeliushelp,5,Tue Jun 30 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"This continued until she was 17 and her sister was 11. She also describes using her sister as a ""sexual outlet""."

It seems like you're going out of your way to make excuses for the indecent when it's really a cut and dry example of sexual abuse."

In the media maybe, but to someone with a doctorate in psychology (for example) it probably wouldn't. It might indicate boundary issues with Dunham, but that's it.  There's a reason that the people jumping all over the story were largely those with no expertise whatsoever in childhood sexual development."

Masturbation has been around forever, and kids getting their own bedrooms (even their own beds) is a recent phenomenon.  Trying to figure out a way to masturbate in your own bed without being noticed by your siblings is a common thing and has been for ages.  I've heard my uncles joke about it; I heard kids at school joke about it.  How did it become abuse all of a sudden?  As far as I'm aware nobody has announced that it has been discovered to be harmful.  It seems like people are just squeamish about it because they grew up in circumstances that afforded them a level of privacy that is by no means universal even today."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,duckduckCROW,7,Tue Jun 30 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"Thinking about your point more, I'm interested in class issues I see tied to not just this case but sex or masturbation and privacy in general. I'm not saying that I'm advocating for people to just have sex and masturbate in front of kids all of the time or anything. I should clarify before someone takes it that way. I'm interested in a way that is separate from judgment, etc. Think of all of the people all over the world living in very cramped or public places. Usually as a result of poverty.

I mean, you can make the argument that she's lying, but that is entirely conjecture with, to the best of my knowledge, no actual basis in fact.   She was too young at the time to know how horrible her actions were. And a lot of these things she did, she did when she was far below the age of consent or truly understood what she was doing, and why it was wrong.   I don't claim to know the whole story, but from what I do know most of her behavior as a young child was developmentally normal and healthy.    But she clearly tried to make a kind of sexual bond with her sister that was abusive and dominating.   I'm sorry but you are quite likely wrong here. You are ascribing adult motives to a child, and are criminalizing normal childhood sexual development, which is something that actually is harmful to children."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,notchevybut,12,Tue Jun 30 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"I used to think like this as well, but Josh Duggar was also well below the age of consent; you could easily argue that his incidents were predicated by curiosity. His sisters also defended him to the hilt. And yet here we are, calling for his shows to be taken down, for him to be federally indicted, and for him to be placed on a sex offender list. But we let it pass for Dunham because the Duggars are conservative religious zealots and Dunham is more liberal? It just feels ethically wrong to sweep it under the rug like that. It may not have been sexual assault, but it may very well have been abuse. Sibling love blinds and complicates many already very delicate legal and moral questions."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,Kir-chan,15,Tue Jun 30 13:59:39 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I misunderstand this, but we aren't talking about the legal ""age of consent"" but more of capacity of awareness. Josh Duggar was a preteen and physically molested five girls God knows how many times, which is a hell of a lot different than a seven year old girl masturbating in bed next to her sister.  Can't speak for everyone else, but I personally was much more aware of right and wrong as a twelve year old opposed to a seven year old. Also the fact that the Duggar family is literally known for being repressed makes a big difference in how we should interpret the victim's response. It's fine to criticize, but trying to draw a comparison between such vastly different situations honestly seems ignorant and sexist to me."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,notchevybut,19,Tue Jun 30 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"He was also 14, not a preteen. 14 is the age of consent in many places.   The youngest girl he molested was 5."

SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,Othello,6,Tue Jun 30 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"And his family assigned homework to his sisters about how they did things wrong and he didn't.

I don't know every single detail, but most of what Dunham did is part of normal, healthy childhood development. The huge glaring issue with criminalizing this behavior isn't the effect on Dunham, it's the damaging effect it can have on children if this becomes the dominant narrative. This is really a serious issue here."

It's interesting that all the examples that are being brought up here are comedians (Fey, Dunham, Schumer, Poehler) because comedians in general are very touchy when it comes to the subject of what they shouldn't say. They go on the defensive and rally behind each other at the drop of a hat (or a slip of the tongue). Here's a load of them complaining about political correctness."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,WizardofStaz,6,Tue Jun 30 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"I think that this has a lot to do with having a career tied up in the lack of political correctness. Just like the owners of a meat-processing plant defend the right to eat meat, advertisers want to be allowed to advertise whatever they want, and teachers want lower class sizes.   If your way of living and making money rests on the maxim of ""I can say whatever I want (as long as its funny) and you're going to like it"", then they will rebel against anything they see as eating into any comedic space. I think almost every popular comedian nowadays has some off-color joke in their set; especially because ""shock comedy"" was super popular 10 years ago, and is probably still popular nowadays.   In short, they are probably defensive because they have invested themselves in a career which can be impacted by political correctness (god forbid they have to change their material to fit what an audience wants)."
SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,WizardofStaz,2,Tue Jun 30 13:34:22 2015 UTC,"Most of them consider being able to make an audience laugh at jokes that should not be funny a measure of skill.

I don't think comedians should alter their set just because the audience doesn't like it (I mean for any reason, not just racism) because that would degrade their art.

I see people accusing you of trying to shut up white feminists (which reads as one step away from BLACKS ARE THE REAL RACISTS) and people demanding that you explain yourself for being tired of this. You're not mistaken, and you're not being unfair to white people.

It's also that I get frustrated with people who don't get basic tenets of SJ and yet they're in SRSDiscussion.

Louis C.K., Bill Burr, Seinfeld, etc are all male comedians who (with the exception of Louie) shy away from feminism, and female comedians tend to do the opposite and remain some of the loudest voices in both the media and the public eye. Why not try and ask those voices to be a bit kinder to the people who deserve it?   We shouldn't forget that the core problem is patriarchy; it is from this injustice that [intersectional] feminism should carve itself space.    That's exactly what is happening, though there has been literally no space for intersectionalism in the mainstream. The revolution against male-centric societal structures has been led by people who give far less attention to minorities (both racial and sexual), and speak on their behalf when they have little authority to do so. We all agree that cultural appropriation is a horrible thing, so why the double standard for this?

SRSDiscussion,3blqnv,WizardofStaz,18,Fri Jul 3 09:25:44 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that someone like Amy Schumer really can't solve the problem of being a white voice in a field where minority voices are needed.  You called out white feminists for speaking on behalf of groups they don't belong to, and that's all they can do.  Amy Schumer's platform comes from her success as a comedian, which isn't something she can transfer to other people beyond encouraging mentoring other up-and-coming comics — which it's a little early to judge her for considering she's still establishing her own career.  It's not as straightforward as in, say, academia, where the current crop of professors have total control over the recognition and career advancement of the next generation.  Amy Schumer can't create a female comic of color any more than Louis CK could have created Amy Schumer.  By existing and speaking she inevitably whitens the conversation more than she could ever make up for in any other way, which I think is why people see it as silencing when people blame a preponderance of whiteness on the white voices that are present.  The important thing is that the problem is an absence of voices and it's unfair to put so much blame on people who are able to be present and use their voices.  Your post jumped straight from identifying the problem to criticizing the shortcomings of individual white feminists, which is a very small part of the problem (if it's even fair to characterize it that way.)  Also, while your original post paid plenty of attention to Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham's shortcomings, it didn't mention a single person of color whose voice you think deserves more attention.  I see one other person you mentioned in a comment, but she is a brand-new media celebrity.  I think it would be more useful to talk about voices who deserve more media attention and aren't getting it — talk about why they haven't been getting enough attention and what people (including high-profile white feminists) could do about it.  Also I don't think Amy Schumer really has a chance of avoiding racist overtones, because her schtick involves a lot of dredging up the dark, unhealthy parts of herself and acting them out for humor.  If she tried to pretend there was no racism down there, we'd call her out for that, wouldn't we? I think she does a fine job of presenting that stuff in a way that is very difficult to mistake for approval."

My only point is that it's more likely the fact that she's white and not that she's a feminist that makes her clueless about race, so to pass this off as ""white feminism"" as opposed to ""white racism"" misses the point.

Praising someone for one aspect of their work, which may be really praiseworthy, is not the same as endorsing every aspect of it. I think if any time a member of an oppressed/minority identity succeeds and does some things worthy of praise, if we get the mentality that we now have ownership over them and subsequently hold them a higher standard than others on every issue, we're actually making it harder for those people to succeed than straight, cis white males who don't even try to identify as allies. We're actually reinforcing the very structures we claim to be against. In an ideal world, all comedians would get an equal amount of shit for us for racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, etc. That is what is lost by focusing only one ""white feminists.""

Being a TERF is a part of many black women's feminism and I think that painting TERFs as not being very intersectional with black women would be wrong.

I'm not upset with Schumer and Dunham specifically, but the school of white power feminism they've inspired-- centrist, Caucasian-centric views getting mainstream attention when really those views are only slightly progressive and aren't inclusive of minorities and diversities that deserve recognition (e.g. disabled people, gender non-conforming, victims of institutional racism). And in the case of Dunham and Schumer specifically, every time they are accused of not adequately representing marginalized minorities in their brand of feminism, they either hide behind their status as comedians, or assert that they haven't done anything wrong and disclaim their responsibility to represent people equally. I feel like this is a huge affront to other people working far harder at real activism than they are but get 0.1% of the media attention.

There was a lot of frequent and underlying sexism and racism in 30 Rock under the guise of being feminist. It was like the jokes were supposed to make fun of the stereotypes, but women and PoC were still the butt of the joke. Similar thing in Mean Girls where it's supposed to be by girls for girls, but it perpetuates so much sexism and victim blaming. It's like you can feel that it's written by someone trying to be progressive but who still holds underlying sexist and racist beliefs, and they are heavily implied throughout the finished product. I really enjoyed 30 Rock and Mean Girls, but I hate how they're hailed as feminist and for women. No, they're still for mainstream audiences, with just a twist of having more women."

However, she's perfectly honest that there's no way she'd be able to juggle these responsebilities without having the money to rely on a nanny, she's made plenty of concessions during her career, and she will make horrible jokes as it suits her. I realize that women are hardly free of oppression, even white affluent ones, but we really need to stop trying to elevate female celebrities to sainthood as soon as they achieve any kind of self-realization."

It reinforces racism, sexism, and all sorts of systems of oppression to discount the achievements of any minorities if they had to ""rely on a nanny [or make] plenty of concessions during her career"" to achieve success. Some people are always going to be much more successful than others, regardless of field. If we say we're going to applaud oppressed identities up to mediocre level of success, but not do so if they break into the top level and that it's just okay to leave that to cis het white men, then we might as well pack it in now because we're not going after real power or equality."

There's the ""angry black hotties"" group and that's pretty much the only real attention black women get. Plus more than one underage girl in the asian clique is ""hooking up with"" the adult gym teacher, which I feel is sort of an overlooked stereotype (the young asian schoolgirl with the older man). Plus, it's made into a big joke, not taken seriously or at all discussed as harmful to the young girls, with them fighting each other over him and such.

SRSDiscussion,3bl0zx,Glass_Underfoot,5,Tue Jun 30 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"So I have been checking in on this topic every once in a while since it was created. I was hoping to see some other people's opinions on it, before embarrassing myself.   But here goes nothing.  I think it is interesting to compare the usage of the pride flag to acts of cultural appropriation. I do not think, however, that they are comparable. When (to use one of your examples) a white person appropriates a native american headdress, that harms the participants of that culture by diluting their heritage, as well as absorbing and homogenizing their culture. (I probably am quite off base, but instead of downvoting me, please inform me.)  When a straight person imposes a rainbow onto their facebook profile picture, they are in no way either: diluting an exiting culture, or homogenizing an existing culture.  I am rambling, and should really just go to sleep, but I don't really see your train of thought.  I will say though, that I am probably very wrong, and look forward to being informed.  EDIT: After looking through the required reading, I have some more thoughts.   Appropriation is a way of saying ""this is not yours"". It is an assault on my identity because it means not only can white America demonize and ridicule my heritage, they can take what they like from it and make it their own, destroying and distorting the original in the process. Whites surrounding themselves with a mishmash of Indian symbols and artifacts and Hindu ideas haphazardly lifted from some New Age book make a mockery out of an identity that is very real to me.   I think that the current fad surrounding the pride flag if different primarily because (currently) it is still being used explicitly to promote LGBT rights."
SRSDiscussion,3bl0zx,iTARIS,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:23:31 2015 UTC,"Straight person here, here's my perspective. At my work, practically everyone else is really anti-LGBTQ. When the subject rarely comes up, and somebody backs me up, that fills me with a lot of reassurance and vigor. It's hard to make an argument for anything when you're the sole opinion, and less hard when you have backup. That's what I see the pride flags as - visual evidence that many, many people support gay rights."
SRSDiscussion,3bl0zx,afndale,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:17:24 2015 UTC,"I'm probably not the best person to ask about this, since I tend not to more easily assume appreciation than appropriation than some. And am perhaps not offended by things or find them problematic that I should.  But I wouldn't worry too much. I think we all make mistakes, and simply having an earnest desire to be an ally is a good thing. It would sure be usual and misleading for a straight person to wear a shirt saying ""Pansexual"" for solidarity, when that would imply that the person is Pansexual. And there are plenty of other supportive LGBT shirts that show solidarity. I don't know if that would be appropriation so much as sending the wrong message, though.  I don't know what all about our culture could be misrepresented or appropriated. Or what terrible things about us could be said by people trying to be allies that aren't said about us.  But I think it would be good to keep an open mind. And probably would be best to avoid generalization since we can all be so different. It would be sad to spread generalizations and misinformation that isn't true. Like for instance, it would be wrong to say that transpeople feel gender dysphoria to the point of feeling suicidal, when many of us don't, including me.  The concern over the usage of a rainbow pride flat possibly being appropriation and marginalizing is the sort of thing that makes me think that some people are taking and misusing the idea to discourage appreciation. Which is just as harmful if not moreso than appropriation. Appreciation should be encouraged. If you want to fly our flags, I totally encourage you! :>  Making a caricature or a stereotype out of us is probably not a good idea, or a nice idea, though."

SRSDiscussion,3b9m82,Engelgrinder,6,Mon Jun 29 03:48:32 2015 UTC,"This is a really pompous way to say that not only should the most marginalised people beg, but that they should beg for less, and frankly I think this is a new low even for SRSD.  If you recognise this:   Social change requires the consent of the ruling classes.   Why do you consider it a good thing, or something that should be humoured? By definition the ruling classes will not consent to meaningful or radical changes which threatens their position of power unless they are coerced by something which constitutes more of an existential threat (welfare state as a concession to stave off communists, pretty much most major concessions after decades of violent and vocal agitation that made possible the non-violent agitation). Certain classes must be entirely subjugated for the ruling class to exist (e.g. colonised peoples and the settler state).  By positing this as realpolitik you are only ignoring the dedicated anti-utopianism of revolutionary organisation worldwide, which has its origins in gradual and planned work by vanguard and masses alike, and you are condescending to a lot of people who are a hell of a lot more oppressed than you about how they should feel about being oppressed. But then again, this post entirely focuses on the USA, so, shrug. Universal harmony or something.  Also, I'd rather abolish inheritances than gender. The majority of critique and concern I've seen by other LGBTQ people about this decision is about the institution of marriage or about reprioritising homeless queer youth, trans rights, etc. I'm sure there are plenty of people saying what you're saying, but I don't really like this misrepresentation of LGBTQ concerns as unreasonable or the delegitimisation of them as excessively ambitious.  A lot of us aren't liberals who are trying for slow reforms which can be and often are (less topically, but I can provide many examples) rescinded by the state. I personally don't intend to ask for the consent of the ruling classes for anything, because I will never get it, because I am an impoverished indigenous trans person. And I am disabled in such a way that I will almost certainly die young (as have most of my people, who work and die before they can see even the most miserly of reforms, let alone see it whittled away by further reform), so I'm not about these slow timetables for freedom. Instead, I spend my time working towards conditions for a revolution wherein we can transition towards a society without a ruling class."

SRSDiscussion,3b9m82,kisamara_jishin,3,Wed Jul 1 08:01:50 2015 UTC,"You're underestimating the unstable situation the soviet state was, especially in the later stages of its existence. They often survived through buying grains or getting relief aid from western states and i would argue quite a load of help. Especially the 80s and the early 90s you could see huge problems and it is of of the reason why the German reunification was possible. Germany not only gave one billion in relief aid (mostly food) immediately when 1991 a severe drought hit the soviet union, in the coming years Germany also paid into a program that build houses for russian soldiers formerly deployed in east Germany in Russia (7,8 billion), the ""upkeep"" of said military (3 billion), transport costs (1 billion) as well as paying into programs for reeducation of soviet soldiers (0,2 billion). You think if they were a ""industrial supower"" would be able to pay that themselves, wouldn't they?   But not only that, in 72 when the soviet union experience another very brutal drought and it is estimated that ⅙ of all bread in the soviet union was made with US-american grain. You might not have learned these things in your history class or you were not aware of it for other reasons, but it like to point out that the lack of famines in the middle and later 20th century in Russia was often accomplished by buying - sometimes even blackmailing with military force basically - it from the more modern and better working western world and all of that started in the 60s when the soviet union bought grain from Canada, when they had problems as well.  Now, if the Soviet Union actually planed all of that i would not say that it would be a big problem, however it wasn’t and their incompetence in this area (especially fertilizer production as well as land utilization) was always rather staggering. From our perspective today it does not sound that bad, in the end they just bought food, right? However from the perspective of the SU this was seen as a big problem, because the Soviet Union has some of the best soil there is in the world Ukraine always was the definition of the grain basket. My father still can’t fathom the fact how incompetent the SU has have to be been to be so ineffective. However he was a German farmer, so that may come with the territory.  The SU always - and Russia still is - a country rich of resources, but they often imported more than they exported. This has its strong roots in its mismanagement. Yes they were a superpower, militarily and politically first and foremost, but i would hesitate to say that they were a economical superpower, however you talked it being an industrial superpower which is absolutely correct. Planning an industry is way easier and can be centralized way better and this was demonstrated by the SU very well, but their problems in the food sector were indeed persistent and did not go away.  On the other side, some peole are very keen to argue that those are exaggerations or capitalistic propaganda. From the bottom of my heart, let me tell you they aren't."

But do you know who it's really good for? Really, really good for? Those who already have everything.  Why would my point be that you don't deserve pleasure, or that we should all return to subsistence agriculture. Of course, that's absurd. But the claim that inheritance is intrinsically good because it's tied to the the inevitability of economic development and growth misses the way that inheritance actually works to benefit those at the top.  The political elite who give away mineral rights for nothing are beneficiaries of inheritance. The foreign wealth that is used to buy those mineral rights exists primarily because centuries of capital accumulation have allowed it to consolidate into relatively few hands.  Of course the middle class isn't the problem. But redistribution isn't about taking small farms from Africans and giving it to the state. It's not even about taking big giant farms from the oligarchs. It's about targeting the accumulation of wealth (of capital) that rolls over, and over, and over, from generation to generation perpetuating inequality from here until forever."

Democracy may or may not be cancled.  196X-199X, Internal civil wars give way to either stable dictatorships, weak democracies, or highly authoritarian regimes, the west opens up trade.

The point is, the wealth was literally taken from the oppressive factions and then RE TAKEN by other military factions, there hasn't been the western style 100s of years of family wealth, when besides the Ethiopian exception, these nations are  less than 100 years old (and South Africa is its on unique special monster, its closest to Zimbabwe in country model style).

You however are literally a settler judging from upthread, so it makes sense you would assume you know the most about the land and also be very terrified of any threats to the ruling class. You are not a subsistence farmer, you run a farm remotely from another continent while having a second job. You are no more entitled to your super special intergenerational farm under capitalism than you are to having your own labour exploited like us proles. And fwiw it's morally outrageous from what I understand of your farm for you to operate in such a manner, don't know why you're surprised an indigenous person might object.  I live below the poverty line due to the material conditions I described, and cannot get proper medical treatment. How terrible for me to decry inheritance when I come from a line of exploited and segregated black labourers. I hope your indignation makes you feel better, since relative material security and safety to the majority of the world does nothing for your contentment.  and I live in a farming town, probably closer to any farms than you, so I've seen what large scale capitalist farming, which is in huge part predicated on estate inheritance, has done to my ancestral lands. (edit: I'm not an anarchoprimitivist by any stretch of the imagination but I find this nth generation farming entitlement, routinely encountering it, to be something super out of this world.)  I have nothing for your melodrama except that your assumption an indigenous person who wants to reclaim their land and unseat an oppressive mode of production is acting destructively is ultra racist, but it seems you missed that part of my post and think I'm a white person so I'm just going to conclude its terribly naïve. Nobody wants to destroy land or natural resources, the intent is to continue to use it productively as well as equitably while halting the unsustainable and similarly inequitable destruction of the infinite growth called for by capitalism. nth generation farm bosses are not the only person who know how to farm.

SRSDiscussion,3b9m82,plenty_of_time,5,Sun Jun 28 08:31:26 2015 UTC,"My issue is this. You must know as much as I do that we are starving, and the population growth is at a rate never before seen by humans.  Also, calling me a settler is bizzare since we have always lived in the region, we just expanded and grew,[A lot of pre 19XX marriages were to expand and centralize the holdings which lead to this] and thanks to luck, managed to get to the west, and sacrifice there to improve the home working conditions.   We cannot use pure native slash and burn techniques to feed a 100+ million country, and I am not going to promote killing millions so we can use the pre colonial techniques that worked when our populations were smaller.  Small farms will not feed our huge regions, and if we locals do not farm, the multinationals in the US will eat our lunch and we will become a pure petrostate, which is unacceptable. I do admit, I am lucky. I come from a line of farmers pre grandfather, who sent my grandfather to the colonial school, and through luck he became a doctor who moved all over the world, and eventually to the states. My father came from a line of bureaucrats and religious figures.  Also, if you call providing fair jobs that do not require working for an oppression multinational or living in the slums of the capitol oppressive, I will disagree with you. I'm not some white Rhodesian settler going WHITE FOREVER, I work with and consult with the chiefs to ensure that local families have fair economic policies.   Its just that, this may be me being a 'technocrat', but our traditional farming techniques, while having value, are insufficient to feed our exploding populations, and as long as we are a hugely religious land with low socio-economic development, the spikes mean we need to feed more people. Its why I want to use more advanced techniques so I can conserve water, use 0 pesticides in 5-10 years, and truly modernize while ensuring the land is productive  for at least 100 years.  I mean, lets say you did take the land, and the estates, the biggest issue is capital, and unless you are going to tell the military or worse, the Islamists up north to share (which is an internal issue and a massive long term concern), state capital to replace the foreign capital, which more likely they will just go ""oh, some Marxists again, time to suppress"", good luck.  I suspect we are comparing Africa to the New World, as again, calling me a settler is oxymoronical, as we have owned that land since pre colonialism. (also I might be angry because during the various political crisis, a bunch of it was sold to our neighbors under the alleged window of redistribution, but their portion collapsed so I had to play the game of 'fix the land and prevent mudslides, but they improved it as well') we settled the dispute in the west and now I talk with the guy, through the magic of African expat communities, we went to the same church).   You must know how it is a delicate game to run a property without being looked at as radical, and since our goverment allied with the united states, a radical revolution won't be Biafria bad in that the international community will condem but do nothing, but it will be ""Terrorist marixst revolution was suppressed by Drones and special forces."". I have seen 10+ years of war in Iraq, and the north is unstable.

While typically liberals like to blame the Left for exaggerating oppression (""It's not that bad"" ""It gets better!"" ""If you vote you can change it"" ect. ), this exaggeration by liberals is arguably more absurd. It's this sort of mentality that traps people in the confines of this ultimately meaningless electoral game rather than attempt to find avenues of actual resistance. Even the language of this post is coached in liberalism, only those with wealth are even able to consider having ""inheritances"" or ""capital"" to protect. Even MLK recognized the ineptitude of the ""white moderate"" and the importance of non-electoral action.  Lasting Social change only comes when the ruling class is overthrown. All other social change are temporal in nature and the product not of an election but of a radical concession brought about by struggle. Stonewall was a riot, there are still Radical Black activists in prison on trumped up charges ect. ect. Marriage is a sort of mutant of a concession and a reinforcement of the system: integration and assimilating some Queer and Trans people into an institution that does so much harm to the oppressed. The fact that these ""pride"" events are sponsored by corporations, protected by the same pigs who murder the oppressed, and sanctioned by the same state that detains and misgenders Trans and Queer people is an ultimate testament to who these ""pride"" events really represent.    And yet, these constant appeals to ""the public"" (which public?) are most of all an appeal to ruling class respectability politics.

I don't think Communism is possible due to my personal opinions about humanity, but I believe a socialist USA is possible within the next ~100 years and many stepping stones, like universal basic income, will be necessary in the next 50.

It's so depressing and defeatist. Abandon the Dems and fight for a genuine alternative. At the very least you can help shift political consciousness leftwards."
SRSDiscussion,3b9asc,Tidorith,15,Sat Jun 27 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"I think you have a fundamentally backwards view of how to influence a political party. If far left people don't vote, the Democrats will move right, because the people farthest to the left will not be voting, and so they will have to appeal to moderates to win elections. If their base votes strongly the Democrats will be free to stay left and ignore the opinions of moderates.   It's not like the Democrats have a secret hidden agenda to move right. They move right when it helps them win elections. By your logic, the Tea Party movement voting strongly and consistently for Republicans should have moved the Republicans to the left, but clearly it did the exact opposite of that."
SRSDiscussion,3b9asc,BlackHumor,2,Sat Jun 27 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"The horrible thing about the 2 party fptp system is that it forces Democrats to neglect the interests of their core voting blocks (ethnic minorities - particularly african americans, the young, precariat/working class) to win elections. Speaking from a psephological point of view, there's no reason why they should move to the left ever. I think one good thing about the death of bipartisanship is that its allowed allowed the Democrats to retreat into more comfortable territory. Hillary is making moves in the right direction and if she becomes president, her base will expect her to implement a progressive agenda."
SRSDiscussion,3b9asc,Tidorith,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if Left wing former Democrats vote for a actually left wing (on the spectrum of Western politics) third party, this creates a measurable incentive for the Democrat party to move left."
SRSDiscussion,3b9asc,l33t_sas,5,Mon Jun 29 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. It creates an incentive to move right. You are thinking of the Democrats like they really secretly love the far left and will be sad to see them go. But that's not true: the Democratic Party has no long term intentions, period. If they lose votes on the left they will simply go replace them in the center. They will never move left to appease parts of the base that don't even vote for them.   Think of it this way: Democrats lost the 2000 election at least partly because more people than usual voted for Nader. The next election, they didn't nominate a True Leftist, they nominated one of the most boringly establishment candidates they had in a while. The election after that, leftists turned out to vote for Obama, and we actually got a moderately left candidate in the White House."
SRSDiscussion,3b9asc,Suddenly_Elmo,2,Mon Jun 29 21:19:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree. If there is a general, understood commitment that all left wing people will vote for the most left wing party, no matter how right wing they are, then there is literally no incentive whatsoever to either move left, or to save left. I agree that there's no fundamental driving force to move right, but there is a strong incentive to do so: swing votes. So if we create a situation where there is no incentive, ever, to move left, and even a tiny incentive to move right, what would you expect to happen?  It's a pretty simple calculus, really: what should we do to have the highest net gain in votes? If all democrats commit to remaining democrats, then the answer will always be move right. If only a very few democrats start voting for a more left party, then that remains true because there are more votes in the center. On top of that, the democrats are more likely to lose an election, and they get a convenient scapegoat.   But if a trend is established (i.e. growing number of people voting for a more left wing party over several elections), then that can change the calculus. You can't just look at two or three election cycles and see what happened there, and go ""well obviously voting for a third party does nothing"", because voting for a third party is a long term strategy. The expected result of one or two big third party/independent vote one election followed by a small one the next is the status quo, because the message that sends is that people have bought the idea that third party votes are a waste; that they've learned their lesson, as it were.   The idea that third parties cost elections for the democrats was pushed incredibly strongly, by everyone. This is one of those many cases of self fulfilling prophecy, like a run on a bank. If everyone believes third party votes to be a waste, they will be, because there won't be enough of them. But fortunately, we don't need to ask people to waste their votes. Only ~40-50% of the population is voting. If every one of those people voted for a formerly minor party who more closely mirrored their views, you don't think that would create an incentive for the major parties to shift towards their ideas?"
SRSDiscussion,3b9asc,nyuutsu,2,Tue Jun 30 19:50:49 2015 UTC,"But what I'm saying is, swing votes are only an incentive to move right if the party needs swing votes to win.   Imagine a country where 51% of the electorate was socialist. If they all vote for the socialist party, that party has no need to compromise its ideals. In fact, it has a strong incentive not to: if it does so it gains nothing and potentially loses some of its base.   But if it can only count on 49% of the vote, the socialist party needs to find some kind of compromise with the moderates to its right. Now it has a strong incentive to move right, and much less incentive to move further left (because if it moves further left it will be losing many moderates to pick up a few radicals).  Also, in the US electoral system, a third party vote is fundamentally a waste. Not even just a waste, it's actively harmful to the most popular choice, and this is not something that can be overcome by any amount of support a modern candidate has ever had, third party or not.   If you don't believe me, look at the 1912 presidential election, where a hugely popular progressive third party led by a hugely  popular progressive former president caused the most conservative candidate in the election to win."
SRSDiscussion,3b9asc,MySilverWhining,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"I do agree with nearly all of what you're saying. There is often an incentive to move right. The problem is that with no democrats ever voting for a more left party, there is rarely an incentive to move left. You are right that there are more voters in the US right of the democrats than there are left. This does definitely affect who the best person is to vote for (certainly in the short term), but it is not a problem that can be solved by voting for one party or another.   Also, in the US electoral system, a third party vote is fundamentally a waste. Not even just a waste, it's actively harmful to the most popular choice, and this is not something that can be overcome by any amount of support a modern candidate has ever had, third party or not.   This is what I take issue with. It is a waste in one sense only, in that you will normally negatively affect the outcome of the currently election. It is not a waste in two other senses:   1) your vote carries more specific information about what kind of party you'd like to vote for than simply not voting.   2) it shows that some voters in the US are willing to consider third parties.  But the biggest thing I take issue with, is that people who vote third party are constantly derided for wasting their vote, and that this happens far more than people who literally do not vote at all are derided for wasting their vote. How can any other action be more of a waste of a vote than that? You don't even send a strong message that you don't like the current electoral system. Off the top of my head I can name four completely different reasons why a person might not vote, and there's no way to tell which reason accounts for which portion of the non-votes.  If every person who currently didn't vote, voted for a third party that campaigned on a single policy of fixing the US electoral system, they would win in a landslide. The problem is not people voting for a third party. The problem is the acceptance of US voters that their current system is unchangeable, to the point where they'd rather not participate at all than ""waste"" their vote in an at attempt to effect any change. And people saying things like you are bear a lot of the blame for that."

I thought she was just agreeing with you in a fun way..almost like she was just really excited to finally have found someone who thinks similarly to her. Would it have been better to say, ""ah..finally somebody who gets it"" or would that have been just as bad? Should OP have refrained from letting you know she's happy you see eye to eye? I'm really just curious where the harm was.  I know it's a bit random that this one comment prompted my first post on the sub, but I guess it just left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm really excited to be learning more about social justice here and elsewhere; however, I'm getting turned off by the idea that nearly any word or concept put forth by an individual has the potential to offend someone else. How was ding ding ding so harmful? Maybe I'm wrong (and if I am, please correct me--I will listen) but it does sound to me like you might have overreacted a bit and made OP look like a jerk who doesn't respect you..while all along I believe OP was only looking to metaphorically high-five you.  I'm honestly just a little confused and this one little scenario represents a larger picture for me. My sister was the one who got me into social justice and other positive movements. I've learned a lot from her but she is far, far more ""in it"" than I will ever be. And while I try to learn more and become a better advocate, partly because of my love for her, sometimes this sort of thing can happen between us. She will find offense in something that was not malicious, and I won't understand why it was offensive. This indirectly leads me to worry about what I personally say around her, in case I somehow set her off some day with one bad word choice. I avoid her to a degree, because 1) I'm irrationally scared that I could offend her one day and, 2) her finding offense in everything just bums me out.  Anyway, sorry for all the words. I got a little carried away there and just let it flow. But if you have an answer or even any insight at all, that would be awesome.

SRSDiscussion,3b7qss,benthebearded,6,Sat Jun 27 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"Today is a massive victory for the GSM (Gender and Sexual Minority) community across the nation. What the movement has been pushing for, the metam belli as it were, has been, in one fell swoop, has been achieved. People are free to marry the person they love now. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided that it is an inalienable constitutional right that cannot be abridged by the states.  This is a massive win that means a lot for a lot of people who have spent their life’s work in building up this moment. The power in the words of the court’s opinion give no doubt to the importance of today’s decision:   No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotions, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were. As some of the petitioners in this case demonstrate, marriage embodies that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to a live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. Anthony Scalia, the Majority opinion in Obergefell v Hobbes   For all the people who have fought for this right for decades, this confirmation of their life’s work is an affirmation that is indescribable.  But the fight cannot be allowed to end now. There is still so much that is needed to be done in the GSM community. We must fight for and with those who still have their identities denied to them everyday. We must fight for and with those who are disowned and forced to leave home because they are a trans person. We must fight for and with those who, in their fear for their future, which all too often looks to be one that is filled with hate, one filled with loneliness and condemnation of their fundamental identity, and not being able to see a way out, turn towards a final solution to end their suffering.  We must fight for and with those who, in their struggling to survive because of discrimination in the work place, are forced into sex work and are exploited and abused and treated as subhumans. We must fight for and with those who, being assigned to the wrong gender at birth, must secure the right to their bodies and how they choose transition. All of this must be accomplished before we can pat ourselves on the back and rest on our laurels for winning this civil rights battle.  Before their 20th birthday, 42% of transgender people will have attempted suicide. 53% of the same group have self harmed. 26.5% struggle with prescription drug abuse. Half of transgender people have experienced sexual violence in one form or another; out of this number, one in five will experience sexual violence in a health care setting. Half of the transgender community will experience domestic violence as a direct result of their identity. Fifteen percent of transgender individuals report being sexually assaulted while in police custody or jail, which more than doubles (32 percent) for African-American transgender people.   Although these numbers are just for members of the transgender community, they are matched all across the gender and sexual non-conforming spectrum. To be quite frank, the fact that gay marriage is now recognized as a fundamental right in the United States doesn’t mean a whole hell of a lot to these people.  Yes, they may want to marry in their lifetimes, and yes, they would like to be able to marry regardless of their lover’s gender, but what matters the most to them, is an end to the heartache, and to get to a better life, free from the discrimination and violence that all queer-identified and transgender people face in their lifetime.   These are the people that need the most help. The people suffering from sexual and domestic violence because of their identity. The people struggling with substance abuse to cope with the hate and discrimination. The people who hate their own lives to the point of ending it forever. The people who, being born gay or trans to a hate-filled family, are thrown out of their homes, and forced to fend for themselves without a support structure that so many of us depend on.   We cannot allow this momentous victory to let us lose sight of the true goal that has always and will always be at the heart of this movement: to ensure a good life for all members of the GSM-community. One decision on the Supreme Court cannot give us this victory. I expect, that before the fight is over, we will come time and time again to those 9 judges, and, fate willing, the voices of progress and humanity will prevail over those who would hate, and seek to put down members of our community. But this is not the most likely scenario. We will fight, and sometimes we will, unlike with the ruling given down today, we will lose. And we will get back up and fight again. Because this is our brothers and sisters and lovers that are being beaten down. This is for every single member of our community. This is for the gay man born into wealth, whose family accepted him in his entirety.  This is for the trans woman born into the deep south, whose family disowned her the second she voiced her intent to transition. This is for the trans man, who, after being kicked out of his home, and is out on the streets, turns to sex work just to survive. This is for every single member of our community. Until every single person, who upon discovering their gender and sexuality, feels comfortable, and free from fear because their own, fundamental human identity, we – members of the GSM-community, their families, their friends, their lovers – must keep fighting. Or else the human suffering will continue."

Recently a Latina Transwomyn was shut down by the president at their own ""Pride"" event in the White House for protesting against Detention Center abuses, not just by the straight president but by a host of rich Queer ""leaders"". Are these the type of people privileged Queer and Trans people want to become when they clamor for acceptance?    I don't want people not to celebrate this stuff, it certainly helps a lot of people, but let's remember who is being left behind in the Queer and Trans communities by this growing integration into the marriage (and other) systems of power.  Part of supporting social justice is that we don't just support it for the most privileged of oppressed groups, we support everyone's freedom and liberation. Let's not forget that."

The Right does not argue this; they argue that any integration (even one that actually affirms power structures like this one) is bad because they believe it does harm to power structures or dilutes their prominence (""destroying marriage"" ect.). In much the same way they oppose privileged Black people attaining public offices, even when those Black Faces wear White Masks (to play off of Fanon).  Does that clarify my complaints?"
SRSDiscussion,3b7qss,iamaneviltaco,13,Fri Jun 26 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"Just a bit confused as to where you're getting ""privileged people are helped more here"" when I can marry anyone of any color or sex now, regardless of trans status or any other social designators. Literally, a marriage license costs like 50 bucks. This is now the most inclusive thing possible, and the only people who aren't helped by it are people who practice polyamory. A minority genderfluid person could marry an asexual person if they wanted, and share all of the benefits (medical, social, taxation-based, end of life decisions...) that everyone else can, for whatever reasons they decided to. This isn't anyone forcing anyone to conform to any system, this is forcing the system to conform to the people. You say it's a heterosexist power structure, I say ""the supreme court just decided that it's not, anymore, and should be open to all consenting adults"".  And that's not even touching on the fact that the marriage tax breaks are fantastic if you're low income, and I speak from experience here: They really kinda are.  That's the very definition of freedom, and while I get that there might be other pressing issues at stake? It's a bit harmful... No I'd say it's incredibly harmful to immediately disregard a huge step in giving rights to absolutely every free adult in the nation. And you say that's not the intent, but where your point veered off a bit, imo, is that none of this has anything to do with pride organizations or detention centers. One problem at a time, yeah? This is a fight that's been ongoing for years now, and we just won it. There's no crime in stopping to appreciate that fact for a bit.  I guess the one thing I don't get is that you sound like you don't want the current systems to conform to allow all consenting adults equal rights and protections. IMO, that's the absolute end goal of any fight for social equality."
SRSDiscussion,3b7qss,anichai,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:34:04 2015 UTC,"Here are some reasons why marriage itself is not all it's set out to be for a lot of oppressed people: http://www.organizingupgrade.com/index.php/modules-menu/beyond-capitalism/item/1002-marriage-will-never-set-us-free  The book ""Against Equality Queer Revolution, Not Mere Inclusion"" is also decent though not without it's problems.  Secondly: you are ignoring the (ideological) impact that this has on the movement has a whole. Queer and Trans people have in heterosexist vocabulary ""made it"", the struggle is ""over"" because the one's dictating it see marriage as their end goal. The same people loudly trumpeting marriage were the same that shut down  Jennicet Gutiérrez and who have ignored and degenerated Trans and Queer people who were not white, cis, and rich/bourgeois. Just look at the recent scandalous ""Human Rights Campaign"" demographic surveys and complaints from non-white and non-male workers to get what I'm saying. Not only is marriage itself deeply harmful, it is being used as a weapon in order to integrate a fraction of the Trans and Queer population (the most powerful) into heterosexist cis-supremicist capitalism and shut out the rest (who are still poor, homeless and mostly Colonized).   We are focused on marriage so much that the issues that affect the most oppressed Trans and Queer people are ignored, and have even gotten worse. Violence is going up, not down for us. The people being deported and subject to Colonial violence (including, of course, deportation and extreme exploitation) are also Trans and Queer. And yet, we don't hear those voices. The only voices being heard are the white one's at the pride events and their corporate sponsors. This is what we are talking about when we say that we are being silenced. And I'm honestly tired of having to explain how Trans and Queer oppression works for the vast majority of us to people who would rather celebrate these changes and ignore what is going on around them."

Nobody is forced to ""assimilate"" (I strongly disagree with your use of the word there, frankly) - but it is important that the option is there. Even if nobody takes it. But they will because millions of gay people want it.  Does it fix everything for everyone? No. It doesn't even fix everything for gay people who want to get married, but so what? That's not even close to the vicinity of the point.   In my opinion, any model of social justice that doesn't celebrate progress, however small, is a model of social justice that sucks.

I could be happy for you if there was any recognition of the struggles that non normative queers will continue to face, but for so many gays, the concept of allyship doesn't even begin to go that far--we don't exist, and while you might have empathy for people like me, there are so many out there for whom this ruling practically does mean the end of the road for queer social justice.

SRSDiscussion,3b1ndw,papermoon1,7,Thu Jun 25 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"Reddit isn't really ""far-right"" so much as it's full of the shittiest sort of liberals.  People who like to think of themselves as progressive and will generally support progressive causes in the most halfassed wishy-washy way possible but will go absolutely apeshit on anyone who challenges the status quo in any serious way or says anything critical about them or the things they like. Phil Ochs wrote a song about this phenomenon that's still surprisingly relevant.  Bernie Sanders is held up as the ""far left"" candidate but that's only true in the context of a political system that's massively corrupt and bent on defending the interests of wealth and power. His ""socialist"" economic policy is basically to roll back the worst, stupidest things that Bush II and Clinton I did and maybe take a bit of money from the wealthiest people and give it to the middle class. I don't know of any position he's taken on any kind of social issue that isn't overwhelmingly popular with reddit's core demographic of young white men. The only thing I'm aware of with Sanders that might actually be controversial on Reddit is that he's against nuclear power but that doesn't seem to get brought up ever so people probably aren't even aware of it.   The problem with Reddit isn't so much the vaguely center-left politics of the average user so much as what constitutes ""acceptable thought"".  It's a community where a woman gets turned into Emmanuel Goldstein for saying some mean stuff about Mario but straight up Dylann Roof style shit about how great Rhodesia was is greeted with ""oh well I might not agree with that, but free speech though..."".   It's not inconsistent at all that someone like Bernie Sanders could get some love on here."

It's been a long while since I've watched an Loony Toons but to my memory/knowledge Yosemite Sam doesn't have any of the same connotations that a caricature of a confedate soldier would.  To be honest, I would think it more of an issue if the university were in the southeast. People in what's now Nevada didn't have any stake in the civil war when it was going on, did they?   That the newspaper is called the Rebel Yell is more disconcerting than the mascot, I think, because that definitely DOES bring up stuff about the confederates, and not really anything else.   I suppose that if the school wanted to change the name to Mountain Man or something, that would probably be the least worriesome choice.

SRSDiscussion,3azj0u,bigninja27,5,Thu Jun 25 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, so full disclosure: I went to the University of Mississippi.During the time that I was enrolled there the ""unofficial"" mascot (Colonel Reb) was eliminated completely, one of our marching songs was cut (From Dixie With Love, it's essentially Dixieland that segways into a big brass band fight song because... football) after it became clear that students would not stop chanting ""the south will rise again!"" at its end, and Barack Obama was elected president.  This is Colonel Reb. He was always depicted as a Confederate soldier, leading the Rebels. That doesn't mean we always kept him in uniform like that. Like UNLV, we would put him in athletic jerseys to try to remove the more obvious racism from it: see, it's so much better, right?. The presence of the same mascot, no matter what the hell you tweak about his image, is still toxic. You can put Colonel Reb in a basketball uniform, but he's still Colonel Reb.   We replaced him with Rebel Black Bear, which is a bear dressed up like the typical student tailgating for a sports game. Voila.  Even though a mascot seems iconic or a tradition seems invaluable doesn't mean that it can't change. Did it piss off alumni, yes. But they'll get over it and the important part was that the student body was not alienated completely.   As an institution their Southern Studies department and their Institute of Racial Reconciliation deserves a lot of respect. It's always bothered my professors deeply that they were associated with a great college that was completely tainted by the goodol'boys trying to pretend that Meredith never happened. Like, in talking with my profs in my department, I was never allowed to call the university ""Ole Miss,"" which is an ambiguously racist nickname for the school that's practically drilled into your head as ""its name.""  Back on topic: your school has traditions regarding this. That's understandable. But trying to update the inherently racist ones is a really hard battle, and sometimes you've just got to give up. Like the only difference is that your traditions stem from  the 1950s and ours from, really, the 1861 enlistment of the student body into the CSA army."

But racism is not isolated to South Carolina, or the South. I'm not sure if racism is more of a state or National problem but instead a human or generational problem.  People in the south, as you well know, are almost born with an innate racism, both black and white.  Children are born into and raised by families who's grandparents witnessed segregation when it was accepted socially and enforced by the government.    You mention USC so I'm sure you will be interested in about Clemson University.     But, the socio-economic condition in South Carolina, and the south in general is not where it needs to be to educate its children and citizens about racism, it's deep roots and it's broad grasp over the region and the individual.    I love South Carolina and I'm embarrassed to be from and by the actions of many South Carolinians.  Racism isn't going to be defeated or weakened by a law or removal of a flag. It can only be accomplished at the individual level and I know this is extremely difficult for you to do, but if you hear people defending the Charleston shooting, you or someone needs to make a statement.  If people are allowed to think, believe, and say things in public like that and no one confronts them, then we are all guilty of propagating racism.     You could find an infinite number of other cases through independent research of SC teachers saying things like they would commit genocide. This is a teacher from North Carolina, which shows it's not a South Carolina problem, but a regional problem.   Racism is prominent in South Carolina, but it is not the predominant ideology.  Poverty and education is definitely a problem but even that stems back to the Civil War and the burning of the south.  The war was fought in the south and the south was destroyed.  It took decades to rebuild and the effects are still be felt today, in many many ways.

I have a few queer friends who, due to anxiety/awkwardness and a lack of traditional (bullshit) western aesthetic appeal, frequently find themselves struggling to procure any romantic or sexual liaisons. Never is it for a lack of trying that they are turned down. I'm talking about being dismissed as ugly, or ""impossible to be sexualized"" on appearance or first impression alone. Although their scorn for more sexually successful individuals is often harsh, I can see why they might feel down and angsty about it. It sucks being lonely, and even more so to be teased by others for being that way.   To a certain extent, we overvalue sex. It is, and this may stem from patriarchal notions, an unfortunate embodiment of power and social currency.   edit: Adding to this, in retrospect it occurred to me that this is probably a big part of asexual-stigma. As much as sex is a part of human culture, and that might be why people dislike them, I think it is also because they are at least partially exempt from the social hierarchies and social power that sex propogates."

That social perception of your desirability can play just as much of a role in winning arguments, or dominating a social circle as facts and rhetoric.   It's just another garbage social rule, like what determines ""charisma"". Knowing when to smile, how to control your cadence, and other skills are considered agreeable, not predatory and manipulative as they often are. But if you're depressed, anxious, or mentally ill, you suffer in every instance for not adhering to the subtle minutiae in cues that make up ""the rules"".   Were you to abolish the fucked up aesthetics that currently govern our sexual discretion, I don't think it would change this. People would then still defer to the sexual experience of another to gauge their desirability, and subsequently, their prestige. ""If other people think they're sexy, they must be."""
SRSDiscussion,3augxv,cantilover,7,Thu Jun 25 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"It's a holdover from an old necessity. Before birth control, condoms, and a bunch of other great modern inventions promoscuity was downright dangerous!   We see this in far more things than just sex. For example the religious rulers saw that a bunch of their citizens were getting sick from eating pork, so they decreed that pork was anti God. And making something kosher was just making sure that it was safe and blessed with a seal of approval.   First off is the spread of STI's and other diseases were a big problem for old societies. This risk was massively reduced by only sleeping with one person.   Next there is the issue of pregnancy. Before large governments there was really no help for single mothers, and without paternity testing there was always the worry that the woman may not have the husbands kid (this is mostly a holdover from royalty).   And of course there is the plain old sexism were the standards were applied much harder to women. I believe the thought was that they could control the women because they were property but they couldn't get the men from visiting slave brothels."

SRSDiscussion,3augxv,tuff_gusty,6,Tue Jun 23 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. There's a few posts prominent on R/relationships weekly that feature a man who's discovered how many partners his girlfriend's had, and is losing his mind. If you, whoever, can stomach it, go about halfway down (could be higher depending on the post) and read the responses there from the usual suspects. It's something that stirs up the most moderate reddit dude, really. Defending the positions these guys who probably post to r/atheism begin to paraphrase Bible verses.  Edit: we should probably go ahead and add that before there were cultural notions, there was jealousy. In my view the extreme of jealousy is possessiveness, but a economics guy could probably do much better with that. Suffice to say that there's two things going on: first, women were viewed, historically, by my understanding, as possessions. Or person/possession hybrids. Largely objectified.   Also, jealousy on an interpersonal level. Jealousy is aggressive, thus masculine, and therefore virtuous. It is encouraged on and on. I hate saying ""throughout"" history, but I'm not a history guy either.   So, somewhere in that heady brew, you have the reason that it is commonplace, especially among young straight men, to want young women who are not sexually experienced. (It's funny, I originally typed: ""young straight men...want a young woman."" Because that's what it's like, culturally. A multitude of men: one idealized woman). They're seen as more valuable property (less wear, I guess, as gross as the whole notion is), and there is less cause for jealousy. The fragile male ego of a young adult male is not challenged."

To clarify we aren't controlling or taking possessiveness to any extreme; we are completely fine with each other being friends with whoever we want, hanging out or going out to bars/clubs and other places separately. We are just both uncomfortable with the thought of the other being with someone else, to the point where we basically have no discussion of past relationships and don't even talk about other people we think are attractive (including movie/tv stars).

It comes out of very illiberal ideas about what is owed to the community (i. e., you aren't the ultimate owner of your body and thus selfishness and hedonism is theft from the community).

Religious people look down on promiscuous people because, according to most religions, sex is supposed to happen only after marriage, and with one person for your whole life. (Something I personally find impractical and unhealthy.) Even with non-monotheistic religions, your body is typically a 'temple' and should be respected as such- meaning you shouldn't eat unhealthy things, drink, do drugs at all, and have sex with people you aren't 100% sure are safe and respectful.  We still live in a very Puritanical society. Most American's are some sort of Christian denomination. And even if they aren't, their opinions are colored by the majority of people around them.

Still, thanks to Puritans settling successfully in America first, the country was founded by men raised as Christians. Also, with regards to big P Puritans, celebrating sex within the bounds of marriage is precisely one of the legacies of guilt to which I am referring. OP's question is Why are people who are sexually promiscuous looked down upon in American society? Your comment about Puritans promoting sex within the marriage proves that they were one of the earliest settlers who cast a judgment on promiscuity. They may not have prized virginity over marriage, but they expected people to wait until marriage and have but one sex partner for life, or more if they were remarried after being widowed or divorced, but that is not what promiscuity means. Promiscuity means having multiple sex partners at your discretion. Since bigamy is illegal, that would have to occur before or outside of your marriage."
SRSDiscussion,3augxv,Chalools,3,Thu Jun 25 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"The same could be said of catholics (who beat the puritans to America) and the many English settlers who followed more conventional anglican beliefs.

What he does not touch on is how to break the mold of a people who hate another people. Once again, I forget my sources, but a way to break down this hatred is to have the opposing sides bond in some way.  When looking at the Rwanda genocide, for instance, the hatred became so intense that one side began to dehumanize the other. When this happens, it makes it much easier to kill, as one does not believe the other can do things such as love or hope.  Finally, regarding his latest blog, I believe he hit the nail on the head. The compassion has to go both ways though... There are always going to be people on either side of the spectrum with the ""fuk you ur wrong"" argument. When it comes to them, do your best to try and let them see the way. Appeal to some common moral ground as much as possible, but do not be discouraged or fight on their terms.

The USSR, a nation founded on the principles of Marxism-Leninism was a totalitarian dictatorship up until its death. If you want to talk about eliminating materialism from society you are going to have to redo a couple things from the bottom up, and I'm not sure many people are going to go along with it.   First, I would say to ditch the Marxist tag. It's a 19th century concept that works in small communities, but fails when you give people power. Second, I need you to convince me that there is a better alternative than a physical reward for hard work. If I work hard, for example with a simple 9-5 job as an accountant, and I can provide for my family, have my own house and car, and splurge a little bit, then why should I feel sad. I believe the saying goes, ""Money can't buy you happiness"". I agree with this statement, but I'd rather cry in a house than in a high-rise apartment where I don't know my neighbor, and cannot be proud of my abode.  With Marxism, there are two ideas I have problems with. The first is the very concept of ""from each according to his ability, to each according to their need."" I feel that socialism is a fine alternative to this concept, and has worked out for many countries. The second aspect I have a problem with is the idea of transitioning into utopia.

Secondly Marxists are not utopian, in fact Marxism arose in opposition to the utopianism of the socialist movement of the early 19th century. Thirdly 'physical rewards' for most people in a capitalist society is reduced to the minimum of base necessities, thinking that capitalism gives all people rewards like your own house and car is a reflection of your own privilege in our capitalist society.

Meanwhile, after Elliot Rodger slaughtered a bunch of people and published an anti-women manifesto using the same misogynistic rhetoric echoed on TRP, by MRAs, etc, it took ages for the news to even hit the front page (I remember this because I was somehow surprised by how long it took) and was almost immediately brushed off in the aftermath.   I also think the Charleston atrocity is different because I do not believe it was some mentally ill loose cannon. This was a premeditated and political act committed in cold blood and 100% due to racism. Trying to sweep that under the rug is just Redditors not wanting to discuss anything that puts white men in a bad light or forces them to confront anti-black racism and white privilege in this country."

We do NOT put suicides in the news. Why? Because it will encourage imitations. So why do we put murderers in the news when it's not relevant to anyone outside of that community?    The media is selling terrorism and we're only getting rich in consequences. There's no great fight for gun control, or social reform, or outreach, there's just romancing mass murderers."

Downvote and report ad nauseum, but many big subreddits don't even have rules against racism.

I do feel that strongly. I'm the summer minister for my congregation. On Thursday I sent out an e-mail blast asking members to join me at the memorial service at the local AME church. I expected 12 people. 40 showed up.  I have to preach tomorrow. Instead of talking about the solstice and father's day, I have to talk about tragedy, loss and feeling powerless. I have to give them hope that the world will be a better place and its up to them to do it.  and I get 15 minutes of talk time to do so.  Am I doing something about it? Have I been pushing my congregation to go out into the city and get to know people of color instead of just talking about them in terms of ""others""? Have I been going out into those areas to talk with people? To mentor at the inner city school? Yes. Yes I have. I literally practice what I preach.  And sometimes I get heartsick because the world is big and evil sometimes gets a point in the game of life. So sometimes I just want to bitch. Here I am.  So, you tell me not to lose faith in this community due to a few ""dozen"" who are stirring up the pot. I will admit that in some of the more obscure subreddits there is some great community. But judging by the number of subscribers in Coontown (15K), GreatApes (4.8K) and WhiteRights (5K) I think there is more than a few dozen (or a few thousand) people stirring up the pot.   This reason this hurts is that the majority of Redditors are under 30. This is supposed to be the future generation and if they are more racist than the generation before, humanity is in big trouble. Having racist thoughts go unchallenged causes them to deepen. Having them confirmed by others makes them deepen twice as much. I fear that in 20 years the divide will be so great that it will take a major incident to come back from it. That it will take another civil war.  So there you have it.

Furthermore, even if this was a plausible solution, it would be impossible to implement without some smaller steps being achieved."

That, not only did we fail as our own nation, we managed to come back from a ravaged series of battlefields into an important and prosperous part of this country.   I'm on mobile and rambling, but the point is, in southern education, and living, and being raised in the south, very few of us are taught to associate racism with that flag.   The ones that are taught that are the LOUD, IGNORANT MINORITY.   It's the same with every hate group. The ignorant minority is generally the more extreme and vocal.

Sometimes white people in the south have to figure out that ""Wait, even though I want this to symbolize my gritty awesomeness/old-fashioned values/affinity with nature (whatever the positive idea of Southern-ness is), it really represents hate and oppression.""   The other point is that when you live in a place and someone who doesn't live in that place gets all mad and tells you to stop doing something, that's not an easy sell for many mainstream people. The human tendency to be like, ""Fuck you, you can't tell me what to do,"" comes into play. Not justifying it, but being told what to do in a condemning way is going to piss people off. Just the way people are.  edit: I'll tack on, kind of randomly, that it sort of extends to the whole anti-SJW online thing, etc. We all know what the perception of your typical white southern guy is (probably depends on class). I'm a white southern guy. But the stereotype of white non-southerners who protest the flag is that they're trust fund babies who have weird haircuts and shout on soapboxes merely for attention. The issue is that where the moderate white southerner may (or may not) be more sympathetic to the political cause than you might think, they find the ""all talk"" nature of the protester to be annoying, and defensiveness takes over.

That's a really good way of looking at that. It seems like in the context of looking at gender identity as ""biological"", the context is something that someone is born as. That somehow there are these very different brains men and women have and it causes differences like gender identity."
SRSDiscussion,3aebgl,ViolenceIsTerrible,3,Fri Jun 19 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"I formerly identified as various non-binary gender identities before a transwoman. Actually I spent the most time when I discovered gender identity saying I don't have one. Which meant that I said I was agender, or just that I don't have a gender identity. Gender has always been a journey for me of confusion and unhappiness with gender in general.  This helped me empathize with gender critical feminists. Or sometimes called gender abolitionists or maybe even post-genderists or other gender critical things that have often been popular in or a part of Radical Feminism. Even many trans exclusive feminists, though I also always found their transphobia and separatism and intolerance very bothering and not okay. Even if they thought that gender identity wasn't a thing any more so than racial identity, that didn't make it okay to dehumanize transpeople the way many did. And to support discrimination against transpeople.  As someone who wasn't comfortable with gender and being born into society where gender seemed so important. Gender felt more than just something like ""I'm a girl not a boy, and I feel dysphoric"". But almost as if gender and the world of gender hurt.  So I deeply understand and empathized with, and gravitated towards what many TERFs were saying. Even though I was assigned male at birth and many of these women were separatist feminists who wouldn't want anything to do with me, even if I identified as a girl. Who would hold onto their assignment at birth and their reproductive organs as a deeply important part of their identity to exclude me or people like me. What they said about gender deeply resonated with me.  Feeling agender can come with a deep feeling of alienation from gender and society. Being horrified by gender. Wondering why everyone has a gender and why they would want a gender. Why gender is this tangible thing that matters. Wondering if it's all a miscommunication and there's just something you don't get. Being called a special snowflake or other degrading terms when you come out as agender. Being told your feelings aren't real, aren't anything like dysphoria, and trivialize transpeople and their gender neurodiversity. Feeling self-doubt. I would be surprised if other people who have identified or a-identified as agender never felt the same way. But I know everyone is different and I haven't had that many agender people to talk to.  When you feel agender, it might be hard to relate to people who have gender. To get it and understand gender. Gender has always just felt like a tragedy to me since I was a small child. The journey of gender for me has been trying to understand and live in a world where gender is seen as a biological reality. Trying to empathize with gender identity, trying to change myself to be more tolerant. Even fearing gender, I knew that gender identity mattered to people, and I at least had to be empathetic and accepting. And that I couldn't let my fear and discomfort with gender let me be transphobic.  I remember when I was a child, I wanted to be a pretty girl. And I didn't know I could be. But part of that felt like the autogynephilia that many TERFs talk about today. It felt more like I wanted to be who I was attracted to, so I could look in the mirror and see someone I was attracted to. I thought it meant I wanted a girlfriend.  Instead, of wanting to run away from being a boy. I just wanted to run away from gender and the world of gender. And Gender Critical Radical Feminism really spoke to my experiences of wanting to run away from gender.  I personally don't like the pink brain and blue brain thing. And that feels like an understatement. I think that the markers for being transgender and the brain could just be brain plasticity and the way people are raised. I really don't care, and if I had to have such markers, maybe I wouldn't be a real woman. I'm terrified by the idea of my brain having a gender, I start to feel a sick feeling deep in the pit of my stomach just talking about it. If I'm not a woman because I don't have the wrong brain, then I'm totally lost in terms of gender. I don't know who to be or who I can be. I've finally grown attached to the idea of being a woman after so many years of many genderqueer identities. But maybe I just identified as a girl being I'm attracted to women. Maybe I just identify as a woman because people told me I could. Maybe this was just my way of dealing with a world where gender appears to exist, when people have told me it exists my whole life and all of the things that come with it.  I would like to think that you don't need some awful biological things and ideas and justifications for gender identity to be an okay thing. That you don't need a ""scientific"" basis for non-binary gender identity or any gender identity. But with the way people are talking about biology and why it makes gender identity a legitimate thing, and why other identities aren't legitimate because they aren't biological, it really makes me wonder. It brings back the feeling I've had for so many years, of just wanting to run away.   I'm still terrified of gender. I don't know how that relates to me being a transwoman. But I'm still terrified of gender. And a part of me still feels like running, far far away. And I don't know what it means, all I know is that people have been telling me that gender is not a social construct, it's biological, and it makes me feel sick somewhere deep within my psychology. I wish I could tell you about my gender identity and justify it, or why it makes sense. But I've always been lost."

It can be helpful for people who are coming into a nonbinary identity to know that there is some known biological basis for it, and it can be useful for explaining nonbinary genders to intolerant and/or uninitiated people. However, gender is really personal and I'm of the opinion that we shouldn't be defending nonconforming genders with science, but rather with a 'mind your own business' kind of mindset.

SRSDiscussion,3aebgl,lecih,2,Fri Jun 19 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"Since you asked about biology, I'll assume you're talking about purely material causes for things. Suppose the cause of male identity in the mind is a set of quantities of specific chemicals M acting on the brain, and the cause of female identity is a different set of quantities of specific chemicals F acting on the brain. There's clear reason to believe the quantities allowed in M might vary over a spectrum, and the same is true for F, however if we allow this variation on a material level we're implicitly describing a system which does not exist on a binary, but rather exists on a wide range of quantities and materials. The chemical/material environment of someone's brain is constantly changing and there's good reason to believe that it's possible for the range of materials and quantities in some particular individual's brain to be different from the standard ranges M and F.  However, I think this is really a red herring. When we say something is a basis for something else, we're saying that it is the primary justification for such a thing to exist, and if the basis is not present, under that system it would throw doubt into the legitimacy of the person's identity. I don't see any reason why we should want a world like that. It's fine to investigate things in scientific ways but there's a clear and very serious problem when we use these investigations to establish behavioral norms. (not to say you're doing this, but it should be obvious that this happens if you've ever read a discussion on gender identity)"

SRSDiscussion,3aebgl,electricmink,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:14:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this helps, but here is something to consider:  nothing in biology is simple, and sexual development (both mental and physical) is no exception.  Every embryo starts developing as female by default, with hormonal signalling kicking in at certain stages of development to steer it toward male (if that's where its chromosomes tell it it should be heading);  anything that interferes with the signals involved will affect the final outcome.....and there are plenty of things that can do just that.  Androgen insensitivity?  You get women with XY chromosomes.  Chimerism - two embryos fused into one (more common than you may think) - that send mixed signals?  One of the many ways you get physically sexually ambiguous or hermaphroditic people.  And so it goes....  Just by the messy way biology works, and the fact that every individual contains the ""recipe"" for either of the two most common genders, leads to a very expected result:  if you graph how individuals across a population physically develop gender-wise, with female at one end and male at the other, you're going to get two overlapping bell curves that peak over those two genders, but connected by a valley of less common cases that are difficult-to-impossible to classify on that binary....and that's just the physical manifestation of sex.  The mental development, the gendering of the brain?  It's even more complex than popping out genitals of one form versus another, and it's going to be even more blurred across the binary as a result.  And because it is only partially influenced by that physical sexual development, it's going to often result in brains that don't match the bodies they wind up in.  Quite simply put - these differences are inherent to the way biology works, and they are going to manifest in a whole lot of people that absolutely cannot be shoe-horned into a simplistic binary framework in any meaningful way.  The majority may land nicely into two big piles, but there are always going to be millions who fall somewhere other than the two primary peaks."

However, I think that in the US, I fall more into the anti gun control camp, in that I think that so called ""assault weapons"" (which isn't a technical term, it usually just means, ""a gun that's painted black and looks like something a soldier might use"") should be legal.  By and large, I agree that we could probably prevent some deaths in the US by banning more kinds of guns and certain types of ammunition and magazines, but we could also prevent a lot of deaths by banning liquor (just like Australia has few gun deaths, Saudi Arabia has very few drunk driving deaths), but I don't think we should do that. Booze provides a lot of enjoyment to a lot of people, and yeah, we're all a little less safe for it, but that's a risk that we, as a society have decided is worth it.  Guns (and especially semi-automatic long guns, which are what gun control advocates often target) in the US kill fewer people each year than drunk driving, yet, in my estimation cause a similar amount of fun, so if I think it's a good trade in safety for fun to allow booze, I think it's a good trade in safety to allow semi automatic rifles.   Given how few people guns such as the AR-15 kill each year relative to handguns, it's absurd how stringently they're targeted for restriction. If I wanted there to be stronger controls on alcohol to prevent drunk driving deaths, I would absolutely not be going after the craft beers first, since those aren't what's doing the much of the killing. This is my main problem with the gun control camp - they consistently try to ban the sorts of guns that kill very few people each year, but lots of people love. They would have us make the worst trades in terms of safety vs. fun."

You say the AR-15 and guns like it are heavily restricted but also talk about how few people they kill compared to handguns.  You also talk about how howitzers are heavily restricted and should remain that way.  But howitzers don't exactly kill a lot of people in the States either I'd imagine.  Might they both not kill very many people for the same sort of reason - the fact that they're harder to come across than handguns thanks to regulations?  I mean howitzers are a lot more unwieldy than handguns too, so even if there were no restrictions I don't know that they would be killing a whole lot of people relative to handguns, but I also don't think a lot of people would say that justifies them being easy to get access to.  There's probably an answer to this but like I said, I don't know much about guns/gun policy, so I figured I'd ask."
SRSDiscussion,3acfxe,dothoggin,4,Thu Jun 25 09:38:23 2015 UTC,"You say the AR-15 and guns like it are heavily restricted but also talk about how few people they kill compared to handguns.    I was mostly saying that the AR-15 and guns like it are targeted the most by gun-control advocates for restriction, but, as of now, it is relatively easy to buy ""assault weapons"".  The AR-15 and other ""assault weapons"" were  banned (except with ultra-special permits) in 1994 under the assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004) it is now relatively easy to buy them (at the federal level, certain states have further restrictions). They killed few people prior to the ban, and kill few people after the ban. I understand your reasoning, legalizing howitzers probably would kill lots of people and I can't lean on the ""but they don't kill many now"" since the reason they don't kill many now may have to do with how heavily they're restricted.  But in the case of the AR-15, we've seen the worlds in which it's all but banned, and the world in which it isn't. In both cases it kills few.  Your point is completely reasonable, I should have spelled out the assault weapons ban timeline."

The benefits to the environment of hunting and the connection hunters forge with their land is real.  Long guns also give us the insane sport of Biathlon, which is just awesome to watch. Other target/long-distance shooting events are fun as heck too.  Ranchers also have a legitimate use for rifles in protecting their crops from pests like coyotes.  That's pretty much it, though. Semi-auto rifles and all handguns serve no purpose but to kill other humans, and have no place in a civilized society."

We could draw an analogy with booze. The only reason to have booze is entertainment, and society is certainly a lot more dangerous thanks to our legalization of it (look at how few people are killed in Saudi Arabia due to drunk driving), but we as a society have decided that the slight risk of death in booze related incidents is worth the entertainment value that they give. Why not the same for semi-automatic rifles? They kill fewer people each year yet provide a ton of entertainment."
SRSDiscussion,3acfxe,model_railroad_alt,8,Fri Jun 19 23:14:13 2015 UTC,"I can agree about handguns, but semi-auto rifles absolutely serve a purpose. For one, if you're hunting coyotes, nothing does that better than an AR-15. Also, assault rifles are the best if one of your hobbies is target shooting or plinking. You can go to the range and shoot hundreds of rounds without your shoulder getting sore. Also, only a tiny percentage of gun murders were committed with assault rifles. Banning them does very little to solve the problem. Maybe regulate them a bit more to keep them away from the mentally ill, but banning them outright is silly"

Let's say you're hunting for deer, and all of the sudden a bear appears and you need to defend your life. The rifle you brought likely won't have enough firepower to take it down or eliminate the threat, and chances are you aren't carrying two rifles on you. You need a powerful handgun in order to have enough firepower to kill or, at the very least, hurt it enough to eliminate the threat.  That's pretty much the only legal use for them though (other than self defense and target practice) which is why they're so heavily regulated. Other than that, that video is pretty spot on"

By banning guns you would only serve to limit law-abiding citizens in what they can use, since criminals would just obtain them illegally or use other weapons - and that most attempts to control them are just knee-jerk reactions to prevent mass shootings, overall crime rates are not reduced."
SRSDiscussion,3acfxe,AngryFuckingDrunk,4,Fri Jun 19 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately they aren't very useful for self defense. Guns actually make people more at risk of being shot. For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides.  A 2013 study found that women purchasing guns are more likely to be shot by them than to shoot any attacker, and 61% of female homicide perpetrators are known to the victim. When a gun is present in the home, the risk of homicide for women is increased three times  Carrying a gun makes you 4.5 times more likely to be shot.  I don't really have a problem with guns, but these myths need to be fought. Keep guns for fun and food, not self defense. They simply don't work well for those purposes."

People just think ""oh I can't imagine why anybody would want to do that so they must be mentally ill"" but these suspicions are rarely backed up by a diagnosis. Statements like that contribute to mental health stigma. Mental illness is a scapegoat because it's much less controversial to say ""mental illness made him do it"" than ""white supremacy made him do it"". And mentally ill people are more frequently the victims of violence than the perpetrators of it. So if we're going to have a second amendment at all, mentally ill people should be as entitled to possess firearms as everybody else.    99% of gun owners are everyday law abiding citizens.

If you ban guns, then only the government has guns (and criminals) which they can use to easier oppress the citizenry.  That's my main point. Another more minor point is that even if you ban guns, criminals will still have them. And the average, law abiding citizen, will not be able to defend themselves as well from these gun using criminals.  I don't oppose background checks and the like however.   I would be less inclined to oppose gun control if the government completely removed illegal guns from the hands of criminals and took steps to prevent guns from reaching criminals illegally.

Could you not refuse to work for any employer unless they agreed to enable you to avoid being taxed on the income they were paying you?  If you would be taxed at 20%, but you don't consent to taxation, what's the difference if you tell your potential employer, ""I do not consent to being taxed,"" and they say, ""Okay, well that makes my life a pain, and also I believe people have a moral obligation to pay taxes, so that decreases the wage I'm willing to pay you by 20%, will you accept the job at 80% of my previous offer under the table?"" and then you accept the new offer and they send the 20% difference to the IRS. Can you logically say, then, that you are being taxed without your consent? I really don't think you can - you are just voluntarily accepting a wage that is 80% of what it would be if you did consent to taxation, but there's no intrinsic right to be paid the same amount whether or not you consent to taxation, so there's really nothing coercive about that arrangement."

What we have isn't.   I largely agree with you, I just wanted to point out that having a leader or leaders, even if they are selected unanimously by every single member of a community, still constitutes a hierarchy - hierarchies are just a naturally occurring pattern of topological organization, whether it's organization of society or of information.  The central distinction, I think, is the one you make about top-down vs bottom-up organization, whether the hierarchy is imposed, by rules/structure/violence, or emergent, through each individual element naturally/voluntarily being drawn to the position it ""best"" occupies in the hierarchy."

It also disagrees with you about hierarchies:   “Chimpanzees live in quite aggressive, male-dominated societies with clear hierarchies,” he said. “As a result, they just don’t see enough adults in their lifetime for technologies to be sustained.”   I'm not assuming sexism and racism are normal, that's just what history shows.

It's the same reason why early suffragettes absolutely never pushed for gay rights, regardless of their personal opinions. If an advocate for gender fluidity starting talking about race fluidity too honestly, then the mainstream backlash would threaten both movements.  Why do I bring this up? Because it's important to remember that the taboo regarding certain social activist topics exists for Machiavellian rather than moral reasons. We fight for same-sex marriage not because marriage is a perfect institution, but because marriage abolition is a fringe issue the public will not yet support. It's true that people make these wild comparisons for regressive reasons, to show how wacky and unreasonable the LGBT activists are. But idealists might use the comparisons for progressive reasons, to show that there are still societal problems left to solve.  We do not know what the future holds.

I've made a couple of other comments in this thread, but I've always deliberately avoided making a judgement call on whether transracial identities are socially acceptable - at the moment I really think it's besides the point. I do think at the moment we have no evidence that it is common - I have yet to see many genuine claims at being transracial, just hypothetical ""gotcha"" type arguments against trans people.  What I am completely astounded at are the number of people who think that transracial is in any way similar to being transgender. What dismays me is people who think that using transracial as an analogy for being transgender should be given the time of day. I find it utterly bizzare that the discussions on being transracial automatically include discussions on being transgender. They are not the same thing. Not even close.  Racial identity has no biological basis. Gender identity does. End of story (albeit an extremely complex story). We can discuss them separately, but comparing them encourages some really harmful misinformation that throws transgender people under the bus. I am 100% not in favour of that, ever. So, no we shouldn't compare them - at least not in this context."

If you don't want to have to deal with that discussion and that comparison, that's an option for you if you're cis. You can look at the comparison and say ""whatever it's blackface not worth discussing.""  Trans feminine people don't have that option. Trans feminine people are told by TERFs all the time that they're doing ""female blackface"" and that they're ""appropriating women's bodies"" and are just ""delusional men"" and that they're just trying to access spaces that are only for ""real women"" etc etc etc. Trans feminine people have to deal with being questioned about Rachel Dolezal as well and for us it's an attack on the core of our beings. We don't get to not deal with this comparison; we don't get to ignore it and just go ""oh racist white lady whatever."" We have to read a bunch of articles and language that looks identical to TERF language--and if you can't actually explain why it's not the same, in a way that doesn't mirror other TERF language, it doesn't make us (or at least me for one) feel any better about the validity of my identity.  I understand trans people finding the comparison insulting--my gut emotional reaction is the same. But this ""I can't believe you're even talking about it how could you!"" thing is bullshit."

I've noticed as well that a lot of the things because said are the exact same thing that trans-exclusionary feminists say. And it gives me, well, a lot of strange feelings. And as much as I want to feel confident that it's totally different. It hits close to home in a lot of ways and I feel a lot of doubt. I'm reading a lot to do with this, um, controversy that has been made popular the last few days. And people saying the very same things about race that I've been reading from TERFs in relation to gender for years with such confidence.   And I wish I could say I have that same confidence and certainty about how things are totally different. But instead I feel shaken. And perhaps I completely misunderstand matter of race. But I feel like I couldn't repeat those things in earnesty and honesty without it feeling like a justification or going along with what other people say because it's the popular thing to say. And I really don't want to say things I don't believe in or things that I have doubts about because they're popular and a lot of people support them. It seems dishonest and not earnest.  I've felt gender confused and the society and realities of gender it tries to press upon me have left me feeling stressed and confused for years. I've gone from feeling like I had no choice in being a boy, to identifying as agender and many genderqueer identities, to identifying as a transwoman. People telling me transwomen have female brains and that if I've ""been a woman all along"" since I was born doesn't actually make me feel better at all. Nor do all of the people saying neurosexist things and gender stereotypes to justify my gender identity.  And while I think that Rachel Dolezal has said and done many wrong things. The fact that so many people are saying so many of the dozens or maybe even thousands of things about Rachel that TERFs have said about my and transgender people's gender identities for years, leaves me feeling so very confused."

SRSDiscussion,3a6at2,AngryFuckingDrunk,5,Wed Jun 17 21:34:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should try.  I think about it like this... i have no experience of trans anything.  Transsexual doesn't impact me, you say it impacts you.  Who am i to say your experience and feelings have no legitimacy?  You want to be treated with dignity and kindness and respect.  I think everyone deserves that.  You want to be identifed as female (or male, as the case may be), i can accept that and i genuinely hope you find the happiness and peace you seek and i am quite happy to treat you as a female.  Does that mean i really believe deep down that you are really one gender trapped in another?  Truthfully, from my perspective (white, cis, hetero, male, upper middle class - priviledge oozes from my every pore), it is hard for me to go that far - maybe that is as far as my empathy can take me - but i do honestly believe i am not qualified to have an opinion, not hurt by the idea, and that you deserve to be happy, deserve to have full charge of your own body, and deserve to be treated with decency, and frankly i cannot see anyone you are hurting, or any way you are benefitting unfairly, so i defer to your assertion. It is all good.  On transracial, again, i have no experience of it, no reason to assert it is true or false - but it does benefit this specifIc woman, in this circumstance, so i am a little skeptical.  Like every cis hetero white male, in younger days i had opinions i now would be ashamed to express, as they were not tempered with humility - so, i see this unfamiliar thing - transrace - and i reserve judgement because i dont know it is false.  That does not mean i buy it.  I just think we should let this woman and the NAACP work it out.  I am not entitled to an opinion.  Maybe you are - as a transgender, you certainly have a different perspective than me.  I think of it like the gendered bathrooms issue.  Should a transgendered male (i apologize if i get the definitions wrong, i mean someone born with female genetalia who identifies as male) use the men's room.  My answer: if he wants to, yes.  Should a transgender female use the lady's room?  My answer: i think so, yes, but let the ladies debate that - she's welcome in the men's room, and i would be unimpressed by a woman who said no - but that is easy for me to say, as i don't ever fear for my safety in a restroom (never).  Similarly, is a transrace person who identifies as black , black?  Ask the black community.  I don't define black - i don't really know what it is to be black, no one wants to hear my opinion on who is black, anymore than they want to hear my opinion on who is a real man, or who should use the lady's room.  This does not mean i view the two issues as equal - i see a person benefiting dishonestly from her transrace, while I cannot even fathom how a person could benefit from transexuality (aside from the emotional issues). So i am a lot more hesitant to embrace transrace as a thing - i just dont think anything good can come from a cis white hetero middle class male getting prissy about some one else's life choices.  I think you should take the fact that people like me are hestitant to judge as a good thing - a world where people's assertions about their inner identity is not subject to mainstream society's self-righteous judgement has got to be better than the alternative, even if it does mean some BS slips through unchallenged.    TL;DR - i cannot prove it has no legitimacy.  I dont think i should try. I can understand why you might have a concern with it, I am not naive or stupid, but i don't think people like myself should indulge judgemental impulses."

SRSDiscussion,3a6at2,praxulus,5,Wed Jun 17 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"No, because trans women have been around in some form since forever. Gender has always been fluid to a degree. Race has barely existed for a few centuries, and in that time, has mostly just been used to excuse the exploitation of nonwhite people by white people. So a white person claiming to be nonwhite is a very dubious claim since this is something decided by your ancestry, your upbringing, and your life experience, not by how you feel about yourself personally (like gender). I'm not about to support a ""minority group"" that is based around being blatantly racist and appropriative. This is a case of people trying to be ""open minded"", and in turn just giving racist vultures the benefit of the doubt."

It was not always like it is today, of course, but people have always divided themselves in ethnic groups/identities defined along multiple, fluid criteria. We do not have a clear idea of what defines race: we do not have definite criteria based on any of the dimensions you mentioned. We cannot decide on a certain percentage of African ancestry, a certain kind of upbringing and a certain number of life experiences that would define a person as 'black'. If we tried to do that, we would end up excluding many people who are legitimately black. So, yes, it seems to depend a lot on how you feel about yourself and on how your particular community sees you. Such that a person may be perceived as black in some places and as non-black in others - it happens with me - and still be the same person. And all this fluidity looks a lot like gender!  So indeed we need an argument showing why we should rely on self-identification in the case of transgender people and not in the case of so-called 'transracial' people."

SRSDiscussion,3a6at2,TrillhouseVanCountin,2,Thu Jun 18 00:05:54 2015 UTC,"I think that race might mean different things in different context. Black is considered a race in America, but there is no one shared black experience or culture. And there are many different ancestries to being black or white or Asian. As well as cultures.  In some cases, race is more related to appearance, like skin color. An in some cases more related to culture. In some contexts of race, and perhaps I don't understand racial matters well enough, it seems like one might in some sense be that race by passing as them in a long term. This wouldn't just be white people, but people of color as well. An Asian person could also pass as black. A black person could pass as Asian. And an Asian person could pass as white. And such.  People of different skin colors don't necessarily have different upbringings. There is certainly oppression and privilege in the way that society treats people. But this certainly seems like evidence of how complicated and multifaceted race is when things like ancestry, skin color and other parts of appearance,  upbringing and culture, all play parts in it.  I think that, in some cases it would seem, what people mean by race isn't ancestry or culture, but appearance. Certainly not all Asian Americans for instance, are Asian culturally. And forgive me if this is an ignorant statement, but perhaps for some Asian Americans for instance, one of the major things that makes them feel Asian, or seen and treated as Asian, is their appearance. As they do not have any connection to an Asian upbringing or culture. Is perhaps this is wholly ignorant and not the case.  I've at least read articles from Asian Americans who have said that, they do not feel Asian culturally, but American. And no less American culturally than any white family. But that the Asian American experience for them, as an identity, is being other, exotified, and treated as other and not American because of their appearance. That their appearance seems ""foreign"" to Americans, and thus they're considered Asian and excluded from Americanness as defined by whiteness and white privilege."

I'm not going to make excuses for Dolezal, but I really don't understand enough about Dolezal to say which things she did were clearly good and from good intentions, and which were clearly bad and from bad intentions.  And Dolezal isn't the only person who has brought up or is bringing up this idea of being ""transracial"" or whatever better word there might be for such a thing. There's also people like Xiahn and many others. Dolezal is just one person to talk about here in relation to this issue. And I'm sure there will be many cases of people in the future making an effort to pass as another race, whether that race be oppressed or privileged.

And it gives me, well, a lot of strange feelings. And as much as I want to feel confident that it's totally different. It hits close to home in a lot of ways and I feel a lot of doubt.   I don't know if it will make you feel better, but unless anyone can offer a biological mechanism that could give rise to a racial identity then we cannot consider race an analogy to gender. A developing foetus does not develop its race, but it would develop a sex and gender.  Gender identity has a real biological basis, and is probably going to remain consistent regardless of the society/culture/environment you grow up in. Before anyone who jumps in here to say that gender is a social construct, I'd like to point out that Gender roles and gender expression are social constructs, not gender identity (at least, mostly).  Racial identity on the other hand, is purely socially constructed - it is a result of how races are treated differently. In a true egalitarian society, we probably wouldn't have racial identity - or at least, it would be very different.  As far as I can see, transracial is only brought up as a hypothetical bullshit scenario by transphobes. As an argument against trans people it's entirely irrelevant, and I rate it on the same level as the ""you have to share my experiences to belong to my group"" argument, which is to say zero."

I don't know where my feelings have come from, and the desire see myself as genderqueer or a transwoman.   And I feel like that some people who are making the comparison, are not saying that there's something biological about racial identity. But perhaps challenging notions about biological gender.  In a world without gender socially, I'm not sure that I would have a gender identity. I'm not sure where my gender identity comes from. Maybe I'm not a real transwoman."

As a transgender woman, I feel the exact opposite. The very fact this comparison is being drawn is heavily down to cis people misunderstanding what being transgender is. Honestly disgusts me and feels greatly triggering for this comparison to be being made. All my life TERFs have told me I'm the gender equivalent of blackface. Now I'm being told the same thing on SRSD.  Just because something 'sounds the same as TERF language' doesn't mean it is the same. Race doesn't exist, gender does. That's the fundamental difference, I don't understand why that won't sink in, and its pretty fucked up.  People who are buying into this are buying into a racist, essentialist, transmisogynistic myth. They severely need to reconsider the actual history and science behind race and gender, and understand the origins of where transgender people come from and how we form. Being transgender is not a trivial decision, nor is it down to perception or opportunism. It is a biological status similar to being intersex that occurs in the womb. Being transracial is ridiculous, because race is about perception and cultural background, not biology. People who blindly and ignorantly continue to make this comparison are playing exactly into the hands of the reactionaries who fight against transgender people, and they really need to stop.  Just because it sounds like TERF shit doesn't mean its TERF shit. Wanna know what TERFs think about this? Guess what? They think its exactly the same. They think 'transracial' people have the same validity as transgender people. They're using it to undermine trans people. So the real TERF language is agreeing with this bullshit."

IMO asserting that the only thing that makes trans people ""OK"" is because it's a medical condition is playing into medical gender essentialism and cisnormativity and refusing to discuss this because what if the bigots overhear us  is ceding control of trans narratives to transphobes."

There are a lot of things that TERFs do are wrong and transphobic, but do you think that gender denialism is among them?  Is the claim that race isn't real, but gender is, the major reason why these two things are different and one is offensive and one is legitimate?  Being a TERF is not allowed on SRS. And being transphobic is certainly wrong. But I feel that many TERFs would take exception to the claims you're making about biological gender. Many ciswomen feel that the only thing that makes them women is their vaginas, and the way that society has treated them because of having vaginas. And don't personally feel that they have female brains, and would take offense to being told that they do. I'm not saying that males are men and females or women, and that TERFs are okay for excluding people based on reproductive organs. But if this is how many ciswomen feel, I don't see how that's wrong, either. For some women, the only thing that makes them women or feel like women is their vaginas, and the oppression associated with that. And if that's how they feel, I think that's okay, too.  I certainly don't want to take away or detract from your gender identity. Or be offensive or transphobic. But sometimes it feels almost as if there are certain biotruths about gender not to be questioned.  The legitimacy of trans-identity doesn't rely on claims about biology like this, do they?"

So I guess I think it's an okay discussion to have, provided that you actually have any idea what you're talking about? That you understand transness at at least the basic level that transfolk are forced to to survive, that you make the effort to learn basic language and also understand how often the topic's used to attack transfems, as opposed to actually being in good faith? For cis people, it's a curiosity; for me, it's painful. And I'd really rather not be the only trans person, as well as the only person with any idea what they're talking about re: transness, in the discussions I've had to have over the past few days any more.

Those TERF arguments are ridiculous because they are not true of trans people and don't make sense in that context, not because those types of arguments are inherently bad.  In the same way as saying ""It doesn't matter what gender you have sex with!"" isn't equivalent by just replacing sex with age, it's also not equivalent to just replace ""race"" with ""gender in these arguments against the concept of identifying as another race.  Why?  Well with pedophilia there is a key difference that underage people can't consent.  And with gender and race, there is a key difference that racial identities are socially constructed, and gender identities are not.  Gender identities are inherent.  And I'm not sure but I feel like a lot of people here maybe just aren't accepting that and maybe believe that I transitioned because of a social construct, and that it would be just as easy to change my mind and label myself another gender and it wouldn't make any difference in the long run (this is obviously ridiculous).  Identifying as another race?  It is like that.  It is something you just choose, it is something that doesn't really mean anything, isn't based on anything inherent, under the concept of racially identifying as another race it is just something you can decide and have no issues or harm based on having to live against your identity.  Because it is socially constructed.  Gender identity is real, for everyone (cis and trans alike), and all of our identities as male/female/non-binary are based on something inherent in us, not just a social construct, and our identities not being recognised causes us actual harm, because it's not just a social construct.  They are not equivalent and just because an argument can be used for ""trans-racial"" people doesn't mean it can be used for transgender people.  tl;dr: When people complain about similar arguments to TERF arguments it makes me think you all don't understand how being transgender is different from this and how the arguments do not work for trans people but do for people like Rachel Dolezal."

I think that people make comparisons for a variety of different reasons. And after having read about the subject, I can see why some people make the comparison. It doesn't appear that pedophilies have any choice in their sexual feelings any more than heterosexuals do. And if that's the case, it would be best if they seek help to deal with their desires rather than acting out on them in a way that hurts others.  People relate not having a choice in your attractions to things like sexual orientation.

There are various studies (there of course does need to be more) that point towards neurological and biological traits of being transgender.  There's also a whole generation of intersex people who underwent surgeries as a kid, were raised as a certain gender and lied to.  Because the belief at the time (and still sometimes today) is that gender identity can be decided, you can raise a kid as a certain gender.  This was based on a now infamous study involving David Reimer.  Originally posed as a success until David Reimer started talking publicly about how it was definitely not.  David was surgically altered as a baby, raised as a girl, as an experiment in an attempt to prove that you can raise someone as any gender you want. It failed drastically.

Many people use transpeople and their identities for their agenda.  And no child should have gender and gender roles forced upon them. Gender policing is wrong. And children should be able to choose who they want to be. Forcing a gender identity on children is forcing gender roles upon them. Children should be allowed to be themselves. And it's wrong for parents to ""raise"" their children, as any gender. Gender is a part of their self expression and parents have no right to choose that for their children. Their own femininity, masculinity, identity, and so forth, is for the children to decide.  None of the cases of those intersex children prove that gender identity is inherent.

Now, anthropologists and sociologists tell you that people's understandings of themselves are absolutely, unequivocally affected by their material circumstances. People are not bears; we exist culturally and are shaped by sociocultural forces. This is not controversial. Thus it seems bizarre to me that gender, if we're not presupposing a biological are metaphysical root, would be something that is formed during a person's life which is completely unaffected and uninformed by every single structure, authority, experience, relationship, etc. in a person's life. That would make gender wholly miraculous in a sociocultural sense.   Now, if we're to accept that gender identity has some cultural input, it becomes clear that we cannot call gender 'inherent'.

If absolutely every difference between the male and female genders is socially constructed, it would make humans unique among the animal kingdom. How long ago do you think our evolutionary ancestors lost this biological difference?  Race is a truly arbitrary categorisation, and humans have divided people up into races differently throughout history. When a person is conceived, the genes of their parents determine their skin colour and so on, and that's just what it is. There isn't a chance to be born asian, a chance to be black and so on. You're always a combination of your parents genes, there is no 'potential' to be anything else.   Furthermore, even species don't actually exist in nature, they're just a handy way humans use to categorize life. Every animal that ever lived was the same species as its parents, and yet there are many species today. Therefore, there's no more basis to transracial (as something inherent to someone's brain) than there is otherkin.   Whereas with gender, it is related to sex, where there is 'potential' to be either. Hormones determine which one a fetus grows to become, and usually they end up the same. But sometimes they don't, so its totally plausible that you can end up with someone with a female body and male brain, or that neither wins out and the person grows up to identify with neither gender, and so on. There is no equivalent with race, there's no black hormone that a baby with white parents might get too much of.    Often discussed on here is the boy who was raised female after a botched circumcision. Even though he was raised female almost from birth, he never adopted the gender as his own and eventually committed suicide. If there was no biological basis to gender, why would this happen, given that he was raised that way for his entire life?   As a final example, consider an experiment were run where only a group of white males were raised from birth in an environment with no contact with females or people of other races. They don't know females or other races exist. Do you agree we would still expect to find some turn out to be transgender, even if they couldn't put that concept into words themselves? But that we wouldn't expect to find any who were transracial?"

I'm in work involving actuarial pricing so we work with the rating factors that the insurance company obtains from you in order to give you a price.  There's a ton of discussion about what factors are ethical to rate somebody's insurance on. Mind you, rating comes from extensive statistical modelling and data analytics, not stereotypes. Questions in the industry:    Can you rate a policy based on a person's gender? Unmarried women receive noticeable discounts for being in a very risk-averse pool. Trans* people are still lumped in ""male"" or ""female"" not out of discrimination but statistical significance - the model needs specific gender identities, and male/female are the only identifiable samples large enough to model with. The gender identity used in the model is entirely dependent on what gender the policyholder tells their agent (so the insurance company can't go ""You're not REALLY a woman""; it would have to be dealt with at the individual agent level). Are credit scores a valid rating factor? On one hand, credit score is a strong predictor of ability to pay premiums and is also a statistically significant identifier for driving risk. On the other hand, some accuse insurance of using credit score as a proxy for race (since we are not allowed to rate policies based on race). The accusation is untrue; the insurer is only interested in risk behaviors and what factors best predict them. Race is conflated with all kinds of confounding variables (economic status being one of them) so it would be illogical to use, even by objective statistical standards. However, there is the ongoing question on whether credit score is disproportionately affecting people based on race. Health insurance is plagued with all kinds of questions which I won't try to answer because it's not my field. Pre-existing conditions, etc.   Remember that the goal of an insurance provider is to offer someone a price based on the risk they pose to the company. If they are not priced adequately, they are essentially given a discount for their risk behaviors, and everyone else pays the difference, regardless of privilege status. If folks are interested, I can talk more about potential solutions to insurance pricing in order to replace identity with behavior and truly be equitable.  It's a really really interesting field for a social justice mind because we have to look at policies and factors to determine what is ethical."

SRSDiscussion,3a2zjl,Marshawn_Interview,2,Sat Jun 20 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"From a social justice perspective: I ask this question of myself and my coworkers too. No one has a solid definitional difference between race and gender in insurance, that doesn't involve mental gymnastics. So yeah, it is pretty silly that one identity can rate you but another can't.  From a legal perspective: All 50 state departments of insurance forbid race from being used as a rating factor. Actuaries propose factors they'd like to rate policies (age of driver, number of cars, home/auto discount, etc). The state approves/declines the factors they find acceptable. Certain states like Hawaii and Montana have decided that we cannot rate insurance based on gender, but most others allow it. You can read that from two lenses: If you're in favor of equal rating regardless of risk factors, it's great. If you're in favor of equitable rating, it's not great because young women in Hawaii and Montana are paying more for their insurance than they should because their premiums are covering the insurance claims made by risk-welcoming young men. The reason insurance works is because it spreads the cost of high-severity claims across a pool of customers.  From a statistical perspective: As I mentioned in the first post, race is heavily conflated with other variables like location, income, number/value of cars, and more. So it can't be a good determinant of risk because it double counts other factors. So even if it were legal today, insurance wouldn't do it. Gender has far fewer overlaps, but is still not perfect. Data shows that young men are more accident-prone than young women on average. But there are risk averse young men and risky young women, and we have no way of including that factor. I suppose that we could remove gender and get a BETTER predictor of risk by getting some kind of aggression/recklessness index (e.g. having drivers take a knowledge/instinct test to show how risk-prone they are), but that is horribly costly and would be protested by every customer.  The ultimate solution is to rate policies on an individual risk basis that doesn't involve bucketing them in groups. The holy grail of 21st century pricing is telematics which all major insurance companies are pushing toward. But there is still a lot of social debate about the ""Big brother is always watching"" nature of the devices."

SRSDiscussion,3a2zjl,salty-sardines,2,Wed Jun 17 04:00:54 2015 UTC,"It's a necessary institution that has openings for abuse (and evidence of abuse, definitely, as shown in the redlining example). The solution would be a countrywide insurance program with one standard set of premiums for everybody, regardless of need. This is problematic because everyone has different needs (people with low-value cars don't always want collision/comprehensive, for example) and different risks (do people who decline collision insurance have the same risk level as a person who pays for full coverage?).   The goal is to price every individual based on their own risk level, and it would be ideal to do this on an individual basis - but not possible with current technology. So as in every statistical model, people need to be grouped by traits (see: every academic research study, ever).  If you're a country driver in rural Illinois, you're rates shouldn't be as high as residents in accident-heavy Chicago. This is actually the exact basis the company State Farm began (insurance for farmers). But there are plenty of other characteristics that we can research to ensure that your insurance price is the most equitable (""equitable"" here in terms of risk, not income).  I definitely experience a lot of internal conflict working in insurance, but I hope that my social justice mind can help bring some consistent ethical discussion in the industry. Like it or not, the concept of insurance cannot be replaced in this current society. It prevents people from paying massive livelihood-ruining sums on catastrophic events, by replacing it with smaller manageable sums. A standard set of premiums would eliminate the incentive for a driver/homeowner to reduce risk characteristics, because they have a set payment and a set coverage.  There is definitely a level of immorality that can happen in claims (e.g. a claim being denied), but this is a completely different discussion than insurance pricing (which actually sets reserves for claims that are unexpected)."

Tech, and programming in particular, has a poor reputation, but IMHO it's somewhat undeserved.  Like, looking at the numbers with no context, gender representation in programming is overwhelmingly male, indicating large gender diversity issues in the field.  However, if you look at the gender breakdown of those graduating with Comp Sci degrees(~15% women), a necessary requirement for most programming jobs, and compare with the gender representation in the industry, women tend to be over-represented (I think something like 20% of programmers are women).  Also, if you look at pay statistics, and account for position and level of experience, there is no pay gap in programming.  If you only account for level of experience (which is valid, as the pay gap often manifests itself in terms of likelihood of promotion), then there is a pay gap, but it is less than other industries (about 7-10%).  Ultimately, what the tech industry really needs is more women graduating from Comp Sci programs.  It's hard to blame the industry for that.  It's also hard to pinpoint why less women do CS, and how to change this.  My hope would be that the number will increase, and programming jobs become more gender-diverse as a consequence, but I've no idea how long that will take.  In terms of race, Asian people are hugely over-represented, even when looking at the percentage of Asian people graduating with CS degrees.  Other minority races are all under-represented.

I'm Googling, and seeing a variety of stats between 11% and 19% for years between 2010 and 2015.  This says 18.2% for 2011, and this says 18% for 2012, for example.  The article you posted says ""fewer than a fifth"" for 2012.  Earlier, I had a source which said 15% in 2013.  Can't find it now though.  The point, though, is that qualified women do not appear to face hiring discrimination for programming jobs, as the percentage of female CS grads and women in programming jobs appear to be closely correlated.   it's not because women just aren't interested in the field/have some innate characteristics that disadvantage them.   Of course not.    However, if the percentages of female CS grads and programmers who are women are correlated, I would question the idea that the programming profession is uniquely hostile to women, compared to other jobs in other industries.  Perhaps there's some wider manner in which the tech industry dissuades women from pursuing CS which I'm not considering (?), but based on my experience and from what I can tell, the industry isn't super relevant to the choice to pursue CS in the first place.  I think we have deeper problems in society to do with how gender roles are imposed, and how these roles are policed, which are the real root of the disparity we eventually see in programming jobs.   The format of technical interviews, for one. Whiteboard programming is in no way representative of what most programmers are asked to do in their day to day jobs, and yet you're expected to pass this silly test just to be considered. Being rewarded for being able to think out loud and be verbally aggressive is another.   I'm aware that there's a lot of debate in this area, but I disagree that whiteboard coding is silly.  To a certain extent I agree and identify with the being rewarded for thinking out loud (I'm quiet and introverted by nature, and verbalizing deep technical details of something on the spot is something I struggle with), not sure about being verbally aggressive, don't think I've personally encountered that.

Well, I'm kinda talking about programming jobs specifically here, not the wider tech industry...  I have no personal experience or context to do with the non-technical side of tech companies...  I have read the high profile cases over the last few years though.  I've always wondered though, is this a unique problem in the tech industry, or are cases of sexual harassment and gender hostility in the tech industry just reported on much more than other industries.  Because, like, the tech industry is hot right now.  Tech companies receive a huge amount of interest, publicity, and scrutiny, in contrast with companies in almost any other industry.  I'm looking for statistics on sexual harassment by industry and can't find a good source, unfortunately.  Btw, keep in mind that I'm not trying to argue that the programming is this fantastic, non-discriminatory, accepting field.  I just don't feel that the tech industry is uniquely, vastly more hostile to women in contrast with other industries, and that this is the main, or even a large, factor in the small numbers of women pursuing careers in programming.

You mention that you see stats showing that women who enter the industry with CS degrees mirror those who work as programmers. Frankly, I find that an overly simplistic analysis that ignores historical trends and context. For much of the earlier 20th century programming and the computer science fields were way more equitable towards women. It wasn't until ""start ups"" and popular ""tech companies"" became a thing that this trend started going downwards. There were a bunch of articles a while back that showed while women are more welcome now in studying computer science, they still faced hostile work conditions.

I work and mentor girls in tech, so it's where I choose to focus my criticism. You can't just neatly separate how women are socialized and expectations for their behavior in the workplace.

I'm very conscious of this, and I really don't mean to come across as mansplaining here.  I should probably clarify a bit.  The word ""unique"" is central to the point I'm making.  There is an obvious gender disparity problem in programming jobs, and I think it's important to identify what the real root factors which cause this are in order to address it.  There is, of course, hostility to women and sexism in programming jobs.  Thing is, if it's more of a general corporate culture issue, which exists in many industries, then this hostility is not unique to tech, and thus not a core factor in why we have so few women programmers.  Like, google ""sexism in law firms"", ""sexism in the finance industry"", ""sexism in sales jobs"", ""sexism in retail"", etc.  You'll find a whole bunch of articles and reports of sexism in many other professions, many of which have much better gender representation than tech, and many of the complaints are very similar to what you hear about in the tech industry.  Now, you do say this:   I'm not as interested in analyzing this in a complete vacuum where we point at other industries that are worse and go, ""Well it's just a general problem, so let's not focus on tech."" I work and mentor girls in tech, so it's where I choose to focus my criticism.   And I agree.  There's no reason why we shouldn't focus on sexism within tech just because there are other industries with sexism problems, because it's an important issue which needs to be addressed in each industry in which it is prevalent.  However, I think that if all the sexism and gender hostility problems within the tech industry were solved, you wouldn't actually see significantly more women becoming programmers, because, as I said in my earlier post, I don't see these problems as core factors in why more women don't pursue CS and programming jobs in the first place.  And tbh, I don't think these issues can actually be solved unless much more women start to become programmers first.   For much of the earlier 20th century programming and the computer science fields were way more equitable towards women. It wasn't until ""start ups"" and popular ""tech companies"" became a thing that this trend started going downwards.   This isn't really correct.  Startups became a big thing between 1997 and 2001, during the dot-com bubble.  They've had a resurgence in the last few years in the latest tech bubble, and most of the modern big tech companies were born in one of these eras (Apple and Microsoft being the two main exceptions).  However, the number of women graduating with CS degrees began to plummet well before then, in the mid 1980s.  It seems to be the advent of the personal computer which sparked the downward trend of women studying CS.  Before this, computers were abstract, inaccessible entities to most people.  Now, they were becoming common in business personal homes, and importantly, were marketed heavily towards boys and men, as well as a media narrative popping up portraying enthusiasts as almost entirely male (good article on this).  To summarize, I think the modern notoriety of the tech industry for being especially or uniquely sexist and hostile to women is, relatively speaking, undeserved.  This is not to say that it is not sexist or hostile, or that we should ignore these issues and not focus on solving them.  However, I think it's important to not forget that the biggest gender issue in programming jobs is the disparity, and this is a much deeper issue to do with societal perceptions of technology, and the very gendered perception of tech workers, which has been entrenched for the last 30 years (and thankfully, this at least appears to be changing, albeit slowly)."

My company does both, with an oral interview and some whiteboard exercises after successful completion of a written test. It seems to work pretty well.    These aren't just anecdotes. They're just high profile cases that happened to make it to mainstream news.    My point was simply that you can't extrapolate trends about an entire industry from a few high profile cases. If I made the same argument about say, false rape accusations, would you consider it reasonable?   It might not be an actual job but the norm of communicating on there absolutely bleeds over into many start-up cultures.    Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory"

I'm sure your company thinks its interview process works fine, but I'll also bet your company isn't as diverse in terms of gender or URM as you'd like to admit.    you can't extrapolate trends about an entire industry  from a few high profile cases.

I really don't see what your big problem with whiteboard problem solving is. Many candidates perform better in an interactive environment where they can get immediate feedback from the interviewer than on a pen and paper test. Wouldn't it be unfair to deprive these individuals of an opportunity to demonstrate their skills at their best?  Whiteboard problem solving also happens pretty regularly in the office. If someone's stuck on a nasty problem, they'll throw the pseudocode up on the whiteboard, and a couple of us will talk through it and figure things out."

Giving someone a unique problem to solve in 24 hrs and expecting someone to be able to talk through their solution isn't recipe for cheating. Especially when the point of the exercise is to demonstrate good software architecture design skills and not spit out an algorithm that you can just look up in a book. If your take-home project can be completed with cheating, you've designed it poorly. Which goes back to my original problem with typical white-board programming problems--they don't test at all for the skills needed on the job.    Wouldn't it be unfair to deprive these individuals of an opportunity to demonstrate their skills at their best?   I'm not saying that whiteboard programming doesn't have its place. But why use it as gate-keeping when it's clearly not what's all needed to be a programmer? Leave it as an option if someone wants to take that route.

SRSDiscussion,3a2zjl,fleetingnightingale,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:43:43 2015 UTC,"how whiteboard programming disadvantages women and minorities.   Well I'm glad you asked. As someone who falls into that demographic, I can tell you that the barriers of being able to pass something like whiteboard programming at most large software engineering firms are out of reach for people who don't get formal CS degrees. And unfortunately, the industry becomes very biased in favor of young grads, which skews heavily white and male. None of this is on purpose, but if you've set up your interviewing process to heavily penalize people who don't have access to the requirements to pass that process, and those people happen to be overwhelmingly women and minorities, that's the essence of systemic discrimination. Notice I'm focusing on disparate impact here.    Obvious example: Candidate calls up their college roommate, who is an excellent programmer, and the roommate solves the problem for the candidate.   I can assure you most non-college grads don't have friends they can just call to solve a 24 hr take-home engineering project. I think this highly unlikely scenario just demonstrates how out of touch you are with a majority of aspiring devs who aren't white and male.    Yes, and StackOverflow is an anonymous medium on the internet, where people are a lot more likely to be assholes. That makes it an unsuitable proxy for real life working conditions in industry. It would be like using r/atheism to argue that all atheists are asshats.   StackOverflow is a huge or at least a significant part of most programmer's jobs. If you don't know something, and your boss isn't technical (like in many start-ups with project managers) chances are you're going to go online to speak to peers who do. It's funny you should bring up /r/atheism--I've found that the most vocal atheist IRL who organize around atheism as their main exposure to oppression tend to be asshats, so thanks for proving my point.   Then there should be studies or statistics that back up your argument, right?   Not everything needs to be a peer-backed scientific study to show that it's a widespread problem. Do you know of any organizations scrambling to fund an industry-wide study of women's experiences in programming? When I talk about sexism within the industry I run into people like you who want to argue til their blue in the face that it doesn't exist, or even if it does, that's it's not worth pointing out because other industries are just as bad.

At my last job, I was the only man in the lab for the vast majority of the time. While the lab I worked in was an exception to the rule, I'd probably say that gender representation was pretty good across the board, until you get to senior lecturer/professor level where it's still an old boys club. Conferences were when the gender disparity really got obvious. I went to a few where every speaker was a middle aged white man.  In terms of views, most people were socially very accepting and generally aware of the importance of things like feminism (even if politically they identify as right wing), with a notable exception of a few religious students who turned out to have not so nice views about women and/or gay people. However, most of the accepting people did not really think about social justice issues very much.

Guys who have come out of the army and went for computer science with the GI bill, former federal agents, military contractors, people like that. Do you know what sorts of things can disqualify you for top secret clearance?

Not to mention that if defending a rapist (something a public defender might not have a choice not to do), there are basically two defenses -- innocence and consent.

SRSDiscussion,3a2zjl,AprilRyan8,3,Tue Jun 16 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Since I started the thread, I suppose I should also add-  I work in the fine art world. I specifically work for a contemporary fine art gallery. The industry has a few main facets: Artists, galleries, museums, collectors, and advisors. There's also the important corollary of art students and art schools.   I feel like homophobia and racism are pretty low in the industry's acceptance of artists as a whole- representation of GSM and PoC artists could definitely be better, but it's made some massive strides in the past ten or twenty years. I feel like the idea of ""gay art"" or ""black art"" or whatever is pretty well accepted as unique and important perspectives. Not as much as it could be, but I feel like it's very rare to hear someone question the existence of, say, ""black art"" as a legitimate and important component of the contemporary art scene, vis-a-vis Glenn Ligon, Rashid Johnson, Theaster Gates, Kehinde Wiley, Kara Walker, Mickalene Thomas, Kerry James Marshall, etc. And the same can be said of ""LGBT art"" or whatever.   I think when it comes to the industry's relationship with artists, women are still much more significantly marginalized. Women's representation in group shows, biennials, gallery sponsorship, etc. is still pretty despicable, especially when you hold it against gender stats in art schools. Most major art schools, in any given year, have women representing anywhere between 60-80% of graduates. This has been true for like 50 years. Despite this, women still only make up like 5-10% of most gallery rosters, group shows, biennials, etc. The bar is set much higher for women in order to ""prove themselves"" as ""real artists,"" compared to men. Even blatant misogyny still rears its head every so often; most recently, major artist John Baldessari felt the need to reiterate his opinion that women are biologically incapable of being ""truly great"" painters.  On the administrative side of things (museums, galleries, advisors) there's much better representation overall. There's a LOT of women curators, gallerists, advisors, etc. to such a degree that I almost feel like the industry might be 50/50, at least when you look at people below 40 or maybe 50 years old. Advisors especially are very heavily weighted towards women. Racial representation is good but not great. Higher ups tend to be old white men. The museum world, and gallery world, is largely run on the money of old white men. It's gradually changing but so much of the upper echelons of the art world are tied up in banking money that it's kind of inevitably very SAWCSM heavy.   Collectors are generally pretty white. It's a symptom of money being more commonly held in white hands, and a lot of money being needed to be an art collector. Lots of women collectors though, and plenty of GSM collectors. PoC collectors are just now sort of becoming a thing. There have always been PoC collectors, but it's just now sort of on the rise.   At the end of the day, I think the biggest concern with the art world is probably the financial component. The fine art world is in a strange and problematic place with money. It's an industry fueled by the richest people in the world, buying objects that far exceed any common metric of value in their material or labor. Most art is sold on reputation; an extremely small minority of artists account for the vast majority of art sales both in terms of volume and value. At the same time though, I think the advancement of the arts is an important social concept, and a lot of artists are actively creating jobs. Big artist studios often literally have dozens of employees, and in my experience artists themselves usually have pretty good hiring practices.  TL;DR: Women are REALLY underrepresented as artists, but tend to be fairly well represented in arts administration (museums, non-profits, advisors, galleries, etc.). PoC and GSM have made huge strides in being represented as artists, moderately represented in arts administration. The art world has a lot of fundamental problems tied to the ultra-rich, but it's hard to assign blame for that."

Undergraduates typically were on the first two floors where the classes were held. Researchers and professors were usually higher up. Despite this my lab happened to be on the first floor so I would use the first floor bathroom. When I transitioned there I went from using the men's restrooms to using the women's. On the first floor the women's restroom was far far more crowded then the men's. This is not so unusual as I am sure most women can attest. But if you went to the upper floors where most of the researchers and professors offices were the women's restroom is deserted, I rarely ran into anyone else there. While the men's was more active.

SRSDiscussion,3a2zjl,luladin,2,Thu Jun 18 14:41:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a graduate student in Bioengineering.  My field as a whole suffers from a lot of the problems that engineering fields in general does (in 2011, women received 18.4% of engineering bachelor's degrees).  However, bioengineering is a much newer and less entrenched field than the other engineering fields, and my undergrad program was ~45% female.  For my immediate surroundings, it is actually quite good.  The PI for my lab is a woman, and the other grad student in my lab is also a woman.  Our department as a whole has 30% female professors, but our department chair is very good.  She has been working to eliminate many of the issues that have historically discouraged female professors, such as the difficulty of having kids while being a professor.  Prior to becoming department chair, she actually ended up getting into a fairly serious fight with the previous (no longer with us) department chair over converting one of the break rooms into a maternity breastfeeding room.  From what I've heard, she ended up going up to the university president to get him overruled.  She has also done things such as changing faculty meeting times around to accommodate professors who have to pick up kids from daycare or school.  Additionally, she has been actively seeking out other professors to hire to try to increase the diversity in our program. So I think that I can comfortably say that my specific department is friendly to women in engineering, which many engineering departments can't claim.   For ethnicity, I don't have the numbers at hand, but we are strongly white and Asian.  There are very few African Americans in the department, which is a trend that shows up in much of academia. My lab has one of the few African people in the department, who is our post-doc from South Africa.  (On a slight tangent, he has commented on why he thinks that African American professors tend to not publish as much, or in as high of impact journals.  From what he has seen, because of how few African professors there are, whenever the university forms a committee, they keep going to the same professors to serve on it to add diversity.  That means that they are spending more time in committees and less time working with their students.  I don't know if it is true, but anecdotally the African professors do seem to serve on more committees than anyone else). I haven't seen or heard complaints about any examples of racism, but since I am white it is quite possible I just haven't been told about what others have experienced.  My university as a whole has some issues, but is slightly skewed towards a liberal atmosphere, though there is a sizable and vocal hard reactionary conservative population.  In this past year's student government elections, a new party formed that actually took the time to talk to minority student organizations, including the campus transgender community, and one of their platforms was to actually designate some of the individual restrooms on campus as unisex, rather than have them be gendered individual restrooms.  The entire LGBTQ community rallied strongly behind them, because they were the first student government party that acknowledged that they exist, and they did win which was awesome.  Less awesome was how many people screamed about how their entire platform was to transphobia.  So I guess it is a fairly mixed bag.  It could be a lot worse than it is, but it also has massive room for improvement.  Fortunately, I think that there is some actual push towards improving it."

In my experience, TE has a very close female:male ratio. I don't have data to back this up and its all anecdotal. My undergrad PI was a woman. She was the first TE researcher at my undergrad university. The second TE researcher joined the university a year before I left, she was also a woman. My current PI as a PhD student is a woman, department chair, and one of the top names in the field. Last week I was tasked with presenting on a ""leader in the field"" in our lab meeting. Somebody had already presented on Robert Langer (the ""father"" of tissue engineering) and just based on my readings I narrowed it down to, coincidentally, two women (Kristi Anseth and Jennifer West for those of you who are curious).  Now I should emphasize that TE is likely still slightly male-dominated, but it's very close in my limited experience. I am curious why that might be though. What attracts women to BME and TE in particular? Part of it is the newness of BME as its own distinct profession. Most of the faculty in my department are very young (under 45). TE itself is also only a 25 year old field. I know the biological sciences skew female more than other branches of STEM so that probably plays a part too."

Asian/white male in the construction industry (USA) here, apprentice electrician to be specific. Lots of light banter and ribbing about racial stereotypes, though I'd assume it's mostly non-malignant and self-aware; Asians probably get it the worst, though, since they are super underrepresented in comparison to White, Hispanic, and Black people. While it's hard to not get along with the other guys when you're sweating it out there with them, I can't help but wonder how much of it is true acceptance or just professional tolerance.   Unfortunately, it's still very much an old boy's club out there, so the prevailing attitudes towards women, gender and sexual minorities is negative and demeaning. I'd hazard a guess that many social justice issues don't even cross the minds of the people I work with."

There are a lot of issues tied up in this though - I think the fastest possible improvement would still be slower than you might think.  When we're talking about the higher ranking jobs that take 10+ years of experience, the pool of female candidates is naturally proportionate to how good our representation was 10 years ago, which was worse.  And even after that there's still room for discrimination when choosing who gets promotions (there's less than you might think, but it's still there for leadership roles).  The percent of computer science graduates who are women is still too low.  As an industry we either usually either think this is someone else's problem, or just have no idea what we can do to improve it.  We're also concerned that the raw number of graduates is dipping, and similarly have no idea what to do about it.  The more graduates there are, the faster our representation will drift towards what's coming out of college.  (100% of CS graduates being women won't make a difference if it's just 1000 of them per year.)  Below the executive level, I think our industry is actually on track to fix itself, unsatisfyingly slow as it might be.  To get to the executive level in a tech company though, you either have to be a founder or a well-connected executive with previous experience elsewhere.  Most companies are founded with venture capital, and venture capitalists and executive-class social circles are heaps of discriminating.  I don't have any optimism for this improving.  If I start a company, I'm not looping these people in.  Representation of women is the hot-button issue, but our track record for representing blacks is even worse.  I don't have any insight into how to fix this.  Maybe found companies in cities with better track records?  It's not like the west coast is good at this.  We're doing a pretty good job with gender and sexual minorities!  Mostly gay men though, since they're the least impacted by our problems with representing women."

I was talking to my gf about the non-binary thing, and came to the same conclusion, that their brains would just be somewhere in between or just different from binary brains in other ways.  It seems silly to think there is no biological basis for being trans. Society doesn't tell people ""be trans"", usually quite the opposite, to the point of using violence to enforce gender norms. Gender of course has huge gigantic societal components, but that alone I don't think would explain trans people. Brain or hormone or womb differences seem likely contributors to me, and some studies support that. Intersex people were studied in a few studies as well, and being raised as a gender they didn't identify is tended to have pretty severe consequences including suicide."

If you lived secluded on an island as a trans individual, you would still feel gender dysphoria without society telling you what your gender is because of your sex.  I think it's a bit muddy to wrap the trans experience up entirely in societal gender expectations and ignore the biological condition behind it as well. I personally cannot speak to the realities of every trans person but from what I've gathered, this isn't just a ""my birth sex doesn't match society's expectation therefore I am trans"", it's ""my birth sex is wrong on the inside"". Getting caught up in the outward appearance and behavior side of it feels sometimes short sighted as to the realities of dysphoria."

So I'm assuming (with no scientific evidence of course) that the sex side of things is confusing and dysphoric but the societal implications of gender only serve to worsen it. This makes sense for people that are able to transition happily in different ways; perhaps deeper levels of dysphoria for different people?  I think it would be interesting to see how trans people feel if they're not subjected to the gender expectations in addition to the sex difference.  Although we do know that trans people exist in cultures with different ideas of gender so I think it's safe to assume that the dysphoria occurs quite a bit with just the body being wrong, not just the societal implications being incorrect.

Our position on that scale might change over the course of our lives.  Our gender identities emerge from our sense of where we fall on that scale.  Is there reason to believe this is all wrong?  I have found this view persuasive because it seems intuitively obvious to me that there is really no such thing as a perfect male or female prototype and, at the same time, everyone exhibits both male and female traits (so-called) to varying degrees.

Although I don't think sexual orientation is correlated with hormones necessarily, so it would be interesting to hear how all these jigsaw pieces fit together.

SRSDiscussion,39u91h,Pterodactylism,24,Sun Jun 14 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"Ehh I think that SRS post was taken out of context in a way I'm not entirely comfortable with.   Regarding ""brain sex"" stuff.. I recently read a piece that had interesting stuff to say about that:   Brain Sex  Moving on, the next thing Burkett does is to present trans people as having as a core ideology the belief that we are born with binary male or female sexed brains. Burkett frames us as having the goal of convincing society that brain sex requires people to act in a gender stereotyped manner--for example, that being born with a female brain makes a person bad at science and math, good at nurturing, and into frilly dresses.   Now, it is true that Caitlyn Jenner makes sense of her identity as a woman by saying, as Burkett quotes, ""My brain is much more female than it is male."" There are many binary trans people who use this sort of language to try to explain what it feels like to have a gender identity that doesn't match one's assigned sex. But please note that the reason trans people do this so often is because cis people constantly demand that we explain how we know we are trans, and where our trans identities come from.   Thirty years ago, when I was in college, straight people were always asking gay men and lesbians how they were sure they were ""homosexual,"" and what made them gay. Back then, lots of LGB people were very interested in brain studies that claimed to show that gay men had brain characteristics similar to those of women, while lesbians had brain areas that were similar to those of men. Today, that just sounds silly, and scientific exploration of the idea that lesbians think like men and that gay men have girl brains has largely petered out, because people no longer demand to know what biological factor could possibly explain sexual orientation. With the depathologization of same-sex attraction, the search for some biological basis to explain it has faded away.  But when it comes to gender identity, many cis people still refuse to accept a person's self-report of how they feel. They demand that we ""prove"" our gender identities, and explain our ""compulsion"" to gender transition. There are scientists studying this question by examining brains, and so some trans people turn to this idea when asked to justify themselves.  What Burkett does not acknowledge is that there are many trans people, myself included, who are quite critical of the idea that there is some simple brain center that determines gender identity. There are many, like myself, who discuss how so much of the neurological research into ""brain sex"" has been deeply flawed, and used to bolster misogyny. What we argue is that gender identity is a deeply complex matter, that gender varies over time and between cultures, and that while you will find minor sex differences in specific parts of people's brains, the brain is a plastic organ that is shaped by our lived experiences.   What the differences found in the brains of deceased men and women show is that we die with slightly different brains, not that we are born with our gender identities stamped in some simple way on our hypothalamus or some other brain center. The fact that trans women's brains resemble those of cis women's reveals shared identity and experiences, but the factors being studied as differing between women and men are tiny. ""Brain sex"" is a complex and subtle thing--not some matter of pink brain centers that are obsessed with makeup and blue ones that refuse to ask for directions. In any case, neurologists' understandings of sexed brains are still very limited and contested, and ordinary people can't be expected to parse their scientific articles.  What we urge is that cis society stop requiring that we somehow prove that our gender identities have some biological basis, and just respect our self-report of what our gender identities are.   Idk... yes I think ""Men and women have physically different brain structures, and thus exhibit different behaviours."" is a bad statement, but I feel like the context of the comment (talking about/defending trans stuff) isnt really the best place to pick apart / pick on that argument.   From your OP:   Nor does this affect non-binary persons because I'm nearly 100% positive the structural differences would just be different from both binary men and women's structures as well.   I'd like to see a citation on that please."
SRSDiscussion,39u91h,greenduch,4,Sun Jun 14 21:06:36 2015 UTC,I don't have one. As far as I know a study hasn't been done on one.

I'll leave it up but keep in mind this is pretty much just me rambling and not paying attention to my tone very well..    I think you're getting hung up on the brain differences. Really you are ""hardwired"" in certain ways from birth. But a lot of your brain structure changes throughout adolescence. It's not so much it being hardwired from birth but being shaped a certain way as you grow in childhood and through puberty. The differences they've found between men and women (cis women and trans women vs cis men and trans men) are incredibly small but also incredibly distinct. These parts of the brain are also incredibly regulatory in nature and not part of your personality or interests.  I can't speak specifically to how you feel obviously, but if not some ""other"" category, where would your brain fit in? While it's not the end all be all of your experience, disregarding the biology of it is pretty silly. A scientific approach should always be considered when searching for the truth, granted it should be a fully valid scientific approach that examines all parts of the issue from the feelings to the physiological realities. Disregarding the physiology of gender can be just as harmful as relying solely on biology (or perhaps better worded, relying on biology in the wrong ways).  I'll fully admit I'm a ""STEM lord."" I'm an undergrad who one day hopes to be a physician. So I do value objective approaches to issues like this. And yes, it is possible to objectively view gender identity without turning into a transphobic reactionary. Where is the harm in seeking to find the full truth? A truth that takes into account the physical evidence and the experiences of those who have lived it. As a gay man I would love to know why I'm not like 90% of the population. I want to know what makes me feel the way I do. What makes me different? I think that option should be available for people of all gender identities as well, even if you don't need that information.

What I'm wary of when people cite brain sex studies is that the citer often seems to imply natal causation (where I don't think it has actually been established?). Like ""all women have certain brain features from birth and they are immutable, and therefore it would be possible to test whether someone is really trans or whether they're actually a confused crossdresser."" You haven't done that, of course. But I guess my worry is that citing these studies as a defense of trans people (I am nonbinary and trans, btw) could end up reifying or buttressing oppositional sexism or bioessentialism. Additionally I worry that it misses the point, which you addressed in your post, and that it sets up a standard for acceptance of trans identity that could well be scientifically overturned or used as a sort of gatekeepy trans litmus test.

Although I agree that the biological aspects of gender shouldn't be ignored, I also think that presuming that such factors are pivotal and hardwired to create your identity is problematic on many levels. A big problem with disaggregating biology from socio-culture is that the sociocultural can become biological in many ways. This means that studies could indicate biological differences correlated to different gender identities without concluding that these differences are innate. Rather, these differences themselves could also be a product of how subjects interact with gender norms.   I also agree with greenduch's analysis here. Although biological aspects are not to be ignored, I don't think that they should be used as an argument for trans rights. Doing so would only serve to further exclude different identities that stray from the norm which don't have some physiological basis. Instead, the focus should be on fighting for acceptance regardless of whether or not there are biological components to gender identity.  I do appreciate your willingness to be open to other opinions though! Many ""STEM lords"" only are able to accept things which conclude in a single, stable, and objective truth.

Trans health care is medically-necessary.  Expensive, medically-necessary treatment is usually paid for by insurance companies or national health care services on the recommendation of doctors. That means both doctors and insurance providers are going to be interested in research that may help understand the etiology of the condition and lead to better screening and diagnostic techniques. That's especially true when the current best method is essentially self-diagnosis.  Homosexuality could be demedicalized because gay people don't require any medical treatment for being gay.

But I would ask you, and all the other trans* people who have the privilege of not suffering from severe dysphoria, to remember that people like me exist. These treatment protocols that you enjoy having access to were developed for us because we need them - because we are in severe distress, undeniable even to the patriarchal and paternalistic medical establishment, and no other treatment works.  Perhaps saying they're medically necessary is problematic. But saying they're not is far more problematic.

SRSDiscussion,39u91h,Allabear,3,Tue Jun 16 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with that. Trans people don't necessarily ""require"" or want medical treatment, and being trans isn't a disease. It's very difficult to medicalize anything related to identity or ""mental health"" without being oppressive. Doctors should absolutely be aware of and know how to deal with issues trans people often face, but medical diagnosis and psychiatry have a really messed up history when it comes to gsrm people and I think antioppressive principles should come first."

I try not to make these discussions personal, but there's no way to avoid it here. If I lost access to hormone treatment indefinitely, I would kill myself. I'm not being melodramatic. I become actively suicidal when I'm not on testosterone. Demedicalization of transsexuality + testosterone still a scheduled drug = dead /u/mathemagicat.  Since treatment is quite literally a life-and-death matter for me, I'm very frustrated by people who treat it like something that can just be casually brushed off because it's inconvenient for their gender theories.

Men and women have physically different brain structures, and thus exhibit different behaviours.   The part in bold is why the linked post was shit, not the mentioning of whatever tiny, insignifcant differences there might be between male and female brains.  This one is from the exact same person who posted the linked comment, in the same thread:   Depends on the equality. Women deserve equal rights and equal treatment, but some initiatives like trying to get women into engineering, are simply a waste of time because most women don't want to be engineers, and it's biology, not society, making them think that way.

SRSDiscussion,39u91h,WizardofStaz,7,Tue Jun 16 04:26:43 2015 UTC,"Brains are sexually-dimorphic because of the same prenatal and pubertal hormonal influences that shape other sexually-dimorphic structures, and this dimorphism appears to be relevant to gender identity (as demonstrated by studies of intersex children).   Trans people's brains do not appear to conform exactly to their assigned gender, although they don't appear to conform exactly to their identified gender either. It's likely that the differences from the assigned gender are related to gender dysphoria.  The gender that a child identifies with influences their behaviour. Children who identify as boys are likely to internalize cultural norms of masculinity, while children who identify as girls are likely to internalize cultural norms of femininity. Children with an androgynous gender identity are likely to exhibit a mix of masculine and feminine behaviours as defined by their culture.  However, there is no evidence that brain sexual dimorphism in and of itself influences behaviour.  All that said: The comment linked in the SRS thread sounds well-meaning enough, and better-educated than average. It's hard for me to justify filing it as poop."
SRSDiscussion,39u91h,WizardofStaz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:03:49 2015 UTC,"I see no reason to dismiss the idea that that brain sexual dimorphism in and of itself influences behaviour. As a base starting point for how we start out as babies, I find the idea quite reasonable and easily explains how children can exhibit strongly gendered behaviour even when their parents go to great lengths to avoid gendered socialization. The important thing to remember is: there is nothing wrong with this.  There is nothing wrong with gendered behaviour: with acting stereotypically girly, or with hating math. There is nothing wrong with conforming to society's expectations, just as there is also nothing wrong with defying them.  Also, for gender, as with race, while there may well be characteristics that can be associated with the group, just because the archetype looks a certain way does not mean that all (or even most) individuals within the group match the archetype."

Arguments from biology marginalize these people by implying they aren't ""truly"" trans or gay or whatever.  Plus, making the argument from biology opens you up to a bunch of slimy questions you shouldn't have to deal with, like whether it's not possible to be biologically agender or whether people with dangerous parphilias should get a pass because they have a biological reason for their behaviors.   The best and only argument you should ever need is that someone's actions or wants or identity aren't harming others.

Not all trans people experience gender dysphoria, and not all trans people want to be considered mentally ill before they are allowed to transition. Being gay was once considered a mental disorder. Part of what determines a mental disorder is that you cannot function in society, but that says much more about society than it does about trans people. This line of reasoning, too, is problematic."

A lot of the leaders you mentioned had very big faults in their leadership. FDR is one of my favorite presidents but let's not whitewash history. He stacked the supreme court, led for four terms breaking precedent set by Washington, imprisoned Japanese-American citizens. All of which are illegal and would be extremely looked down upon today. He was a remarkable leader but in a way he was also blessed by timing that enabled him to have so much free reign to get things done. He was almost a benevolent dictator in the amount of control he had because of the circumstances of being seen as the Democrat that led us out of the great depression, led us through WW2, those circumstances allowed him to have much more political capital and leverage than we've ever seen really.  You're idolizing something that never was, just look at what George Washington said at the very start of our countries political outlook...   The line between Parties,” Washington wrote Trumbull, had become “so clearly drawn” that politicians would “regard neither truth nor decency; attacking every character, without respect to persons – Public or Private, – who happen to differ from themselves in Politics.”    Fifty years from now someone will probably be arguing the same thing you are about President Obama."

FDR wouldn't have been seen as great if he didn't gain all the political capital he did through the circumstances of his terms that enabled him to push such a progressive agenda. Who are all the other amazing civil rights leaders that surrounded MLK but were overshadowed either because they came too early, or for a myriad of other reasons?   I'd argue President Obama is great leader, leading in a bad time, and whoever wins the next election will probably reap most of the benefits (and/or negatives) of Obama's policy. Bill Clinton was seen as a good leader because he happened to be President at the time of an economic upturn lead in part by the dot com boom. Not to diminish his charm, intelligence, and leadership qualities either. My point is, great leaders still exist among us, they just lead during uncertain times, don't have nearly enough political willpower and capital to succeed fully, and/or your definition of great leaders is marked in hindsight rewritten by historical remembrance rather than reality."

SRSDiscussion,39onbn,FaceofMoe,9,Sat Jun 13 23:01:26 2015 UTC,"I addressed this more in another post, but I feel I should add in here, too. What you're doing is saying that trans women are women because we say so. That is how social constructs work, though, and we shouldn't be ashamed of it. I see a lot of people working too hard for a logical argument against trans-racial identities, and it's not gonna work because there isn't one. It'll be parroting arguments against transgender identities while saying, ""no, it's different, really."" But those arguments aren't different. I'm putting my money on it, transracial will be a thing in fifty years. Until then, people aren't comfortable with it. It's not acceptable, and that's okay. We can roll with that. But let's just own up to the fact that this is an argument about social constructs, and social constructs exist because we say they do."
SRSDiscussion,39onbn,Koeida,3,Sun Jun 14 03:49:05 2015 UTC,"Are you saying then that to be supportive of the trans community I have to support the idea of race dysphoria?

That isn't okay."
SRSDiscussion,39onbn,FaceofMoe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:07:12 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I'm very ignorant on these issues, but it seems like if someone started permanently passing as someone perceived as a racial minority by passing. Like with surgeries and so forth, they might entirely lose all of the benefits of being in the racial majority because they would not longer be perceived as such and might not be able to again without make-up and surgery or so forth.  If someone, for instance, found a Korean pop idol very attractive and beautiful. And felt they wished they did, and wanted to look like them. And wanted to see a pretty Korean pop idol when they looked in the mirror, rather than who they see and are perceived as by society.  That wouldn't be the same as being Asian or Korean. Not all Asian people or Korean people look that way. That wouldn't change their culture. To be Korean, culturally, the way to do that would be to immigrate to Korea and become a Korean citizen. How one becomes a part of a culture is controversial, and many people view needing to be born into a culture to be a part of it. But for instance, I view Arudo Debito as a Japanese man, and I view Asian Americans who have immigrated to America later in life to be Americans and culturally American, especially if they have adopted American culture and identity.  But I think that, by doing such surgeries or so forth, and looking like a Korean idol or group of people this person may have modeled their cosmetic surgeries on, if someone didn't know they were ""born as a different race"", simply by having such features, they would pass and be perceived as a member of that race. And wouldn't have any privileges associated with being a part of that original race. People wouldn't know, and they would treat them as this different group.  You could argue that that would be offensive fetishization for a white person to want to pass into the same aesthetic as a Kpop idol and be seen by others as Asian by fitting into the same aeshetic of beauty as someone like ChoiSam. Again, not all Korean people look this way, and it would be racist to say that they do. But by looking that way, I think one would be perceived as Asian. And with enough surgeries, that would be possible.  People have said that you can't ever been any race other than, well, I probably shouldn't use a trans phrase like assigned at birth. So I don't know what word to use. But depending on the definition, that might be right. But I don't think you can say that, with enough surgeries, someone white or black couldn't look a lot like the rapper ChoiSam.  You could argue that would be extremely unhealthy and racist appropriation and fetishization for someone to want to do that. And that there are limits to individual freedom and what people can and should want to do with their bodies. Before it becomes racist.   But if someone did get so many surgeries that they did look like this person, they would be perceived as Asian and would be treated as such, instead of white or black. And like with BDSM, even if we perceive something as racist and wrong, I wonder how much we really have a right to tell anyone what to do with their bodies.  Also, how would the situation of privilege work if someone who was black got surgeries to try to pass as Asian. Or if an Asian person got surgeries to try to pass as black. Would the police and other parts of society still see and treat a person as black if they looked this way?"
SRSDiscussion,39onbn,ViolenceIsTerrible,3,Wed Jun 17 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"I definitely respect you and your perspective. And I know that many other transwomen say they feel that way. And I certainly don't want to trivialize your experiences.  But I would say that I don't think that all transwomen feel that way. Unless I don't qualify as a transwoman. Because I don't get the feeling that I was ""always a woman"". I've always been uncomfortable with gender, not just how I've been assigned and treated, but with society. But I didn't identify as a woman until I was an adult.  And while many people say that doesn't mean you weren't always a woman. And most transpeople didn't realize they could be trans, which is a part of why so many people don't transition or identify until later. I don't feel that I was ""always a woman"" or a girl when I was a child. Just uncomfortable with gender and ways that I was assigned and treated.  I was identified as male and treated that way. And that came with many privileges, even though I was still uncomfortable with that identity.  I identified as agender when I discovered gender identity. I identify as a woman now, but for a long time I felt I didn't have a gender identity. It's hard to feel that I've ""always been a woman"", when gender has been such a long journey for me.  I'd like to think that my identity is legitimate, and that I can still be a woman, even despite and through all of this. I've certainly grown attached to this gender identity and am enjoying transition. I don't think that all transwomen experience the same things. And personally, I don't understand how someone would have been ""always a woman""? How is one always a woman or always a man?  What do you think of the Simone de Beauvoir quote that one is not born, but becomes, a woman?"

Part of me isn't even sure I should be asking the question, at the risk of legitimizing them. But I am curious, and this is a discussion subreddit.  I think one thing you said really shines light on one of the big differences. So much of what race is is the experience of being that race. Someone who optionally pretends to be a certain race when it suits them simply does not have the same experience as someone who grew up in that skin. It's not really the same as gender, which is mostly about how you feel now. Race is not mostly about how you feel now. It's about what you've gone through."

It's interesting what you say here because if you'd replace race with gender here, this is literally the same argument that trans-exclusionary feminists use to invalidate trans* people.

SRSDiscussion,39onbn,OneJobToRuleThemAll,-2,Mon Jun 15 02:50:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps my wording could use some more refinement. I meant race as a social construct. Of course, AAs and Asian immigrants are the same race from a biological perspective (to the extent anyone is, although that's a question for geneticists).  And yet, as I've spoken with AAs and Asian immigrants, I have gotten a very different sense for the experiences they have of their own race -- different types of discrimination, different challenges. Yet a third experience is the experience of a non-white native in their own country, where whites often still have privilege but where discrimination is less felt by virtue of them being uncommon. Their experience of race as a social construct is, to my understanding, quite different, even if their skin tone is the same. I don't think this is a controversial viewpoint, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me know if you disagree."

While civilization seems to be getting better in a lot of ways because of the amount of young people who are raised in a much different and less xenophobic on some fronts atmosphere, I fear that lately credibility with white people, even young ones, is something that comes and goes with the wind. A lot of support, especially the vocal support that can really help good causes, comes from self aware whites who are willing and more capable of ""going against the grain"". It feels like in this group, as a white male that is concerned with these issues but who has lived most of his life around ""Middle State"" white evangelicals (even going to a Christian college), there are a lot of wonderful intelligent people in my corner. But the increasing popularity of social justice, and social justice having become seen as a largely good thing even to Whites has led to some unpredictable changes in how white people relate to each other, our own ethnicity and our place in society in general, and whether or not the high position we occupy is something to be ashamed of or not.            I hate to sound selfish, but as a mentally ill person, I worry greatly that my own cause is going to be taking a hit. I know the most popular response is ""this is going to be an excuse to cover pre-existing prejudice"", but as someone that works actively within the community of people that actually exhibit that prejudice I'm more worried about genuine changes in how people in my community view certain issues."

That's a pretty fucked up view. Gender dysphoria is your cause, and the same would be true if ""race dysphoria"" was a thing.   I'm also ""mentally ill"". I'm aware some diagnoses receive more acceptance than others. But isn't that just a call to action? A call to raise awareness for all diagnoses? A new diagnosis setting us back is a small price to pay for the good it can do for those that are affected: the possibility to improve one's quality of life, maybe even be ""cured"".   I don't believe racial dysphoria is a thing, but if it were, or anything else came along, shouldn't we be the first to stand as a shield against bigotry directed at those affected?"

Which is why I desperately hope that we'd band together around ""new arrivals"". And that's pretty much the point I wanted to make.  If ""racial dysphoria"" is a thing (airquotes indicating I don't believe it is until shown some proper research), I'd hope we could help increase acceptance for those affected, without worrying what it'll do to us.

No, you were trying to do that deliberately because you disagreed with my point of view and then tried to shame me into not having it. That kind of thing is what the social justice movement gets made fun of for, even by the people who support it, that mentality. I can't say this enough, there is no argument you could ever make that would ever undo the damage of saying a statement like that to someone who isn't one of us. We mentally ill cannot call rednecks ignorant bigots like the others so love to do. As a mentally ill person, we should never attack people outside of the social justice movement because those people can be our allies too and people in the social justice movement aren't always. I hope for marriage equality, better treatment of minorities and an open atmosphere of acceptance and understanding, but I'm going to go into why we especially should never, ever attack people who quietly hope for some conservative future in addition to responding.                         Now, TL;DR: The cause of mental illness takes a hell of a hit when our ""allies"" describe mental illness to the unaware with knowing inaccuracies, demonizes us, or attacks one of us as a strawman while ignoring our health difficulties, which is why I am so worried about this. This is going to be a hell of a post.                                                       Now on to your points. My main problem is your perception that one half of America's pathetically bichromatic political sphere, and one particularly strong willed, but not always liked, social group within that half, is actually our only possible ally/bet. No. It's murkier than that. While I agree with all of the goals of the ""cause"", the people in it are happy being ignorant and vicious, just like anyone else, as long as it is condoned by the people populating their worldview. Believe me when I say, as mentally ill people this is going to be a long fight because unlike gays, blacks, trans people or different religions we actually can be more difficult to work with. It's really hard to tell people what to expect, and while we can hope to get them to understand that sanity is a more of perception of health than a comprehension of the complex social and biological influences...yeah, you see, you're average viewer just tuned out. This is also why we shouldn't bite into non-SJWs, it's because we need them to at least sympathize with us and because it's no less possible than making our allies understand us.                            Right now what you call our allies don't have a healthy perception of what mental illness even is. They certainly don't take us seriously either, because aside from ""trigger warnings"" (I've been in mental health hospitals, getaways, retreats and even lockdowns when younger and have never heard of that bullshit in any of those), we don't get any consideration and are often demonized, especially people with Antisocial personality disorder and sociopathy, which have been given incredibly stupid demonizations that have nothing to do with their reality (they're usually portrayed, especially by our allies, as emotionally non-existent sadists and the words pop up too much). The rest of us, well, it's just assumed that because they are more kind people that some of the kindness will trickle down. It can't trickle down when we're not even being described accurately outside of our own community. Shit, we never even got a Daily Show or John Oliver episode focusing on us. The ""mentally ill"" character in ""Orange is the New Black"" is a joke caricature that they should be ashamed of and that fucking show is watched by every feminist on Tumblr who are probably only concerned that the main character wasn't a minority. There is a 17th century style representation of a violent mentally ill person with ""crazy eyes"" right in front of them while they're mumbling about this obvious injustice. Please let me know if you can think of a good liberal entertainer, pretty much the right hook of the social justice movement and it always has been, that doesn't ignore us or worse. With the exception of David O. Russell and the cast of The Silver Linings Playbook, which while not as accurate as the book still deserves our undying applause, especially if you know people with ""real"" emotional disorders, that switch between manic and depressive in high gear.                                                                                                                             Second, the topic this started on is the woman from Washington who clearly has pseudologia fantastica. I think it would be awfully nice if those ""allies"" of ours stopped using this one case of a woman with very clear pseduologia fantastica (she claimed that her hair was blonde because of cancer, her brother was her son, fabricated strange appointments she never went to, claimed her father died of cancer, refused to speak to her family and a hell of a lot more) as target practice. So far I've seen her painted as appropriating, as a bitter cunning racist, as everything other than what she blatantly obviously is. People are being utterly inconsiderate to the mentally ill just to advance their argument.                                                       And I wish I could say that I'm surprised. I remember when they refused to consider mentioning a mentally ill man who was beaten to death while he screamed for his father because he had been the beneficiary of White privilege at a rally against police violence. People are running around screaming ""There is no transracial disorder! She's just crazy cuz she's evil!"". I don't expect everyone in society to care about the mentally ill, because even ""causeheads"" pretty much ignore us, frankly. But when someone is campaigning for justice and it just happens to absolutely ignore any information inconvenient to their cause while they just attack a strawman, well that goes a bit further than ignoring us. Now they're hurting us.                                                 It's hard to consider someone a friend when they won't quit doing that kind of crap. I think we need to be criticizing people when they do something that absurdly ignorant even if the current political spectrum implies that they will eventually come around to helping us. If someone considers themselves active for social justice, we should hold them to a higher standard, not ignore it when they do something incredibly, consistently, repetitively and unrepentantly shitty.                         So I'm sorry, but worrying that our cause might take a hit is a pretty valid response, because we did take a hit and it came from our so called friends. We absolutely cannot confine ourselves to just them as allies. We cannot insult or attack people who attack us either. We don't even have that luxury, other groups don't even realize that their rage is something that someone else had to earn the right to have in public is a luxury they just don't understand. While at the same, one would hope, encouraging our allies to take up a higher (or, rather, existent) standard of our defense."

You either actively take a stance, in which case you'll always bring some change (however small it may be) or you don't and remain passive, in which case you unconditionally support the status quo.    Second, the topic this started on is the woman from Washington who clearly has pseudologia fantastica.   You cannot diagnose her, you haven't talked to her personally. You're relying on a reporters account of her words, which alone gives credence to several other types of diagnoses and the possibility that the reporter is just a lying asshole. That's one of the worst kinds of discrimination we face, ""normal"" people throwing around diagnoses like sociopathy in order to explain why perfectly normal people like themselves commit heinous crimes.   It's hard to consider someone a friend when they won't quit doing that kind of crap. I think we need to be criticizing people when they do something that absurdly ignorant even if the current political spectrum implies that they will eventually come around to helping us. If someone considers themselves active for social justice, we should hold them to a higher standard, not ignore it when they do something incredibly, consistently, repetitively and unrepentantly shitty.  So I'm sorry, but worrying that our cause might take a hit is a pretty valid response, because we did take a hit and it came from our so called friends. We absolutely cannot confine ourselves to just them as allies. We cannot insult or attack people who attack us either. We don't even have that luxury, other groups don't even realize that their rage is something that someone else had to earn the right to have in public is a luxury they just don't understand. While at the same, one would hope, encouraging our allies to take up a higher (or, rather, existent) standard of our defense.    This part really got me to think, so thank you for that alone. Some excellent stuff a great amount of people would benefit from reading."

SRSDiscussion,39onbn,Koeida,18,Mon Jun 15 04:35:59 2015 UTC,"Gender is not biological either, folks. Even sex, while it has distinct biological elements, has been constructed in the way that it has by science partially because of cultural ideas about gender.   There are in fact some people who claim they are trans racial, including people who have gotten cosmetic surgery to look like a member of a different race. However, there are a number of reasons why I personally don't believe that surgery to look like a different race is ever appropriate and why I feel that race dysphoria is a very different issue than any other kind:   Race and gender are different things. This probably seems like a very simplistic point to make, but it bears repeating.  Gender has to do with one's location in a system that is based on one's individual experiences of the world and issues like gender dysphoria occur when our experiences of the world do not match up with our internal realities. Race is not individual - it is a system of classifications that was specifically created to envelop, mark, and oppress groups of people who were determined to fall outside of a falsely created norm.  Any individual could have been assigned a different sex at birth, or developed different hormones, etc. This is not the case for race - what race people perceive you as and what race you experience the world as is dependent on your parents and the family you are born into. A white passing person of colour will still have very different experiences of the world than a white person - including white people who are sometimes racialized because of their appearance. Race is frequently much more about cultural differences than gender is - people of multiple genders occupy space in the same culture and receive knowledge about other genders' roles in their culture. For example, as a white person in Canada I understand ideas about gender roles for white men and women in my area, even if I don't personally identify as either. I do not, however, understand ideas about (for a random example) Anishinaabe gender roles and identities, because that is not my culture. If I identified as ""trans racial"" native I would not already have an understanding of what it means to exist in that category in the way that I do with regards to gender.  Most people who identify as ""trans racial"" are white people who do not have clear ideas about their desired heritage, and instead fetishize and generalize about what that experience means. Frequently it is connected to warped ideas about racism and white supremacy that are very far from realistic. People who identify as transgender have individual relationships to what their gender means to them. People of colour who get surgeries to look more like white people, or who relax their hair, lighten their skin, etc, don't call themselves trans racial. They do it in order to get jobs, to be treated better, to fit in to the dominant beauty norms, because it's expected for everyone to strive towards whiteness. Take Julie Chen's story for example."
SRSDiscussion,39onbn,MedukaMeguca,9,Sat Jun 13 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"I don't like your arguments, so I want to reframe them from a different perspective. I think within the argument against transracial identities exists an argument against transgender identities. Therefore, we ought to be very very careful about the arguments we're using here.   To begin, I do agree that altering your physical characteristics in order to outwardly identify as another race is wildly inappropriate. But I'm not entirely sure why I agree with that.  Now, 1/2]  EDIT: Upon further revision, I want to separate out #1 as being a strong argument. Race and gender are different things, but I think I disagreed because of its context in your post as a whole. Race currently requires the experience of growing up inside that race because people, especially PoC, agree that it is an essential component to understanding race.   Race and gender are different things. This probably seems like a very simplistic point to make, but it bears repeating.  Gender has to do with one's location in a system that is based on one's individual experiences of the world and issues like gender dysphoria occur when our experiences of the world do not match up with our internal realities. Race is not individual - it is a system of classifications that was specifically created to envelop, mark, and oppress groups of people who were determined to fall outside of a falsely created norm.   You use gender dysphoria as if we didn't only recently win the battle on this being an actual thing. You use it as if it's been accepted for years. You describe it as if racial dysphoria would somehow be described differently than, ""when our experiences of the world do not match up with our internal realities."" It's assuming we know the mechanism for gender dysphoria, and that there is only one mechanism and it is biological and that's the only one that matters.   As for race being a system of classifications used to [etc.]... Well, why can't we say the same for gender? Both are based in very real physical differences. Can we truly say one was invented to oppress while the other was not? Or are we focusing on recent history, and arguing that because the most 'recent' iteration of race came into play primarily as a tool of oppression, it is different than gender, whose most recent iteration was something else entirely. I don't know what that something else is, though. I would think that the very most recent iteration of gender is the one in which anyone can claim whichever identity suits them. But what was it before that, precisely? It wasn't primarily a tool of oppression, as race was... so, primarily a tool for identifying potential mates, and social class, and responsibilities, and a hundred other things that we all agreed were shitty parts of the patriarchy. But no no no, I get it. It's because people actively chose race as a tool of oppression, whereas gender is just a biological thing. Well, that doesn't make sense, either. I'm sure most people participating in racism a few hundred years ago saw it as 'just a biological thing.' I mean, that's been the defense for all racism and sexism until we proved/prove each instance was/is scientifically unsupported. But no, I got it this time. It's because the history of racism in recent times, especially the places we're having this particular conversation (i.e. probably america, or at least close to), racism has a more violently tumultuous history with greater longer term implications than sexism. So we're playing oppression olympics to decide whether transracial or transgender is... wait a second. That doesn't seem right either.   Who cares, too hard to think, let's continue.  People came up with man and woman because there is a physical difference between them that is important to the way they interact. Well, people came up with [race 1] and [race 2] because there is a physical difference between them that is important to the way they interact.  What we're saying with this argument, is that identifying one's gender by appearance no longer serves a role we consider appropriate, practical, and/or important, while upholding the appropriateness, practicality and/or importance of visually identifying someone's race.  I would like to know why it's still appropriate, practical, or important to visually identify someone's race. Because my theory about this argument, is that its credibility comes purely from the fact that race relations are still more fractured than gender relations are. It makes me think, maybe second wave feminists were right to deny transgender women in their time because gender relations were still to fractured to be ready for transgender people... No. They may not have felt ready for it, but that didn't make transgender identities wrong.  onto 3]   Any individual could have been assigned a different sex at birth, or developed different hormones, etc. This is not the case for race - what race people perceive you as and what race you experience the world as is dependent on your parents and the family you are born into. A white passing person of colour will still have very different experiences of the world than a white person - including white people who are sometimes racialized because of their appearance.   I think this line is less clear than you'd like it to be for race and gender. People from a spanish ancestry get confused for white all the time. Jewish people get confused for white all the time. Mongolians get confused for chinese get confused for all sorts of different racial groups across Asia. Different hispanics get mistaken for blacks. Different blacks get confused for hispanics. As for gender: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaN7O24cW54 and a million more just a google search away  Hell, my white aunt with her curly black hair and deep tan went to her college freshman orientation and was approached by a black girl who said, ""Thank god I'm not the only one here."" She got mistaken for black in the fucking 70's!  And if we're gonna bring family into this, let's go all the way. Gender is experienced via your parents gender expectations, which isn't terribly unlike your parents cultural expectations, which you later admit is the primary feature of race - culture. You can go on to disassociate yourself with your parents gender expectations, and their cultural expecations, but for some reason you can never disassociate yourself from society's racial expectations? But now it's okay for us to disassociate ourselves from society's gender expectations? I'm not saying this is wrong (in fact, I think you're right), but can you go ahead and explain why that is?  I do understand that in no way discredits the fact a white person who is sometimes mistaken for another race will still have different experiences of the world than people of that race, or that a white passing person of color will still have different experiences than a white person. But you failed to include something else that I consider a very interesting oversight. A white passing POC will still have very different experiences of the world than non-passing people of their race. A white person who is mistaken for a POC will still have very different experiences of the world than unmistakeably white people. More than that, there is a conversation that happens in both the ingroups and outgroups about those people.   ""[insert POC] had a white parent, they aren't really [insert race]."" ""[insert POC] speaks too much like a white person to really understand [insert race]."" ""[insert POC] forgot his heritage, he doesn't belong with us/them.""  Those are shitty things that people actually say, but that's what happens when battle-lines get drawn. You have to solidify your identity. People do that by attempting to discredit the identities of people that look like them. White people do it to white people (i.e. identifying and picking out racists, or 'SJWs' and posers). POC do it to POC, too (as all the above). Same thing happens on the gender front. It is literally the same rhetoric.   3] is a strange argument that says genes are more important then doubles back and says that ultimately, it is about perception, while refusing to acknowledge the frequency with which those perceptions are fooled, and simultaneously ignoring the fact that correcting for society's perceptions plays a significant role in how transgender people decide to modify their bodies, wardrobes, and pronouns.  Onto 4/5]    Race is frequently much more about cultural differences than gender is - people of multiple genders occupy space in the same culture and receive knowledge about other genders' roles in their culture. For example, as a white person in Canada I understand ideas about gender roles for white men and women in my area, even if I don't personally identify as either.

Frequently it is connected to warped ideas about racism and white supremacy that are very far from realistic. People who identify as transgender have individual relationships to what their gender means to them.   Do you really wish to simply parrot second wave feminist arguments against the inclusion of trans people? Cause that's what you're doing.  Are you also saying that someone who is raised in the absence of the opposite gender cannot be transgender? That's claiming quite a bit of knowledge about the mechanism for gender dysphoria...

SRSDiscussion,39onbn,MathRobot,8,Sat Jun 13 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"6]   People of colour who get surgeries to look more like white people, or who relax their hair, lighten their skin, etc, don't call themselves trans racial. They do it in order to get jobs, to be treated better, to fit in to the dominant beauty norms, because it's expected for everyone to strive towards whiteness. Take Julie Chen's story for example[1] .   Women who wear suits, shoulder pads, and short hair don't necessarily identify themselves as transgender. They do it in order to get jobs, be treated better, to fit in to the dominant social norms, because it's expected for everyone to strive towards masculinity. Take the 80's for example.  Seriously, though, your point is?    I should reiterate that I do think it's inappropriate for people to modify themselves in order to be perceived as another racial group; however, we need to be very clear on the argument. As coquette put it:   Bruce Jenner was lying to the world about his identity as a man, and now Caitlyn Jenner is telling the truth about being a woman.  On the other hand, Rachel Dolezal was lying to the world about her identity as a black woman, and now her parents are finally telling the truth about her being white.   In other words, the argument is ""because we say so."" But, again, as coquette says, ""that’s the fundamental nature of social constructs.""  The real question is why do we say so? I think it's because racial tensions are too high, race relations are too fractured, and the definition of race currently includes having grown up inside it. Quite frankly, we just can't do transracial right now. Consider that if you ever feel the need to judge a second wave feminist, or if you can't understand why people held such backwards views 50 years ago. And remind yourself of that if transracial ever becomes a real thing, and whenever you need a reminder that your perceptions of reality are as unstable, subjective, and contextual as anyone else's."
SRSDiscussion,39onbn,ElectricFleshlight,20,Sat Jun 13 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"Gender isn't biological? As far as we understand right now, gender (as in gender identity- it's really unfortunate that we refer to so much with the same word...) has a distinct biological basis, with distinct neurological differences between, for instance, trans men and cis women. This is kind of a super-critical thing- gender dysphoria has nothing at all to do with society. If I spent my whole life on an island alone, separated from human culture, I'd still start feeling pretty shit around puberty! (I feel kinda meh about saying ""biological"" here because we haven't studied all of this in too much depth yet, and I don't mean it in a if there aren't studies ur gender is invalid sense or something dumb like that- the important thing is that we're pretty sure gender identity + dysphoria is internal, disassociated from society.) On the other hand, race as we understand it isn't that way at all- it's entirely a societal thing, as far as we can tell.  The ""this is internal and detached from society"" bit is huge. Arguments about race being different because, for instance, white people don't understand how much other races are marginalized in society are dangerous- the ""trans women aren't women because they don't experience misogyny"" argument has been used to treat sad trans girls like trash by TERFs for the longest time. Likewise, TERFs treating gender identity as something a) disassociated from the self and b) associated with society results in them using the ""if society wasn't sexist, we wouldn't have trans people"" argument, which is wrong. This is something I've noticed on the news, etc. a lot, and it really hurts- we aren't trans because of some kind of screwed-up internal ideas about gender roles, and it's horrible how many people think this is the case and use it to oppress trans folks?  Anyway tl;dr the reason that gender dysphoria is an issue is because it has nothing to do with society. Society can exacerbate it, but it's not responsible for it existing in the first place."

Read, or skim, or don't, whatever, your call.  I feel like some of these points are...I dunno, I feel like they miss the mark for me. Yes, race and gender are different, but I think there's a lot of just-so justification going on that doesn't really hold up, or is maybe inconsistent.  In your second point, I feel like you're individualizing gender, but gender is as much a collective site of oppression and identity as race. I think you're saying race/racism is an intentionally constructed structure of mass oppression (which it is), but that gender isn't, which I don't think is true. People experience both race and gender on an oppressive collective social level and on an individual, personal level. I may be misreading you, though.  Your third point, especially on gender, feels kind biological-hand-wavey. It's true that there are many conditions at pretty much every level of the body that could result in a variety of gender phenotypes essentially independent of one's inherited genetics, but that's not confined to gender. We could say the same of ability/disability/""trans-abled"" people, and, yes, race, too. But there is something you're getting at here that I think is definitely a difference people aren't talking about: the generational nature of the trauma of racism. The wounds and the injuries carried there go back along centuries of oppression, and a person born to a family socially identified as white is probably not getting that same experience of collective, community-level trauma.  Then again, I'm hesitant to say women don't also experience community-level trauma, though it's obviously not generational in quite the same way. We do have a lot of social narratives and myths around womanhood (that have also been around for a long, long time) that young women are exposed to and internalize and those can create experiences of trauma, though of course the experiences are definitely different in terms of the economic realities created, so I dunno. But yeah, I do think the generational component of the legacy of racism is a big difference that people aren't talking about.  And the whole discussion around ""passing"" is really interesting. I would characterize my experiences as a young trans woman as being the experiences of a woman passing as a man, and you're right, that's not the same as just being a man. Though it's really fucked up in a lot of ways, there is value in the concept of ""passing privilege"", though mostly in the way it highlights which perks those of us ""passing"" up a privilege gradient don't get access to. You identified, totally correctly, that for example, a person of color ""passing"" for white can't just walk away from their identity as a PoC, they're still exposed to and forced to internalize the racist myths and narratives that other PoC deal with, too--not to mention the constant fear of being ""found out"" etc. etc. So though that concept gets mobilized in super-fucked up ways, it is useful, though it needs some rehabilitation.  Your fourth point is interesting, but I'd actually argue that there are in-group skills and knowledge that we compartmentalize along gendered lines, too. I don't think it's as extensive as the process of racial enculturation is, but after I came out as a trans woman I definitely had to learn a lot about interacting with others as a visible woman, both to simply make myself heard and to make myself legible. Like I said, I think there's probably more of that going on in communities of color, but it's a difference of scale moreso than a fundamental qualitative difference.  I do agree really strongly that the vast majority of ""tran-racial"" folks are engaging in essentialism and fetishization, but I do want to put the breaks on for a second before we absolve all trans people of that same tendency. I have known trans people with weird, fetishizing ideas about manhood and womanhood who are totally essentializing and happily playing into patriarchal attitudes and structures--but I don't think those people's shitty politics make their needs any less real and valid. You're right that transgender people have individual relationships to our genders, but gender is also a large social structure, and we can't just divorce ourselves and our decisions from that.  For your last point, I do agree that this happens and that we don't label these adaptations ""trans-racial"", but I have a question: people do adapt to dominant norms all the time, because we do live in a racist, sexist, capitalist coercive society, but do you think the phenomenon you're describing is fundamentally different from women who adopt traditionally masculine behaviors/leadership styles/habits etc. because that's the only way to be taken seriously in corporate contexts? I'm not really sure what I think there."
SRSDiscussion,39onbn,kurashiki,7,Sat Jun 13 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"Your fourth point just gave me a really interesting thought, because it illustrates one of the main differences between race and gender: That neither cultural background nor the full extent of marginalization in society are something you ""intrinsically"" know about other races, while gender doesn't have a strict culture, and social views on various genders are all around us.  Like, I'm neither male nor female, but throughout my childhood, I have collected a big number of factors of what constitutes men or women by observation and my parents' words. This is why the socialization argument used to push trans women out of women's spaces is such bullshit - of course trans women even before they might realize they're transgender, because misogynistic expectations of women are all over the news.  With culture and racism, it's very different - having grown up in a biracial household, I know both White German and Chinese culture,  and I'm also visibly recognized as East Asian, so I've heard all kinds of Ching Chong jokes in elementary school. Now, a white person might think ""yeah, I know the gist - you celebrate lunar new year and people ask you what Ching Chong means"", but of course, that barely covers it and to know any more, a white person would have to put hours of research into my culture to have an understanding that even comes close to mine, and they still wouldn't know the feeling of all the Chinese people at my high school collectively reclaiming a slur as means of solidarity. Similarly, I don't have an intrinsic understanding of other non-white cultures at all, and if I were to claim I was of any other ethnicity, people who actually belong to it would quickly uncover that I have no idea what it means to be that ethnicity.  So, yeah. So much for the ""it's the same"" argument."

My first thought is to say no research would be enough.

It isn't relevant as to whether or not someone's identity is ""genetic"" or not. This is just a talking point that was spread around to influence a debate because if people thought transsexualism was prompted by environmental differences they would be entirely likely to view it as mental illness alone. Mental illness itself, in it's billion myriad forms is actually not anything like what people perceive mental illness to be in the public, so I think it's best to simply avoid that line of thought entirely.                                I honestly believe that even in our own community mental illness is seen as something of a blight because of this. You have no idea the lack of support that we face even from our allies.

So, among other things, being treated as a race you're not is quite common for some folks.  To make this analogy you have to ignore all of these experiences and have a spectacularly simplified understanding of race, not to mention of gender.

SRSDiscussion,39ilzh,justcurious12345,7,Fri Jun 12 05:35:04 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best argument for choice in this thread, and it's the reason why I'm pro-choice but I've seen some problems in this argument lately that has made the issue more unclear for me. I'm basically with you up to the point where the fetus is in her body without her consent.   Basically fetuses don't create themselves, they're created by their parents, one of which is their mother. They are mainly created by a specific act which can but does not always result in the mother sharing her uterus with the fetus. So the question is, how can a woman willingly* participate in this act which may result in her sharing her uterus with a fetus, and not give consent for it to be there? Conception might simply be a risk, and not the intended outcome of the sex, but when you engage in risky activities, you consent to take the risk. That only makes sense. Furthermore no fetus can, of it's own accord end up in the uterus of a woman without her help (unless she is raped.)  (*I support unconditional access to abortion for rape victims because no one can consent to being raped.)  So I started to have doubts that sex-consenting women can really conceive without their consent. I began to think...well even if she did accept the risk of conception, she still needs to harbor this thing for nine months. Who can force her to do that? She should be able to revoke consent at any point in the pregnancy. But this troubles me too, because we are granting that a fetus is a person, and it seems wrong to recklessly destroy a person because the woman who created it no longer wishes to be responsible for it. Then I thought about, when it comes to bodily autonomy, or any kind of autonomy really, the individual with the autonomy gets the sole right to decide...but not necessarily the right to change their mind. In that case it seems like we always base the right to make that decision on the consequences it might have.  For example, you have the sole right to decide if anyone else can use your blood or organs to stay alive. If you decide someone can, and they transfuse the blood or transplant the organ, you have no right to demand it back...The other person is now using it with your permission.   A lighter example: You can give permission for someone to ride in your car with you to work. You can revoke that permission and demand that they get out...but not if you're going 100MPH on the highway. If you forcibly removed them in that scenario, you would be charged with a crime.  In the case of abortion, if we grant that the fetus is a human, then we're saying that the mother has the unilateral right to forcibly revoke consent at any time, for any reason, at the cost of a person's life. Why? We as a society rightfully take the consequences into account in other situations involving the revocation of permission, and those consequences are usually less dire than loss of life.   Now I'm stuck in a place where, if the fetus is a person, there is no clear issue of bodily autonomy that overrides it's right to life. But still the idea that society should force a woman to carry a fetus to term fucking sucks. Also the idea that we should permit human lives to be destroyed by the people who recklessly created them fucking sucks. It all fucking sucks. Hurt women or hurt children? As a man I just stay the fuck away from this issue. But I'd still like to be on the right side of it.   edit: I was banned after starting this thread so I can't reply to any commenters or continue this discussion."
SRSDiscussion,39ilzh,Neil_DeSpace_Cosmos,6,Fri Jun 12 07:43:14 2015 UTC,"You can't ask for your organs back, but you can withdraw consent up until the point that you're unconscious on the surgery table. If we're on the highway and I demand to be released from your car, you have to slow down and let me out as soon as you possibly can, even if it's inconvenient. Otherwise it's kidnapping.  Unplanned pregnancy definitely sucks. Abortion does not. If it's done with the consent/at the request of the pregnant person, it's what she thinks is best that makes it a good* thing. Ultimately, though bodily autonomy is a strong argument, what it comes down to for me is the radical act of trusting other women. I trust that they know more about their lived experience than I do, that they can make the right decision for themselves in something like abortion way more frequently than if someone else decided for them."

Like I said, fetuses can't just end up in their mothers' wombs on their own volition.    The way you talk about this makes it very clear you don't trust women. You think we'll just get abortions all willy nilly if someone more rational doesn't come impose his morality on us. Hold us to our end of the agreement. That's offensive. I decide who uses my body and how. If you don't agree with that, you do not get to call yourself pro-choice or an ally.

SRSDiscussion,39ilzh,Neil_DeSpace_Cosmos,2,Fri Jun 12 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's called an unplanned pregnancy.   I think I'm coming around to seeing this your way but there was definitely a point preceding every unplanned pregnancy where the woman took a risk knowing that pregnancy could be a result. So a pregnancy can't happen without a woman's consent (except of course for rape).  The thing is, we often do things that have a small chance of killing someone. Whenever you drive a car instead of walking, you increase the chance you will kill someone. We accept that you are allowed to put other people at risk by doing that so that you can get to where you are going faster. And cars definitely aren't the only example. There are plenty of other situations where you can put other people at risk in some small way without their consent and you won't be punished much if at all if the worst happens and someone dies.  If you absolutely had to terminate any pregnancy that might result, then by having sex you would be risking the life of a fetus for sex. But it's possible to take enough precautions that you're less likely to get pregnant from a sex act than you are to accidentally kill someone on any given day, so with enough contraception that risk is acceptable. And moving the decision to terminate from before the sex to after the sex shouldn't make the decision less ethical.  I have my own completely unrelated reasons for being pro-choice, but I do think that if this was the only justification for abortion then it would be ok provided you took a lot of precautions when having sex.   I don't buy the argument that you can drain someone's blood and drink it on the understanding that you will give them a blood transfusion, then refuse the blood transfusion because of bodily autonomy."

I don't buy the argument that you can drain someone's blood and drink it on the understanding that you will give them a blood transfusion, then refuse the blood transfusion because of bodily autonomy.   I think legally you should be able to, but ethically it's not good if you're doing it just because.

A lot of people might want to install mods to enhance their gameplay fun, but they're not really in for the Putinization of their save file. Sure, they can lower the chance of corruption by practicing good save file hygiene or only downloading from trusted sources, but it might still happen. In that case, they should be able to have the option to somehow remove the Putin glitch from their game.  Of course, one might argue that some people really find the idea of that glitch hilarious, and they'll deliberately download mods that are known to lead to their game being corrupted with the Russian head of state. But these people should still be able to fix the glitch when they realize that it's really not all that funny, annoying, or even detrimental to their game performance, and not have to put up with it for the rest of the game.  Similarly to this, pregnancy is always, even with contraceptive methods used, a possible outcome of intercourse. And saying that people who are willing to have sex should just deal with the possible outcome of pregnancy is much more morally questionable if there is no possibility whatsoever for someone to terminate said pregnancy.  Also, unwanted pregnancy does not only affect the person carrying the child, but the child as well, since being unprepared for offspring can lead to a lot of difficulty in the kid's and the parents' life. I'm always careful with this argument though, since it's often a slippery slope to euthanasia apologism.  (On a sidenote, while I do very much believe that the infringement on reproductive rights is rooted in misogyny and thus a women's issue that doesn't directly affect all and only women, I think gender neutral language is appropriate when it comes to the discussion of pregnancy/reproductive roles in and of itself, since women who cannot get pregnant and non-women who can do exist.)"

Almost everything a woman does carries a non-zero risk of being raped. But let's say we want to exclude the baseline risk of sitting at home alone, and just consider activities that carry a particularly elevated risk of being raped - things like going to a party and getting drunk, or going to a man's house alone. When women choose to do those things, they choose to accept the increased risk of being raped. Does that mean they consent to being raped? (Obviously not.)  Consent to be in a situation where someone or something might try to violate your bodily autonomy is not the same as consent to have your bodily autonomy violated. A blastocyst doesn't have the moral right to set up camp in a woman's uterus just because she had sex any more than a man has the right to stick things in her vagina just because she got drunk.  The difference between the blastocyst and the man, of course, is that he has moral agency, so it's his responsibility not to rape anyone. The blastocyst isn't capable of understanding that it's violating the woman's right to bodily autonomy, so her only recourse is to treat it the way she treats other life forms that lack moral agency: take reasonable preventive measures, and if it manages to invade anyway, remove it."
SRSDiscussion,39ilzh,mathemagicat,2,Mon Jun 15 22:23:26 2015 UTC,"I guess ultimately it boils down to how we define personhood. While I wouldn't say that an embryo is not human (because, well, it's not a dog or anything) and that it's irrational to get attached to it, I don't consider embryos who neither think nor feel yet as much of a person as I do with the person who's carrying it.  Naturally, discussing unwanted pregnancy always comes with the risk of making pregnancy sound like something terrible devoid of any emotional connotations. Even people who decide to abort an embryo who they can't or don't want to give birth to oftentimes get emotionally attached to it, and the act of abortion can be incredibly taxing. I don't think implying that it's selfish or irresponsible and thus creating guilt in people who decide to not carry the embryo until birth is the right way either, though. Like - terminating a pregnancy because you know you would not be able to care for the child the way you think is ideal, be it because of your economic situation, your physical health or your emotional capabilities (for me personally, bearing a child would amp up my stress levels to a point where I am a danger to myself), is also a way of taking responsibility for your actions."

There is no point that a boy becomes a man, but all countries have a legal drinking age, driving age, age of consent, etc. The fact that these ages vary between countries is indicative there is no exact place to draw the line, but it's still a convenient legal fiction because we know we don't want children drinking, driving or having sex, and this is the easiest way to legislate that.

Normally the thought of a woman being raped is enough to cast silence even over very aggressive debate. Why should a human being's life be ended because it was sired in a horrifying act of violence? Do two wrongs make a right?           No, they sure don't. The problem with a lot of people in our movement is that we rely on shock value of the atrocities committed, but sometimes we use that instead of actual analysis.       In this question I think there is a massive argument to be made that while two wrongs don't make a right, three wrongs don't either. There are impacts to not allowing abortions, especially to the consideration of rates of rape reporting, the impact that having to raise a child of rape and many other issues that make the issue much more complicated. This one is a very difficult argument to win because, frankly, the fetus will become a living human being if allowed to continue and there is no real way around that. You can muddy the issue by making them more aware of how much to the issue there actually is, but I think it's best to start looking at the forest for the trees in this debate and worry about making a positive personal impression instead of winning a debate.

First, they believe that life begins at conception. Imagine a person's whole life represented as a line. Where does the history of that particular colony of cells begin and end? The end is obviously death, but the beginning isn't the moment of birth. The person still existed (the line continues uninterrupted) beyond that, to the point where conception occurred (and beyond that the integrity of the line can no longer be maintained and splits in two).  Second, they believe that human life is inherently valuable, and should be preserved.  Third, they believe in personal responsibility. And I don't mean in a specific, personal way (they may in fact be massively irresponsible in their personal lives), but as a general organizing principle of the world. This is important, because most pro-choice people are left-wing, and don't, really. They believe people are the products of vast social forces beyond their control - racism, sexism, the patriarchy, etc. Which matters here because a fetus doesn't just happen - it has to be created through a deliberate act, which, though not necessarily intended to result in pregnancy, carries a known risk of such with it. And if someone engages in behavior that creates a new human life, then they have a certain responsibility towards it, from the pro-life perspective.   These premises are incompatible with most of the usual pro-choice arguments. The first one rules out most arguments along the lines of ""it's about personal choice, it's just a clump of cells, it's just a part of the woman's body"", etc. The third one rules out most of the ""she may not have the means, it might be a terrible hardship,"" etc style arguments.  Note, I'm not saying that any of those arguments are objectively wrong, merely that they start from a completely different set of premises and so can't possibly be convincing to a pro-lifer.  So, you have to attack the premises instead. You can't really do anything with the first one, because it's clearly true. You won't be able to do anything with the third one -- that's just one of the fixed differences between left and right, a divergence of worldview that either cannot be changed or, if it can, will alter only gradually over a very long time, and certainly not as a result of a single facebook conversation.  So your best line of attack is to go after the second premise. The idea of inherent value is incoherent - for something to be valuable, it must be valuable to someone for some reason. And since a fetus never develops higher consciousness while a fetus, it is incapable of valuing itself. Moreover, value is generally dependent on scarcity, and at over six billion humans on the planet, human life is cheap.  There's certainly no reason why a fetus should have any particular value to society, or anyone other than the woman carrying it (and possibly the man who engendered it, but then the burden of carrying the child is not evenly distributed, and her greater interest in the affair suddenly becomes relevant after all).   And you can point out that while we talk about a right to life, liberty, etc., most of what we consider rights are age-conditional. You need to be a certain age to legally drink, vote, drive, serve in the military, and so on, and these limits both arbitrary but also obviously necessary. There is no good reason, then, why society should not withhold the right to life before a set age, even if we choose to make that age, say, three months in the womb."

What I prefer is sticking to talking about public policy and the implications of putting what they are espousing into practice. Do they want to make abortion illegal? What would that law look like? What are the sentences like and who goes to jail or pays fines—the person getting the abortion, the doctor, the person who offered a ride to the clinic? Do the police now investigate miscarriages? Do pregnant people have to register with the state? Are natural abortificiants going to be restricted like illegal drugs?  Asking these type of questions gives you a few general kinds of positions. There are people who concede that it is impractical from a policy standpoint and that they think abortion should be legal even though they find it objectionable personally—and the conversation can turn to how that's actually called being ""pro-choice"" even if they would never have an abortion, personally. There are people who want to limit access to abortion—by imprisoning or revoking the licenses of doctors and shutting down clinics—but not actually punishing people seeking abortions. These people can, maybe, be argued into a reluctant acceptance of legal abortion with arguments focused on how removal of safe legal abortion won't actually stop people from aborting it just makes it less safe and the impracticality of trying to police every miscarriage. Finally there are the people who want strongly punitive measures for everyone involved in all circumstances—who want a world where pregnant people are held in prison cells until they give birth because they tried to buy vitamin C without rose hips added over the internet after being raped.  I don't know what to say to those people other than ""I'll be leaving now, thanks for answering my questions.""

SRSDiscussion,39ilzh,TheoX747,2,Fri Jun 12 04:23:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to consider the other person's point of view here. If they're correct that a fetus is a human life then ending it is murder. Where you differ isn't the logic, it's a premise. If either of you were to swap your views on when human life begins you would swap conclusions too.  So, if we have a bunch of people on either side who believe they are right how do we make a law? Well we can start by making some cutoffs. Obviously before fertilization there is no person, otherwise pretty much everyone over 13 is a killer. And after a point there is a person, verified by common sense and various scientific studies. That's why pretty much no one supports third trimester abortions.  That still doesn't solve that pesky region between conception and ""definitely-person"". And it's a time that really no one knows if that's a clump of cells or a person. Lots of people have strong beliefs, but no one actually knows. So, my view is that if no one knows then our government has no business making the decision for people. That seems like an overreach into what ought to be a personal, philosophical choice. We shouldn't be restricting people's freedoms just to be on the safe side.  That probably won't make your friend change his personal view. After all there's no reason for him to change his premise about when life begins. Like I said, no one really knows. But hopefully it will make him change his view on the extent to which the government should be involved in this decision. There's nothing wrong with people being morally opposed to abortions if they violate their beliefs. The problem is when they try to equate their morals with law."

It opened my eyes to the fact that the only reason I was pro-life was a reaction to the extreme pro-choicers who seemed to be more spoiling for a fight than trying to actually convince me.  I now see the rights of a fetus to be on a continuum, up to the point of viability, the natural place where a woman's right to choose is overcome by the right of the fetus to life. Before that, controlling her body necessarily means the fetus dies. After that, it does not.  Of course, there's also factoring in the actual process of getting said fetus outside of the mother, which gives a gray area. But I'm perfectly fine with creating a fuzzy line like that.  I also found the fact that the Bible does not actually mandate life starting at conception to be a good argument. Historically, Christians thought that a baby was ensouled at ""the quickening,"" the point when the mother felt the fetus moving around inside of them."

You shouldn't be allowed to be offended because it's not serious, it's a joke, we don't really mean to be racist/sexist/misogynistic/whatever.

I'm not always offended by jokes that pick on women or feminists, but when I am and I speak up it opens the doors for people to mock me personally for being a killjoy, and incidentally it feeds the stereotype in the jokers' minds that feminists are super easily offended.  Basically what I'm saying is that yeah, jokes are nothing next to real threats and bullying. But because joking is okay to do, it's a socially acceptable way to spread hateful ideas and stereotypes that influence people's perceptions so that they might hold on to those ideas when the joke is over, or at the very least it feeds the ideas of someone who is already hateful and makes them think that those ideas are okay."

Except that I was in the liberal kid groups in high school, but still very upper middle class.   But my dad was born into a house without any of those amenities you mention. They moved into a real house in Nashville when he was still pretty young and did well by world standards, but he just comes from an enclave of what we call ""hill billies"" here. Mountain/hill people. That community is still isolated.   I sort of just wanted to say all that because I'm not always sure that people on this sub, which is a good sub, don't realize the conditions poor white Americans live in, but that's a tangent, too, considering:  My point is that the phenomenon of people posting the shit, and freaking out this way, having a huge and impromptu but surprisingly organized public temper-tantrum, has to be the product of privilege, by which I mean wealth. These are young upper-middle class people with no scruples about posting this sort of thing.  So, jokes are white noise, sure, but this does freak me out a little. Maybe I'm being naive.

SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,JManRomania,8,Thu Jun 11 08:05:27 2015 UTC,"Not really. /k/ has enough active black posters, that are liked members of the community, that casual racism will be met with a resounding ""GB2 /POL/"", /o/ is a car board, 'nuff said, /co/ is joked about as /tumblr/ on 4chan, they're probably the most liberal board I go on, /g/ is honestly just shilling at this point, there's a lot of thinly veiled hype over useless apps, and very little discussion of hardware (I miss the network security threads...), and the rest of the boards similarly focus on their respective content.   Moot made both /pol/ and /mlp/ as containment boards, as Stormfronters and Bronies were goddamn everywhere. Now, they generally stay in the space tailor-made for them, and when they post on another board, the only thing that might give them away is if they use a typical /pol/, or Brony reaction image, and even then, some of those reaction images are used all over the net."

One thing that I want to add is that it also shows why purely vote-count based moderation (as reddit employs) doesn't really work on the internet. Brigading is always going to be a thing, particularly since the admins have never enforced side-wide rules.  By the way: your misuse of the word ""anarchist"" is a little heartbreaking."

Seems pretty standard business practice."

A lot of people are angry because they believe certain subs are being banned as a result of a political agenda, and are angry that subs are not all being treated fairly. If there thought process really was ""let's just ban one and see how it goes"" then they are idiots and deserve a lot of the criticism they are getting"
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,Trekky0623,23,Thu Jun 11 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"The thing is, this is ultimately a useless gesture on the part of the Reddit admins. Let's face it, Reddit is a business. Their only priority is to make money for shareholders and themselves. Reddit doesn't ban /r/coontown or /r/philosophyofrape because they haven't reached the front page, and keeping them in their little corner of the site is beneficial. This was true of /r/fatpeoplehate until today when a post leaked onto the front page, and I'm guessing Reddit's advertisers were not pleased.  What's more, Reddit hasn't done any favors for obese people using the site as evidenced by the literally dozens of subreddits that have cropped up to replace /r/fatpeoplehate, which they now have to ban as well to save face. Even if they are able to ban every related subreddit, the leaking of the content onto /r/pics and other subreddits shows one basic fact – that removing these people's corner of the site, they have merely spread to the rest of it. FFS, earlier today more than half of /r/all was content related to making fun of obese people and/or Ellen Pao. Moreover, as OP pointed out, this move has also just stirred up hatred and misogynistic comments for CEO Ellen Pao. Eventually this may die down, but I can guarantee when it does, another subreddit will exist to house these people and keep them off the front page, and Reddit won't care as long as they stay there.  This isn't anything new. When /r/jailbait was banned due to attention in the press brought by CNN and Gizmodo, it was replaced with /r/CandidFashionAdvice, which still survives to this day, able to stay under the radar and continue to exist as long as they don't threaten Reddit's bottom line. Point being, ultimately Reddit does not care about making a safe place or whatever BS the admins have tried to put out in their announcements. This is purely a PR stunt to try and please investors, and once that is done, they'll stop. Perhaps even more telling than the banning of /r/fatpeoplehate is the banning of /r/NeoFAG, a subreddit essentially attacking the gaming site NeoGaf, an advertiser on Reddit. Even if we were to accept the claim that they were doxxing or vote brigading or whatever, plenty of other subreddits do that as well without consequence. The difference is they aren't attacking Reddit's profits. Combining all this stuff with Ellen Pao's recent legal troubles, I think it's clear that the Reddit administration is concentrating on maximizing profit by removing troublesome subreddits."
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,chaanach,21,Fri Jun 12 02:33:14 2015 UTC,FPH topped /r/all daily. They rabidly upvote each other and it shows even on unrelated subreddits
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,ForeignAlphabet,13,Fri Jun 12 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"Nailed it. Best post I've seen all day. Everybody criticizing Pao for being leftist and everybody defending Pao for being a savior are completely missing the point. This website is a business and it is being run to maximize profits. This sites owners do not care about free speech, and they also don't care about preventing hate speech. They care about advertisers and their own personal PR for financial reasons"
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,WizardofStaz,2,Thu Jun 11 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"You're close but the motive wasn't that FPH hit the front page, it was that they started going after the staff of imgur.

SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,lcfparty15,3,Thu Jun 11 06:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, precisely. Anyone trying to reason this all out looking at any move on the part of a business that isn't entirely business related is rather missing the point of business."
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,Leninator,29,Thu Jun 11 08:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think the real kicker is everyone saying it's bullshit because the admins have left up places like coontown and a bunch of the other highly reactionary ones.   Which, you know, it's true that those ones should go and pretty outrageous that the admins haven't moved against it. But if they removed them first would any of this be different?   Fuck. Remember the outrage a few years ago when we got jailbait banned? Or creepshots?   All of the people saying ""leave FPH alone and ban something serious"" would be decrying it as an attack on free speech. The only difference would be that the front page would be filled with a different kind of shit from freezed peach crusaders.  So I say do it admins, call their fucking bluff and clamp down on the chimpire. The masses of reddit are calling for it now!   Hell, delete all of the shit and then delete us too, because then you'd be finally doing your jobs and SRS would have no reason to exist.   But of course that's just utopian, isn't it?"
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,nuotnik,8,Thu Jun 11 17:01:04 2015 UTC,"If this proves anything, it's that the bans were a good decision. Why would any company want these disgusting people on their site?

SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,ReNoLuK,22,Fri Jun 12 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"But the reason that this is all boiling over is because Reddit the company is seemingly no longer supporting the ""'free speech over all' ideology.""

SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,wyllie7,9,Fri Jun 12 03:16:10 2015 UTC,Here's hoping it is the latter. Hopefully Pao and the admins can drive the reactionaries to find some other website.
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,DJbezoar,13,Thu Jun 11 06:12:54 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. I think the only reason FPH was banned was the linking of imgur employees on the side bar, targeting people, and the brigading of other subs.   Admins are really just enforcing the rule of ""don't attack individuals"".   I'd still love to see other horrible, bigoted subs get banned though."
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,Gigantobot,5,Thu Jun 11 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Pao and the admins can drive the reactionaries to find some other website.   I honestly don't understand this.

SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,Naggins,8,Thu Jun 11 03:16:42 2015 UTC,"As long as /r/coontown exists, it is represented by Reddit. Reddit is paying for servers to host it and paying for the domain.

If Pao follows her current trajectory, the rp network and the chimpire's days are numbered. It also doesn't bode well for loosely affiliated necrophilia subs. IF this occurs though, there will be a reactionary shit exodus that will deplete a substantial portion of the site's userbase."

This isn't anything new, it's just the cycle of how reddit admins make the site look better to outsiders without enacting any real change. Ban enough token subs for external news sites to write about how awesome and progressive reddit it, then pretend it never happened one week later and return to the status quo.  As long as CandidFashionPolice is allowed to continue unmolested after the big deal they made about deleting the original, I remain completely unconvinced that the admins will care about this issue long term.  Mark my words, on the 4th of July, the original fatpeoplehate users will have some new cleverly named sub to laugh at people eating hotdogs and the admins aren't going to touch it because the mainstream news wont be reporting on it.  The admins know what they are doing. This is a great PR move for them that rides on the coattails of the recent actions by Imgur/Twitter, and all the ""outraged"" users aren't going to migrate to voat any time soon when it is so much easier to just rebrand on reddit."
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,chaanach,17,Sat Jun 27 04:20:37 2015 UTC,"yep its just PR. /r/FPH hit the front page. If /r/coontown did, it would get banned.

SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,SoftandPretty,5,Thu Jun 11 11:10:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know if reddit would risk alienating them as well   Well, they already have though, that's the thing. The frequency and ferocity with which the FPH clones were created and upvoted shows that the vast majority of active users are angry with the admins decision.   Likewise, the lack of any kind of moderate response to the outcry over FPH's banning seems to back this up. By which I mean there wasn't a sizable section of users posting and upvoting comments calling for calm, or claiming that both sides were wrong and they just wanted to ""get back to their memes"".   In fact, the few cases where such things did happen (notably the /r/pics mod), the call for calm was later qualified by an open endorsement of the anti-banning mob.   The Reddit admins are in a contradictory position. On the one hand they seem to have no moral qualms about the reactionary bullshit that pollutes every corner of this site. For all the claims that Pao is a skeleton feminazi, and that the rest of the admins are all her cucks, they're yet to move against the chimpire or rape subs, let alone places like KiA and TRP. They only act when things become too toxic for them - jailbait, creepshots, ""the fappening"" etc, or when things clearly flout the sites rules, such as the harassment of Imgur staff. One of the reasons they're so reluctant to do anything is because the reddit base fucking loves being reactionary shitheads - or are such deluded liberals that they think defending such people has anything to do with free speech.   That being said though their position as ""the front page of the internet"", and the public celebrity and advertising options that come along with it means that they're forced more and more to clean up the piles of shit that amass in the corner. That's what you can see yesterday's actions as.   This contradiction means that they keep posturing as hip crypto-libertarians, whilst implementing more and more censorship (which, in this case, is a good thing), thus alienating the vocal reddit userbase outside of but sympathetic to the reactionary cadres who have been leading the FPH charge.   The question that remains though is how much these users have been alienated. Clearly it's enough to attempt to spark some kind of ""movement"" on reddit, but will it be enough to attempt to build an entire new community on voat? And not one that is solely focused on opposition to progressive politics - one that genuinely attempts to be a replacement for reddit in terms of non-political content and niche subs.   And if this does happen, it remains to be seen whether a new layer of redditors will rise to fill their gap, who come here for the memes, or the news or the niche communities and couldn't give two fucks about the culture wars."
SRSDiscussion,39e0nr,SweetNyan,2,Thu Jun 11 05:54:26 2015 UTC,"The movement is already happening. I work with high school students and we often discuss issues regarding social justice. When I first started working, kids would be ignorant and naive about social justice/the world but were generally receptive of what I was trying to communicate.  In the past two years, things have seriously changed. Some percentage of the young white men I teach have gone from literally not knowing what feminism is to already being ""experts"" on the basis of their activities online. It starts with accusations of ""reverse racism"" and goes from there. I don't have any of the protections that university professors do and I'm very convinced that I will lose my job within the next two years do to student complaints from young white men.  In other words, there's already a movement, and it's beginning to spill offline. As the lines between virtual and actual blur more and more, e.g. memes encroaching on real life, these kinds of reactionary virtual communities are. I don't want to be completely alarmist, but all it takes if for a young person who can't separate their online/offline life for something extreme to happen."

Of course, reddit in general is still shit. But I think in some ways this is actually good in bigger generalities, because all that tension and dirtiness and unabashed awfulness is being brought to the surface. The whole world gets to see a fuckload of redditors absolutely losing their shit because their ability to mock, harass, and deride fat people has been stymied. This is what happens when you keep these people around, when you make policies that serve primarily to defend and allow this kind of shit.

SRSDiscussion,39b8vr,SuperStealthOTL,15,Sun Jun 21 13:01:14 2015 UTC,"I've always been a fan of it. It premiered around 2001 and I've been avidly following it since 2003-2004ish.  When I was still a teenager I enjoyed the crude humour and stupidity of it all, along with that little extra east coast Canadiana. I didn't even really notice that no one treated Randy and Mr. Lahey differently just because they were together. It was never played up for laughs and they certainly were never made out to be less by any of the other characters for being gay/bi. Only as I got older did I really understand the significance of this.  Now in the more recent season they have introduced a transgendered (crossdressing?) character, again with no mention of it and certainly no negativity being directed towards her. Among the girls, she's treated as one of the girls. One of the characters in the original gay relationship was in a relationship with her.  Randy and Mr. Lahey have done numerous tours of Canada and beyond (always fully in character), and they're universally loved among the college-aged white male demographic. Why is that?  I really think it's because they aren't given stereotypical mannerisms and their relationship is never treated as abnormal. No one treats it as out of the ordinary and this certainly has a big effect in really establishing that it is ok with the audience.  I love that Donna is now a main character and no one even bats an eye. Maybe this will instill in some people that being transgender is normal and it's ok. Although, I really wish Don would make some appearances too because he was one of the funniest characters that came out of the show.  I'm glad Netflix picked it up and produced new seasons (or we wouldn't have Don/Donna). I'm also glad that this awesome piece of Canadiana is being seen and loved by people outside of Canada. It may not be for everyone (it's definitely a crude show), but it certainly was ahead of its time in portraying homosexual and now transgendered characters."
SRSDiscussion,39b8vr,Jumpbutton,4,Wed Jun 10 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"yea, the show shows that you can be 'edgy' without resulting to lgbt/racist jokes. Off the top of my head the only ""gay joke"" (and I use the term loosely) is having Lahey and Randy dressed up in costumes staring at each other prior to sex, and even then that's more of a role-play  joke then a gay one"
SRSDiscussion,39b8vr,Bitterant-,6,Thu Jun 11 06:16:24 2015 UTC,yeah that's entirely a joke of how RIDICULOUS their role-play is. a giant bumble-bee and indiana(indianapolis) jones?? that's fucking great.  the only other kinda 'off' joke i can think of is lahey making randy some viagra burgers which is more an impotence joke than anything. it has been a while tho
SRSDiscussion,39b8vr,mildly_inconvenient,-3,Thu Jun 11 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"Aren't impotence jokes technically ableist? Either way, they're potentially icky because they can feed into the notion that a man that is unable to have sex is somehow worth less than a 'complete' man."
SRSDiscussion,39b8vr,Noob616,4,Thu Jun 11 17:24:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I definitely agree. Donna is a total step in the right direction for the portrayal of transgendered people in TV.
SRSDiscussion,39b8vr,NowThatsAwkward,7,Wed Jun 10 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a shame the show is mostly known for weed jokes and rickyisms, there's so much more to like about the show. It's actually very progressive and far more so than you'd think at first glance.  Randy and Lahey aren't a gay couple, they're just a couple. The characters don't make jokes about them being gay, any jokes and insults are directed at the relationship and characters themselves. Other characters make fun and joke about Randy and Lahey being together, but  not in any way homophobic. It's just something that doesn't seem to matter in the TPB universe, Randy and Lahey are openly bisexual, it's insinuated that Sarah and Lucy are bisexual, it seems like most of the cops in the show are gay or bisexual, but it doesn't matter, it's just a character trait. Then there's as mentioned the whole Don/Donna thing. We don't really know if she's crossdressing, transgendered, or if it's a multiple personality thing, but either way it doesn't matter. The moment she begins to identify as Donna, every other character treats her as Donna and she's just one of the girls.  I guess what it comes down to is that like straight characters in most media, the LGBT characters in Trailer Park Boys aren't defined by their sexuality or gender identity. They all have genuine character development and real story arcs that aren't explicitly about them being LGBT. Randy's defined by eating cheeseburgers, and Lahey's defined by drinking, their characters aren't about their sexuality. Even the jokes made about them having sex aren't about the fact that they're gay, it's that they get dressed up in these hilariously ridiculous costumes. It would be the same humour if it were a straight couple."

I'm another one of those who started watching it back when I was 'edgy' but when I picked up again last year starting at season 6, I was pleasantly surprised.   Something that made me more uncomfortable in the beginning was their portrayal of Bubbles. He seemed a bit one-note and over-the-top to me, even when I first watched it. I think that aspect of the show has mellowed over time. The 'Bubbles voice' is far less prominent, he as a character is more nuanced.   It could be that the show matured in other ways in the later seasons- I'm not sure since didn't want to try re-watching the first few seasons again since it seemed to improve so much over time. I didn't want to chance not being able to handle the cringe."
SRSDiscussion,39b8vr,DrScrubbington,10,Wed Jun 10 21:02:01 2015 UTC,"I think bubbles is the most progressive character. While his disability is occasionally played for laughs, none of the other characters treat him as lesser and he's often the smarter character."

Yes, coke bottle glasses are hilarious, but the person behind them is no less worthy for them.  I like the scene where Randy comes to Bubbles about his bisexuality, and Bubbles pulls up pornography depicting women (presumably, because Bubbles is heterosexual) and asks Randy ""do you like that?"" and Randy says ""Yeah, I like that"" and Bubbles says ""me too, Randy"".  Then, Bubbles presumably pulls up homosexual pornography or at least pictures of men, and although he looks away, asks Randy ""do you like that too?"", Randy says ""Yes"" and Bubbles says well, that's normal Randy, you just like both things and that's fine."

It's worth emphasizing here that Europe's new and most dangerous anti-Semitism is a product of a coalition between the Islamist far-right and the more traditional far-left. ""Traditional"" right-wing anti-Semitism is effectively moribund - people like Orban are worrying and possess and appeal to dinosaur attitudes, but they are not the ones murdering Jews in the streets.  The Left/SJ communities find it extremely easy to criticize (the comparatively few) right-wingers who are anti-Semitic. It's fairly straightforward - there was even one in this very thread who was just bounced out for being a knuckle-dragging, slobbering Nazi.   However, criticism of Jew-hatred present on the Left is something we find much more difficult, partly because ""our"" anti-Semites are often Muslim (i.e. brown/non-white). These conversations which we need to have are then also deliberately obfuscated by the pathetic/hateful ""I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm anti-Zionist!"" brigade."

And before someone makes an unnecessary comment, I'm not saying that all anti-Israel behavior is antisemitic. But it can be, and even if it isn't, the intense focus on and the demonization of Israel in many environments can make Jews feel highly uncomfortable.   I'm Jewish and I don't really experience antisemitism firsthand. Maybe it depends on where you're from or if you where a Kippah or something else that indicates you're Jewish. I live in an area with many Jews and most of my friends are Jewish. So perhaps it's different for me than for others. There's a lot of antisemitism online, but much of that is so silly that it amuses me more than it offends me. But given the amount of antisemitism online, it's likely that there are a lot of people with those feelings that are just bottling it up."
SRSDiscussion,393894,Leninator,6,Tue Jun 9 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"I think antisemitism is largely ignored in the Social Justice community because the most extreme forms of antisemitism come from groups viewed as oppressed   I don't necessarily agree with this, and I'm going to argue why this isn't the case in Australia - things may be different in the US, and I know they're definitely different in Eastern Europe where anti-semitism is a real, tangible political force that needs to be countered by the left.   The main reason I think that antisemitism is largely ignored is because it's nowhere near as prevalent in the west as other forms of racism are - specifically islamophobia.   The concrete reality in the west is that Jewish people aren't systemically oppressed. I don't at all mean this in a way to lessen the realities of the history of antisemitism, which culminated in the brutal horror that was the holoaust - or to apologise for neo-nazi organisations - but there no longer exist any kind of large scale discrimination against Jewish people. Jewish people aren't subject to widespread street-level harassment, nor are they subjected to media hysteria about their loyalty to the country, nor do politicians routinely make speeches in Parliament calling for war against Jewish countries or Judaism as a religion, or calling to restrict the immigration of Jews.   In fact, the only times that antisemitism is ever raised by the Australian government is when it's cynically used to slander Palestinian human rights activists, as part of the general atmosphere of anti-Muslim racism they're pushing.    the intense focus on and the demonization of Israel in many environments can make Jews feel highly uncomfortable.   I think this is a criticism that needs to be solely laid at the feet of the state of Israel, and, in particular, pro-Israeli groups in the west that seek to equate support of Palestine with anti-semitism.   The way to combat this is twofold - speak out against anti-semitism whenever it rears its ugly head in the palestinian movement, but more importantly, politically counter the propaganda that organisations like AUJS (not sure what the US equivalent is) argue.   The reality is that ani-zionism =/= antisemitism. This is evident by the number of Jewish people who are supporters of Palestine and opponents of Israel, as well as the number of supporters of Israel who aren't Jewish. There's countless books written by Jews such as Noam Chomsky, Normal Finkelstein and Antony Lowenstein that all prosecute this argument, as well as from historical figures, such as Leon Trotsky, who politically opposed the zionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th century.   With this in mind, I reckon lessening our criticism of the racism and apartheid of the Israeli state would only be a betrayal of Palestinian and Arab activists - both in the middle east and the west.    But given the amount of antisemitism online, it's likely that there are a lot of people with those feelings that are just bottling it up.   I think this is pretty close to where it's at, but doesn't fully explain it. On the internet the few cadres of the far right can be as open about their intentions as they possibly want - it's all (mostly) anonymous, and has little effect on their real world attempts at political organising. IRL however, they keep their holocaust denialism under tight wraps and focus on where the real game is at - Muslims.   This for a couple of reasons. Most importantly is the fact that open antisemitism is political suicide. It's just not the case that there are large sections of the Australian population (or even strong but small sections) that think Jews or Judaism is at all to blame for any of the problems in the country at the moment.   The main force in society that they organise in opposition to are Muslims, and in their islamophobic crusade, the state of Israel is seen (rightfully so) as a staunch ally against ""ismalo-fascism""  Some anecdotal evidence: right now in Melbourne neo-nazi organisations are attempting to politically rebuild on the back of the islamophobic hysteria being peddled by the Australian government.   A number of leaders of their movement were out and open antisemites. One was taken to court over harassing a local Rabbi, and there's a collection of comments he's made praising Adolph Hitler, and talking about the awful Jewish scourge.   Today, however, those same former nazis are openly siding with the state of Israel.   This is an international trend as well - in the Netherlands Geert Wilders identifies as a ""zionist"" and the fascist ""Party for Freedom"" officially supports the Israeli state.   In France the Front National have dropped the holocaust denialism and now focus on combating the ""Islamisation"" of france, leading to numbers of French Jews actually joining the party.   In the United Kingdom UKIP have come out strongly in support of Israel - again, because the main game is fighting Islam.   In Germany, Pegida supporters routinely wave Israeli flags at their rallies, despite a number of their leaders being supporters of Adolph Hitler.   To sum it all up, the terrain of racism has shifted dramatically since the 1940s. The awful reality of the holocaust shocked into the west the consequences of antisemitism, and the creation of the state of Israel lead to a political shift in the ruling class.   This change in popular consciousness is clear to certain sections of the far right, and any fascist organisation that wants to become a legitimate force in society (golden dawn withstanding) has been forced to shift the subject of their ire away from Jews and onto Arabs.   For these reason antisemitism does not exist on any kind of the large scale that it did in the 20th century.   It continues to exist on the internet in places such as /r/conspiracy, (as well as a number of other awful subs that I'm not even going to name) stormfront and neo-nazi blogs such as Redwatch. But these fringe lunatics don't represent any kind of real force within society - and they certainly don't have state-pushed antisemitism to ride on and give them legitimacy.   The waters are further muddied by the efforts of Pro-Israeli organisations (especially on the campuses) who seek to cynically equate Palestinian activism with anti-semitism in an effort to discredit activists."
SRSDiscussion,393894,Leninator,4,Tue Jun 9 18:22:59 2015 UTC,"Look, I said in my original post that I was going to talk mainly about the experience within Australia, because I don't know that much about the situation in western europe (or, specifically France where I feel a lot of your examples come from). That being said, I'm gonna try and reply to some of the stuff you raised as best I can. Please correct me where I get factual points, or generalisations wrong. Examples are really appreciated, too.    For all intents and purposes, Right anti-Semitism is politically dead, and extensive arguments against it are a strawman.   Yes. This is precisely the point I was making - the organised right, both the far and moderate, no longer push anit-semitism. Nor does the ruling establishment. The main game today is islamophobia, and the state of Israel is seen as an ally in this struggle. For these reasons there does not exist any kind of mass hysteria in the media or the political establishment against Jews.  Likewise, the far right today is not attempting to break into the mainstream using antisemitism as an ideological base. They're using islamophobia.   That is one of the reasons that the struggle against antisemitism is not stressed as much as the struggle against islamophobia, or racism against refugees is. Because antisemitism is something pushed by fringe nutters in society and, actually, has no legitimacy at all in Australian politics.   Modern anti-Semitism, referring to the anti-Semitism that is presently most common in our society, which Jews fear, is a product of the Islamist far-Right and it is given political cover by the far-Left.   Again, I'd argue that this is factually incorrect, and the equation of anti-zionism with antisemitism is wrong and disingenuous. I'd like you to genuinely refute the points I made in my original post, specifically in relation to the number of Jewish leftists who are opponents of the state of Israel. Do you consider them to be anti-semites? Or do you consider them to not exist at all?   I have never in all my years as a member of the organised left and as an activist for palestinian human rights, seen any defense or apologism for antisemitism. In fact, a large part of our organising in Australia goes into attempts to get left-wing Jews involved in the pro-palestine movement, specifically through the creation of Jews Against Israeli Apartheid. A number of leading anti-Israeli figures in Australia are themselves Jews. The most prominent (and best imho) is Antony Lowenstein.    Toads like George Galloway are only the most obvious example of white far-Left activists joining into coalition with Islamists, but it is a pattern repeated across Europe (and beginning to be replicated in the USA) by activists who see a common enemy in the State of Israel.   I don't know enough about Galloway to argue against you characterising him as a ""toad"". From what I know he's a bit of a nutter, a pretty foul sexist at times, and often takes tactically insane positions on Palestinian activism. So you're probably right.   Galloway aside though, I don't see what's wrong with tactical alliances with islamist groups. It is factually the case that the main anti-racist struggle taking place in the western world today is the one against Islamophobia. In Australia there are a number of racist laws that are being passed, the government's rhetoric is getting fouler by the day, and there has been a dramatic spike in racist attacks against Muslims. This is the same in the US, the UK and France. If Islamist groups want to protest against this then good.   One of the coolest things to happen last year during the passing of a whole bunch of anti-terror legislation was that the Islamic Council of Victoria came out against what the government was doing. It was one of the first times since the begining of the War on Terror that they've taken such a bold stand on a controversial political issue.    It's also true that we do share a common enemy in the state of Israel. Israel is a racist, apartheid colonial settler state that is central to western imperialism in the middle east. It would be wrong for any genuine anti-imperialist in the west to not be involved in the campaign to sever ties with Israel.   The question of radical islamists is a separate one. Take hizbut tahrir in Australia for example. None of the activist groups I'm a part of work with them, mostly because they have a strong hostility to the far left, and politically our goals don't align.   It's true that they do push a bunch of pretty foul antisemitic bullshit. It's also true that they're not at all involved in pro-Palestinian activism in Australia. No antisemitic group is. In fact, very few Islamist groups are even.    It is not white anti-Semites who are murdering Jews in their museums, their schools, in their supermarkets.   No, you're right, it's not. It's fringe nutters who are (rightfully) condemned by Muslims, the left and every section of the political establishment. This is in stark contrast to attacks on Muslims in their schools, supermarkets and mosques, which are facilitated by state sanctioned and state pushed racism, and not reported on by the media.    It is not white anti-Semitism which is on the march, and destroying European Jewish communities.   Forgive my lack of knowledge of western European politics, but this seems to be mostly hyperbole. As far as I can tell there aren't large-scale pogroms against Jews, nor are there major street mobilisations against them like there are against Muslims, characterised by the rallies held by the FN, Pegida and Reclaim Australia.    Your post is a brilliant example of what enables Islamist anti-Semites, by the way. A technical admission that ~sometimes~ Palestinian activists are anti-Semitic, followed by well over half of your comment saying the real problem is the Jewish state   Again, not at all what I said. I specifically pointed out that antisemitism has absolutely no place in the Palestinian movement in Australia. Not just that there is a political battle against it in campaign meetings, or at rallies or what have you, but that it seriously does not exist.   As I point out above, there are a number of Jewish groups involved in the protests. If you look up any of the rallies that took place last year you'll find Jewish speakers from those Jewish groups talking about how Israel does not represent the interests of Jews.   Seriously, look it up, there's some really kick-ass speeches.   Also, I never ever said the phrase ""The Jewish State"". Israel does not exist as a ""Jewish State"", and to claim that it does is factually wrong - look at the treatment of Ethiopian Jews in Israel. Look at the number of prominent Jewish academics and activists who are opposed to the very existence of Israel. Refering to it as the ""Jewish State"" is, on the most part, a tactic by supporters of Israel who attempt to muddy the watters between anti-zionism and antisemitism.    ""Islamophobic"" (a word invented by Islamists, btw, to forestall criticism of them by non, ex, and secular Muslims).   Wait. What? Holy shit. Are you serious? Are you saying that Islamophobia does not exist, or that it is not a real, serious problem? I hope I'm misunderstanding you right now.   EDIT: Here's the video I was talking about, where a member of JAIA takes the stage. Notice the complete lack of antisemitism, despite the fact that he openly identifies as Jewish?"

SRSDiscussion,393894,generaljony,10,Tue Jun 9 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"I think OP is addressing the tension between anti-Semitism and white privilege. I can only speak for the British context, but I believe it to be the case in America too, Ashkenazi Jews have been positioned as or coded as white since the end of the Second World War. That is not to say that anti-Semitism has ceased to exist, but I do not understand why OP is looking to recuperate the Jew as racial Other, when the politics of difference have moved on considerably since before WW2. That is not to deny our experience as Jews or our identity, but to realise that given that Jews, at least in Britain, have radically assimilated, the notion of racial Other is just untenable.   It may be said that Jewishness itself has fragmented with the rise in secularisation, the decline in ethnic solidarity, and the massive acculturation and eventual integration of Anglo-Jewry. Set on this context, and the quite middle class social position of Jews - 80% voted Conservative in the last election, the idea that we are read as off-white like pre-WW2 cannot be sustained.   That is also not to say the position of Jews in post-war Britain has been unproblematic. Tony Kushner has analysed the existence of post-war British anti-Semitism. The construction of Jew-as-different remains, he is still in an ambivalent position, but it is a far cry from pre-war.  Which brings us on to anti-Semitism. We need to reach more of a consensus on what anti-Semitism actually is. It is inaccurate to say, as one comment on this thread has done, that anti-Semitism is only relevant when it is an organised political force or is overt bigotry.  There is still a tradition of intolerance but is far more casual, more rhetorical (even polite) and difficult to detect.  Sometimes it becomes more pronounced – there is a static neo-Nazi rally in the North London on the July 4th, but by and large, it has moved on considerably since the earlier twentieth century.   We must also underline the construction ‘anti-Zionism does not equal anti-Semitism’. That is absolutely correct, one should be able to criticise the state of Israel or take part in BDS without facing charges of anti-Semitism, many Jews of the diaspora do so. Obviously, anti-Semitism does feature in the literature and practice of anti-Zionism (comparison of Nazis with Israelis etc) but this mustn’t be over-emphasised to derail legitimate grievances against Israel. There is a continual attempt to recast anti-Zionism as the new anti-Semitism – and I find this to be quite wrong.   To get back to the point, we can have an inclusive and respectful discussion on Jewish identity, and the continued existence of anti-Semitism, the problems of assimilation on Jewish identity, but I don’t think it is helpful to cast ourselves as racial Others or as being disabled by oppression. Our difference shouldn’t be erased, but neither should it be overplayed. There is a continued discourse of Jew-as-different, but Islamophobia is far more relevant, at least in modern Britain. The tropes once used against Jews in the early twentieth century, as disloyal, as criminal, and dirty are now being used against Muslims, and we need, as a community, to stand against together and with others against this."

If he doesn't know the people he's with, he won't disclose that he's Jewish. More often than not, I'm assumed to be the Jewish one, not him.

I'm bisexual and have hetero ""passing privilege"" but homphobia/biphobia affect me. Trans people who ""pass"" still experience transphobia and are affected by the fear of oppression.

I have also experienced some of these, nobody is claiming that anti-Semitism has ceased to exist, but he/she continually tries to recuperate white Ashkenazi Jews as qualified to talk about structural racism by citing examples - when they just cannot.   This is why his opening post was so ridiculous, OP makes continual caveats recognising white privilege, but then goes on to discuss Jews as if they should be voices in discussions of racism. He never goes into any depth about what this casual erasure actually is.    I also reject your claim that Leninator was being tokenistic - he clearly doesn't subscribe to the established Jewish position, I don't know whether he is Jewish, but is just anti-Zionist, which a number of diaspora Jews are.   I am very happy to discuss it - but it is hard to do so in good faith, when OP starts by writing poor history and bad sociology to begin with.

But I think a lot of people are assuming that ""Zionism"" = ""total support for Israel's current policies"" or ""Israeli nationalism"" which is in many cases, and the definition/historical meaning of the word, not true.   Zionism means that the Jewish people deserve a safe homeland after thousands of years in diaspora. There is nothing about that idea that requires the support of the way modern-day Israel treats Palestine (which is appalling). It says that the Jewish people, after thousands of years of expulsion and oppression and murder, deserve a place they can be somewhat sure will be safe. This is not a radical idea, and I do think it is somewhat anti-Semitic to call yourself ""anti-Zionist"" without any kind of qualification when you aren't Jewish. Fight against the government of the modern state of Israel, not the idea that Jews deserve a homeland. Unless, I guess, if you apply that idea consistently and talk about how all states should be dissolved, etc.   There's a really active conversation about this on Tumblr, which includes often Jews of color and Jews of different levels of practice:   http://jewish-privilege.tumblr.com/ http://littlegoythings.tumblr.com/ and  http://jewishsocialist.tumblr.com/  are the three I follow.

That is that a Jewish homeland is by it's very nature exclusionary, and being exclusionary can be argued to lead inevitably to apartheid, which is clearly what happened in the case of Israel.   I've heard various solutions to this argument from the standpoint of accepting the argument to be valid:  a) That said homeland should necessarily not be priorly occupied. Big problem there is that anywhere not priorly occupied is going to be, bluntly, a shithole.  b) That presuming you were going to put it somewhere priorly occupied, the place they put Israel was asking for trouble due to conflicting cultural, ethnic and religious attachments, particularly to Jerusalem. I personally don't find this argument very useful. It's happened, ""what ifs"" aren't generally productive.  c) That it's simply untenable to assume an ethnically specific state could ever fail to be exclusionary (and potentially ergo apartheid) simply because of population mechanics (the issues within Israel at the moment about the non-Jewish Israeli population growing substantially faster than the Jewish Israeli population).  There's also the counter-counter argument that acknowledges the inherently exclusionary nature of such a state, but argues that it's a case of a ""least bad solution"" (in principle, those arguing were not advocating an apartheid state).  I don't really have a firm opinion on said arguments myself, because I'm from such a multi-ethnic/multi-cultural area that I don't think I have the perspective to consider the matter fully. I will admit, however, to agreeing that, isolated from the issue of Zionism/Israel, the idea in principle of an ethnically or religiously exclusionary state is one I find distasteful."

I think what you're describing is one of the biggest complexities of the current wars that are happening. The ""Global War on Terror"" may have been officially ended, but the actions and policies still in place hardly make that feel true. In a lot of people's minds, it's still in effect.  If we were talking about Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, or Vietnam, it would be easier to consider them as people fighting against the US for their own freedom or defense of their country. However, the US is fighting against insurgents that are easily labeled terrorists because of their well-publicized usage of violence against civilians as a tactic to further their goals.  So we've gone from the media narrative of a nation protecting its borders to insurgent groups terrorizing civilians. That's why the narrative changes and the sympathy changes. It's easier to sympathize with an army fighting for change in it's country (under the supposition that they are fighting for the betterment of the country's people) versus a group that hurts people in an attempt to overthrow the established government. In the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, it's very difficult to side with people that hurt intentionally civilians as a tactic in the name of supporting groups that are trying to establish a fundamentalist government that offers even greater restrictions of personal freedom.  I personally think that there should be greater consideration for the motivations of people that are considered ""enemies of the US"".

I frequently wish we the US would stop involving itself in conflicts since I think that plays a large part in our current troubles.  Iran doesn't have people that literally demonize us for no reason. Our involvement in the overthrow of their government paved the way for their current government and was a direct cause for the hostage crisis in the 70's.  Believe me, I'm not ignoring the weight of responsibility of the US in the reactions of our ""enemies"".  I was trying to provide a framework for understanding why posters would be sympathetic to US soldiers and not those killed by US soldiers. I'm not saying the situation is right. In any conflict, especially when blood is shed, an ""us vs them"" mentality will emerge.  I was trying to describe the current situation and why the consideration for ""them"" is less prevalent than in previous wars. Even during WWII, the Korean war, Vietnam war, or even the Cold War, there was still a vocal sympathetic element that doesn't seem present today in the same magnitude.  Honestly, I'm trying to understand a lot of it as much as you are and trying to find the logic behind why today is different than yesterday.  I just tried to provide some of my own conjecture.    I suppose most of it comes down to this: the current perceived ""enemies"" are far more difficult to relate to and thus far easier to dehumanize. The ""enemies"" in Germany, Korea, Vietnam, and USSR all had discrete ideologies that they were trying to promote and institute that a segment of the US population could sympathize with.   Fascism and even eugenics weren't completely disagreeable in the US until after the war (and not completely so even then). Socialism and Communism had large support in the US which took decades to be stamped out and turn into reactionary vitriol at the mention of the words. Yet, when such ideas had large support, it involved a lot of sympathy for our supposed ""enemies"".  There isn't any such support for fundamentalist Islam in the US. It was quite foreign in the US to begin with and has an extra hurdle in that it involves a non-Christian religion. Yet it is at the heart of much of what has become known as ""war"" in the past 15 years. It's a foreign concept in so many ways to people in the US that having it as a motivation for ""enemies"" makes it really difficult to understand them as people. The lack of an understandable motivation, I think, is a key component to why it is so easy to dehumanize them. Let alone the sectarian differences that populate those regions!  I think until those issues are accepted and understood, the US is going to keep falling into the same traps it has for the past several decades."

Can't agree with you there for one simple reason: it's always the only article. There is no article on the fear an Iraqi faces from drones or snipers. There is no movie, very few books and no news coverage on the experiences of those that fall victim to U.S. soldiers.   The pedestal you have erected for these soldiers demands that these viewpoints don't enter public perception, otherwise that pedestal cannot be upheld."

Hell, I've met a few of LBJ's staff from the time. I've literally met my oppressor. I enjoy his company, understand why he did what he did, and also understand why he quit the State Department after a few years.   I still like this country. I understand why we did what we did, too.   Give the soldiers, the civilians, and the enemy combatants a platform, and you might be surprised about what you see.

SRSDiscussion,394l32,deadfenix,8,Tue Jun 9 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I considered removing that part of my comment because I don't mean to equate the two- it was just the first shitty reddit circlejerk derail I could think of.   I didn't realize soldiers couldn't be ""real victims""- it's a tough job often taken by people with few economic opportunities who receive little pyschological support post-discharge.   And while clearly you're never going to support soldiers, it's still considered a normal job and occupation by Western (actually, global) nations. Therefore it's okay for a British newspaper to discuss a soldier's perspective-we're not talking about rapists who are universally condemned as criminals. And again, there are hundreds of articles on all news subs about the awful things the US Army does to civilians, this is not a one-sided perspective when you consider the whole front page.     Coming back to your original post though, I think you're holding /r/worldnews to a higher standard than needed, or rather the wrong higher standard. Worldnews is already an ideological shithole, it only takes scrolling through a thread about Roma to see that. I'd rather people stick be forced to stick to the article at hand than shove Stormfront (or any other agenda) down people's throats."

It's a sadly common mentality online to explore ""the other side"" of a moral issue until it becomes the only side given any serious consideration.  Of course remorse and regret can be healthy. But there's a wide spectrum of healthy remorse between not giving killing a second thought and suffering from PTSD. The last thing I'll ever do is tell someone with a mental disorder that they deserve it. But then again, I work indirectly for the American government putting together educational materials on PTSD and traumatic brain injury. I can't pretend to be unbiased."

Yeah, it doesn't portray war like Tennyson does, but by presenting the American soldier's PTSD and alienation from his family as the only negative consequences of war, it implicitly supports war; rather than glorifying death and murder, it glorifies the struggle of the hero, of the man who fights for his country despite what it does to him, who puts America before his country. It's just a more covert form of pro-war propaganda."
SRSDiscussion,394l32,deadfenix,3,Thu Jun 11 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say the one-sided identification has much more involved than I can describe in a single post. I think a large part of it has to do with the ""military are heroes"" mentality that has occurred since 9/11. There's a lot of different reasons for that and honestly need a discussion in itself. It's partly jingoism, it's part ""us vs them"" mentality, and I think a good bit of it is knowing someone that has served in the military.  I didn't join the Navy desiring to kill anyone. No one I knew did. We joined for a variety of reasons but it was never because we had some bloodlust. More often than not, it was because we wanted to gain a good skillset and the GI Bill. In my case, I knew (or at least thought I knew) college wasn't an option out of high school. I didn't have the grades, family wasn't rich enough to pay for it and not poor enough to warrant grants. The Navy was a way to wipe my past clean, start new, and walk away with some useful skills, job history and money for college. I was hardly alone in this among my coworkers.  You may be able to say ""well you chose to join an organization that kills people"" but most that do never think that will apply to them. Even outside of the Navy, most people don't take part in combat. You can spend your whole career fulfilling support roles and/or only training for combat in the event that countries like China, Russia, or North Korea actually wage war.  It's easy to rationalize the decision with the idea that ""I'm not likely to be patrolling Iraq or Afghanistan"". In my case, I joined before 9/11. The US was in ""peacetime"" and scoffed at the thought that we'd be at war before my contract expired. I'd get my skills, experience, GI Bill, and then be off to a more successful life than I could have had otherwise.  Thankfully, I never saw direct combat. Hell, my ship never shot tomahawk missiles at anyone. I thought the Iraq war was bullshit. PATRIOT Act was bullshit. Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfield were walking, talking piles of bullshit. However, I still had to abide by the orders given. Please don't post the ""I'm only following orders"" bit either. One thing drilled into our heads was to follow lawfully given orders. The tricky thing is that when you're concerned about the lives of others around you or your own, you don't have time to think through a thoughtful debate on the issue. There's a lot of grey areas that can become difficult to understand fully until afterward.  I didn't get into combat but I found myself serving in roles where it was seen as a serious possibility. Where making the wrong decision could result in loss of innocent life, others alongside me, or my own could have been a consequence. It's not until after those moments pass that you can take the time to reflect on things from a non-stressed perspective. That's why, whenever I see comments about some military action publicized, I try to take it with a grain of salt. It's easy to criticize when you aren't part of the controlling element of a situation long after the event has happened. In the moment, you have to make very quick decisions, have to rely on training, and hope to god you didn't fuck up when you act or moment for acting passes. All I wanted was some job skills, a decent resume and the GI Bill... then I had to worry about whether or not I might make the wrong call.  TL;DR: I know I rambled quite a bit and I probably didn't quite answer your question. I just wanted to give a little perspective. If you have any questions, please reply and ask them. I'm usually much better at answering specific questions with more specific answers (though there will probably still be some rambling)."

SRSDiscussion,394l32,95RJ,2,Sat Jun 13 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of those cases where the blame lies with governments more than soldiers, because it's not up to any soldier whether the war they fight in is ultimately just. It's not a matter of giving soldiers carte blanche so much as realizing that virtually all militaries consist of people conditioned to follow morally dubious orders without question."
SRSDiscussion,394l32,Suppiluliuma_I,2,Sat Jun 13 02:13:25 2015 UTC,"Um only if soldiers are not moral agents would that be the case.  Since they are required to disobey some extreme orders, and since they volunteer for their jobs, I don't think that idea holds any water."
SRSDiscussion,394l32,JManRomania,3,Sat Jun 13 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"A soldier is conditioned to believe (and it's often the case) that disobedience jeopardizes their whole squad. Plus they're often making decisions with limited information (or lies their government fed them) under stress. Lucid moral choices with predictable consequences aren't as common as you might think.  Sure, American soldiers volunteer, but most militaries are volunteer forces and most soldiers don't get to find out what they'll be ordered to do until it's too late."
SRSDiscussion,394l32,Suppiluliuma_I,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:57:36 2015 UTC,"Sooooo, I just finished my reply and realized it was a bit longer than I though it would be.  I still hope you read the whole thing.  That being said, one major point I wanted to ask was in regards to this quote (please still read and reply to the rest):   Since they are required to disobey some extreme orders   Can you give any recent examples of this? This wasn't acceptable behavior when I served (00 - 06), nor my work as a contractor (07 - 10) and seems quite contradictory to my experience in general.  I won't deny that there were newsworthy incidents such as Abu Ghraib but those were the exception and not the rule. I won't defend the actions of bad people in the military but I hardly think there has been shown precedence of such actions being commonly accepted in the military.  And now for the rest of my response which I typed up prior to my previous paragraph. Please endure:  This is honestly a difficult question that people in the military have to deal with.  Like I said in another reply, we're to obey ""lawfully given orders"".  That isn't a phrase that is taken lightly and I heard stressed AND questioned AND answered quite a bit. The Vietnam War changed the military and how they do things. The atrocities reported then led to a big shift in many branches.  None of that has been perfect. We still had Abu Ghraib. However, that incident was treated quite harshly. That was an incident that someone could have and should have spoken out and would have been protected by military regs for doing so.  In all honesty, a lot of the military (especially the officer level which give orders) is VERY PR conscious these days. Almost to a fault (which isn't really much of a fault).  My point being, most officers aren't going to tell their people to do questionable stuff (eeeexcept maybe SpecOps...but that's a whole other thing). Most of the ones I've worked with actually try to do ""the right thing"". If nothing else, ""the right thing"" means not having their people do stupid newsworthy stuff and not impede their career.  Basically, the normal enlisted folks in the military, the grunts, the jarheads, the seamen, etc. aren't normally the about to do anything stupid that hurts someone since they are constantly being told doing so is going to get them in a lot of trouble.  In the Navy, they would force us to have ""liberty buddies"" in order to reduce the risk that we would screw up in a foreign port. I saw people screw up and not get liberty for the remainder of a deployment (4+ months of not being able to leave the ship because they got too drunk and stupid).  In all honesty, think about when you were a teen and lived with your parents. Think about all of the frustration of all of the rules and all of the bullshit. Think about how they could take away allowance and ground you. The military actively does that and does so regularly. 1/2 months pay and restriction x 2. Two months of restriction (stuck on the ship doing bs jobs for people during time off) and 1/2 months pay for two months.  My point is, the Navy or the military does anything but encourage dissent.  They're actually like working for/living with your parents for 4+ years in terms of discipline and liability."
SRSDiscussion,394l32,SIDWULF,2,Sat Jun 13 04:06:57 2015 UTC,"I would completely agree with the government part. I will say, it's not so much a matter of morally dubious orders as it is an issue of morally dubious situations. The biggest problem is that the orders given and the situations of military folks are normally legal on level they are delivered. If I tell you ""clear that house out because it's full of terrorists"", you clear it out and you only shoot people that shoot at you and arrest the rest, it seems legit, right?  Except it turns out the people you just arrested were sent to Guantanamo and they never get a trial. The big issue is that the military are usually far removed from the issues and have no other voice but to trust their superiors which might even only get partial info coughIraq Warcough.   Folks in the military are constantly trained to do specific jobs. Constantly. That is done because the jobs frequently need people to be able to act almost on muscle memory.  I was primarily trained to find and prosecute submarines. It's a very complex job and sonar is nothing like in the movies. It relies on a lot of memorization of frequencies and a lot of trying to turn ambiguity into certainty. If I make the call that what I'm seeing is an ""enemy"" sub versus a friendly ship, friendly sub, neutral ship, etc. I take a large part of the ownership of that call. If I'm wrong, there are so many levels of hell to pay it's not even funny. Being wrong means we shot a torpedo and possibly killed hundreds of people because I was wrong. There's no end to that guilt.  During security training, we learned how to secure a room with potential hostiles inside. Someone opens the door, you run in following the side of the room opposite the person in front of you, and you only pay attention to what's in front of you. You have to trust that the person in front of you covered your other side. Hear shots? Keep your head pointed forward until you hit a wall. Then you can look to the side. Hallway instead of a wall? Focus on the hallway in case there's an additional threat and hope the people in your team in front and behind take care of it. Your job is now the hallway. Once the room is clear, they gather behind you and you lead the way into the next room in the hallway.  All of that might occur in the space of a second.  My point is that we aren't trained to be unthinking. We aren't trained to simply follow orders.  We are trained to be able to perform actions under stress because we've trained so often that we act on almost ""muscle memory"" (depending on the job, more like mental memory) despite the stress. However, even then, some situations (like those I mentioned), don't allow you to just act on instinct and you're forced to act on your best judgement.  My point is we are trained to be able to react. We weren't trained to blithely obey orders or the government. We are trained to be able to hear an order in the middle of a heated situation and enact it.  However we weren't so brainwashed as to hear ""kill babies"" or ""kill jews"" or ""kill muslims"" and just say ""ok"". Boot camp does break people down and build them back up but it doesn't remove a person's ability for critical thinking!  A lot of jobs require serious critical thinking. Any technical job I saw (and my own which involved difficult troubleshooting and maintenance) required quite a bit of it."

All I tried to do was provide understanding and context to the thought process for people that are in the military.   You say this, and then have a paragraph about how you're only following orders.   No! That paragraph was anything but! I was trying to describe how difficult it is to balance the immediacy of a situation when you're worried about the lives of potential innocents, those next to you and your own. You completely ignored the preceding sentences which provide the actual context for what you quoted!

It had nothing to do with thinking it's ok to shoot women or children, put people into concentration camps or anything like that.    I was talking about situations that you were told were a high threat area and having to quickly decide whether someone (or some ship) acting irregularly was an actual threat or was just acting irregularly.  Despite what you might think, the window to act or not act is a few seconds at best. You're left with maybe 5 seconds to figure out whether your next action will ""kill an innocent civilian"" or ""prevent my ship from being blown up like the USS Cole"".  ""Is that boat heading towards us real fast going to turn away or is it going to ram into us and explode?""   The Navy heavily cautions... um, caution.  Any round round shot better have a damn good reason for being fired. It's a branch that doesn't deal with liability too well. I knew a guy that negligently fired a round and the only thing he hurt was his foot.  Got in a LOT of trouble. Shoot an innocent person that wasn't obviously shooting at you?

SRSDiscussion,394l32,speedrhino,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't handle it lightly.  I can say, with most tomahawk missile attacks, there is a lot of intel that goes into them.  There is a lot of work and paperwork that has to be done before even one tomahawk is launched. It's actually a pretty big event for a ship like the one I was on (a DDG).  I am, by no means, suggesting they were perfect. I can only say those methods were normally vetted quite a bit.  I like the ""idea"" of being able to act and having less death on the US side. Ideally, being able to through a robot out there should mean you should have to worry about its life as much. You have the chance to make a split second mistake and no one gets hurt.  However, that isn't how it's turned out...  They could've been used to make war safer, but I'm not so sure that will be now.  That being said, I think we might be both thinking of the same thing which is drone missile attacks.  I have a very...troubled concern for those.  I like to listen to podcasts such as ""This American Life"" quite a bit and I think that was one of the podcasts that first made a big deal about efficacy of US drone targeting. Basically, the a source in the US agency involved (forget if the CIA was still a part...that was totally f'd up when they were) admitted that cell-phone data was the primary component of targeting.  Then there was mention that some terrorists would force members to put their SIM cards in a bag and grab a new one on the way out. This was done to make it difficult to track leaders that had their cellphones tracked.  I just kept thinking: ""What the hell! Is this why we have reports of drones bombing weddings!?""  I mean, at what point do you admit that a method was flawed? How long until you look for a more accurate method?"

John Brennan himself said when asked about the wedding bombings, ""I've got news for you: terrorists go to weddings.""  This is just a particularly evil example though.  Bombing a residential or commercial building to kill a combatant is intentional killing of civilians.  You're excusing it by saying that there's a lot of paperwork.

SRSDiscussion,394l32,SIDWULF,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"I wasn't able to find the John Brennan quote. I'd like it if you have it. I never quite trusted the guy (who could trust anyone head of the CIA?) but he really showed his ability to lie when the Senate (finally!) started putting some pressure on the CIA. I'd really like to see the guy face some real repercussions for his crimes and lies. Sorry, the guy, and the agency, and Feinstein deserve a sub full of criticism all to themselves. A very warm sub... with lots of pointy pitchfork shaped objects.  So! Distraction aside.  I didn't mean to excuse such actions by saying there was a lot of paperwork.  What I was stating, was that what happened, didn't happen without a lot of checks and balances in the process. You couldn't simply have someone come up behind a guy at a console, squeeze his shoulder tightly and yell ""fire a missile there!"". There was a lengthy set of procedures that were involved. A lot of officers and high ranking enlisted had to sign off on documents that would lead to the end of their careers if they were wrong.  If your impression of the how the military acts, operates and how the chain of command works is formed by movies, you are most likely under the wrong impression.  Explanation does not = excuse.  That's pretty much been the point of all of my posts. At no point do I nor have I tried to excuse anything.  I'm merely trying to provide information. Treat me as the interactive version of an episode of ""This American Life"" or one of Jon Ronson's articles. I'm a personal story that can't explain everything but can explain my experience.  Ok...that was probably a little disingenuous.  I am capable of giving an opinion and an actual discussion.  Look!  I'm not remotely trying to be combative nor am I trying to excuse anything. I say that with absolutely honesty.

You have been quite inquisitive and respectful and I don't want to be anything but the same in response.   What I'm trying to say is that the rules in place are meant to prevent unintentional killing.  I know that isn't always true and there are examples of it. I think the current drone program is one of the most damning examples.  In that respect, I think the biggest issue is what the military determines to be an ""acceptable loss of life"".  Throughout the US military's history, there has always been an acceptable level of death. Actions in Europe and the death toll from bombings are something that wouldn't be acceptable today. That much is good! However, I think it's also a rather small step to say ""Well, we're not as indiscriminate as we were in WWII"".   We have the technology to be so much better and this is one of the major points I find myself disappointed. I think this is a point that needs constant criticism!  We don't have the tech to completely exclude casualties bit we have the tech to do better. However, if you forced me to choose between casualties and no casualties, I would honestly ask: ""What's the potential casualty rate of the target?""  Can you completely blame me for that?  I'm not trying to be heartless. I'm anything but. Yet, I find that the older I get, the more I have to be pragmatic instead of idealistic. I hate it, but reality doesn't conform to my wishes.  Reality doesn't give me the convenience of trying to be  Shirou Emiya from ""Fate/stay night"". I want to. God do I want to. But, ultimately, I have to side with Archer. I don't want to. I disagree vehemently...but it's the pragmatic choice in the end.  I didn't ask to become jaded nor did I intend to. I've tried to keep my child-like curiosity of the world and the optimism I once held. After 30+ years of experiencing life, I've realized there's a lot more complexity and difficulty than I once thought. I've seen a lot of things and experienced a lot of things that frustrated me to no end. ""Giving up"" was not the issue in dealing with them.  Some issues just can't be ideal no matter how much you push for them to be so. Some issues are just ugly, and all you can do is learn how to best mitigate the ugliness and attempt to foster growth of beauty.   That's how it feels to be in the military at times.

But I do not recall any instances in which we got a head's up about the material. There are a few instances in which that would have been appreciated, but mostly I wish the professors had kept a bit tighter control of classroom discussion -- there were a few occasions where things veered into the merits of domestic violence, for example, or advocating violent transmisogyny.  My then-girlfriend was allowed to do an assignment on a different book, because partway through a novel (I don't remember which one; I was not in her class) there were some pretty horrible rape scenes which brought up memories of her own rape. So she spoke to the professor and was allowed to read a different novel from that time period.  I can only speak for the English department (it didn't come up when I was in the biology and chemistry departments) but there was a decided split. Some of the professors were proactive about making sure the classroom was not a hostile place for their students; others (namely the department head, RIP) were reactive but obviously cared. And some of the professors seemed not to care or straight up encouraged these things."
SRSDiscussion,38xm8h,plaid_banana,5,Sun Jun 7 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"I had a different experience in English (graduated last year). A lot of the topics for my classes were pretty grisly (colonialism, the crusades, 9/11 narratives, BDSM), and for any of the more graphic texts, I feel like we got fair warning, with maybe one or two missed. In one of my classes, we watched Girls and anyone who didn't want to watch or participate in the discussion of the rape episode were totally allowed to.   Specifically, for the BDSM a class, we were told Day 1 that basically every text was going to be really graphic and that there would be discussion of bondage, rape-play, etc in the texts and class meetings. At the end of the semester the instructor screened a film that we got to choose and the class picked A Ma Soeur by a landslide. That instructor particularly did a great job keeping the discussion in check, despite it being a lot of non English majors in the class.   Overall, I think it was mostly the discussions that got out of hand, if anything. Mostly in lower level English classes or in non English classes."

Never once did we receive a heads up on anything that we were going to read. Now that I teach English (high school), I too teach some things that are rather graphic, but I always give content warnings as far in advance as I can."

While I do not fault those of my professors who were reactive rather than proactive, I certainly believe that I owe my students the responsibility of proactively making the classroom a safer place for them to learn."

But what classes are these? The complaints about students wanting trigger warnings aren't the examples you cited where a student is taking a required Comp 101 class and may be triggered by depiction of a rape.  The complaints are more geared towards law students who request trigger warnings on descriptions of rape (just check a few of the google results for it). They are geared towards students who sign up for African American Lit or a gender studies course as a free elective or as the major they selected and expect trigger warnings for racial slurs or gendered violence.  The distinction is when the ""triggering content"" is essentially a critical part of a major and the student should be able to handle the content.   Here is another write up from a professor who is defending trigger warnings:   ...This scene painfully recalls a moment in my own life, and though my students are increasingly spared such moments, there are always a couple who feel what I feel. Does this novel deserve a trigger warning? It doesn’t, and here’s where I draw the line. Though I might be disturbed by that scene—might find it very difficult to read and to contemplate—I’m not traumatized by it. The difficulty I experience is part of the difficulty of life, the difficulty many queer people experience, and have to learn to endure. Likewise, the black students who sign up for my courses in African-American literature know what they’re signing up for. They’re there not to avoid difficulty, but to learn from it.   https://www.skidmore.edu/center-leadership/documents/MasonStokesTriggerWarnings.pdf  http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2014/05/29/in-defense-of-trigger-warnings/#disqus_thread"

If you can't handle the basic subject matter, you have to change your major.   My favorite prof still warns people, because she's kind, but she mainly warns us to steel us - her doctorate is focused on nuclear weapons, she got it from Cornell, and she was one of the star students at Jawaharlal Nehru university, she's taught at Harvard and Stanford, and she openly tells us that everywhere she's been, the foreign policy field is incompatible with squeamishness.

SRSDiscussion,38xm8h,minimuminim,7,Thu Jun 11 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"In my experience, I've not had an incident where a single professor outright refused to make accommodations for a student where the request was within reason, which certainly applies to students with disabilities of any sort. I took a class on anthropological understandings of childhood, where we did deal with topics such as child abuse and child soldiers, and various fairly detailed accounts of children with terminal illnesses. All of these topics were made quite clear, if not by the titles of the assigned readings, then by our professor warning us usually a week beforehand. Everyone got one ""freebie"" unexplained absence, after which you were meant to email said professor if you couldn't make it to class for any reason.  Even the most adamantly anti-trigger warning professor I've ever had a class with more or less fell over themselves to accommodate a student's needs, even just for things like scheduling. I work in gender and sexuality studies, so sensitive content comes up for me on a pretty regular basis. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect my fellow students in this field to anticipate that. It's pretty clear what we're going to be studying when we go into the field. But surely a student who takes the initiative to ask a professor or to inform them that they have issues that need to be accommodated shows more initiative and willingness to engage with the subject matter, not less.  I am very much in favour of some sort of warning when something with an otherwise innocuous title might have disturbing content, but when your reading is titled something along the lines of ""An Ethnography of Children with Terminal Cancer"" (which is more or less what I read), I think it's safe to say that anyone who took any time at all to glance at the title knows what it's going to be about. It is disingenuous to assume that those are the kinds of things students need trigger warnings about. On the other hand, if we're being asked to watch a film as part of, say, a course on filmmaking, and the film contains a scene of sexual assault (no other foreshadowing, common knowledge etc. to hint at it), I don't think it's that big an ask to mention it beforehand."

Likewise, I took a class that heavily focused on the darker side of humanity (a LOT of genocide discussion), and there were never any trigger warnings, although day 1 we were warned about the material that would be covered in the class, and were told that we could leave at any time if it became too much for us -- but I mean, in a class like that, it was kind of exactly what was written on the tin."

I think the questions we need to be asking is whether the works containing certain content really needs to be in courses at all, from the perspective that a non problematic text is almost always available in the same vein. I think the claims of censorship are just ridiculous; no one is trying to get anything banned, just rethinking what goes in to courses and what will have the most positive outcome for students is not censorship. Does intellectual growth really require works with graphic content? If professors are able to assign alternative works, why not just have those works as the main content to begin with?"

So why is it such a big deal now, and specifically why do people to react to calling these warnings ""trigger warnings"" with such vitriol.    If professors are able to assign alternative works, why not just have those works as the main content to begin with?   There is often value in works that contain potentially triggering content.

SRSDiscussion,38px78,arjun10,4,Fri Jun 5 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"I recently attended an anti-discrimination training in San Diego with the Women of Color Network as a white person, and I have some opinions that I hope are not too terrible or misinformed. There were some white people that came out with pretty dreadful comments. They involved women of color and their perspectives and feedback in every training session, which was great, but a handful of white people were downright combative in their responses. One example was a woman of color expressing frustration over white people believing that with enough training and reading, they could become experts on the lived experiences of people of color. The white person in question then countered that it's really important that white people feel like they should not be afraid to make mistakes and keep speaking up, to which the original woman responded with intense frustration that she had not said that white people need to just shut up. The white lady said that that wasn't what she meant either, but the damage was mostly done and that particular speaker of color, who had made many really important points, was mostly silent for the rest of the trainings, and several women of color had left the ally training events in tears, which I think is fairly terrible. I don't know what the solution is, but I felt like that whole exchange was bad.  And I think that a lot more focus needed to be on education in these events, I felt beyond lucky that Tony Porter gave an hour and a half talk on structural and institutional racism, and our role in propagating these racist institutions as employees, but the remaining 7 hours were focused on white people being introspective and talking one-by-one about our feelings. Which was great, but I feel like white people do not have the answers to these questions, and after such a previously elucidating talk from an expert on the subject, 7 hours of white people talking about how they felt like they needed to be doing more in their companies felt like a waste of focus.  But those are my opinions, I'm probably just salty that I didn't get to hear Tony Porter talk more.

Simply talking about racism and oppression and structural repression in abstract terms is always going to be a clusterfuck.  I really don't think there is a way for everybody who enters such sessions to come away feeling 100% good.  People are going to enter with different conceptions, different contexts, different perspectives--not all of which are going to jive with one another, and not all of which are going to be resolved purely through discussion in a a few hours of discussion.  It's action that breaks down divisions between groups of people, whether those divisions are based on race, gender, or creed, and thus we probably need to move more toward concrete action, and away from just talking about stuff.    The exchange that you participated in might have been bad, but I don't think that's the fault of the participants--rather, its the fault of the structure and setting that the participants were placed into.  At the end of the day, if we don't set up structures that are effective at incorporating a variety of backgrounds and perspectives--particularly those that have backwards or strange views on race, gender, sexuality, etc.--then we're not going to be effective at changing society for the better."

I will say that I've only attended a few diversity ""training"" sessions or conversations that were solely about race, but I've had what I, as a white person, interpreted as pretty good experiences. Most of the sessions have been ones that my employer did for employees and the community, and my organization is mostly white, although more diverse than others in the area, I suppose. I also work for a domestic violence shelter/ anti-violence advocacy agency. I add that because as advocates, we act not as a director or a counselor, but more as amplifiers for our clients. We will share what choices we know of that exist in the community and share with them what we know about safety planning, legal action, medical needs, etc, but ultimately our clients make their own decisions. We're all about empowerment and not paternalism. And I think this is something that certain white allies I've known don't understand. For me, my role as an ally isn't to ""shut up and listen"" all the time nor is it to talk over others and interject and whitesplain every racial problem away. Shut up and listen, and then use your privilege to make change by being that amplifier, not be injecting your own agenda.   One of my most negative experiences with this was at a conference that centered around safety and domestic violence advocacy with individuals with disabilities and D/deaf individuals. I went to a session that was supposed to be a discussion on dismantling oppression. The first 50 minutes of the 1.5 hours was the presenter having us play Oppression Olympics. She gave us a list of categories [age, race, sex (she refused to do gender/trans/cis, and only ""biological sex""), disability, national origin, indigenous status, etc]. She described groups as either AGENTS of oppression or TARGETS of oppression. Fair enough, this is nothing I hadn't heard before and seemed to make sense.   BUT THEN. She started asking us. Age was pretty easy (consensus found soon), but she wanted us to pin down an age range of privileged/oppressed. Race was pretty easy, sex, and so on. But when we got to disability, she described the targets of oppression as those with visible disabilities and those who are D/deaf. I suggested adding ""invisible"" disabilities and she fought with me and one other person over this for about 10 minutes, about how an invisible disability does not oppress you in any way, but you know, she also said she is not disabled. She legit said all of that. So I started rambling off examples of how I, someone with mental illness and multiple TBIs, experiences oppression, and a few others joined in. She finally just said ""well thanks for sharing your opinion"" and moved on to the next category.   end rant. I needed to ge tthat out lol.   Edit to add the point of my disabilities example: Silencing those with real-world experience is a super shitty thing to do and don't do it ever."

People that are not very political, which is most people, do not respond well to this.  There is also a strong undercurrent of censorship to the views of a lot of people that would fit the ""SJW"" label, in that they try not just to counter, but to shut down opposing viewpoints.  This second point especially puts off people (such as myself) who think of themselves as liberal and agree on most points, but are also strong supporters of free speech.  I know from lurking around SRS that the view here is that you have the right to say something, but that the public blowback from it is on you, and nobody (such as a university) is obligated to give you a platform, and I agree with this.  However, when a college tries to be a free and non biased platform for its students, it is necessary that the university provide a platform for views that the administration does not hold.  When SJW's try to shut down events and invited speakers that express an opposing opinion, they are attacking the very non-biased nature of the institution itself.  This is always done under the justification that this viewpoint is not just an opinion, but is actually tangibly damaging to certain students.  This opinion is not only dubious on the face of it as no one is required to attend, but also unbelievably one sided.  I have never heard of a social justice type student group cancel an event because they had concerns that their event might have this same hypothetical damaging effect to conservative students.  The real nature of what is going on seems to be that SJW's know that most of the professors and administrators are liberal, and want to pressure them to change the fundamental nature of the institution form one that provides a platform for all viewpoints to one that selectively allows a liberal agenda, giving them the excuse of ""student pressure"" to hide behind.  This is just a step too far for me and most other liberals that I know.   I say ""I am a liberal but..."" to identify myself by my political beliefs, but not these tactics.  I want an institution that provides a platform for viewpoints I disagree with.  I want an institution that provides a platform to viewpoints that I find morally reprehensible.  I want this as a matter of principal.  I want this as a practical matter because a ideologically biased institution is a frightening weapon that can easily be turned against its wielder if the winds of public opinion shift."

Nick Griffin did end up on Question Time and he was made a laughing stock, the party's racism was made obvious.  And it probably hurt their support levels.

But I personally know a few ardently academic feminists as co-workers and I'm repeating their arguments. There are modern social justice (I'm uncomfortable using the term because frankly I learned my feminism 15 years ago so I don't know what it entails entirely) ideas which are disturbing to some academics.   For example, trigger warnings on course material. A core thing about academia is having the ability to expose students to content which may be upsetting. Trigger warnings can be construed as a road to censorship, I'm on both sides of that argument. After all, a class with no TW content is good for everyone, right?   There's also the fact that professors should have the right to teach content which is offensive. Not outright hate speech of course. But Mark Twain has a character called N** Jim. So should Mark Twain be banned? He's one of the most important authors that ever lived. I read an article about how an adjunct didn't keep his job because students were furious about Mark Twain being taught in class, and even madder when the defense was that the content was supposed to be upsetting.   Or to give a more stark but hypothetical example, what about something overtly racist and awful, like Birth of a Nation or Triumph of the Will? Unbelievably important moments in cinematic history, and propaganda films for the KKK and Nazi Party as well. Unlike Mark Twain, this is overt hate and openly supports two of the most racist, vile groups who have ever existed. But it's still important to teach.   You can be an ardent feminist and antiracist and still want to teach material which are offensive to those sensibilities. And more to the point, academics have the right to teach offensive material. Frankly, if you get an arts degree without ever encountering something which is upsetting or offensive to you, then your degree is bullshit."
SRSDiscussion,38ktaf,oskomena,3,Sun Jun 7 05:44:23 2015 UTC,"Another aspect of simply removing 'triggering' content is that it creates an illusion of a tolerant past (or even present), when that's not true, and minimise the consequences of very harmful behaviour - e.g. such as white Americans who think racism has been over since the civil rights movement or the abolition of slavery.  We need to know that people were and are bigots, even if it's painful. There are better ways to promote a more equitable curriculum - like highlighting accomplishments that were unjustly ignored, discussing those issues critically, and so on."

A completely reasonable proposal regarding trigger warnings that I have heard put forward would be a more extensive and detailed kind of syllabus which contains some sort of indication for disturbing material. Then students are able to prepare themselves for it adequately, are able to recuse themselves from the class if they are not interested in being exposed to that kind of material, and even to seek alternatives from the instructor, who may or may not grant them depending on the circumstances.  This seems like a totally reasonable proposal which dodges all of the problems you brought up.  To be honest, I think your post was mostly strawmanning because the feminists who talk about TW's have not (to my knowledge) often suggested we ban Mark Twain. Rather they have put forward something akin to what I brought up; a more detailed system of outlines for the benefit of the student.  Who could object to a more detailed contract?"
SRSDiscussion,38ktaf,BarvoDelancy,3,Thu Jun 11 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"One thing for context is to differentiate offense and harm. Somebody who has a panic attack because they're exposed to a scene of racial abuse is harmed by the content. Somebody who gets really upset reading about racism is offended.   The balance here is to protect people from harm, but to not protect people from being offended. A prof has a right to offend students. Right wingers get offended by progressive content all the time. Their feelings are just as valid, right?  Short of hate speech which is harmful and not just offensive, all ideas are worth considering in an academic context.   By including trigger warnings or just content warnings and allowing students to recuse themselves from class, you could see a good number of students simply skipping out on major sections of courses because they may be offended by it. Very soon the incentive is to never teach content that could offend a student.   That said, I may be tilting at windmills here. I could find one instance of a professor who got in trouble for teaching Mark Twain but otherwise students generally are there to learn. But there is always a cost for these kind of policies, and that cost should be examined seriously. Perhaps through some pilots and what not. Some professors I really respect are nervous about the TW idea, and so I want to take their concerns seriously, even if I am generally in favour of TWs."

Like the thing where the only possible source of criticism is bigotry and evil, therefore your critics are evil.  My politics are pretty obvious, but if it'll carry some more weight, /u/Multiheaded is considerably leftier than I am, and is saying some similar things.  It makes sense that if you have a publically-lefty professor who secretly holds bigoted viewpoints (though you'd think he'd have picked a different job), he'd bring up real, legitimate criticisms of how social justice is executed. It's analogous to this thing about Cindy Sheehan and Shirin Ebadi. It shouldn't matter if he's a horrible jerk; these things are real. Perhaps less so in academia than in internet culture (I wouldn't know, I'm not in academia), but we're all on the internet here, and it's a bit... reductive to assume that anyone who critiques bad memes in social justice is really just hiding their bigotry.  For what seems to me like excruciatingly calm criticism of social-justice, I can do no better than to point you to Scott Alexander, whose actual views are generally pretty leftish, but who's sharply critical of SJ culture and methods. Start with ""In Favor Of Niceness, Community, And Civilization"", and follow up with ""Living By The Sword"". (For contrast, here he is saying good things about trigger warnings; this is the post that convinced me that trigger warnings are a good thing.)  The problem isn't the goal of not being so terrible to each other. The problem is the scary internet mobbing, the idea that the importance of the cause justifies pretty much anything you do in its service, and the horribly manichean view of things which ends up turning into terrible infighting. Of course, people who just like bigotry will adopt these criticisms as well. This doesn't mean that scary internet mobbing is a great idea and only evil bigots think otherwise."

It was only by saying ""you know what, GamerGate, you aren't part of us. We do not have to tolerate you."" that progress towards tolerance was made.

I don't buy the idea for a minute that social justice or ""liberal"" students are the problem.    I once saw an adjunct not get his contract renewed after students complained that he exposed them to ""offensive"" texts written by Edward Said and Mark Twain.    is the problem. There are so many more graduating PhDs than there are academic slots, so university admins can easily find someone who won't rock the boat or draw attention.   What this article, and the others I've seen do, however, is blame a legitimate problem on a caricature of social justice advocacy. They have inflated a reasonable request for content warnings on syllabus material into an attack on intellectual rigor.   On the internet it's so easy to find the most extreme voice or the loudest voice, and prop that person up and say ""look, this is what feminism wants to do!"" This isn't a new problem, but it's made so much easier when you can find someone's rather extreme views on Twitter and tell those who don't know better that this is what everyone wants to do.   I don't know what the solution is, except to keep fighting for things that are important and to keep pointing out the problems in arguments like these. To show where academics are being disingenuous, are using their authority and people's assumptions about ""liberal academia"" to uphold the status quo instead of understanding that things change.  And we can help call for better job security for adjuncts, so that honest discussion can happen and discipline can be for real complaints/abuses instead of any kind of student unhappiness."
SRSDiscussion,38ktaf,qwe2323,12,Tue Jun 9 13:45:55 2015 UTC,"There are certainly reasons to object to certain readings as offensive to social justice values. Many of these readings could also be important to read in an academic setting. Context is important. The problem is when one student can object to any reading for any reason and it carry weight enough to have a severe negative effect on the instructor.   You're right, it is not the students claiming to be doing this for reasons of social justice - it is our current academic climate/system overall. Professors are scared for their jobs because they are more replaceable than ever. It is easy to blame current socio-political movements for this threat, but they're just the pushing force on the weakening academic environment. For some things, this is great. But when anyone's pet project can cause immediate reactionary changes in the academic environment, professors begin to feel threatened by it.   So basically, I can totally see where the author of the Vox article is coming from. It is easy to blame current the far-left or ""social justice warriors"" for what is happening - but they just happen to be the ones currently there to push forward on a system that coincidentally is more reactionary to student demands. Really, anyone with a voice loud enough will probably find most liberal arts schools giving in to some degree.  I also think that the author's finger isn't pointed at a caricature of social justice advocacy, but at (to some degree) the fringe.

Things that you once saw only on obscure blogs becoming mainstream. At the same time though, increasing radicalization within parts of the movement. Eventually, I think that it became so radicalized that it started turning off too many people. The turning point was #CancelColbert, because that's when they decided to go after a popular, liberal white man. I can't even remember what Colbert was supposed to be canceled over. But that is when I think a lot of social justice became a parody of itself. What is going on now is a Thermidorian reaction focused against feminism in particular. It really started last summer with the whole Women Against Feminism thing. GamerGate, and the backlash to the failed Rolling Stone article are additional chapters of the story.

That is correct, it is harmful for people to continue believing incorrect things, especially when we're considering something as important as a revolutionary movement from capitalism to communism. This is a commitment to both personal change and to educating others. The link between that and a religious movement is extremely tenuous, unless you're going to argue that all guidelines for conduct are semi-religious in nature.   Why do you think saying that ""capitalism cannot be overthrown using reformist methods"" is anything other than a tautology   You can read something like Rosa Luxemburg's ""Reform Or Revolution?"" for a treatment of this.    Have you seen an analogy between liberalism and harm-reduction before?   A harm-reduction strategy for capitalism doesn't really appeal to communists any more than a harm-reduction strategy for feudalism would appeal to liberals.

SRSDiscussion,38q0on,TheoX747,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:55:36 2015 UTC,"My kid has autism. I'm especially sensitive to the r-word. Decades ago it was a medical diagnosis, but now it is a slur."
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,twoisnotenough,5,Fri Jun 12 02:00:23 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, now I can understand what word you're talking about from context.  Honest to god I've never heard to it referred to as ""the r word"" before though."
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,TheoX747,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:09:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, well, it pains me to hear that word, let alone say it or type it. Tonight my husband made a poor ""short bus"" ""joke"" and I gave him the cold shoulder. God damn, son, your own daughter rides on a special needs bus, and thank the gods for the accommodation the state provides us. Our generation was raised to joke about that sort of thing, and hopefully it's fading away these days. Kids and parents alike are super nice to my kid. I hope the ""r"" word receives the quick and unceremonious death it deserves."
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,twoisnotenough,8,Fri Jun 12 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"I don't have an answer for you, but we can talk about this more generally. A lot of words have etymologies that are ultimately bigoted in one way or another, but I don't think all of them need to be erased from modern English. How old does the non-bigoted usage of a word have to be for its not-so-kosher roots to be forgivable? Is it just a matter of how closely people associate a word with those roots?"
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,praxulus,-2,Fri Jun 5 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't think the term ""noble"" as an adjective is at all divorced etymologically from its roots - simply because the word still sounds exactly the same. When the word itself shifts over time and no longer creates an automatic mental association with other words that share its root, then it is possible for a problematic word to become non-problematic. But I bet a simple psychological study would bear out that hearing the term ""noble"" as an adjective is a primer for thoughts about the nobility, the noble class.   I'm saying that noble should be considered a reverse slur, or something of that nature - rather that its use in it's current meaning reinforces existing classism, and surely this a bad thing to do.  A more appropriate usage might be, if I hear of a business owner exploiting their workers, or a politician disregarding their constituents, that that is very noble behaviour. Obviously this flies in the face of the definition of the word, but I think it helps get at the problem that there is with the current usage."
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,l33t_sas,2,Fri Jun 5 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with you that potentially some speakers do associate the adjective noble with the actual nobility, but unless you can show who use of the word is actually harming, I don't see why anyone should care. Unless you're going to go as far as making some sort of Whorfian argument that use of the adjective noble causes people to regard the actual nobility in a better light  ... but I at least would find that thoroughly unconvincing. Not to say that I wouldn't be interested in a psycholinguistic experiment which tests this hypothesis, of course!"
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,arjun10,12,Tue Jun 9 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think this issue has been raised as an issue because ""nobles"" as a class do not really exist in the Anglo-Saxon West the same way that they did in feudal European times when the word developed.  So while its an interesting observation and further evidence of how oppressive standards can be encoded into language, the fact that its no longer linked to a concrete class structure makes it a non-issue for most people."
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,arjun10,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely see what you're saying, and the thought did occur to me. But I don't see it so much as that the nobility disappeared, but that it transforms into the upper class that we live with today. The link is definitely weaker now, but it certainly isn't gone. Whether or not this is sufficient to remove the problematic nature of the term is a much harder question.   I don't think this issue has been raised as an issue because ""nobles"" as a class do not really exist in the Anglo-Saxon West the same way that they did in feudal European times when the word developed   As a possible counter to this: if this reasoning works, then are you saying it wouldn't be problematic for me to describe bad and/or selfish behaviour as ""peasantly""? Obviously there's no reason why I would unless I were incredibly classist, as that isn't an actual word in use today. But doesn't this point more at the comparative usefulness of the two words, rather than their relative problematicness? Or can an otherwise problematic word be okay to use, if it's simply common to use it?"
SRSDiscussion,38q0on,rmc,3,Fri Jun 5 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"It would be problematic, but I don't think most people are going to throw much of a fuss about it.  It simply doesn't have the kind of direct relationship with contemporary class structures and societal divisions that it used to, or that certain modern offensive words do that are racist, sexist, or homophobic toward existing groups, and continue to be used specifically to demean these groups."

Straight folks outnumber queer individuals at theses events, so don't worry about sticking out.  And if you have anxiety about not being ""queer"" enough, my partner (who is a bisexual woman) likes to say that being you is queer enough.

Straight folks outnumber queer individuals at theses events, so don't worry about sticking out.   I generally agree with your critique of corporate pride parades, but in the context of OP's concern this sounds like ""Don't worry, biphobia doesn't happen when things are sufficiently white-bread."" I'd be MORE worried about biphobia in that place, not less, because those are exactly the kind of people who think ""LGBT"" means ""white gays and sometimes lesbians""."

Besides, if someone gets shitty about a stranger they think is straight at an event they sure are making a lot of unfair assumptions. What if you or your partner is trans? What if you're poly? What if you're bi?  EDIT: I assume it's implied, but ""aggressive displays of heterosexuality"" are uncool.  While a lot of pride events are sexy and fun, you should probably avoid being gropey and making out with your husband or doing anything else that screams ""Hey everyone, I just want you all to know that I'm hetero!"""

To show that they have pride, even if society thinks they should be ashamed.     Why not use it as a day to let your husband know more about LGBTQ community."

This has gotten me some occasional negative looks, and confrontations, when I accompany friends to social events where many queer people are present.   How do I signal to people who I am without having to alter my appearance?  This is all the more confusing considering that, regularly, cishet men and women have feminized me for the sake of derision. I don't know how I can be broadcasting so many different facades to people without any intention."

It's why homophobia is the enemy—not homophobes, or even safeguarding from potential homophobes.

Prime is a safe space in the sense that bigotry is supposed to be terminated (or sometimes left up for visibility and mocked) on sight, but it does look upon and mock a stream of pure shit with no end in sight, and it is highly stressful to the point that plenty of people don't like to read it. That's a completely reasonable response.

I already understand that Reddit sucks and some redditors are absolutely terrible, so I didn't need the constant reminders.    It's like being forced to look at a trainwreck every day. At first you're drawn to the scene just to look at it from a distance. After a couple more days though, you realize you just have to turn your head away.

SRSDiscussion,38ffrw,Koeida,8,Thu Jun 4 12:46:22 2015 UTC,"As someone with manic depression, I learned the hard way that you have to be responsible for your mentality. I say mentality, not feelings, because while feelings are not under our control, our mentality is directly affected by the actions we choose to take.  When you say you are scared or sad, those are emotional descriptors - albeit weak and nonspecific. When you say something has led you to feel scared or sad, that may very well be the case, but it's more of a shot in the dark than most people are comfortable admitting, if they're even aware of it. When you say something is making you scared or sad, that is a victim mentality.  It's present in the way you're writing about this. You used the active verb! You didn't say, ""SRS Prime made my depression worse, so I had to stop subscribing."" You didn't say, ""SRS Prime frightened me, does anyone else feel this way?"" You didn't say, ""SRS Prime was making my depression worse, so I doubled down on my study of social justice, and I also have a few suggestions about how it can be more responsibly run.""  No, you used the active verb, and immediately followed it with, ""I will never understand..."" A statement of hopelessness. Why won't you understand? Are you stupid? Is your ability to understand people limited to 'people who are just like me'? Are you incapable of asking for help? We both know those things aren't true. No, you're not stupid. Yes, you are capable of identifying reasons for someone else's behavior. And yes, asking for help understanding something is always an option (and not one to be ashamed of).   But this has nothing to do with analyzing and contextualizing the anti-social behavior exhibited in SRS Prime, or your relationship to that material. You're not interested in that, and that's okay. I personally suggest making an effort to do so because I think SRS Prime is biased, cherry-picked, and utterly lacks any interpretation of context that doesn't have the worst implications possible. It's disastrous to base any understanding of anything (other than SRS Prime itself) off of what you find there, and thereby shares more in common with the shit-posting it mocks than it does with feminism or social justice. Those opinions reshape its content into something bland and uninteresting, and certainly not frightening. However, I may be wrong. So I can't necessarily suggest you waste time picking it to pieces when that isn't even your problem.  Your problem is that you decided to hand over your personal agency to somebody else. You decided that your time was better spent agonizing over bullshit written by trolls, assholes, and ignoramuses than it was doing anything else. You feel hopeless, you're used to feeling hopeless, and you found something new to justify feeling hopeless. Eventually the sharp novelty of SRS Prime will wear off, and you'll find something new to feel hopeless about. Prime will be another chapter in your great big book of hopelessness that you return to once and again to remind yourself how hopeless everything is.  Throw out the fucking book and move the fuck on."
SRSDiscussion,38ffrw,oskomena,2,Sun Jun 7 07:20:53 2015 UTC,"You feel hopeless, you're used to feeling hopeless, and you found something new to justify feeling hopeless.    As someone who's dealt with depression, this is pretty spot on. You just keep on looking for things to feel shitty about. At some point you need to start to live your life.  That being said, it makes sense for anyone to feel a bit worn out after you read Prime. Maybe the OP may also feel guilty if they choose to ignore it - and I say you need to handle as much as you can and learn from it so that you can be a better person. No need to wreck yourself over it."
SRSDiscussion,38ffrw,TheoX747,2,Thu Jun 4 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not really that affected by the abrasiveness, to be honest with you. There is certainly a place for sensitivity, but like /u/meowmixxed said, sugarcoating can sometimes make things worse. It's good to have opinions on both sides of the coin, and I do appreciate everyone's advice here.  As for the ""this is only a reason for you to feel hopeless"" thing, that's pretty spot-on in most cases, but for me, the issue is a bit more nuanced than that. I'm a minority and a trans person, and seeing the toxicity of people on Reddit (and elsewhere on the internet) makes me feel hopeless because it reinforces the notion that I'll never truly be accepted by the majority of society. Streams of random comments on the Prime frontpage along the lines of ""I'm still going to call him Bruce Jenner"" or ""Tr**nies get their own TV shows just for being tr**nies"" are far bigger blows to my sense of self worth than some unstable MRA's weird, sexist/ableist/misogynistic/racist/transphobic/homophobic screed. In the case of the latter, it's easier to complain and lament about these things. We know the poster is an idiot. We know that they are likely a veritable nutcase. But as someone else in this thread said, many of these are cherry-picked examples and most of the people who say them have serious issues. The more subtle, transparent vein of racism, sexism, and transmisogyny that I see on Prime every day is much more prevalent, very pervasive, and exists at nearly every echelon of Western society (exemplified by the microcosm that is Reddit), and knowing that this is the zeitgeist of the people who surround you hurts you in a way that doesn't immediately occur to you unless you're transgender. Sure, we make fun of people who say crap like that too, but we are 1% of people (the actual percentage likely lower) fighting against the other 99%. It can really kill whatever optimism you have for making the third rock from the sun a little kinder and sweeter.  Okay, enough of the rant-- it is definitely very sound advice to cut out whatever is making you feel hopeless from your life, and merge onto the freeway instead of dicking around local roads. Ever since my last suicide attempt it's one of the things I've been very proactive about. So point taken, and challenge accepted. :)"

SRSDiscussion,38ffrw,meowmixxed,2,Fri Jun 12 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you're right. It is too abrasive for unsolicited advice. I took the wrong path on this one. I should have first asked what they wanted out of this thread because I wasn't particularly clear on their expectations for discussion. I could have written something more in line with their needs.  That being said, I take issue with people victimizing themselves. Moreover, I have a distaste for when communities conflate supporting a victim with supporting their victimhood. To merely say, ""I feel you, sister,"" and move on is as if to say, ""You're right, and what you're doing is fine."" To add in, ""Maybe you should consider unsubscribing,"" lacks nuance and opts for medicating the symptom rather than healing the system. There is a time and a place for all of that, I'm aware, but the discovery of SRS is not a trauma to hold your tongue for.  If I'm right, I'm right, and I offer them an affirmation of their ability to do what they need to do. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I've said nothing to degrade the OP. Sure, I put their behavior in a context that highlights the absurdity of their position (or rather, my perception of it), but I'd call that telling the truth. Sugar coatings mince words."

I think sometimes people need to hear someone say ""you're right, I hear you"" and just have someone be a soundboard or someone to nod and listen.

SRSDiscussion,3864sx,doyouknowBRD,45,Tue Jun 2 03:05:51 2015 UTC,"The important thing to remember is that, on reddit, your argument is not necessarily for the benefit of the person you are arguing with.  If you are truly attempting to argue, your argument is for the benefit of the many third parties who are reading your argument.  It is very easy to get sucked into an argument hole with an individual who will not change their mind, on an old thread where no one is watching.  This is a waste of your time.  The only thing that matters is changing minds.  The only reason to have such an argument is if you think you can learn something.  Maybe you really want to understand why someone believes what they do.  If so, then continue, for your own edification.  Just remember you're engaging in a learning exercise, not ""to win"".  It can be very hard to suss out what someone else believes while you're passionately arguing your own point.  However, if you are arguing for the benefit of others, on a point which you believe to be sound, then remember that reddit is a stage.  Compose your message not for the person you are arguing with, but for the audience of your message.  Conduct yourself with dignity and grace.  Do not be the first to engage in name calling.  Express your doubts succinctly.  Use lots of factual links.  If the person you are responding to replies with a nonsensical and angry answer made of rhetoric with no substance, or with some kind of broken moon logic, it's often time to stop responding.  They do not have an argument which will persuade you, if they had an instant, devastating rebuttal to your point, they would have made it.  More importantly, if someone else is reading the thread, they will see you make a clear, well reasoned point, and your opponent respond with something that makes them look foolish.  Once you feel like the comment thread is such that a sane reader would understand your argument and you've rebutted every point made, you can leave it in peace.  There is no need to give your opponent a chance to dig themselves out of whatever hole they've put themselves into."

I've learned a lot from people who were willing to explain things and give sources, and it made me feel more prepared to have those discussions with people irl.  That said, it's not worth it if you are sacrificing your mental health. Another way to step back is to have an alt that you use only for this purpose, and don't stay logged in on that account. That way you can read the comments on your own time when you are ready for them and enjoy reddit away from those discussions if they happen to get toxic.

Like writing about what mainstream politics has achieved here, or doing ridiculous amounts of research for people who really, really aren't providing anything to support their points, or responding to ridiculous bigoted copypasta or etc., etc.  I justify this by (a) trying to be charitable and kind to people, at which I don't always succeed, and (b) making sure that I learn something. I think of this all as being sort of lazy-loading knowledge, and responding to other people is how it gets loaded.  If you're pinning your emotions on changing people's minds, you will very frequently be disappointed. Just put the truth where it needs to be, and make sure to learn something.

It's about sexual gratification, sure, but that sexual gratification is attained through the assertion of power.  It's harmful to talk about rape in terms of it being about sex because it leads you down the ""well, did you dress in such a way as to invite their advances?"" path; Rape isn't about sex, because it isn't about how sexy the victim was. It's about how you can control a second person.   Sure, I think that is possible, but my concern is that by talking about rape in those kind of terms - not about sex, etc, it actually makes that more difficult.   It depends on your definitions. Do you define a rapist as one who has raped, or as one who aspires to rape?  If you frame the consent discussion as ""This is how you have good sex. This is how you have sex with someone while being able to be sure that they want to have sex with you."" then why would you even need to talk about the motivations of someone who actually wants to rape people? Obviously you want to go into what would be rape, but you would do this from the perspective of how not to rape someone. You need clear boundaries so as to not make things confusing.

I do think there is a contradiction to some extent though - you can't teach rapists not to rape if they're doing it for power, doing something like that for power means you know its wrong and you're enjoying the violation of the other person. You have to know you're ignoring consent.  Whereas you can teach people not to rape when it comes to types where they don't know they're doing this, when they don't think about consent at all, as someone else said, 'unwitting rapists'.

As everyone knows, the accusations in the news have been about students assaulting other students, not students dating professors.   Patently untrue.    she attempted suicide two days later, now has PTSD, and has had to take medical leave   This doesnt sound like an accuser. That is a survivor. The author then spends the next few paragraphs doubting her and supporting this professor (who theyve never met).   In fact, it’s just as likely that a student can derail a professor’s career these days as the other way around, which is pretty much what happened in the case of the accused philosophy professor.   Ah yes, the reddity argument about false rape accusations.  /vomit   The committee was responding to a student-government petition demanding that ""survivors"" be informed about the outcomes of sexual-harassment investigations.   Doesnt this sound reasonable? Dont people have a right to know if their professor has been found guilty of sexual crimes? Dont people have a right to know and take steps to protect themselves from people who have been proven to be predators? Is that really so extreme?   The petition also demanded that the new policies be amended to include possible termination of faculty members who violate its provisions.   And the author acts like this is some sort of drastic measure; at any other reasonable workplace that had a decent HR dept this would be the case. At least in my field.   There was more, but my eye was struck by the word ""survivor,"" which was repeated several times. Wouldn’t the proper term be ""accuser""?   She attempted suicide and has PTSD. Does she sound like an accuser? Why are you doubting her story? She has said and done nothing that is worth doubting. The professor ADMITTED to trying to get her drunk enough to rape her, and take her home.     ban fraternities.    Literally the only thing I found of worth in this entire article.  Also the example of the book columnist is EXACTLY why the rules barring student teacher relationships: you cant reasonably expect to have a even power dynamic in a romantic relationship where one person holds significant power over the fate of the other, because time and time again returning that attraction (in the form of sex as it were) is no longer a non option for the other person.   He may have been an occluded jerk, but he was also a fairly human-sized one.   Not sure why she's trying to downplay this guys behavior. This dude cheated on his wife and kids, and used his power and position to force a romance on a client. this is not the behavior we expect from human beings.   Whether or not it’s a brilliant move, plenty of professors I know, male and female, have hooked up with students, though informal evidence suggests that female professors do it less, and rarely with undergraduates.   And no one was shocked ever. The author seems oblivious to the fact that we live in a patriarchy and that the power dynamics of relationships dont occur in vacuums: they are at least are influenced by patriarchy. Thats not to say that people have no free will, but its clear that society has a huge impact on choices people make and relationships are not immune from that.   The new codes sweeping American campuses aren’t just a striking abridgment of everyone’s freedom, they’re also intellectually embarrassing.

SRSDiscussion,37shx8,Engelgrinder,6,Sat May 30 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"Okay. It does not matter what her background is when what she's actually writing is victim blaming shit, like the smugly written survivor/accuser thing (which is exactly like what MRAs like to say).  She is systematically believing the story of the much older male colleague over the younger woman. A colleague who was old enough, and supposedly educated enough, to recognize the impropriety intrinsic in the scenario and to avoid it.  She is writing this to provide cover for a colleague and friend.  What we're taught in academic ethics in general, which especially applies here, is that the appearance of impropriety is nearly as bad as the actual existence of impropriety. At a grad level dealing with undergrads, the rules are: Don't date your students. If you must date a student, wait until they are no longer your student to date them. If someone you're dating tries to take a course you are instructing, ask them not to or to take a different section, if they do so anyway, inform your head of department promptly and do what they say.  All this applies triple for actual adjunct and tenured professors, plus the additional grodiness of there probably being a 15-30 year age difference between an actual professor and an undergrad.  The issue of the power differential is not just ""professor using their position of power to force etc etc on a student""; that's grody, and possible, but unlikely. A far more common scenario is that relationship leading to what amounts to cheating for the student, either in the form of more generous grading or something more overt. Once that dynamic is in place, it becomes possible for the professor/grad in the scenario to unknowingly force a non-consenting scenario due to the student's already existing dependence on the relationship for maintaining their grade. These sorts of relationships are often be instantiated by a younger student in an academically difficult position to try to improve their grade, but luckily, an easy resolution exists: don't date your fucking students!  Literally the only credible point here, and it is a minor one relevant to her larger thrust, is that people misinterpret these codes to mostly be about protecting students from predatory professors. That is certainly an extant part of it, but in practice they exist to prevent unethical behavior on both sides; students attempting to bolster their grades or standings for research, professors attempting to use the power differential to bolster their dating life, and every other possible consequence of that sort of relationship. And this is a MUCH bigger deal for professors dating their grad students, because professors are literally their boss and simultaneously hold a sword of damocles over the grad student's entire future career.  You don't do these things for the same reason you don't date your boss or subordinates in any professional setting and is a ""report to HR immediately"" scenario in any company meeting a minimum standard of professionalism, and dating among employee peers is often very strongly discouraged by HR.  In this case, the onus is entirely on the professor/graduate instructor because, surprise, they're the professional in this scenario and their student is probably just an under-25 student. more leeway is given to grad students fucking this up with undergrads because they are also young students, but they will be given a stern talking to and may face consequences even assuming no accusations of Actual Bad Shit surface.   Even assuming that everything claimed by the professor accused above there is true and the student is fully lying, well, this is why those rules against fraternization exist. The narrative she is presenting about this is grotesque and appears meant simply to cover the ass of a colleague caught in unethical, unprofessional behavior- and by her own admission, to cover her own ass for participating in the same.  Summary: don't date your fucking students. Don't take them on dates. Especially don't sleep with them. This is not a complex question."
SRSDiscussion,37shx8,PiscineCyclist,4,Sat May 30 18:47:32 2015 UTC,"There's also an analogy to the queer community that I could draw-- I know tons of men who had relationships with older men when they were younger, some of which that where illegal. Some of these relationships were horrible, abusive things, caught up in exploitive sex work, etc., but I also know people who credit their relationships with older men for who they are today as gay men.  How do we have to vocabulary to talk about this stuff? I have friends who feel alienated about discussions of this sort of stuff because the automatic assumption is that they were taken advantage of, or that they just don't realize how bad things were. The existence of these kinds of relationships, even if they really are just outliers, isn't a justification for railing against consent or legal protections for minors,  but we need a way to talk about them that is more sophisticated than just ""they shouldn't happen. Because they do, and will continue to exist, and we need to empower young people to make the right decisions at the same time as we condemn predators and abusers."
SRSDiscussion,37shx8,Engelgrinder,4,Sun May 31 05:25:59 2015 UTC,"She is writing this to provide cover for a colleague and friend.

You don't do these things for the same reason you don't date your boss or subordinates in any professional setting and is a ""report to HR immediately"" scenario in any company meeting a minimum standard of professionalism, and dating among employee peers is often very strongly discouraged by HR.   I think there's tension here between the ideas and realities of under/grad research. On the one hand, while I obviously agree that cheating is wrong, I'm tempted to tell you that preference and soft favors are just part of the game. Particularly in the part of the humanities where I operate, research isn't done sitting at a desk and some of the most productive discussions students and profs may have may be drunk at 2 a.m. smoking outside of a bar.   But that's obviously the rub--it's the humanities. As under attack as the humanities are, there's definitely an impulse in people like me to prop up this precisely fraternal idea of the academy. When philosophical schools of thought have met in cafes and operated more like small communities, is it really so crazy to think that people who are not only academically but ideologically committed to the same project would fuck?   Yet as much as I'd give a big fuck you to using a corporate metaphor to describe the academy, I'm all too aware that the pressures of research at the graduate level in a lot of respects is more high pressure than even the highest of pressure Wall St firm. Your invocation of Damocles is totally apt here, and it's upsetting to think that a students career could be single handedly be destroyed by a bad relationship.   At the same time, given how the humanities are under attack, there's a large part of this discussion that just makes me uncomfortable. I think the biggest thing I agree with this article is the notion that prohibition institutionalizes the idea that there is this huge gulf between professors and students. My aunt and uncle fell in love talking about Derrida outside of class--is that criminal, even if one of them was a decade older?   Which is to say, despite how the author may have written about the issue, I'm not happy with the discourse coming from the other side. There's a sense that everything is being painted with an extremely broad brush. Like, the suggestion that if you recognize that there are plenty of examples of healthy relationships between students and profs you're somehow condoning the abusive, predatory ones, the ones where there's a strong appearance of impropriety.   Like many things in our society, I wish that we could have a better conversation about consent, autonomy, and what it means to be in a relationship between two people at different points in life rather than just resorting to prohibition. As I said, I think these relationships are likely to continue, and I'm not sure pushing all of them underground is the best way to protect students."
SRSDiscussion,37shx8,papermoon1,5,Sun May 31 05:20:23 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest thing I agree with this article is the notion that prohibition institutionalizes the idea that there is this huge gulf between professors and students.   Thank you for contributing your articulate voice to this conversation. Reading her first article, I get the sense that Kipnis is/was primarily interested in opening a discussion about the seriousness/indestrucibility of ""power."" Power, she says, is not as monolithic and irresistible as we sometimes imagine. Indeed, power exists in a place of profound instability.  Because it is relevant to the discussion, and because I think you in particular might find it interesting, I'm going to quote at length (but also heavy cutting) from Catherine Waldby's ""DESTRUCTION: Boundary Erotics and Refigurations of the Heterosexual Male Body"" (from the collection Sexy Bodies: The Strange Carnalities of Feminism, all emphasis mine):   The culture's privileging of masculinity means that the hegemonic bodily imago [basically, 'cultural image'] of masculinity conforms with his status as sovereign ego, the destroyer, and that of women with the correlative status of the one who is made to conform to this ego, the destroyed. The male body is understood as phallic and impenetrable, as a war-body simultaneously armed and armored, equipped for victory. The female body is its opposite, permeable and receptive, able to absorb all this violence.   […]  The ideological function of these imagos can be seen in its starkest form when we consider the kinds of implications they carry for how sexual violence is transacted between men and women.   […]  If these imagos of sexual difference are treated as though they exercise complete control over the field of representation then they also render the choreography of 'normal' heterosexual sex, that is intercourse, politically problematic. […] In other words on this model no real distinction can be maintained between sex and sexual violence. They simply collapse into each other.  This reading of sexual practice, which I will call an ideological reading, renders sex between men and women as both synecdoche for and means of the unilateral destruction which [novelist Jeanette] Winterson says is attendant upon heterosexual relationships [that is: in a relationship one wants to 'destroy and be destroyed' [[referencing the identity-effacing moment of orgasm]], but men always 'want to be the destroyer, and never be destroyed': thus, Winterson's protagonist concludes, heterosexual relationships are fucking loveless (all unilateral, no mutuality).] Insofar as the woman is refused either recognizable boundaries, or reciprocal powers to violate her partner's boundaries, to transgress his sense of identity, then their erotic practice extends and shores up masculine privileges in the uses of violence and access to the kinds of social power which accompany bodily integrity in our culture. Intercourse simply reiterates the general process whereby his selfhood swells and hers disintegrates.  In calling this an ideological reading of sex I do not mean to suggest that such a reading never finds its correlate in actual practice. It would be virtually impossible, I suspect, to find a woman whose history of sexual relationships with men did not include some experience of systematic annihilation. Rather, it is an ideological reading because it assumes that it is only dominant 'imaginary anatomies' which exercise any force in sexual practice or in the wider field of heterosexual relations. It thinks that it is only those bodily imagos most deeply implicated in the maintenance of power relations between men and women, in supporting masculine ownership of the phallus and correlative feminine castration, which obtain in the everyday living of masculinity and femininity. This is an ideological reading because it assumes that everyday culture works entirely in the service of relations of dominance and submission, and it does not admit the existence of other possibilities for interpretation or negotiation.  The problem with this is that in closing off other interpretive possibilities such a reading tends to work against its own best intentions. It becomes self-defeating in the sense that it shores up exactly what it sets out to problematize.   Such a beautiful point. Look at this thread as an example: many well intentioned people, arguing adamantly for the professor/student power imbalance. It's easy to forget that, as critical thinkers and moral agents of social change, we're trying to disrupt and destroy that power imbalance, not trumpet it or bastion it.   Okay, a little more, to finish of Waldby's point:   Sharon Marcus identifies this effect in her discussion of feminist conceptions of rape, when she points out that in feminism which simply assumes a masculine penetrative drive on the one hand, and a feminine violability on the other, rape is inevitable.  It even amounts, she writes, to an ontology: 'To take male violence or female vulnerability as the first and last instances of any explanation of rape is to make the identity of rapist and raped pre-exist the rape itself' (Marcus 1992:391). Similarly, Moira Gatens (1995) suggests that any feminist work, notably that of Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon, which assumes the body of woman as violable space and poses everyday intercourse as a form of rape, cedes far too much power to a phallic masculine imaginary. Rape is arguably the social practice which takes the ideological imagos of masculinity and femininity most literally, which animates these iamgos most fully. But by assimilating all sexual exchange to the model of rape this feminist work helps to extend and naturalize these imagos rather than challenge them.  A more sophisticated investigation of the bodily imagos of sexual difference and their implications for subjectivity must take into account a certain instability in what they mean and how they are lived out.   From there Waldby essentially goes on to destabilize heterosexual intercourse, outlining a fresh way of thinking of sex as nonpenetrative (or mutually penetrative, or whatever--the point is developing a fresh fantasy that confronts the old one and reveals the biological, difficult-to-classify interaction between genitals), and also to suggest male anal play as a route to questioning/re-imaging penetration. Which, to be honest, I did not see coming the first time I read this article."

SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,WizardofStaz,28,Tue May 26 20:13:44 2015 UTC,"Hey there! ""Made to Penetrate"" not being counted as rape is a problem I've been trying to raise awareness of from a pro-feminist perspective for a while. A number of months back, I even made an infographic based on the CDC's numbers, and posted it to SRSDiscussion. I'll note, though, that I focused on lifetime statistics, not 12-month prevalence.  There's a few things I think it's important to point out:   First, it's good that you've found the 2010 report, but the CDC actually has out even more recent data. In September of 2014, they released the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) for 2011. For both women and men, the lifetime numbers for ""rape"" and ""made to penetrate"" have gone up. For women, ""rape"" is up from 18.3 percent to 19.3 percent. Where previously ""made to penetrate"" was left blank, the CDC now estimates about 0.6 percent of women have had that experience as well.  (Taken together, about  1 in 5 women fit in these categories). For men, ""rape"" is up from 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent. ""Made to penetrate"" is up from 4.8 percent to 6.7 percent. (Taken together, about 1 in 12 to 1 in 15 men fit into these categories). As for the 12-month estimates, in terms of victimization, they remain relatively parallel. (1,929,000 women placed in the ""rape"" category. 1,921,000 men placed in the ""made to penetrate"" category."")   As to why the numbers are so much closer in the ""12 month"" vs the ""lifetime"" categories, that's really good question. As far as I can tell, it's not something the CDC has directly addressed at this point. (If they have, I've missed it.)  It certainly hasn't gone unnoticed by other feminists, though.  I strongly recommend reading ""The Sexual Victimization of Men In America"" by Lara Stemple and Ilan Meyer. Their paper is based on the 2010 numbers, and came out not long before the 2011 numbers were released.  Stemple is the Director of Graduate Studies at the UCLA School of Law. She also directs the Health and Human Rights Law project. She's a self identified feminist, as she notes in a radio interview on the paper.  Meyer also works at the UCLA School of Law in the Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law. He studies mental health in minority populations and is the recipient of an Outstanding Achievement award from the American Psychological Association's committee on LGBT concerns.  On page 3, they note the following:   ""This striking finding—that men and women reported similar rates of nonconsensual sex in a 12-month period—might have made for a newsworthy finding. Instead, the CDC’s public presentation of these data emphasized female sexual victimization, thereby (perhaps inadvertently) confirming gender stereotypes about victimization.""   As another example, the activist group ""Know Your IX"" (started by two employees from Feministing.com) fights against sexual violence on college campuses, and is quite supportive of male survivors. They specifically advocate for 'made to penetrate' to be considered a form of rape:   ""Sometimes schools distinguish between nonconsensual 'penetration' and 'being made to penetrate' in their assault policies, where the latter is considered a lesser violation of a school’s policy, and does not rise to the level of rape. What this means is that if someone makes a person penetrate them orally, vaginally, or anally, without their consent, it will lead to a lesser punishment than if a student is penetrated orally, vaginally, or anally, without their consent. Make sure your policy does not draw this distinction. This will mean using a broader definition of rape.”   I hope this all helps!  (I'd really like to find solid statistics on genderqueer and non-binary victims of sexual violence, but that doesn't seem to be as easily available. I'm sorry I wasn't able to include it in my post.)"
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,IIIISuperDudeIIII,5,Wed May 27 05:53:00 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thanks for all the information and the detailed reply! I'll definitely give your links a read."
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,Alternating_Sum,9,Wed May 27 06:20:07 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about penises, erections, much in the case of other reactions to sexual stimulation, can happen involuntarily. People can get erections against their will, and many do. That includes people who are intoxicated, unconscious, drugged, or in extreme fear.  Slate's Hannah Rosen puts it like this:   ""We might assume, for example, that if a man has an erection he must want sex, especially because we assume men are sexually insatiable. But imagine if the same were said about women. The mere presence of physiological symptoms associated with arousal does not in fact indicate actual arousal, much less willing participation. And the high degree of depression and dysfunction among male victims of sexual abuse backs this up.""   Beyond that, Stemple and Meyer note the following:   ""A related argument for treating male victimization as less worrisome holds that male victims experience less physical force than do female victims, the implication being that the use of force determines concern about victimization. This rationale problematically conflicts with the important feminist-led movement away from physical force as a deﬁning and necessary component of sexual victimization.  In addition, a recent multiyear analysis of the BJS National Crime Victim Survey (NCVS) found no difference between male and female victims in the use of a resistance strategy during rape and sexual assault (89% of both men and women did so). A weapon was used in 7% of both male and female incidents, and although resultant injuries requiring medical care were higher in women, men too experienced significant injuries (12.6% of females and 8.5% of males)"""
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,Alternating_Sum,6,Fri May 29 03:53:13 2015 UTC,Yeah this is an important  point. A lot of people think of rape and imagine a stranger jumping out of the bushes who beats the shit out of the victim. In reality a huge percentage of rapes involve almost no physical violence.  Tons (possibly most) of people just freeze up and don't really resist beyond saying no. That doesn't make it not rape.
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,Alternating_Sum,3,Fri May 29 04:26:46 2015 UTC,Thanks!
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,PrettyIceCube,6,Fri May 29 05:42:01 2015 UTC,Seriously? That's like asking how is it possible to get a woman you abuse to stay with you. Abuse causes all sorts of psychological problems that will make you do things you don't want to.
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,Alternating_Sum,4,Fri May 29 05:14:16 2015 UTC,"Here's one type of scenario:  A man and woman (both cis) are making out consensually.  They're both having a good time, and he has an erection.  She suggests that they have intercourse, and he says no.  She climbs on top of him and forces him to penetrate her anyway.  Does that sound more plausible?"
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,mildly_inconvenient,6,Fri May 29 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"Well, she'd have to get his pants down, which would take some struggle time. Which would give him time to deflate.   Pants could already be down, due to pantsless makeouts.  Or maybe because he consented to oral but not to PIV.     I know it sounds counter to everything you've heard from MRAs who are talking about how prevalent male rape is, but you do have to be in the mood to maintain an erection. You just do.   I haven't spent much time talking to MRA's about this (or about anything), but I have heard from individual men who've been raped by women in this way, so it seems like it's something that varies person to person.  See u/tivooo's comments below, explaining an experience of his, for example."
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,Alternating_Sum,5,Fri May 29 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, anything is possible. But speaking from experience, if a guy is not into it, most of the time he will not be able to maintain an erection.   You're talking about your own experience though, and your own body. Doesn't it seem possible that different men's bodies may respond differently in the same types of situations?    Granted I don't have a penis at all, so I can only go by what others tell me. But for one thing, I get the impression that teenage boys in particular sometimes get erections when they're embarrassing, inconvenient, and unwanted, and that the boy's discomfort alone isn't enough to make the erection stop. Is it your impression that this doesn't actually happen to anyone?"
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,praxulus,35,Fri May 29 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"Forced to penetrate being separated from rape is because of disgusting views around what is and isn't rape.  This is part of the wider rape culture issue which has lead to around two thirds of all rape not being reported.    Sexual coercion in both cases also should be included in this consideration as well, not just what they defined as rape and forced to penetrate values."
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,8ace40,11,Fri May 29 19:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm also confused by that difference in ""lifetime"" vs ""12 months"" statistics for ""made to penetrate"".  I guess they could both be accurate if a small population of men is being revictimized repeatedly throughout their lives?    But then there's this, from the same report:     Almost half of female victims (45.8%) of lifetime sexual violence other than rape reported one perpetrator, approximately one-quarter (23.4%) reported two perpetrators, and just under one-third (30.8%) reported three or more perpetrators (Figure 2.1). For male victims of rape and sexual violence other than rape, the large majority (86.6% and 92.1%, respectively) reported one perpetrator in their lifetime (data not shown). Too few male victims reported two or more perpetrators to produce a reliable estimate.   So it could be that many male ""made to penetrate"" rape victims are being revictimized by the same perpetrator throughout their lives, then?    I'd mostly like to see more studies on this topic, to see if these numbers are replicated, and also to mind out more about the circumstances in which men are raped and how many men have been raped in total (including being ""made to penetrate"")."
SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,Alternating_Sum,5,Fri May 29 20:29:34 2015 UTC,Maybe the number of male rape victims has skyrocketed the past years? We really don't have any data that would allow us to assume that the 12 month rate has been the same over a longer period.

SRSDiscussion,37dc3f,MaoXiao,2,Wed May 27 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"In any experiment, there is some chance, based on the sample size and the size of the effect you find, that the result you found is due to chance. A result is significant if the chance of it occurring randomly is below some number p (usually p is 5% but sometimes it's even lower).  A confidence interval on a number is similar: if your survey (for example) finds that 51% of people would vote for Obama if the election was held today, that's not the ""true"" number because you didn't literally ask everyone in the population of voters, but only an attempt to guess it. The ""true"" number is somewhere within a certain range with a certain probability. So, in most political polls, the sample size is usually selected so that there's a 95% chance that the number the survey gets is within 3 percentage points of the real number. So in the survey I gave as an example, anywhere between 48% and 54% of people might actually be voting for Obama. Notably, this means that even though the poll seems to say that Obama has a majority, it's still possible that he will lose even if there wasn't anything wrong with the poll.  This is the problem with comparing the male and female numbers in the NISVS. The numbers they give are representations based on a sample of the real numbers in the population. It's possible that the real numbers for 12 month rape/made to penetrate could be more different than the numbers the study found, just by statistical accident. Nobody actually did the statistical tests to see how likely it is that the two numbers are truly similar, instead of just appearing similar by coincidence."

I have heard of times when police just chuck out the case thinking it couldn't be done. It's especially troubling because I've often seen it where a man getting raped is just a joke to some people.  So, TL;DR: I don't know for sure, but for various reasons, I wouldn't be surprise if the answer to your question is yes."

I really did love those 10 seconds but then I started thinking with my brain and decided it was a bad idea. I still really like the girl she's super cool and don't feel victimized by it.

And it can be all of the above -- for many people being raped is psychologically traumatic and physically pleasurable at the same time, and a lot of rape survivors experience confusion in processing what happened to them, as a result.

To quote the relevant parts:   [What has government done right?] Eradicating smallpox and polio globally, and cholera and malaria from their endemic areas in the US. [...] Delivering clean, practically-free water and cheap on-the-grid electricity across an entire continent. Forcing integration and leading the struggle for civil rights. [...] Ensuring accurate disaster forecasts for hurricanes, volcanos, and tidal waves. Zero life-savings-destroying bank runs in eighty years.   There's also the way that Social Security has lifted the modal old person out of poverty, the creation of the middle class via the GI Bill and the progressive taxation of the 1950s, and the fact that while we have slums, we no longer have Hoovervilles. Liberalism, in full swing in the 1960s, cut poverty in half.  If you're talking about more recently, neoliberalism is the center of the Democratic range, and the Republicans are further to the right of that. (It used to be neoconservatism; I don't know what the heck it is now.) Globalization has made the rich richer, but the poor even richer, proportionately; see Figure 2. That dip towards the right are the first-worlders who've lost out under globalization. They/we are not a representative sample. So, while it hasn't helped most Americans, it's helped a lot of people who aren't Americans.  The current policies are in many ways watered-down variants of what we used to do. I think this is part of our gaze falling from the horizon, whatever the cause of that is. But both social welfare and neoliberalism have quite a lot to recommend them. There's much to criticize as well, but to say that ""they've never actually solved anything"" is unsupportable.  (Edit: Awesome! I've been linked in some kind of meta sub, /r/gulag.

Politicians are a vanishingly small percent of any population, who are almost all more affluent than their average constituent. As far as ""reacting to a threat"" goes, that the whole point.  Unfortunately. for the past few decades those of us in the Western world use the post-WWII years as a reference for what middle-class life is like. This isn't reality any more. Those years were fueled by a massive infusion of wealth that was transferred from Europe to fund the war, coupled with a highly progressive tax system that kept incomes under control so that there was more of it to go around.  My whole point hinges on the feeling that things are getting worse. They are. Baby Boomers grew up swimming in cash. Now all that cash is in the hands of a tiny few and corporations, stashed away in foreign banks, and we have a more normal amount of wealth to go around."

SRSDiscussion,37ffqw,Lolor-arros,3,Wed May 27 13:50:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, well think of it this way, I'll use the US as my reference since most of Europe was pretty beat up. Britain was no longer a superpower, etc.  The US had a relatively small workforce compared to now. As soldiers came back to the states, many went into college on the GI bill. Most who didn't went to unionized factory jobs working for companies (corporations were more rare then) where they were paid as much as possible before a highly progressive tax code took most of their earnings. In order to entice workers, companies couldn't really pay more, but they could make benefit packages sweeter. This is the birth of employer-based health care.  These workers, and those who graduated from college and got jobs that paid more because of that education were making so much money that buying a house was almost trivial.  A lot of this was because there was relatively more cash available to middle-class citizens. The tax code made it impossible to create the super-rich we have today. Instead of expatriating cash, companies were encouraged to invest in R&D and other investments versus our current M.O. of multi-million per year salaries for executives. Fun fact: 2.1 trillion is stashed in foreign banks in order to dodge taxes on profits. If companies were to repatriate those assets, they'd have to pay taxes on them. As a result, the money never comes back, vis a vis the Microsoft acquisition of Nokia.  Bottom line is that since there is a larger proportion of cash tied up in the 1%-ers and in foreign banks, the rest of us have a smaller pool of wealth to pass around.  Back to ""normal"". In human history, the ownership of land and by extension of a house by Baby Boomer proportions is unprecedented. It continues now, for the most part, but this is due to a shift from a single-income household to a dual-income household. Household income compared to GDP has been dropping since at least 1970.

(Seriously!)   Let's not even talk about the fact that people in America have lost jobs because of globalization, and let me bring up the fact that people in China and elsewhere are paid slave wages.   Seriously, read the article--part of the effect over this time was that people in the lower half of the income distribution in the United States lost out, while people much poorer than Americans are doing way better. Slave wages are apparently quite an improvement over subsistence farming, which is why China restricts internal migration to, but not from, the cities.   Welfare, Social Security, food stamps, and the rest of the so-called ""safety nets"" haven't solved unemployment, poverty, crime, or any economic problem.

First, the proportional increase in a poor person's income from 1988-2008 was greater than the proportional increase in a richer person's; this is not ""slight"". And second, global inequality is directly described in the article.

There is a bad thing for Americans combined with a good thing for Chinese people. How you do the math on this is subjective, and largely up to you. For example, if you think that Americans are more important than Chinese people (a very popular viewpoint among Americans!), this is obviously a bad thing. If you don't think an improvement from subsistence farming and near-starvation to Industrial-Revolution labor conditions really counts for anything, this is obviously a bad thing.   While crime has gone down nationwide, it is still pretty bad in places like Chicago and Detroit.   Chicago shows the same declining violence since the early 1990s. (Pardon the non-zero-based Y axis.) If you have a similar graph for Detroit, please share. (This only goes back to 2000, and shows a constant, high rate.)

I know practicality arguments aren't super popular here, but since we're talking about the US specifically here, there are lots of areas where the government should step in and pay for stuff to create a more equitable society. Unfortunately, it's super hard to raise revenue (i.e. taxes) at the state level in most of the US so the money would have to come from somewhere else in the budget that's considered discretionary (usually a small percentage).  I guess what I'm saying is if you want to stop trying to enforce some part of child support, what will the impact on the child be?

So basically the student loan / variable rate mortgage model? How's that working out for poor people?    A lot better than not going to school at all, but you also misunderstood my point.

Anyway, the current child support system does garnish wages, tax refunds and so on. It's not like you miss one child support payment and go straight to jail. The reason child support is different than a credit card is because it's a court order and if you don't pay you can be held in contempt which is how you end up in jail. Family court judges have a ton of discretion and the racists and classist court system is much more likely to jail a poor black man than a rich white man. I'm not arguing that that's good or an ideal solution. What I'm saying is that if you didn't have the threat of jail, a lot of people who could pay child support wouldn't. It's the same reason bankruptcy excuses your credit cards but not owed child support.   A lot better than not going to school at all   That's exactly my point! Providing free tuition for more poor people would be better than years of encumbering student loan debt, and very few politicians really disagree with that. But the money isn't there. Similarly, yes, if the government would just step in and provide a basic level of support for all children that would be great, but I believe the current system is better than single parents getting no support at all.   A tax loan is not at all like a student loan or mortgage.   The similarity is optimism about future earnings. Basically, the bottom 20% of earners don't tend to earn more as they age into their ""prime working years"" the way higher earners do. And people in the bottom 20% also have almost no savings.

It seems very parallel to what happens in the U.S. to low-income (especially black) fathers, which ends up trapping them in situations like Scott was.  So yeah, I think the state stepping in to pay for child support would allow for more diverse family structures and at least help somewhat reduce unnecessary persecution of black males by police. I'll try to link to the article when I get the chance :)  Edit: Not sure if this was the exact article I was thinking of, but it has some great research and addresses child support:   The shift to “paternacare,” for example—forcing husbands to pay for biological children—an agenda often shared by policymakers, legislators, and courts, “encroaches upon poor custodial mothers’ privacy rights and right to self-determination, and… uniquely imposes its heteropatriarchal model of dependence on poor women” (Smith 2007, 118)."

I'm a proud progressive, but this is a gigantic blind spot to most progressives I know. Reforming these laws would quickly relieve a great amount of oppression in this country.

SRSDiscussion,371i4g,lazurz,35,Sun May 24 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"One of my personal areas that I both know a fair amount, and that presses a bunch of my buttons is pseudoscience in general, and biological/medical pseudoscience in particular.  March Against Monsanto has firmly embraced a large amount of this pseudoscience.  Pretty much all of their objections to GMOs are rooted deeply in lies and false science.  The studies they frequently tout have been largely debunked as being either incompetently run, or deliberate data manipulation for ideological purposes. The one real objection that I see that is valid to the current GMO practices (not going into size of companies in this bit, just the GMOs and agricultural practices) is the heavy monoculture.  However, this same monoculture practice is what is used in organic farming.  The organic movement is very heavily driven and supported by the multi-billion dollar organic food industry (which had $39.1 billion in sales in 2014).  The top 10 companies GMO seed sales in 2007 were ~15 billion (this website very clearly has an agenda, but their chart was easy for me to find.  However, this is older data, and sales have almost certainly gone up.  In 2014, Monsanto had ~15 billion in sales, but that was for all sales, not just seed.  But it gives an general ballpark).  It is pretty clear to me that the March Against Monsanto is not The People vs. The Massive Industry.  It is The Massive Industry vs. The Equally Massive Industry.  Things like the mandatory GMO labeling is just one more thing being used in that fight.  I think there are many problems with the large agribusinesses.  Its just they are the same problems that all large businesses have.  They just don't seem to be any more odious than Merck, GE, or Microsoft are."
SRSDiscussion,371i4g,JohnHenryAaron,9,Sun May 24 04:24:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair to activists, the reason why the public face of organic food is Big Ag isn't because food activists are hypocrites.  It's because the movement has been co-opted by agribusiness to a massive degree.  There is a big difference between the ""organic movement"" and organic agribusiness.    Ag companies just see organic as a value-added label they can slap on a food to increase their profit margins.  This does not make activists complicit in the decisions made by industry.  There is a significant portion of the organic movement that is about social justice.  They want increased citizen's control over how their food is produced.  They want to increase the availability of healthy foods in poor neighborhoods.  They want to eradicate urban food deserts. They want environmental ethics to play a larger role in governmental decision-making.    The organic movement did grow out of a lot of New Age, pseudoscientific ways of thinking, and there is a lot of bad information out there But there's valid scientific basis for many of the arguments and social justice concern as well.  You have to distinguish between the two and not just dismiss the entire thing out of hand."

It's also notable that counting only the seed income from Monsanto is similarly nonsensical - Monsanto doesn't sell seeds, they sell Roundup.

I've just done a bit of internet research.  There's an argument to be made that GMOs are necessary and mostly good for impoverished and food-bereft communities, at least if we remove the context of the unethical practices (or potential ones) of GMO corporations. But it's not really that clear cut. It's been argued that Monsanto's patents and their willingness to viciously protect them could be quite harmful in the long term. And there's the potential for GMO crops to quicken and hone the evolution of pests or weeds, thereby necessitating greater use of dangerous pesticides.  [edited]  There are pros and cons. But I do think it's prudent to be wary—and not unreasonable to be critical—of gigantic multinational corporations with histories of shady legal practices and healthy monetary connections to politicians and who have immense power to shape, in the long term, for better or for worse, the ecology of the entire planet and the health of every human on it. Who knows? Maybe those marching are a bunch of ignorant yuppies.

SRSDiscussion,371i4g,RedOuster,1 point,Sun May 24 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"I have the same opinions as you regarding GMOs and Monsanto. The negative media and stigma against the company stems from claims that they use terminator genes and place farmers in a cycle of debt (which the company denies doing so on their webpage), the belief that GMOs are unhealthy for your due to the genetic engineering (which has yet to be proven, to the best of my knowledge), or that the company sues small farmers if there is cross pollination contamination (which according to them has not happened a lot and they list them in their website). I'm not saying that their website can be taken at face value, but googling anything Monsanto related brings up a ton of misinformation as well, and as I really don't a horse in the race, I haven't delved too far into investigating this.  There is also the conspiracy that Monsanto and their Roundup products kill everything, forcing farmers to rely upon their Roundup Ready seeds and also fertilizer because the pesticide kills soil microbes producing decreasing yields. This argument makes sense to me, but as I'm not an Ag major I can't really provide any evidence to prove or disprove it.  The reason I think the 'March Against Monsanto' and similar movements attracts so many progessives and can be considered a social justice movement is because of the belief that the company shackles farmers in the developing world (and in the Western world) in an endless cycle of debt. However, this fails to recognize that the Green Revolution (which GMOs are a big part of) has been instrumental in reducing world hunger greatly. Also, most progressives tend to overlap with animal rights activists, hence the    I see the thousands of people protesting for a cause, and I struggle empathizing with it.

Or you could trust the thousands of peer-reviewed studies showing GM safety as well as the wide scientific consensus on GM safety as well.   A lot of these studies are more recent, and I agree that they're a lot more trustworthy in establishing the health risks (specifically lack there-of) of established GMOs. But that's a broad topic, and each new incarnation does warrant some additional questioning. And there are many ""supported"" food additives in the past that had their health claims reversed as its discovered what the real effects are. But overall I don't want to argue the health angle, I absolutely don't think GMO crops are dangerous to our health. To me this is more about an increasingly oligarchal, cartel-like corporatization of all facets of farming. I hope the health controvery has died out following the larger consensus from the scientific community.  Though on the environmental side, I think the claims are dubious. In practice many of the potential risks that were dismissed are beginning to develop anyways. Things like resistant pests and inter-mixing with wild varieties.   Considering the organisations pushing the strongest for mandatory labelling...   I don't really care about that. The bottom line is that there was a large public demand, no matter how ""manipulated"" (as if the whole of the movement was hopelessly illiterate), for labeling on food and a large industry was allowed to override that demand to protect their business. This might be similar to milk being hammered into the ""healthy food guide"" for 50 years, but that's a tangent. I don't know what existing GMO label you're talking about. But I don't buy ""we have to protect them from their own ignorance"" as an excuse in such an essential consumer environment. And not for public health reasons, like legislating vaccinnes, but for company profits. It seems so clearly anti-intellectual and anti-science to take that position, and potentially elitist, I don't get why so many ""scientific"" proponents of GMOs are okay with this. The companies shouldn't be afraid, nor permited, to compete with what they claim is 'mis-education' by encouraging further disenfranchisement and powerlessness among consumers. But they want to foster public illiteracy over science, and in one of the rare situations that actually bites them in the ass, they're legislated a special legal exception. That's bullshit. And besides many people might still want to know the GMO content of foods for non-health related reasons. Should companies like Nestle be allowed to conceal their public ownership of brands to protect their image from the purported ""ignorant"" consumer backlash against their legal water extraction or ties to slavery in the cocoa industry?  But the other thing is that poster you linked is not a smoking gun. It's no secret that many groups don't believe in GMOs at all. They may have their own ambition targets that labeling will turn consumers away from it, but that's just a projected fantasy and not some sneaky kill-switch. Personally, I highly doubt it would be enough, the US & Canadian markets are very different from Europe for a lot of reasons. But the idea that some people would want to choose not to consume GM ingredients in their regular groceries and you want to actively take that away from them is nuts. I can avoid corn syrup. I can avoid MSG. I can avoid that special low fat chip oil that makes me shit myself. These products are industry darlings and the science has deemed them safe. Why are GM ingredients such an exception that people should be forced to eat them.  Plus, organic farmers aren't the bad guys. And all the major companies also have organic operations. But there's less money in it for them and they just don't want to have to compete in their markets with small scale farmers or anything else, so they'd rather see their patented products dominate the industry."

That's not the point. The point is that mandatory labels are normally reserved for essential health or nutrition information. GMO fits into none of those categories, and therefore it is a lifestyle issue. If you allow any old lifestyle issue to have a mandatory label (as in, it has to be on there by law) with no limitations on what can be included, then there is literally no end to the amount of labels that can be made mandatory. Do we also pander to, say, people who don't want to buy food from farmers who vote Democrat/Republican. Should the farmers be compelled to put a label on the package saying who the farmer voted for? Because I can guarantee you I could find a group of people who would be so anti-Republican/anti-Democrat that they'd support this.

This is how it works for vegetarians, vegans, adherent jews and muslims, people who eat organic food etc. Avoiding GMO, being no more a lifestyle choice than all the other choices I've just mentioned, is being treated equally. What you're asking for is special treatment. You don't see Jewish groups demanding mandatory ""Trief"" labels on all non-kosher food. You don't see Muslim groups demanding mandatory ""Haram"" labels on all non-halal food.   so they'd rather see their patented products dominate the industry.

If someone expresses to you that they find it sexist or offensive or hurtful the only right answer is to stop doing it around that person if you have any bit of respect for them.

That said, I'm not in communities that use 'fish' that way, but what I've gleaned (largely from reading parts of Janet Mock's book) is that using fish that way is actually a reclamation from drag queens who definitely were using it misogynistically. It seems to me in Mock's book the usage there means ""you are a real woman""--which is, uh, problematic shall we say in other ways possibly, but not really having much to do with the etymological ancestor of the subcultural usage of the word against cis women.  To cut to the chase, accusing trans women of systemic through language misogyny towards cis women is probably pretty faulty especially when considered through the usual SJ avenues of thought."

We never say ""Oh, she's a bitch"", we say things like ""Bitch, you look good.""   Same thing for things like cunt. Being cunt or upper cunt is a hugely positive thing in my social circle.   I've never heard of terms like a trans woman being fish or pussy, but I do live on the west coast so things are different here.   Personally I don't see anything wrong with terms like bitch and cunt as long as they're used explicitly in a positive way. Bitch, cunt, queen (my friends and I use YAS KWEEN from Broad City), hunty; these are all positive terms we use with each other."

SRSDiscussion,36qhi8,enriquepathique,42,Thu May 21 08:58:23 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea why Bernie Sanders is calling himself a socialist.  Worker-owned means of production isn't a ""strict definition"" of socialism, it's just what the word means, and Scandinavian style social democracy isn't an alternative to capitalism, it's a different type of it.  The whole ""any government regulation is socialism"" thing is a right wing ploy I'd rather we didn't even entertain, but anyhow...  The thing about social democratic reforms is that I don't even want to bother arguing for whether they're sufficient or not, because I maintain that they cannot last, for two reasons.   Capital buys power.  This is universally true.  Campaign finance and anti-corruption laws might make it less true in some places than others, but we can't deny that as long as there is such a thing as a capitalist class, it will always be able to find  a way to put its money to use buying influence, which it will use to gradually peel back whatever gains the working class manages to make in the  way of reforms.  It might not always seem like it, but this brings me to #2... Capital plays the long game.  The very nature of investment is that one thinks in the long term, while the reality of working class life is that making ends meet in the here and now.  Even very well off workers usually couldn't last more than a year or two without regular income.  So all too often capital is willing to let labor ""win"" in the short run while quietly getting its way in the long run.  Take the fire fighter's union in my home town, which has successfully prevented the city from cutting pension benefits for the firefighters over and over again.  A short term win for the union, but the city is now just hiring on new firefighters who have lesser benefits from the get-go.  Or when unions fight against layoffs and ""win,"" the company can simply lower its hiring rate and gradually decrease headcount through attrition.    And then on the larger scale, if you have a period of time with an especially militant working class that secures some protections and public benefits and such, the capitalists can accept the temporary hit to profits and just bide their time while gradually undoing that progress.  Take the United States: you've got all kinds of militant action and serious wins by the labor movement in the first half of the 20th century, and then capitalists spent the latter half of it sabotaging unions, pushing for more and more involvement in politics, using that influence to pass union-busting laws and roll back worker protections, and finding new tricks to get around the laws still in place like hiring more part time workers and classifying more employees as independent contractors.   It's the nature of capitalism that capital accumulates.  As long as you leave a capitalist class intact in any form, over time they're going to accumulate more capital, and correspondingly increase their influence, and do whatever they can to get back to their former position of power.  And they have the foresight to do it all the while letting the working class think that they're winning.  So no, I really don't trust the idea of leaving  a capitalist class intact."
SRSDiscussion,36qhi8,robertbieber,9,Thu May 21 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"It's the nature of capitalism that capital accumulates.   This is the crux of the issue - capital begets capital, so you wind up with a positive feedback loop that eventually goes critical.  The thing I don't understand is why people see this as an insurmountable issue. Just like any system who's central process constitutes a positive feedback loop, which will have catastrophic results if it's allowed to go critical (e.g. nuclear reactors, global warming beyond a certain point), the trick is just to have some dampening term that automatically increases in response to how much energy is currently flowing through the feedback loop.  So, for the case of capitalism, something like a dynamically structured progressive tax on wealth (rather than income), where the shape/progressiveness of the tax is a function of some reliable metric of wealth inequality such that, the more wealth inequality there is, the more progressively wealth winds up being redistributed.  Although such a system would still require that people be vigilant not to let that central feedback dampening mechanism be corrupted/eroded, in theory it should prevent the runaway feedback loop that Marxists and what-have-you insist is an inevitable result of any possible incarnation of capitalism."

But I really don't want to bother going down that rabbit hole, because I think the idea that we could successfully regulate capitalism to some ""happy"" medium in the long term is hopelessly naive.  That requirement you listed, ""that people be vigilant not to let that central feedback dampening mechanism be corrupted/eroded,"" isn't a novel idea that's never been tried before.  It's what we had in America decades ago, and it's what they had in the, uh, communist wonderland of social democratic Europe very recently until austerity won out.  But it always falls apart, because capitalists require a significant amount of inequality to survive (remember, it takes a lot of money to live off your investments) and as long as you leave that level of inequality in place you've got someone who wields a disproportionate amount of economic power, who's perfectly willing to exercise it for their own benefit (that is, after all, how capitalists make their living), and who's strongly motivated to sabotage your ""dampening mechanism"" for the benefit of themselves and their heirs."

Right, and the point is that if you set that gap too low, capitalism doesn't work any more.  However much wealth a typical worker has to be able to accumulate to survive and perhaps retire at some point, a capitalist needs many times more than that to be able to sustain themselves on investments alone.  Significant inequality isn't just a byproduct of capitalism, it's a prerequisite for it.   With sufficiently impactful redistribution funneling money in to a UBI, no one is under duress to work any job they don't want to.   Sure, but if they do want to work (and most people do), this UBI scheme doesn't do anything about alienation.  I'm not saying we should have a choice between alienated labor and no labor at all, I'm saying we should have the option to do meaningful work that we take ownership of ourselves.   Again, effectively mitigated by redirecting a large portion of the value created by privately owned automated production into a UBI.   I feel like you're kind of hand-waving this all away with the UBI.  We're still going to need people to do work, and they're still going to want to be compensated as much as possible for their work.  Even if I can live an okay life just scraping by on whatever minimum income the UBI provides for me, I'm still going to want to work to better my and my family's lot, and I'm still going to be pissed if automation continues to represent more for the owners, rather than more for me.   Yes, because no one has ever built a system that was more resilient the second time around, by paying attention to where the first iteration broke down. It's not like we have better tools for research and organization, more knowledge of economics, or complex agent-based simulations to help design a better system.   My point is that it doesn't matter how much you try to regulate it, capitalism is still capitalism.  The capitalist class can't sustain itself without owning a disproportionate amount of capital, and as long as someone owns a disproportionate share of capital in an economy, they're also going to be able to wield a disproportionate amount of economic power.  The absolute best you can hope for is to hold them in check for a very long time, but however you spin it you're counting on the eternal vigilance of a much bigger, much easier to divide and confuse group with fewer resources keeping in check a much smaller, more connected and self-interested group with greater resources.  But just for the sake of argument, let's suppose it's possible to maintain this, uh, equilibrium indefinitely.  That you could somehow convince the capitalist class to remain perched right on the razor edge of sustainability for all the rest of human history.  To what end?  If we're accepting that the working class has marshaled the phenomenal amount of sustained political consciousness that it would require to accomplish such a feat, why shouldn't they just go all the way and take the entire economy for themselves?  What do we gain by allowing a class of non-workers to live a lavish life, or any life at all, on the backs of those who do work?"

SRSDiscussion,36qhi8,robertbieber,6,Fri May 22 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"You've got it the wrong way around.  When they own the means of production, workers have every incentive to automate themselves out of a job.  Suppose I'm working in a widget factory today, in a capitalist economy.  If someone comes up with a machine that can halve the amount of labor required to produce a widget, this is disastrous news for my coworkers and I.  Efficiency is doubled, great, but we're not going to see any of that benefit.  We're not going to get paid twice as much, or allowed to work half as much for the same pay, or anywhere in between the two options.  The boss is going to lay half of us off, and use the threat of further layoffs to drive those of us who still have jobs to work even harder, maybe for less money, because now for every one of us there's a freshly unemployed widget-maker who'd be happy to take our job.  So as a worker, it's in my best interest to oppose increasing efficiency, even if it benefits the economy as a whole.  Now suppose we have some kind of a worker-owned economy, and I work in a widget-making cooperative.  My coworkers and I own the machines that make the widgets, and we divvy up the workload, the leadership responsibilities and the compensation democratically.  In this version of reality, if someone comes up with a machine that cuts widget-making time in half, we're all going to be over the moon.  Now our productivity doubles, and it's completely up to us as workers how we're going to exploit that efficiency.  Maybe we'll produce more widgets and make more money while working a little less.  Or maybe we're completely happy with the amount we're producing and we decide to all just take more time off.  Whatever we decide, we are the ones who reap the benefits of improved productivity, so we're all strongly incentivized to seek it out.  Edit - Also, I read an interesting piece a while ago about how even in our current economy, most basic research is funded by the government.

Presumably there's a vetting process to ensure they can pull their weight.  Does that make job finding even harder?    As a business owner I'd be far more likely to try out an employee knowing I can fire her, than to vote to bring in some person who I now have to deal with as a peer.

One is that employees who are not owners have increased more rapidly than worker-owners, to a point that in some companies, the first are a much larger group than the second. In the supermarket chains owned by Mondragon, employing 38,420 workers, only a minority (12,260) are worker-owners, which establishes a difference in terms of whom to save in the case of collapse. In the collapse of Fagor, the transfer of employees favored those who were worker-owners, which is expected, but clearly creates a two-tier system that affects labor relations. Those who do not become owners either cannot afford to become owners or choose not to become an owner.   I'd really want to understand what market forces created a separation between worker owners and worker non-owners?  Supermarket chains tend to employ part time work, which is exactly the kind of situation I'd find iffy when it comes to deciding who gets to be an owner.  The Mondragon Corp appears to have solved that problem by creating non-workers.  Still, a fascinating read.  Thank you."

SRSDiscussion,36qhi8,successfulblackwoman,2,Fri May 22 07:29:06 2015 UTC,"In the most naive interpretation, maybe, but let's run the thought experiment a little bit.  Keep in mind I am not describing increasing productivity.  A 10% reduction in the difficulty of work will undoubtably benefit all the workers.  I'm talking about the kind of 10x to 100x revolution that renders entire swaths of the workforce redundant.  So in that vein let us imagine a truckers cooperative.  The drivers collectively own their trucks, they are protected from layoffs and recessions because they are all owners in part of the business.  Let us assume that there are enough truckers to ensure that the workload is even and balanced, and everyone gets a fair wage.  So, in short, it's one of the better jobs one can have.  Boris comes into work one day with a perfectly developed self-driving truck.  Truckers, he announces, no longer need to drive.  What happens?  Do the truckers rejoice that they now have to do nothing?  Maybe that seems like the obvious first step.  What happens to a market socialist cooperative when it is able to gain maximum productivity for near zero human effort?  At first, the truckers get a check for doing nothing.  Perhaps unfair, but better they all share equally than none at all.  But, some competitors realize, they could just as easily set up their own cooperative with a tenth the owners (and correspondingly more profit per worker), driving Boris' company to extinction.  If Boris buries the secret, though, equilibrium is maintained.  But, then again, perhaps the state engages in protectionism to prevent this market rivalry, and say that only Boris' trucking company may use the self driving trucks.  In doing so they become the owners of intellectual property - a form of rent-seeking antithetical to communism.  Most cynically, Boris might realize he can start his own trucking collective with a few trusted people, driving his old co-workers out of business.  In all of these situations the now redundant workers fall on the grace of the social welfare net.  The grace of the state protects them via market socialism -- but arguably it cannot protect them too well, because they must be incentivized to find more work.  Will the work they find be as good as before?  We might go a step further and say that the entire trucking industry is nationalized.  Boris' invention cannot make him rich, it can only benefit the workers as a whole.  Still, when all the truckers are rendered obsolete, what do they do?  The state cannot let them sit idly.  They must be reassigned, possibly to labor less suited to their many years of acquiring skill.  From any angle I view it, Boris has done his coworkers no benefit with his invention.  Now imagine that Boris tells the cooperative he intends to spend the next five years working on a self-driving truck.  If he fails, he will have wasted his time (and the resources of the cooperative) and had nothing to gain for it.  If he succeeds he has done his coworkers no favors in the long term.  We might solve this with a state-run innovation lab, but now we've moved well past workers automating themselves out of a job.  I can see every reason for workers to build a better mouse trap.  I can see no reason for them to eliminate the need for mouse traps, not if they make a remotely comfortable living making mouse traps."

You're inherently not going to understand socialism if your worldview is limited by bourgeois market ideology.   a form of rent-seeking antithetical to communism.   Markets in general are antithetical to communism. The problem is that you're spending time thinking up ridiculous ""thought experiments"" with a completely limited knowledge of the concepts you invoke instead of actually bothering to learn about socialism.   We might go a step further and say that the entire trucking industry is nationalized. Boris' invention cannot make him rich, it can only benefit the workers as a whole. Still, when all the truckers are rendered obsolete, what do they do? The state cannot let them sit idly.

Sanders-style socialism ideally provides for everyone without the dramatic social upheaval, which makes it more marketable to liberals and less radical leftists.

SRSDiscussion,36qhi8,papermoon1,10,Thu May 21 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"Most people who are critical of capitalism don't view social democracy as a viable alternative to capitalism. A few thoughts:  Scandinavian social democracy doesn't exist independently of global capitalism, so it's difficult to speak of it as a ""solution"" when in reality it's more like a island of feel good market economies in the middle of an ocean of capital.    As a consequence, it's hard to imagine how we would scale any successes northern Europe has had to the rest of the world. It's great to hold these countries up as a shining example of market socialism, but the reality is that not every country can have a huge sovereign wealth fund from oil. Or Sweden, which relies on heavily on trade with the non-social democratic world.   The obvious proof of this is the fact that immigration has stressed many of these countries ability to integrate non-white immigrants into the economy and social safety net. That's not to say that social democracy can only work within a homogeneous society, but it at the very least illustrates that there are still global forces that threaten the integrity of these ""progressive"" countries.  TL;DR: Might work on a country by country basis, but the point of global capitalism is that it's global, and it's difficult to imagine market socialism taking over without substantial international changes."
SRSDiscussion,36qhi8,papermoon1,6,Thu May 21 14:35:01 2015 UTC,"I think the critics are correct on this one. Scandinavian capitalism is undoubtedly still a version of capitalism, and Bernie Sanders remains a capitalist even if he calls himself a socialist. The UK Labour Party is a capitalist party, even if it calls itself socialist, or is a member of the socialist international. The idea that implementing the Nordic model would eliminate class-based oppression and exploitation is absurd, IMO. I am not sure these things can ever be completely eliminated in a world with private property, but in a Nordic model they would still exist at a massive level.   Whether that is ""fine and acceptable"" to social justice activists is another question. I think one of the contradictions of the contemporary left is the fact that large organizations are necessary for certain elements of progress, and yet unequal and oppressive structures are a feature of almost all large organizations. When one person has ""authority"" over 10 or 20 or more people, let alone thousands, inequalities and potential oppressions rapidly multiply. And this is even before getting into the questions of private property and labor exploitation that are more specific to critiques of capitalism as a means of production. Yet while I can't think of any form of organization that could, for example, construct an Airbus A380 without massive inequalities of power between the (few) directors and the (many) directed, I still want to ride in my Airbus A380.  The only solution I can think of here is that since you can have valid, different models of the ideal society, it doesn't matter that in my ideal society, there would be no Airbus or Boeing. That is, all decisions about values take place ultimately from a position of moral relativism, and each person is accountable only to themselves to determine what is important to them. My ideal society would be populated by people who want to live in that society, but there will always be people who want to live in a world with Airbuses and Boeings and modern capitalism, and I don't think it's necessary to impose my vision on the entire world in a wholesale manner. I think that's where a lot of the ugliness of historical wars of ideology and religion have come from."

Which is exactly why Deleuze argued that critical philosophy is the philosophy of the creation of value. While I agree ""in reality"" that people's wants and desires are too diverse, I still think it's worth asking the question -why- people are so willing to fuck over the rest of the world in order to ride on a fancy plane. I think the explanation that these values appear ex nihilo or as a consequence of some essentialized human drive is far too simplistic--they are obviously ideological in nature.  The fact that some people will call anyone who imagines a different world than the status quo an idealist or naive revolutionary is indicative of the way in which capitalism imposes its vision on the entire world--we can't even imagine a world outside of capital. So while I might agree with you that it's bad measure to impose an economic vision on the world, that's what's happening in the status quo, and the question is how we escape that predicament, even if we're okay with the capitalists doing their own thing in theory."

Maybe that's the case with anarchists in particular (apologies to anarchists if I've got that completely wrong, I don't know much about anarchism) but I don't think the left has a problem with laborers working together under leaders to achieve larger goals.  The question is just where that authority comes from, and if it's legitimate.  I think most people would be perfectly happy to continue to work under the leadership of someone they respect and choose for that position.  It's the imposition of leadership by owners whose sole claim to authority is the amount of money they have, for the sole purpose of inflating their profits, that breeds resentment.

Large organizations with chains of command (e.g., almost all large organizations worth the name ""organization"") are strongly hierarchical and thus create unequal power structures. The larger the organization, the more unequal the power structures are. Not only is a problematic from an egalitarian standpoint, but vested interests become created (things are ""institutionalized""), which resist change. Elections don't solve the problem, unless you think representative governments haven't presided over oppression, abuse and atrocities.

I should have been more careful when rattling off ""Asian"". When I discuss East Asia, I refer to China/Japan/Korea and those countries that: 1. Have a large presence in the global economy (in tech, education, science, trade, etc.), and therefore have more autonomy in their own country's media, but remain dwarfed by Western/US media juggernauts around the world. 2. Whose historical people/current residents tend to have certain traits (dark eyes and hair, little body hair, medium-light skin (on a global scale) and almond-shaped eyes).   As we've discussed before, certainly there is variation within the population and not everyone looks the same, but geopolitically and culturally, I hope I've made it clear what I mean and why I've grouped them.  What is your alternative explanation for the popularity of these features? If mine is that they are rooted in white supremacy and colonialism, just like myriad other social trends are from the West (especially the US in this era). Are you saying these features are all over their media because it's a coincidence? That's what I'm still trying to understand from your end? Either it's a coincidence, and the two trends are unrelated (white supremacy and global beauty standards) or they are related.

There is, however, some agreement that white ideals dominate media and fashion industries in industrialized nations and influence on how young Asian and Asian American women judge themselves and their physical appearance.""   The traits themselves originate in Western ideals (not ownership of the traits), but have evolved into an Asian standard, just like the example I gave with black women.

You would see that there was a wide diversity of criteria. Yes, pale skin was one of them, and in some cultures they appreciated large eyes. Yet others preferred small and almond shaped eyes. Think of it this way: the traits that endured through the ages, that now represent desires of the entire globe, are Western.  It is significant because these features are still desired. Some of the traits were the same, but they would not still be sought after if they were not also Western. I hope I'm explaining that well...  Imagine the Middle East were the conquerers of the globe. Their media and ideals and beauty standards are spread across the world. Dark, luscious hair is a major desirable trait. Many East Asian people already have that as a desirable trait, so it stays.   It's somewhat of a Darwinian response. The coincidentally desirable traits stay, the others fall away. This is directly a result of the Arab domination.  Now apply it to this universe.  Does that make sense? Communicating through writing is hard :(  Did you read the article I linked to?  Read this one as well.  In reference to your comments that black people ""appropriate white looks to raise their cultural capital"", I get the sense that you are unfamiliar with the black experience in the US?  You make it seem like black people have a choice in the matter. Certainly, no one is forcing black women to have their hair a certain way, but its near necessity is rooted directly in white supremacy, and its legacy still survives to this day.  In nearly every situation, Black women are all but required to have their hair relaxed, lest they seem unkempt, dirty, ""ghetto"", unprofessional, etc (try going to an interview with an afro!). Keep in mind, this is their natural hair! I think most people would dislike having to use lye on their hair (to relax it) or up to a thousand dollars for a weave, or have to literally sit through eight hours of having their hair braided! Now, your average white woman does spend more time and money on their hair than your average man, but it pales in comparison to the pressure placed on black women's hair.  Now, there is a growing movement for natural black hair, and I do not think black women who choose to weave/relax their hair in order to be white, rather, they do it so as to not be black.  This is a very major difference; appropriation suggests a privileged class taking advantage of and de-contextualizing a certain facet of another culture, often for profit. White people can appropriate black culture; Black people cannot appropriate white culture. Black people can conform to white standards of beauty."

I think another part of the problem with this suggestion is that it goes against my progressive/left-wing instincts which says look to the structural issue first, and never try to substitute an individual solution to a structural problem. Putting the onus on the oppressed/underprivileged to solve their own oppression/marginalization also tends to imply that the reasons Asians are underrepresented is because no one's created any good storylines with Asians in them, but we all know that's not true. It's not as if the whitewashing of Asian storylines by Hollywood could be any clearer."

You're right that ideally nobody should have to solve their own oppression/marginalization, but real life just doens't work like that.

Look at something like Welcome to Night Vale, which has a queer man who's boyfriend is a Latino scientist and is full of characters of pretty much all racial backgrounds, genders, abilities, etc. It's a podcast, but it tours live and has a book coming out in the fall - it went from a tiny niche audience to a rather larger audience in a couple of years, and is all funded by fans.

At the end of the day, 99% of the media out there is created with a target audience in mind, and for a western to be a western, someone's gotta play the bad guy. We may be getting more roles but they will not be more varied - what use is the increased representation then? Be it the black criminal, or the nerdy asian character for comic relief, racial representation in the anglosphere is always going to mirror that of the course history has taken. People can argue this all they want, but I think that the BBC's issues with diversity and just the whole situation with TV networks trying to capitalise on 'ethnic' sitcoms says it all.  Why do that, when we can do it ourselves? Look at what Korea has built up for itself in the short space of a few decades with its Hallyu scene; Bollywood, Hong Kong cinema, I could go on. The problem lies with the 'West is Best' mentality. But that is beginning to fade - much like how many of our parents and the older generation learnt English and got their feelings for pop culture from looking up to and idolising American media (and the resulting social/beauty standards), we have people in the West now doing the same. Exposure of Asian media and culture has lead to many younger westerners taking on big interests, leading to revenue fuelling the media machines from these countries. The difference? Whereas western media is hegemonic and thus all-encompassing, asian media being accessed from outside asia is largely skewed towards those of more open minds, and thus, higher education statuses and income levels. These markets will gradually become bigger, and much like America being the dream holiday destination for hollywood and disneyland - the bastions of pop culture, Asia is seeing its coming of age.

SRSDiscussion,36asr0,Garboi,40,Sun May 17 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"The blog article you linked to is a one-page gish gallop. It advances multiple tendentious arguments and seems to express an utter ignorance of sexual paraphilia that is so complete that it's not even possible to address some of the points that are offered, because they are simply wrong. The good points, which are thoroughly embraced by those within the very broad umbrella of BDSM practice who are healthily critical of the cultural institutions and prejudices of BDSM, are drowned out by everything that is wrong. If you really think these arguments have merit, you have not been reading too much Foucault, you have been reading too little.   I have honestly written out and deleted several attempts to get into the problems with this article, but it's just too vast. I will have to wait for individual discussions to emerge to engage properly. Until then, I will just quote some Gayle Rubin:   Psychiatric condemnation of sexual behaviours invokes concepts of mental and emotional inferiority rather than categories of sexual sin. Low-status sex practices are vilified as mental diseases or symptoms of defective personality integration. In addition, psychological terms conflate difficulties of psycho-dynamic functioning with modes of erotic conduct. They equate sexual masochism with self-destructive personality patterns, sexual sadism with emotional aggression, and homoeroticism with immaturity. These terminological muddles have become powerful stereotypes that are indiscriminately applied to individuals on the basis of their sexual orientations.  Popular culture is permeated with ideas that erotic variety is dangerous, unhealthy, depraved, and a menace to everything from small children to national security. Popular sexual ideology is a noxious stew made up of ideas of sexual sin, concepts of psychological inferiority, anti-communism, mob hysteria, accusations of witchcraft, and xenophobia. The mass media nourish these attitudes with relentless propaganda. I would call this system of erotic stigma the last socially respectable form of prejudice if the old forms did not show such obstinate vitality, and new ones did not continually become apparent.  All these hierarchies of sexual value – religious, psychiatric, and popular – function in much the same ways as do ideological systems of racism, ethnocentrism, and religious chauvinism. They rationalize the well-being of the sexually privileged and the adversity of the sexual rabble."

SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,1 point,Mon May 18 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that erotic variety is shamed. You can see this by the way people treat ""furry"" pornography and fetishism, My Little Pony ""cloppers"". Foot fetishism. And pretty much everything that falls outside of the heteronormative status quo. Including LGBT people.  But there are fetishes, kinks, and paraphilias that have reason to be morally concerning. While someone who is, for instance, into furry, it could worry someone because they might actually be zoophiles. And since non-human animals can't consent to sex, this is problematic. If someone is into rape play fantasies, one has to wonder where those violent feelings and desires come from, whether they act them out with consent in the bedroom, or within pornography. And children can't consent, so there's reason to be concerned if someone in some way seems to be fetishizing that. Wether through consensual ageplay in the bedroom, or lolicon or shotacon, or so forth.  I feel like it's too black or white, either or, to say that all consensual sexual activity is good. Or that all sexual fantasies are good. Or that, simply because all sexual fantasies and desires that don't fit into the usual and the status quo are unfairly marginalized, just for not being ""normal"", that the answer is to view all sexual fantasies as healthy, and to avoid being critical of them."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,Quietuus,8,Mon May 18 09:55:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would say, and I think Gayle Rubin would agree, that sexual fantasies do not become problematic because of their content, but because of the way people may relate to their fantasies. To be critical, to analyse ones own sexual fantasies is of course very important; but I don't think this necessarily involves rooting out and destroying particular classes of paraphilic desire. Indeed, I think the bulk of clinical evidence would indicate that this is for the most part a fool's errand. We have this idea as a culture that sexual fantasies are in some way uniquely harmful, that they have some sort of special power to short circuit people's decision making capacities and cross the rubicon from fantasy into reality. However, I do not think there has ever been any hard evidence to really suggest that sexual fantasies are inherently more damaging than any other sort of fantasy, or more (or indeed less) likely to be acted upon, in cases where they are dangerous, self-destructive, unethical or illegal. People are spurred to do dangerous, self-destructive, unethical or illegal things all the time by perfectly non-sexual fantasies; but at the same time, countless more people have non-sexual fantasies (for example, about committing acts of violence) that they never act on. Indeed, it is considered fairly normal in our culture to consume and enact (in the guise of games of different sorts) fictional violence. Whilst we are rightfully critical about fictional violence and the way it can be used as a device to impart or reinforce certain ideologies, it is not generally assumed (at least, I would imagine, by most people here) that consuming or acting in fictional violence in any form will make the average person more likely to commit those same acts of violence in reality. We are able to accept, for example, that it is possible to play paintball without wanting to go on a shooting spree.   If someone is into rape play fantasies, one has to wonder where those violent feelings and desires come from   One can wonder, certainly, but I think this falls into a very obvious trap, what one might term the 'psychoanalytic fallacy'. This is the idea that someone's paraphilic desires state something about a person; about their deepest held beliefs or their personality. There is quite simply no real evidence to suggest that this is true. How paraphilias form is debated, but from my reading, personal experience and anecdotal evidence I think the best guess is that it is a form of neurological 'cross-wiring' that forms, generally, during childhood or early adolescence. The object of the paraphilia is largely outside of the individuals control, a matter of the external stimuli they are subjected to, selected almost at random, with cultural biases introduced by the prevalence of certain themes, ideas, objects and so on in an individuals culture. There has been some research, for example, about gas mask fetishism in the UK, showing a peak of interest (as judged by the availability of specialist magazines, for example) that is consistent with the exposure of young persons to gas masks during the Second World War. In the US, where gas masks were not commonly issued and gas mask drills were not a part of daily life, gas mask fetishism was much rarer, despite other cultural similarities. Thus, paraphilias tell us less about the individual than they do about the society in which they were raised. The current popularity of bondage and restraint in Western culture, for example, probably has a lot to do with the fact that production codes for television programs, films and so on aimed at young people have, in order to avoid showing violence or sexual menace, instead produced a barrage of scenes where characters are imprisoned, restrained or put in perilous situations. Now, of course, none of this means we cannot be critical; indeed, this reinforces the links between sexuality and broader society. Rape fantasies might be as comparatively rare as those who are deeply sexually attracted to clowns, if we lived in a society where rape and the threat of rape was less of an ever-present reality."

However, the fantasies that can potentially inspire these behaviours run the gamut. Many people fantasise about their perfect holiday, for instance; are all fantasies of perfect holidays rendered suspect because some people will commit fraud, robbery or perhaps even murder to finance that holiday? Of course, this is an example in which the end goal is not in and of itself a bad thing necessarily, so it wouldn't be directly comparable to, say, a rape fantasy, but I think you see my point?   But I also don't think they can't contain harmful elements, either.   Absolutely, they can contain harmful elements, but once again I think the real issues rely in a person's relation to them. Take for example the case of Gilberto Valle, the 'cannibal cop', who's in the news again with the recent HBO documentary. Valle's fantasies contained some very harmful elements and crossed several lines, but I would argue they were less to do with the cannibalism, and more with things like constructing elaborate fantasies around real people he knew, using the police computer and so on; the blurring of the lines. This is the point where fantasy really does start to become dangerous."

As far as I'm concerned: I have strong sexual desires to being both dominated and dominant. (Doubtless these desires are related to the patriarchal culture I grew up, but also so is literally everything else about me.) Not expressing these desires is an unhealthy sexual repression. Expressing these desires outside of an explicitly negotiated context is dangerous and/or unethical.

In order to side-step reality, BDSM advocates will instead claim that nothing counts as abuse as long as it is “consensual.”   I understand that there can be criticisms of an activity even if it's consensual, but to say that there's no difference between an activity where consent is present and the same activity where consent isn't present is just ridiculous.   People could easily get their adrenalin and endorphin rushes through other activities; if they really wanted to be in pain, there are plenty of ways to self-harm. What differentiates BDSM is that it does involve, and is used to justify, interpersonal and sexualized violence.   So other activities that involve pain are okay, so long as they don't involve sex? It seems like sex is being singled-out here and I'm not sure why.   How would you teach women that they are owed bodily integrity, freedom from violence, and mutually pleasurable activities if they are also taught that it’s normal for sex to be degrading, painful, and non-mutual?   ""If you want to do it, go ahead. If somebody does something you don't consent to doing, call the police.""   How do you expect to prosecute and prevent domestic violence when you promote controlling relationships, sexualized abuse, and psychological and physical abuse as part of “healthy” relationships?   How else do you prosecute a case like that? You demonstrate to the jury that the acts occurred, and that they were non-consensual.   How would you teach men to respect women and want to engage in mutually pleasurable activities if they are also taught that it is sexy to hurt, dominate, and coerce women?   CONSENT   How do you expect to teach men about affirmative consent when BDSM practices themselves do not embody affirmative consent — including situations where consent is physically impossible?   As far as I see it there are two possible answers:   Since it's illegal (at least in some countries) and consent can't be withdrawn - don't do it, or Since it's permissible to say ""okay doctor I consent to the removal of some part of my body while I'm unconscious"", why is it not okay to say ""okay partner I consent to being spanked for up to 10 minutes while I have a gag in my mouth""?

Kink/bdsm stuff is a somewhat important part of my relationships, which are loving and stable. I am also 100% a feminist.   My single biggest issue is with this statement:    regardless of the sexual orientations and gender identities of those involved, BDSM still reinforces the latter point, and can cause, for example, lesbian, gay, female doms to internalize heterosexism and misogyny.   My partner and I are both switches - we change who tops and who bottoms. She's a cis woman, I'm an afab genderqueer-y person. The person who's topping isn't emulating masculinity, nor is the person bottoming reinforcing anything about femininity. For us it's about creating an artificial power dynamic in an otherwise extremely egalitarian relationship. It's about being able to identify what we want (even if that is something we're not supposed to, like pain), and being able to ask for it or give it to the other person in a safe and respectful way.

The things you list as currently policed sexual behaviors are policed and punished because they involve someone forcing or exerting power over someone who is unable to consent. They hurt someone. BDSM requires consent, or it is just abuse, and I think you walk into dangerous territory when you start talking about punishing or condemning consensual sexual behavior.   What parts of BDSM could have ""harsh consequences or punishments""? There are any number of things that fall under the heading of BDSM that it would seem either silly or actually harmful to restrict.

One of the major absurdities of the law was always the suggestion that it would be possible to take a screenshot from a film that had been passed for public viewing by the BBFC and have it become 'extreme pornography', though only if it was used for the purposes of sexual arousal. Section 16 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 is beyond ridiculous in that it criminalises fantasy material whilst being worded in such a way that it would be legal, for example, to possess footage of someone actually being raped captured on CCTV.

But I fear, well, they sure don't seem like the norm."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,draw_it_now,5,Mon May 18 10:07:38 2015 UTC,"Other people have made excellent points regarding the article itself, but I have a different problem with anti-BDSM ideas; as a male submissive, why do we only ever talk about male domination?    Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to make this about men - I think the biggest problem with this is that everyone who talks out against BDSM treats women like children who are incapable of giving consent.  While maledom/femsub is the most common pairing, I think it's very degrading to everyone when women are treated as the 'victims' when there are also men who 'suffer' from this fetish as well. It's ironic then, that anti-BDSM theories actually enforce gender roles more, in my opinion."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,-1,Mon May 18 10:33:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like people talk more about maledom than femdom because it's more common. And because there is historical precedent in male supremacy and male privilege that many people see.  Maledom is socially taught by society. The idea that men are supposed to be dominant, and women submissive. The infantalization of women. As well, women are much more likely to suffer from sexual violence by men, than men are to suffer sexual violence from women.  I don't think it's that people who are kink critical don't realize that femdoms and malesubs exist. It just doesn't seem to be a part of a larger historical and social trend like maledom and femsub seems to be.  And it doesn't seem like to me that people who talks out against BDSM treats women like they're not able to consent. Believing that something is problematic doesn't mean that you don't also think that consent is important, or that women aren't consenting. I don't want anyone hurting themselves, but I don't think that means I'm infantilizing them.  When you live in a male supremacist, white supremacist society, I feel that it does harm to everyone and makes everyone internalize harmful feelings. It seems like you would expect that feelings of male supremacy or white supremacy would be reflected in people's sexualities. But also tragic."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,Raven_Darkmore,3,Tue May 19 08:52:52 2015 UTC,I don't think that means I'm infantilizing them.   I'm sorry but telling people that you know what harms/helps someone better than they do is infantilizing them. It's paternalistic bullshit at it's finest.
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,0,Tue May 19 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"Some things are harmful, though, even though they're consenting to them.  Ingesting heroine is harmful. I don't think it's infantalizing to say that heroine is harmful.  I'm not saying that I think that fetishes are always this way. But I don't think that being critical of something, and how it relates to society and oppression, is infantalizing or paternalistic.  Also, I think that ageplay is infantilizing. More so than being kink critical."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,justajust,6,Tue May 19 20:42:20 2015 UTC,"BDSM isn't one thing, it's a web of related things consenting adults do with one another for a number of wildly different reasons.   ""Anti-BDSM"" essentializes individual sexual practice. All of the ""policing"" you've described revolves around consent and nothing more -- an animal or child cannot consent to sex.   Policing consensual sexual activities is indefensible."

But I'm not sure that accepting that all of it is psychologically or socially healthy is good, either.  One thing I've heard often from kink critical feminists, is that consent is the bare minimum. I think that's a very good way of putting this.  And BDSM is also fantasy. It's in porn and stories and music. This song appears to be about a daddy dom fantasy. In a society where women are dominated and infantilized socially. This seems to be a very recurring depiction of male and female sexuality. This video is sexualizing the idea of fictional children.(Pharrell's It Girl Video) And a lot of people make the excuse that things like this aren't sexualizing children, because no children are involved. Or that these ""loli"" characters, are simply adults who look or act young.  At what point is something like ageplay, daddy doms and songs like this sexualizing children? What of shotacon and lolicon? What of games like Tera Online and the sexualization of childlike characters like the Elin? Is that ""harmless kink""?  And what of all of the pornography that sexualizes rape and pedophilia, but doesn't contain any actual rape or children?"
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,cavemancolton,5,Mon May 18 10:18:22 2015 UTC,"More often than not, Ageplay or Daddy/little situations are about fetishizing innocence, and have nothing to do with pedophilia.  There was a good post on r/sex/ about this."

Some things we mean when we say innocence are very admirable and wonderful, and something to praise and admire in people of all ages.  But it seems like the kind of innocence people sexualize in ageplay sometimes, is the very kind of innocence that prevents children from being able to consent in the first place. Being immature and not knowing, and not understanding the world.  It seems kind of worrying to be sexualizing the very thing about children that prevents them from being able to consent."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,justajust,1 point,Mon May 18 10:36:54 2015 UTC,I don't agree that the sexualization of children in pop culture is related to ageplay. I see it as an emergent manifestation of intersecting patriarchal/consumer values.  I'd go after the Disney channel first.

(disability etc.)   I've been wondering lately about doing a similar post re: can we talk about the issues with insisting BDSM/kinked ppl should not claim GSM/queer ID  I am a kinked person who is also kink and sex critical, yeh? So suffice it to say, as the thread and many comments show, that there are plenty of people who are Feminist who are also ID'ing as kinked who are ALSO critical of and struggling with the issues with both kink as sexual ID and the kink community - which should be understood as related but distinct.  eg. I have friends and lovers all of which are kinked and feminist and kink-critical and also all trans or nb and neurodiverse ppl. Many of us have a history of abuse, and have experienced abuse within kink relationships and kink community as well as outside of same.    (plz no commenters insisting that's why we're 'deviant' can't handle that rn).  Anyways, all these folks are non-abusive and very self-reflexive kinksters. All of us have major issues with the kink community/culture as a whole, which has massive massive issues with abuse and misogyny (though as other commenters have said, not necessarily more than other communities, but certainly as 'bad' as gaming, STEM, geek culture, queer communities etc).  All of us have also had good experiences, met good people, know there's community-within-community safer spaces and feminist spaces and kink critical kinksters and can see the value in the community becoming more self-aware about its own diversity.   There's work to be done that mirrors issues in other marginal communities - kinkter-on-kinkster abuse and sexual violence is often not addressed appropriately and victim blaming and shaming etc are pretty rife and need stamping out. Some sections of the community deploy 'kink shamer!' to defend against very real accusations of abuse or abusive practices.  The community does make lots of attempts to self police, and that works in some sub sections, but there's totally big issues.  These issues are not with kink/BDSM as a sexual identity per se, as others have said: these issues are about the particular dysfunctions that can occur in marginalised communities under misogynist/patriarchal/colonial/capitalist society.  So there's a distinct difference when you're speaking 'kink as sexual ID/individual kinkters' and 'kink/BDSM community and culture both historically and today'.  And then you have 'the nilla publics intersection with both kink-ID'd ppl and the kink community, which is 80-90% fucked up most of the time'.  Is v complex (sorry if I rambled, cognitive function is blergh today)."

SRSDiscussion,36asr0,The_Bombardier,2,Mon May 18 07:02:08 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you so much - essentially 'SAME'.    I, personally, feel that my kinked/BDSM sexual identity is a) inherent, not chosen b) queer and c) arguably falls under GSM  I don't talk about it because, even in places where swerfism, terfism etc are unwelcome, kink is still often mentioned in a 'ohgods kinksters are trying to take GMS/queer again doesn't that suck'.  As a pansexual, polyamorous, scaly, kinked person who is aware how heavily our community and identity intersects with people who are already 'acceptably' queer and someone who likens my kink ID to my pansexual ID and feels they are both inherent/were present since childhood it's a bit tough.  As I explore more and more, I am coming to realise just how much being a submissive sadomasochist is essential and core to my sexuality/sexual expression/romantic identity etc.  As in, both romance and sex without kink and D/s is... just not what I am interested in or fulfilled by.  I need/require that element just as much as I need to express attraction to all genders as much as I need to be free to love more than one person.  And all of that is inherent to who I am and has been present since I was born (I believe).  While I still exist in a world where all of the ways I sexualy and romantically identify are stigmatised and (often times) illegal, it's going to be a bit hard to keep seeing people view kink as heterosexual, heteronormative and not equated to GSM/queer.  Mostly because the ways I am treated or viewed as pansexual and polyamorous, or the ways I see my nb/trans partners viewed and treated, or the ways I see other queer folk viewed and treated, feel the same as the way my kinked sexuality/identity is treated.  Oh wait I just remembered polyamory is not welcome in GSM a lot of places because... ""polyamorous ppl are all white and privileged and don't experience intersections of oppression AT ALL"", as far as I can tell?  But as far as marriage equality and facing some stigma there's blocks to that romantic ID vs heteronormative relationships sooo. puts head down on desk and feels blat  Oh kay don't derail smacks self I just wanted to say thanks."

I think this gets at the biggest error of thinking people have with kink. In the more 'sex negative' camp you've got the idea of kink as some sort of 'disorder' of 'normal' sexual functioning. 'Normal' sexuality is seen as natural and inherent; kinks or paraphilias are something that diverts that natural function, something people can be trained out of or weaned off, like a drug addiction. The problem is that more 'sex positive' folk, at least the ones who aren't paraphiliacs themselves, don't necessarily challenge those sorts of assumptions at their root. What I mean is, they assume, perhaps based on their own experiments with a bit of light bondage or sensory deprivation or sensation play or whatever that paraphilias are, for want of a better word, a 'choice'. Now, even if paraphilias were a choice, of course, this wouldn't fundamentally change people's right to seek (or abstain from) consensual and ethical sexual experiences freely, but the fact of the matter is that, at least for me personally, and for many people I know, my paraphilia, my kink is, as you say, not something that I use to 'spice up' my sex life. It is my sex life. Indeed, normative sex (that is to say, penetrative sex) is for me more something I occasionally do to spice up sadism and domination. I knew I was a sadist before I knew I was queer, and it is something that has caused me a lot of internal anguish. I spent most of my teenage years and into my early twenties on and off trying to 'reprogram' myself, to have a 'normal' sexuality, convinced that I was monstrous. I suffered through multiple relationships that were poisoned from the very beginning by this futile quest, and hurt myself and others in the process. For me, sex and indeed romantic love is definitely impossible without kink. I know this is true for many other people I've spoken to, played with and loved in recent years. Having a paraphilia isn't a mental disorder, but it is a difference. Most people I've talked to about it can remember their paraphilia being part of them back before they went through puberty, something that fascinated them before it took on sexual dimensions. For some people (I am thinking particularly here certain sorts of masochists or algolagnics) it might be something that they're wired for neurologically from birth. It is rooted so deep in the psyche that, like gender preference, it becomes an essential part of the adult person, something that quite simply cannot be wished away. I think this can be very hard to understand for a lot of people, and I think a lot of the backlash against BDSM comes from a failure of the imagination, rooted in an ignorance of this very fundamental nature of paraphilia for many. People project their own experiences on to others; if they think something is unpleasant, then they think all people must really think it unpleasant, and anyone who professes otherwise is broken or brainwashed. No one could actually find physical pain to be sexually stimulating, much less find it to be an essential part of erotic or romantic love. No one could really, truly, actively want to be urinated on, and so on."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,nubyrd,2,Mon May 18 09:27:24 2015 UTC,"/u/Quietuus is correct, it's a gish gallop.  She asserts several premises framing BDSM in the absolute worst light possible, and goes from there.  BDSM is a means of exploring and experiencing emotions and endorphins via controlled, consensual psychological and physical means.  It's not even sexual for a lot of people.  There's as much gender role bullshit within it as anything else in life.  Generally it's ""Man strong dominant, woman weak submissive"", although there are lots of exceptions, just like elsewhere in life.  I don't think there's anything inherent about BDSM that promotes these roles, it's simply reflective of society.  Finally, one thing I find interesting about this discussion is the reality that people read books, go to movies, and play video games, ultimately as a means of  experiencing certain emotions and endorphins.  These often aren't fluffy, happy, positive experiences.  People watch, read, and play things which are scary, morbid, disgusting, challenging, loathsome, more adjectives, etc.  BDSM is the exact same thing, just utilizing role playing and the controlled infliction of pain and other sensations.  You can argue that aspects of how BDSM is generally practiced are problematic, just as you can argue that certain media contain problematic elements, but arguing that BDSM is somehow inherently bad and anti-feminist is ridiculous."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,0,Tue May 19 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Sex is a little bit more personal of an experience than watching a movie or playing a video game, I would think. At least, it is often a very intimate part of people's relationship and communication in a way that movies often are not.  I would also question the sadism in video games and what it might reflect. While I don't think that video games cause violence, it does seem like they can be a part of a culture glorifying sadism and violence rather than empathy and understanding. And that culture in general, and all of its pieces and parts, can probably contribute to violence. And ways of feeling about the word that are unempathetic, and focused on one's personal ego and entitlement, rather than the needs of others, and violence from that.  I look at empathy and compassion, feeling others feelings and their needs and caring about them, as a basis of motivation for kindness and justice. That feelings of empathy and kindness lead to good actions, and should be nurtured and entertained. While cruel and violent feelings being nurtured, ones without empathy, can lead to insensitivity and injustice.  I guess that's my worldview, but I feel like it is always best to strive to empathy and nurturing empathy. If one doesn't like the thought of hurting fictional characters, even if they aren't real, there's probably a very good reason for that. And if one doesn't like the idea of dominating and degrading their partner consensually 'in the bedroom' as they say, there's probably a good reason for that, too."

SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,0,Wed May 20 16:09:12 2015 UTC,"It's controversial, I think. There was actually a big discussion about it, recently here at SRSDiscussion.  BDSM seems to be pretty well accepted in sex-positive and liberal feminism. As far as I can tell, at least. While among second wave feminists and radical feminists, people are much more kink critical.  Kink Critical is what people call feminism that is critical of BDSM.  A simple way of explaining what I see as the difference between these two lines of thought, is that for many liberal feminists, as long as there is choice and consent involved, any sex act is a positive thing. While more radical feminists say that ""consent is the very bare minimum for positive expression of sexuality"". And see BDSM as a glorification and normalization of violent sexuality and violent feelings. And BDSM is still controversial discussions about it still today have their roots in the ""feminist sex wars"" that started many decades ago.  Personally, I find it horrifying. I don't think it should be illegal. But I find it totally horrifying and I try not to think about it. I also find this to be true of violence in general. That's why I have my username. I think that violence is horrible. And I try to avoid violent entertainment. So I can't possibly imagine how someone would want to find sexual pleasure in violence, torture, cruelty, and oppression. But as someone who has an aversion to violence and simply finds the thought of others suffering or the concept of rape incredibly disturbing and not sexy at all, I guess it's not really my place to judge.  But I don't understand where such a desire would come from. Rape is one of the most horrible forms of torture and cruelty that exist. And people fetishize it. Even trying to empathize with people into BDSM, trying to imagine what it would be like being sexually attracted to such horrors, and not being able to help it. I can't imagine how it would be worth continuing to do such a thing. That the sexual pleasure would become worth all of the psychological pain. Just thinking of rape and the concept of rape is incredibly disturbing to me, and can make me very depressed and anxious and woeful. And I don't understand why people feel pleasure from that, rather than the same empathetic pain that I feel. Furthermore, I don't understand the appeal of games like Grand Theft Auto where the whole point seems to be sadistic pleasure in causing harm to others.   I personally feel like some kinks are unhealthy. Sexualizing body parts or other fetishes like that don't seem unhealthy. But sexualizing rape, infantalization, or the idea of children, racism, and other problems in the world, don't seem healthy to me. But I guess again, I'm biased, because these things are horrifying to me, not sexy. And even if I did find them sexy, the psychological pain that just thinking about them makes me feel, would override any sense of sexual pleasure, and make the sexual pleasure not worth it.  I feel like this blog expresses a lot of my understanding, or lack of understanding, about BDSM."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,Quietuus,5,Mon May 18 09:42:36 2015 UTC,"That's annoying, I typed out a big long thing and then my browser crashed.  That blog post seems really confused to me; very much a secular 'love the sinner, hate the sin' sort of thing, and based on ideas that just aren't true. Trying to 'reprogram' a full-blown paraphilia is about as much of a fool's errand as trying to make queer people straight or trans people cis, and there is no evidence it can be done reliably by any clinical professional, and certainly not by an individual at home. This is why they resort to measures such as 'chemical castration' with sex offenders. The blog post basically trots out a few messages of tolerance then 180's. I really hope that it's not a resource young people struggling to deal with their sexualities in this way come across, that's all I can say.  I understand why people can be disgusted and afraid of BDSM, I really do. I think it's good that you try to acknowledge the way your feelings might be prejudicing you. Personal feelings of disgust and repulsion are terrible reasons to base our decisions about other people's sexual ethics on. I see heirarchies of respectability and so on even within kinky communities, which is something that I personally am very critical of. The almost universal disdain shown towards scat fetishists, for example.  I think the thing to try to understand is that, to people who have a different psychological make-up, these things carry massively different import."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,-2,Mon May 18 23:25:16 2015 UTC,"Do you really feel that paraphilias are comparable to things like sexual orientation? Pedophilia and zoophilia and other highly problematic things are paraphilias, too. And I certainly don't want to encourage people to be zoophiles or pedophiles.  I don't know about how much you can change paraphillias, but some paraphilias are very unhealthy. And I think it would be best to... well.. I think that if someone can avoid being a pedophile, they should. And we should at least be critical of fetishes and kinks and paraphilias."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,Quietuus,6,Tue May 19 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"The comparison doesn't come from an ethical stance, it comes from the best clinical evidence on the matter. With paedophiles, particularly, there has been a lot of effort put into trying to 'reprogram' people, and there's no solid evidence anything works reliably; this is why chemical castration is seriously talked about. Admittedly, almost all this work has been done with people who have already committed sexual offences, which introduces a lot of problems; a much higher degree of people with antisocial personality disorders than you'd expect in a general population, for example, who might not be co-operative with the process. You might also argue that people who have crossed that line into actualising a desire might have reinforced it additionally. But this is generally born out in attempts to 'cure' people of all sorts of paraphilias. It might be possible to broaden someone's sexual desires to the point where a fetish object or process or so on is not necessary, so that the paraphilia is not exclusive, but removing a desire completely doesn't seem to really be possible. I agree that, ideally, having people avoid developing certain attractions might be in both their and others best interests, but the problem is that by the time we might identify someone as having a paraphilia, it's probably too late. I mean, personally, I was aware of my paraphilia from perhaps even before puberty. How are we supposed to catch people at that age, and what could possibly be done to retrain them? Bearing in mind that most therapies devised for this sort of thing involve behavioural therapy techniques like guided masturbation, and we're potentially talking about children under twelve. It's also worth asking whether this is worth the effort and intrusion into people's lives, given that a non-trivial portion of people who abuse children probably aren't clinical paedophiles.   What can be done is to do what we can to prevent people from acting on desires in ways that are harmful. Moving back on to the topic at hand, personally, I think part of this is creating structures and spaces in which potentially problematic sexual desires can be explored by consenting adults in non-harmful ways, which at its best is what BDSM certainly aims at being, though it certainly is not achieved at all times. As I've said, you can be critical throughout this process, but you can't criticise the desires away."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,-1,Tue May 19 09:05:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much people can reprogram anything to do with their sexuality. But I think that people should direct their sexual desires in the most healthy and empathetic directions possible.  If a pedophile can learn to be attracted to adults rather than children, they should direct their attractions to adults, instead of children.   You might also argue that people who have crossed that line into actualising a desire might have reinforced it additionally.   Do you think that sexual desires like pedophilia can't be reinforced?"
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,Quietuus,4,Wed May 20 15:58:45 2015 UTC,"This is a thread about BDSM. I don't think it's necessarily productive to keep dragging it off in the direction of paedophilia. I expanded on that point above because you bought it up, and because paedophilia is one area where serious effort has been put in to 'reprogramming'. Whilst I believe there are similarities between all sorts of paraphilia (certainly in terms of their formation and so on), it is certainly somewhat different to BDSM. In paedophilia it is not only the process of the desire that is problematic, the object of desire cannot give proper consent.    I think that people should direct their sexual desires in the most healthy and empathetic directions possible.   I do not really understand what you mean by this.

If you take sadomasochism to include wanting to receive or give pain during sex, I disagree with this quite a lot. It takes a lot of empathy, I think, to be able to understand what a partner wants or needs, to know from someone's body language etc what feels good to them (especially when what feels good to someone else doesn't feel good to you), to recognize good pain from bad pain. For me at least (everyone does things differently) most of the pleasure I get out of topping is knowing the person bottoming is getting pleasure - is making happy noises or is blissed out or whatever - from the things I'm doing to them. (And vice versa - there's an endorphin rush when I experience certain kinds of pain being given by someone I love and trust completely, who I know will stop if I say stop and slow down if she things I'm not enjoying myself, and who laughs and smiles when she can see I feel good.)   I know this is just my personal experience, but I don't think it's so far outside the norm (from lots of people I've talked to online and in person) that it's not a relevant counterpoint. It has less to do with being critical of BDSM from a larger-society perspective, but to say that SM as a paraphilia ""doesn't come from a very empathetic place"" to me is a very narrow way of thinking about it."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,ViolenceIsTerrible,-1,Wed May 20 17:48:41 2015 UTC,"There are different meanings to empathy. At its heart, BDSM is simulating pain and violence. The fact that someone wants something on some level means you can say something about empathy. But at the same time, wanting to make someone feel pain on some level seems unempathetic in a way.  Also, saying there is both good pain and bad pain feels like blurring a very important line. Pain isn't really supposed to be a good thing. Most of life isn't just pure pleasure, and there's pain involved. But I don't think that most people view pain as a good thing.  Fantasies don't exist in a vacuum. I wouldn't say that giving someone heroine is empathetic. They might feel both pleasure and pain and want you to do it. But it's still not a very compassionate thing to do, to give someone heroine.   Perhaps another way of putting it, is that the concept of degradation, inflicting pain on others, sadism, rape, and things like that, are incredibly disturbing. And can't help but invoke an un-ignorable suffering of real people out there you're emulating the experiences of consensually. People using the actual non-consensual suffering as something to be imitated for their consensual kink. Why desire to emulate and perform, consensually, the suffering of actual victims who didn't consent, and who's cries of suffering were actual cries of suffering?  And wouldn't the body language and general communication in BDSM like rapeplay be very similar to the body language of an actual victim? I mean, as actresses and actors, isn't that what people are pretending and emulating?   There's also a disturbing level of doublethink in BDSM for people like me. Emulating something violent to show appreciation. Empathizing with a desire to be hurt, and responding to that desire by hurting. Pain being not pain and good. Showing appreciation through degradation. Showing consideration through inconsideration.  It feels like saying one wants to show their belief in women's empowerment by writing stories with the most unempowering examples of female characterization possible, because some people like that.  Why show love and appreciation through performing its opposite?  Edit: Sorry, I know I didn't do a very good job of responding. This is a very complicated and difficult place for me to share my feelings on. And I feel like empathy in relation to something like this would be very complicated. It's hard to me to communicate my feelings and understanding of this situation."
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,tilia-cordata,2,Wed May 20 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"I had a big long reply, and then had to leave to drive my partner to the airport, so deleted it. I'm glad I did, since your edit. Though I will say that some of the stuff you've written, about emulating actual victims? Is so far away from how I and most people I know do BDSM that it actually offends me a little that you'd make that comparison.   I mostly want to push back against your analogies - of BDSM to heroin use and to media representation - because I think they each miss a critical distinction. Heroin use can kill a person, and frequently does. There are risks to various kinky practices, but few of them are so potentially life-destroying as heroin. Writing ""unempowered"" women in the media because ""some people like that"" also forces that representation on the millions of people who don't like that. There's a whole lot of non-consenting parties in that situation.   Can I offer up a different kind of analogy? People make and sell hot sauce out of ghost chili peppers. (I picked a random link to a random hot sauce, but it's illustrative.) Eating something that spicy almost certainly causes physical pain. But for some people, it also tastes good. Stripped of the social context of patriarchy/etc (which I think is something it's important to examine in BDSM as in all things), kink/pain play/ SM/etc is a lot more like hot sauce than heroin. Unpleasant for many, enjoyable for some, not life-threatening, and only good when there's been consent.   Does that make a little more sense? I understand that things are hard - I do think it's possibly important to separate criticisms of BDSM based on your personal discomforts/feelings out from criticisms based on social structures and broader cultural impact. (Like, in my hot sauce example, criticizing a brand of hot sauce because you think it tastes bad vs one that, I don't know, uses racist imagery in it's label.)   Does that make sense?"
SRSDiscussion,36asr0,klavierthrowaway,1 point,Thu May 21 05:43:17 2015 UTC,"Hi there, thanks for sharing your point of view. I don't blame you for feeling that way. I think I would call myself a kink-critical kinky person. I do agree that many aspects of BDSM are wrapped up in our patriarchal, racist society; I think it's silly to insist that it's a completely separate thing. With that said, I can't change my kinks. They are a part of me. Let me try to give you my point of view as a sadomasochistic person.   I am very averse to violence and oppression, both against humans and animals. Growing up I was a very sensitive child and cried easily when hearing or witnessing any kind of suffering. So I think you need to realize that getting sexual pleasure from these fantasies doesn't imply someone lacks empathy or genuinely wishes violence upon themselves or others. Ever since I was in elementary school, even before I knew anything about sex, I fantasized about being tied up, whipped and abused. Who knows where this came from. But it certainly became a part of me I could never get rid of no matter how I wanted to. I did have a hard childhood and very low self-esteem, but even now as a relatively happy adult, I can't shake those kinks. The only thing that would be accomplished by denying myself those kinks is that I would be very unhappy.   I think the sexual fantasies of domination/submission come from a need for a certain dynamic between the two partners. For instance, a submissive craves a feeling of total release of control and absolute trust in another person. Maybe the person gets stressed and tired out by making so many decisions and having so much uncertainty in their life and this gives them a feeling of certainty and safety. Maybe they are dealing with a lot of emotional pain in their life and the physical pain allows for some kind of cathartic release. A dominant craves the opposite, perhaps because they want to feel powerful or maybe they just enjoy pleasing their submissive. The reasons people do it vary quite a bit but I guarantee you, very few people would actually get turned on by a real act of violence. Perhaps some do but interestingly, you'll find that some doms are actually masochists who have discovered the joy of fulfilling the masochistic pleasures of others."

I also highly suspect that Fenway would certainly be open to partners of trans people without policing your identity or hers.  http://fenwayhealth.org/  if fenway is the center you are referring to, that sucks and i think there's some people who should hear about it.

Sometimes LGBT clinics can be rough places to like, cold call...they often are doing the best they can on really stretched resources. But people can be rude and stressed and shit.    I'm looking at their forms online right now...really under 7. ""do you think of yourself as...""  there should be a box for partner of a trans person.    i would probably suggest calling back and trying to reach other people who are more helpful.  I don't know if it's true at Fenway, but I know my clinic will serve hetero identified people even though they are an LGBT clinic. They are an LGBT-centered and focused clinic, but they won't turn anyone away. Hopefully fenway is the same way.  you might also try /r/ainbow or /r/lgbt because undoubtedly there are people in those groups who are Fenway patients. though they might troll you about your partner, IDK."

One of the strangest things about my situation is how angry it makes people who shouldn't care one way or the other. I'm just trying to get back on my feet, just trying to enjoy a normal life, spend time with my partner, do things that human beings do to feel normal, loved, accepted. I've been called a junkie (I've never done drugs) a leech, a f****t, a bum, and more, just recently. Why is my relationship with a woman I like so goddamn stressful to other people (even people whom you'd think would be more understanding, such as r/ainbow)?

SRSDiscussion,35zlqm,OMGItsNotAPhaseMom,4,Tue May 19 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"This doesn't solve the long-term problem of having local healthcare providers willing to work with you, but here are a couple of links where you can order free condoms online:   Condom USA A small list of websites that give out free samples.  OFree.net (search ""condoms"", although some offers require you do something to get them I believe)   There's also this website which claims to show where in the US you can find free condoms.   Now, to return to the actual issue at hand, I think that requiring people who use their services to identify themselves a certain way completely defeats the purpose of trying to provide services to an at-risk group (because not everyone who is actually an MSM would be willing to identify themselves that way on a form to begin with!). Its particularly disturbing considering that these sort of barriers to accessing healthcare is part of the reason why trans women are less likely to be able to have safer sex / get tested regularly / etc.   Depending on your comfort level, I have a couple of possible suggestions about what you can do, besides ordering free condoms online:   Send an email about this to the clinic in hopes of it getting to a different person (and also because then you have a concrete record of their answer). Maybe it was just this one asshole, maybe they do actually have transphobic policies at this clinic. Getting them to say that outright in an email can give you leverage - because I agree with /u/javatimes , this is important knowledge and if you are willing to make it known that this is the case, it could put pressure on the clinic to change their policies. That's a lot of work, though, when all you want is somewhere you can go to get free condoms and testing. It's really fair if you're not up for it. The other option is to use the link above to see if there are any other places in your area you could go. Or, if your girlfriend knows any other trans women, she might be able to ask around to see if they know of any clinics that are more welcoming.  Speaking of asking people where they go... Where do straight men go to get tested in your area? If Planned Parenthood only offers services to women (which seems strange to me) and this place will only offer services for men who've had sex with men, there seems to be a gap. You could ask one of these places where you'd actually be able to get services, if they are unable to provide them for you, or just ask around generally.  You may also be able to go into this clinic again or to a university clinic and just ""grab and go."" Do they make you do an intake form to just take a bunch of condoms and leave again? Again, this is a short-term solution, but better than having to go without!   I hope this helps! I do think you were treated really shittily by that intake person, regardless of what the policies of their clinic are, and if you want to make a fuss about it I think you'd be well within your rights. However, I can also understand just wanting to find out where you can go and leave it at that. Best of luck to you, either way. This shit should not have to be this complicated, I'm sorry. :("

SRSDiscussion,35viwq,chupamillama,4,Thu May 14 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"Well this wasn't directed at you in particular. Since courts and public opinion should ideally be independent, then surely when we think and talk about them as substitutes for on another, and as qualitatively the same thing, we exacerbate the problem. My only point was that we shouldn't do this.   Who advocates for the replacement of the judicial system by public opinions???   For example, I think when the argument is made that ""If this person, a rapist, warranted social exclusion, they would have been/already have been excluded by the legal system"", it implicitly suggests the purpose and effects of social exclusion are the same as that of the criminal justice system, which is not true. And when the rejoinder is made ""But the criminal justice system is not good at dealing with rapes"", it also falls into the same faulty frame. The reality is that the two things are very different and should be considered independently.  A private action could be literally any private (meaning non-governmental) response to knowledge that someone is a rapist or has been accused of rape, which could range from not friending someone on Facebook to not inviting them into a club where other members would feel uncomfortable."
SRSDiscussion,35viwq,MySilverWhining,4,Thu May 14 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of the cases that make the news involve entertainers, such as Jian Ghomeshi and various athletes.  The qualifications for being an entertainer are arbitrary and capricious enough that I don't have much of a problem with people saying that someone who commits a violent crime, or a sexually violent crime in particular, should lose their ability to work as an entertainer.  This is something in the public's control, and the public shouldn't feel ashamed of using their power to punish someone above and beyond how they're punished by the criminal justice system (with the caveat that we shouldn't make ourselves easy tools of personal retribution; we shouldn't be suckers.)  And there are also jobs that a past sexual crime should probably disqualify someone for:  you wouldn't hire an HR director who just got out of prison for rape.   Beyond that, I think there's a level at which we should exercise restraint.  People who have served a prison sentence should be allowed to re-integrate into society.  Everything we know about recidivism says that social integration, the ability to work and have personal relationships, is key to reducing future offenses.  We have to balance the need to punish against the fact that it's dangerous to create a class of people who have a lesser stake in society.  To do that, we have to accept the punishments inflicted by the criminal justice system as sufficient.  If every person in society reserves the right to add their own blow to an offender's sentence, then the offender is basically permanently excluded from the social contract and is driven to act outside of it.  And when people are not convicted by the criminal justice system, we should consider how that result follows from processes that we have learned to insist on as vital safeguards against injustice.  The usual political dynamic on this issue is that the right indulges in knee-jerk calls for retribution against essentially ""evil"" people while the left invokes human frailty and capacity to change, social cohesion, and the rational argument of minimizing recidivism.  However, there's a strong vein of sentiment on the left that we should make sexual offenses a special case.  If someone is accused of robbing a liquor store, we want rigorous attention to the evidence, full exoneration if the case isn't proved, and if the offense is proved, to let bygones be bygones once someone has ""paid their debt.""  If someone is accused of rape, we are queasy about casting a critical eye on the evidence, and in some sense we want the person to be permanently compromised by the accusation, regardless of any time served or even regardless of whether any evidence was presented.  And that brings us to the crux of the issue, which is that if we take it upon ourselves to punish, we have to accept the responsibility to be just.  The criminal justice system presents us with a concrete illustration of the standards we require of justice:  we demand that prejudicial statements be excluded, that basic facts be supported by evidence, that both sides be given equal opportunity to present their case, and a thousand other conditions that we've learned are crucial to fairness thanks to centuries of trial and error (heh.)  We demand that the process by which we punish someone take into account as much as humanly possible the fallibility of jurors, their susceptibility to unfair tactics, the potential misuse of the criminal justice system, and so on.  We demand that our criminal justice system meet those standards because it has the power to deprive people of property, liberty, and in some cases, life.  Do we, personally, want to live up to those standards?  Of course not.  It's a tedious, exacting process.  That's why we have a professional class of legal specialists, and why we compel and compensate participation as jurors.    What if we required ourselves to meet standards of fairness that were proportional to our capacity to punish, using the criminal justice system as a benchmark?  I think in most cases people who were required to meet that standard, without any ability to cheat, would exercise very little of their capacity to punish.  I think that kind of restraint is appropriate, and I do not understand why people would hold the criminal justice system to such high standards and then place such confidence in their own second-guessing while not holding themselves to a tenth or even a hundredth of the level of rigor."

SRSDiscussion,35mwzh,oskomena,4,Thu May 14 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"My perspective is that we are in danger of mixing up discrimination, wanton disrespect and perceived disrespect in this discussion.  And the danger from this is that dominant groups get to define disrespect as perceived by them as worse than discrimination experienced by subordinate groups.    If we break this situation down into smaller elements: what are the specific power differences here, where is the discrimination, and where is the disrespect, I see it as follows:    The power differences are apparently class, gender and culture/religion (as far as we are told).  The employer has a dominant class and cultural position, the potential employee has a dominant gender position.  It is not a case of religious views versus gender discrimination, but a question of whether such a meeting can be free of gender, class and culture-based discrimination, and whether it can in addition be mutually respectful.    Class discrimination is hard to avoid in the sense that the employer/jobseeker relationship is inherently unequal, but labor gluts and shortages can change the power dynamics to a degree.  In any case this is not what the OP is asking about.    Gender discrimination here by the employer would mean refusing to consider the merits of an applicant based on their gender.  By the employee it would mean refusing to consider an employer based on their gender.  Here I think there appears to be only slight discrimination on both sides.  If the applicant was a religious woman, the meeting would not have been so awkward for the employer who is also a woman and the issue may not have arisen unless a man was put in charge of hiring (in which case the issue would not have arisen with this male jobseeker).    Cultural discrimination seems to be the hot issue here from both directions.  From the employer's culture, not shaking hands with someone of the opposite sex appears to be disrespectful.  Does this give them the right to discriminate against the jobseeker?  The jobseeker in this case made every attempt to be respectful, even submissive, by bowing.  But the employer appeared not take into account the intention to be respectful, but only considered their own perception from their own cultural standards.      The jobseeker's perspective may be that their cultural/religious taboos are being disrespected by a requirement to behave according to standards dictated by a dominant culture with no reference to their ability to do the job.  But they did not take into account the employer's cultural sensitivity to this as a kind of signal of male superiority or female inferiority.  However he is not in a position to discriminate against the employer on the basis of his beliefs and judgments of the employer's culture, so he does not and cannot be said to discriminate.  We can only decide if WE think he is being disrespectful, not discriminatory.  If he was witholding resources or doling out punishments on the basis of gendered beliefs, this would be discriminatory, but witholding a handshake and replacing it with a bow and putting his hand to his chest instead is something less than that.    The nature of such power dynamics between social groups is that there is much more pressure on subordinate groups to be sensitive to dominant group perceptions than vice versa.  He was very unskilful in doing this, not by refusing to shake hands with the woman, but by doing so after he had shook hands with men in the room.  By that token he is drawing attention both to his difference and to the sex of the women in the room.  A dominant culture will often tend to react to such discomfort by stigmatising the subordinate culture which they perceive to have created the discomfort."
SRSDiscussion,35mwzh,piyochama,5,Tue May 12 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"As a Latin American I really take exception to the ""culture"" disclaimer. Sexism in South America is suffocating.

I don't want that sexism to be exported under the guise of tolerance.

If he doesn't want to shake hands with a woman that's his prerogative, but I don't see how that should be protected by anti-discrimination law."
SRSDiscussion,35mwzh,strong_potato,1 point,Wed May 13 12:50:33 2015 UTC,I largely agree. To me it seems too much like Christians using their religion to discriminate  against women and the LGBT community. I think religious views should be protected by discrimination law only to the extent that they don't discriminate against other groups. You shouldn't be able to sue for religious discrimination  because you  refuse to treat women the same as men.

If anything, the post that you linked to showed that this person made every effort to treat this woman with respect. Not touching her should not really offend her in any way whatsoever.

I would argue that this is a clash of cultures, partly because if the woman was from the same culture as the man in this case, there would likely be no hurt feelings.  In fact if he were to force her into shaking his hand against her will that would be considered disrespectful.    Our experiences of different Muslim cultures will vary, and those we know may not be representative of other Muslims.  I just happen to have been introduced to the concept of not touching people of the opposite sex as something some women sometimes insist on to protect their integrity or purity from the men around them.  The wider dynamics which may make such women feel being left untouched by men as a token of respect rather than disrespect may itself be problematic.  But judging it from the perspective of another culture is also problematic, just as it is problematic when dominant cultures ban mixing of sexes by others because it is perceived as disrespectful to women according to the norms in that dominant culture."

But if not touching women is based on preserving ""purity"", especially of women, then yes, I strongly object to that, and I wonder what the implications of believing women's integrity needs to be ""protected"" from men would be in the professional sphere.

So, flaunting your tits at a club is not risky behavior, like leaving a wallet on your carseat in 'bad neighborhood' is.  What is helpful? Letting people know who they can call for help. Having emergency phones/blue lights on campuses. Teaching self-defense and buying mace is not victim blaming. It's preparedness and it's the reality of life.   What really frustrated me when I worked as a victim advocate at Florida State was the emails from police following a sexual assault notification. There was always a list of crime-prevention tips and they were ALWAYS tailored to avoid what the victim did. If she was raped at a party, it would say to stay sober and never separate from your friend group. If she was raped because she got in a cab that wasn't a cab and the driver took her to a secluded area and raped her (true story) then it would say ""only use trusted transportation sources.""

However, I do understand where you're coming from so I'm making a larger effort to support this claim (PS this is all very heterocentric to meet the scenario I laid out).  I'm also talking a lot about risk factors which, as I said above, can be helpful but can also get into the victim-blaming category. Many of these risk factors cannot be controlled and those at risk of victimization should not feel responsible for alleviating all risk of assault. It's not possible and ending sexual assault should be the main responsibility of possible offenders, not victims. /soapbox. So TW for possible victim-blaming and general descriptions of coercive tactics.   I mean, if we look at childhood sexual abuse and prison/military sexual abuse, clothing has little to no bearing on abuse (children are not showing off cleavage/body parts at home very often, prisoners/military women are dressed nearly identically), especially for repeat assaults. We also (almost) never see this discussed when we think about male sexual assault (whether committed by women or other genders).  In relationship abuse, a victim may be continuously sexually assaulted, so outfits would be rotating.  But let's go back to the club scenario - let's say we have a woman with a low cut top and a woman with a crew neck top on. Both have the same pants, body style, social standing/group, race, etc. The essential difference is cleavage vs. no/minimal cleavage in this example.  There is data that supports that ""hypersexual"" men are more likely to have 'coercive sex'.    Regardless of criminal status or age (juvenile or adult), males who sexually coerced age-appropriate females reported higher levels of sexual drive, frequency of sexual behavior, and sexual deviance on the MIDSA (2008) than noncoercive males. Hypersexuality covaries with a number of negative attributes, including components of negative affect like mood and anxiety disorders and increased substance abuse and impulse-related problems (e.g., LÂngstrˆm & Hansen, 2006). source   However, I don't know that we can accurately say that SEEING cleavage or any other sexualized body part would increase the sexual drive of an already hypersexualized man. It sounds as though from this and the MIDSA scale that was used, these men are preoccupied with sex whether in the presence of desired sexual partners/victims or not. However, it would be foolish to say that seeing boobs isn't going to make someone who is already thinking about sex think about it more. Yet again, would this man target someone JUST for having a low cut top, or look for other risk factors of sexual assault?  Extra TW: Disgusting explanations for/of rape  I did find a study on convicted rapists in Kenya. I don't have access to the article but found a blog post that summarized some of the findings. This may have a biased summarization, but here we go: This is what one of the convicted rapists said:   ” She was attractive, sexy, beautiful, and seductive. On that day,she was in a miniskirt and the clothing was tight on the body. Her lipsticks were red ‘hot,’ and she was proud. I was stronger and more robust than her, so I overpowered her. I was drunk and did not know I was wronging her.” (emphasis mine)   In this instance, he had already found the woman to be attractive, sexy, beautiful, and seductive, and reflected the outfit she wore on that day, which could be construed as 'intentionally sexual' like our low-cut club woman. However, I think the ""I was stronger than her and more robust"" is the part that initiated the actual assault. However, this is just one sample and isn't really representative of rape as a whole, I just found it interesting. Another comment, that disproves my assertion:   The woman was wearing a transparent cloth, and immediately after she greeted me, my body got erected. I tried to seduce her, but she refused to abide by my views. My wife had left for her parents’ house the previous week, and since I was used to performing sex with her always I had a lot of sexual urge.”   So that motivation is a bit unclear, but the mention of her transparent cloth could be telling. It could also be unreliable information as it is coming from a convicted rapist who may be inundated with rape myths and/or continues to make excuses for his actions.   The majority of risk factors for rape involve increased vulnerability on the part of the victim - being alone, being a new student (in the case of campus sexual assault), being intoxicated, having trust in the rapist (partner, friend, acquaintance), gender/sexual minority, walking with headphones in, age, being an ethnic or racial minority, etc. So with all things being equal between our crew neck and low-cut neck line physically, I don't know who is at a higher risk. There are many sources that imply confidence can DECREASE the risk of sexual assault. Many risk-reduction websites suggest walking confidently and as if you are not confused, scared, alone, etc. I have not found any actual sources confirming this, but intuitively, we know vulnerability increases risk, so perhaps a lack of perceived vulnerability decreases risk (a stretch).   I found some articles about clothing choice and how that effects the wearer and others' opinions of her. This study posits that women who are dressed in formal skirts (vs jeans) were ""most happy, successful, feminine, interesting, attractive, intelligent, and wanted as a friend."" This article found that ""Sexually unrestricted women, for example, showed greater shifts in preference for revealing clothing worn to the laboratory near ovulation"" and posits this is in relationship to female-female competition. Men tend to be more attracted to (and can decipher) ovulating women. So maybe our club-goer was ovulating.   TL;DR: I went down a rabbit hole and came up with ""well maybe showing cleavage can increase risk"" but I'm not sure how that relates to sexual assault in a causal manner, and I still don't think this is the same as the ""wallet on the dashboard"" car break in scenario because potential rape victims have what rapists want whether it is on display or not. This is terrible wording but I'm trying to be blunt about it."

Isn't it about both? I mean, certainly many rapists use rape to exert control over their victim, but don't many rapes occur when horny kids decide their need for sex is greater than their need to ask for and receive consent?  Maybe I'm overestimating sex drive, I don't know. It just seems like many rapes occur in situations where the rapist can take advantage of a situation where they hold (unfortunately) plausible deniability over reception of consent and get what they want without having to feel any guilt or get in trouble.   I know I've personally been in situations with women where I could see how other men would choose to ignore obvious signals withholding consent (e.g. ""Oh, well, she's only implying she just wants to make out, so I obviously just need to invade her personal space some more until she gives up and lets me have sex with her."")  Basically, power and control as a means to an end, instead of being the end itself, at least within the context of the kinds of rapes seen on campus and in high schools - the kinds of rapes based around a non-binary interpretation of consent, that are all too often seen as ""not really being rape.""

However, if we look at the theories of rape and the motivations behind it, and we consider that the majority of rape is committed by people known to the victim and that rape is not an impulsive behavior but an often premeditated act, the whole modesty thing kind of goes out the window.  I mean, my scenario is US/Western centric. I'm not muslim nor from a muslim-majority country, so I'm not going to go into that too much, but I know women who wear burqas (or saris or other modest garments in other cultures) are still raped. That's just not a factor in rapists' motivations according to al that I've read about rape motivation and what I've seen (anecdotes) working with survivors of sexual assault.   In non-scientific projects like http://whatiwaswearingwheniwasraped.tumblr.com/, we see a wide variety of clothing and levels of modesty.

SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,meowmixxed,6,Tue May 12 11:02:29 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind I'm not saying anything about the theory itself or saying you're wrong. SRS and much of the SJ community has serious issue with making positive claims without backing them up, which is very problematic because it makes us look bad to anyone who is scientifically literate. A lot of what I see on these subreddits and other places are people talking about theories which they support with positive claims that aren't actually supported by any hard evidence and just fit well with their worldview as it has been constructed by the SJ community. It's unfortunately a natural tendency of human thought, but as an ethical establishment which is looking to better the world through understanding and science, this seriously needs to stop.  I don't want you taking this as a personal attack, it's entirely a normal thing to happen to people. Still happens to me every once in a while, it takes time to get yourself to stop. But to me, it's a moral imperative to help SRS clean out all the gunk it's gotten caught up in and focus more on claims which have actually been substantiated rather than constantly focusing on theory that makes sense but hasn't actually been shown to be conclusive by any means. I didn't know if your claim was supported or not, which is why I asked. Admittedly I had doubts, but I wanted to make sure. You then took things a step further and found actual studies on the subject (kudos, we need more people like you) and confirmed that the claim you made was not by any means conclusive. That's great, I'm happy you did that.  But the next step you took just now was problematic. Rather than conclude that a positive claim could not be made for either position (that wearing revealing clothing does/does not increase the risk of rape) you went back to the theory as supporting your idea, when the whole point of bringing up the research was to see if the data correlated with your claim in order to substantiate it. The more scientifically acceptable claim would be to say that the data so far does not support your claim, and conclude that more research should be done in order to be able to have an amount of evidence to actually decide either way. You shouldn't be reaffirming your original belief, you should be doubting it.  I hope this didn't come off as condescending."

SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,6ThreeSided9,38,Wed May 13 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"My view of this is in regards to the long game, but there's plenty of other reasons to disagree with the theft/rape analogy.  If a person conspicuously waves around an expensive item, making it a target for theft, the issue is that the expensive item's existence would not have been known otherwise. If a criminal doesn't know the item exists, they can't desire to steal it, and unless other people are being conspicuous with their items that criminal will not commit a theft at all. Because the target of rape is an actual person, nothing short of flawlessly disguising every woman like a man would keep a rapist looking for a woman from raping someone. Women are everywhere. If one woman declines a drink to protect herself, there's nothing to stop the rapist from trying again with another woman. Even if every woman declines the drink, the rapist can try a different method to get what they want. The tactics used by many rapists mirror regular social interaction, and it's impossible for every victim to know how to protect themselves.   Some scenarios:    A man is raped by his girlfriend. Had he never made her his girlfriend, she wouldn't have had the capacity to rape him specifically, but he trusted her. Is the solution to tell men not to have girlfriends?  A woman is raped by a man she meets at a bar; she consents to some sexual activity, but he forces her to do more than she is comfortable with. Is the solution to tell women to avoid casual sex?    Many people think anti-rape education is ineffective because rapists are self-aware and willingly choose to commit rape. However, in both these cases, perhaps the rape wouldn't have happened if the rapists were educated about proper consent. This particularly applies in the second case: men are taught that women will resist them at first in order to not appear a ""slut"", but will give in if they are convincing enough. Maybe this man didn't think he was committing rape. Maybe the woman in the first scenario had the common belief that men always want sex, and didn't believe him when he said ""no."" These are cultural factors we can change and make people more aware of through anti-rape education, but most importantly we can't get rid of them by telling people to protect themselves. If the boyfriend in the first case is able to stop his girlfriend from raping him, she still hasn't learned anything about consent and could do it to her next partner. If the woman in the second scenario rejects the man, he can find another woman at the bar.   In terms of stranger rape, I agree that all people should be vigilant when out and about, and it's not a bad idea to carry pepper spray and/or know self-defense (especially if you are a smaller/weaker person.) However, most rapes aren't stranger rapes, and anti-rape activism can't really do much about someone who so blatantly disregards another person's autonomy that they forcibly abduct someone and make them do sexual acts. Furthermore, even if a victim in a stranger rape is prepared to protect themselves, they could still be raped - a victim shouldn't be blamed for fearing further violence (like being killed) if they resist. Even if every woman carried pepper spray, for example, they may not be able to use it in time.  Finally, victim-blaming doesn't make sense because of the power element of rape as a crime. Old women, who are not traditionally sexually appealing, have been raped in home invasions (i.e. not walking down a dark street at night or otherwise ""putting themselves in harm's way.) Even if you ""do everything right"", you can still be raped.   While I don't think we should discourage people from protecting themselves from street crime, self-defense is not an important aspect of anti-rape activism because it doesn't address the actual problem. Telling one woman to ""be careful"" may stop her from being raped, but it won't stop the same rapist from attacking another woman. The theft analogy doesn't work because people are the targets of rape, not property, and simply existing can make you a target. Fighting rape culture by encouraging appropriate norms of consent will make it so the only rapists are those who deliberately wish to violate others, not those who simply don't understand consent or don't believe they are causing harm."

I think a lot of it is hard because at the end of the day, all of the comparisons to theft, are just extremely objectifying, and kind of pointless. In the case of theft, you can get away with not bringing a ""diamond encrusted purse"" but as a woman, you can't just not bring your body. Rape happens everywhere and in a huge variety of situations, no one can possibly prepare themselves for every possibility, and even preparing for a few puts a huge damper on freedom, and takes time. From everything I've read you are most likely to be assaulted by someone you know, and the most common ""date rape"" drug is just plain alcohol. So maybe we need to teach women tools to get out of situations, to warn other women about problem men, and ask men to stop enabling their friends by ignoring problems.   edit: sorry if that didn't necessarily explicitly answer the question, I guess those were just my first thoughts on it."

SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,lecih,5,Sat May 9 22:08:17 2015 UTC,"An important part of meaning is context. And in many ways it's the context of comments like these that makes them most problematic. Quite often people will tell victims of rape after the fact that they should have been more careful but this has little to do with what the discussion ought to be about, which is how are they handling the experience of being assaulted? Do they need physical or mental medical attention? How will we handle the person who's committed the crime? These are the important questions to be asking when someone's been assaulted.  When someone forgoes these questions in favor of the much less relevant comment ""there are things you could have done to reduce the chances of this"" we can only wonder what the motivations of the person saying this are. It certainly doesn't help the victim because the assault has already occurred. Also, whatever the ""rational basis"" for these suggestions is (there may not even be one--in my admittedly scant reading about the psychology of rapists I have not found that they actually do care about how you are dressed for example) it's pretty cold-hearted to tell someone that they have partial blame for the occurrence of their own rape when there are a million other things you could be saying to them, such as the incredibly minimal show of compassion ""are you okay?"""
SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,successfulblackwoman,3,Sat May 9 01:09:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, but that wasnt really the question. No one should ask if victims should be cautioned after theyre raped, or told that they should have been more carful. Thats obviously victim blaming and people who do that should be hit with a bat.   On the other extreeme, however, are people who say that handing out pepper spray to women on college campuses undermines the efforts of womens groups on that campus to hold men responcible for not raping, instead of charging women with preventing rape.   What can be said, if anything, to advise, say, self deffense classes, that doesnt imply that people who dont take these classes are asking to be raped?  What are the implications of the phrase ""be careful out there"" in a social climate where women are held responcible for being raped, and where men are imagined as unbridled rape machines who can't control their own actions? Is there a rout to cautioning potential victims to protect themselves that doesnt blame the recipient of that message should they refuse those precautianry measures (or those measure fail) and theyre later raped, or isnt there?"
SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,kissedbyfire9,3,Sat May 9 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party, but some thoughts.  The ultimate goal of any campaign should be to reduce the amount of actual crimes that happen.  If there was any evidence that wearing a sweater would drastically reduce a woman's chance of being raped I'd be shouting the gospel of the sweater sisters from the high heavens.  But for most women, the best advice you can give is that rape can come in any form, and that you're more likely to get assaulted by a romantic partner who uses alcohol to get what he wants.  Being randomly grabbed on the street, while it happens, isn't nearly as likely.  There's a principle at work where a rule can imply the exception.  If you tell women ""don't be alone with a guy you don't trust"" you're also implying that a woman is safe with someone she does trust -- this is not actually true.  If you send the message ""you should be ready to fight off an attacker"" then you imply that rape occurs when a woman is forcefully attacked.  This is also not true.  The best advice you can give a woman is that ""no one should make anyone do anything without their explicit consent.""  A woman who cannot be scared, coerced, or manipulated into saying yes by someone who she knows is in a much better state.  Most advice focuses on the kinds of attacks a woman is less likely to face, and ignores the more realistic dangers.  That said I would absolutely support a comprehensive caution campaign that goes through all the ways a person, woman or man, can protect himself or herself from being assaulted, starting from the basics ""you don't owe anyone anything"" to the less likely ""watch your drink.""  And it must be made clear that this is about risk reduction, not prevention -- it is possible to do ""everything right"" and still be attacked, and if you do a few things ""wrong"" you aren't morally at fault.  The last thing you want is a woman to say ""it's my fault for getting raped, I wasn't out with friends"" or whatever reason she has to internalize it.  Caution is a complex, nuanced message.  It can have unnecessary side effects in its communication.  It should be treated with care."
SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,rmc,1 point,Tue May 19 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment. I think this is a refreshingly clearheaded explanation of what is, as you say, an exceptionally nuanced topic."
SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,Dhamballa,3,Tue May 19 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with telling women ""precautions"" is that:   (as previously mentioned) ""stranger danger"" is the vast minority of rape cases so it's displacing the fact that you're more likely to be raped by a current boyfriend, friend, etc. so it's kind of hard to tell women ""hey, never let your guard down around anyone you trust ever! never let them get you a beer or come over to study or walk you to your car, etc."",    the conditions for people's rape are so wide and varied and aren't necessarily causing one's rape. Being in a park isn't necessary for rape, neither is dressing provocatively, being drunk, walking home alone, studying with a class mate in their dorm room. These things are as causal as wearing flip flops, carrying a purse, stopping to get frozen yogurt before. Just because they are contexts in a rape doesn't mean avoiding them will save you from rape. The only common element in every case that ties victims of rape together is a rapist. You can't predict that person and women can't avoid the thousands of contexts where rapes happen.  The difference between ""avoiding getting robbed"" and ""avoiding getting raped"" is also context too. It's basically saying, there are bad people out there and you have to protect yourself against those bad apples. We can't change people who are malicious just cause. We can't just teach people who are going to steal not to steal because they're bad people, just the same way we can't teach rapists not to rape because they're just bad people. The narrative around this is all wrong. First of all ""going to a bad neighbourhood"" means going to an area of poverty, where unemployment, lack of opportunities, and poverty are all high. These issues are systemic. In my mind, you can't teach a person who is poor not to steal because that's not their problem. Systemic inequality is the problem. However, you can ""protect"" yourself from the actions of desperate people by just doing simple things like locking your doors and windows. And I guess not being an asshole and flaunting wealth in a poor area ( though that's still definitely not a guarantee that you'll get mugged). When comparing this to rape, it's not like rapists are being systematically deprived of basic necessities and therefore need to resort to desperate actions in order to have some basic income. Rapist mentalities come from our general rape culture that our society has: teaching entitlement to women's bodies, objectifying women, pornifying violence, toxic masculinity, teaching men that a struggle is sexy and not really a struggle, etc. This is why we say we have to teach rapists not to rape. Because a lot of men don't even think what they are doing is wrong let alone rape. So that comes with education. Obviously there will still be a handful of bad apples, just like people who steal (some just do it because they like crime). But we're not teaching robbers not to steal because the vast majority of them are doing it because systematic inequality is a huge huge problem and therefore teaching them ""not to steal"" won't do anything, whereas our mentality around rape is taught and thus the vast majority of people who rape should be untaught the mentalities that lead to it.

Imagine you flaunt expensive goods and get mugged, or leave your car in a crime hot spot. Now, your friends, cops and family might say that you should be careful, what did you expect etc. However they don't think that you gave away your car. Despite all the ""what did you expect"" everyone admits that a crime, that a theft, took place. If the thief were to try to register themselves as the new owner of the car, they wouldn't be able to.   However, with rape, people (incl the courts) seem to view it as if no crime was committed, that if you dress revealing in a club that took have consented to sex, and hence it isn't rape."

Circumstantial evidence is way more important in rape prosecution than in any other crime.  Personally, I wish we could focus less on personal choices and more on collective choices. I'd like to work with other feminists to do something about some of the cultural choices that make rape easier (ie getting blackout drunk thrice a week as a lifestyle)."

The anaolgy is problematic in that it is easily over extended and misinterpreted, but it does propose that we may be able to take steps to deffend ourselves against attacks and that isnt untrue. My question is about whether advacting steps twords self defence can ever not emply that the victim is responcible for preventing their rape. If you set up a self deffence class and market it to women, does it contribute to the belief firmly rooted in rape culture, that its the responcibility of the victim to deffend themselves, and if they dont that their rape is their fault?"

I can see how, in certain contexts, making comparisons between rape and theft can be harmful. I don't buy that argument that they can't be compared at all though, e.g. they're both things I wouldn't want happening to me (or anyone else for that matter). I'm not saying rape is theft, or that rape is as bad as theft, just that they have an attribute in common.  There are still plenty of people who think of rape as if it were the theft of a ""woman's virtue"" or some shit like that, and I completely agree that that's a terrible attitude to take. That's not the kind of attitude being espoused in the comment OP quoted though. That person was just putting rape and theft into the category of ""bad things,"" is that wrong too?"
SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,idknickyp,2,Sat May 9 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"I think that the problem is this is a very frequently used analogy, and is often used as a way to tell women that they need to be careful, however, in the theft example, it is easy to just not carry an expensive handbag, but women just can't leave home without their vaginas so they don't get raped, and I think that is where it breaks down. that and the analogy is still encouraging people to view womens bodies as analogous to property. this mentality plays into rape culture, the more humanized someone is, the harder it is to objectify them, but if you are saying their possession of a body, is the same as possession of a coach purse, what are you saying about their humanity?"
SRSDiscussion,35cgh4,woodenbiplane,5,Sat May 9 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"I dont think thats the intention of the anaolgy. I definitely agree that there are some objectification problems with it, and wouldnt it be easier to find an analogy without those problems, but the point of the comparison isnt that women should leave their vaginas and purses at home, but rather that the world is an unsafe place because of some factors that can be accounted for, and that as people aware of those dangers, we might take steps toward accounting for them (like taking self defence classes, or carrying pepper spray or a tazer, in the case of rape, or not carrying valuables openly in the case of theft). I think a bigger problem than either of these though, that was brought up in another comment, was that the dangers we're encouraging women to account for with these cautions are actually less common factors in rape. A really effective caution would have to include not going places with men who you trust, even public, and not being around male family members (which would of course be absurd)."

I guess I'm not saying comparing theft and rape will immediately lead to rape, but that trying to equate theft and rape is emblematic of the problem itself.

I think it is also dangerous to say, RAPE IS ONLY ABOUT POWER, because that makes it easier for people to say, ""hey, what I did was only a little bad, like sure I forced her, but it was just because I was really horny and I know she's a slut and would do it, not because I wanted to have power over her, so it wasn't about power, it wasn't rape"" or ""ehhh, I mean everyone there was drinking, like yeah she didn't really know what was happening, but like I wasn't trying to hurt her, so like it's not about violence, so it's not rape"""

No one was accused of rape, but the rape-relevant nature of the situation was pointed out a couple times.  Dawkins' specific comment on the subject was dismissive, sexist and somewhat Islamophobic, sarcastically telling a hypothetical Muslim woman (in what I assume is some generic scary Muslim country) that her problems are no big deal compared to Watson's. You know, like ""They make you wear a burkha but they make Watson have conversations with men!"" I can't find the original at the moment.

Anyway, you remove the consequence for harassing women, whom many of these people hate, if they are or are not aware of it.   I'd agree with this part, especially what you said in the last bit. Everyone has an inner demon, all it takes is a bit of anonymity and people will say things that would make your head spin. Case in point, the wonderful cesspool that is 4chan.   4chan is essentially highly concentrated anonymity. It creates a very unsettling and yet interesting board culture of sort. The more I browse reddit, the more I see 4chan in it. People make more dark jokes. They say more and more unsettling things about women and minorities. These things are commonplace in 4chan, where everyone addresses each other as ""fag"". Here's the difference though.  People know to keep shut about being a minority or woman on 4chan. Women know if they post one picture, they can expect ""tits or gtfo"" in an instant. It is practically guaranteed at this point. So guess what? There aren't a lot of minorities or women on 4chan. They avoid it, or when they are on it they keep shut.  This is at least understandable on 4chan. We know that culture there, we can avoid that website. But it is absolutely unacceptable and downright deplorable for such a mainstream website like Reddit.  Reddit has disposable accounts with minimal difficulty in creating one. It has slowly become the new 4chan. Hell, look at the comments on reddit, you'll see references such as ""OP is a faggot"", anti-transgender helicopter copypasta (originally greentext on 4chan), and more.  Reddit is becoming or has already become similar to 4chan. Sure, it's not /b/-tier with endless spam, but it's approaching the quality of blue boards there. The only difference is, reddit wants to be mainstream, unlike 4chan. Reddit wants politicians and important people to talk to them on this site. It wants famous actors to talk on the site. Reddit wants attention and emphasis. Reddit doesn't want to be known as the site that hates anyone with a non-hivemind opinion and posts ""Hitler"" in online polls to get attention. Yet where it seems to be going. People make really dark jokes, make very sketchy comments about minorities, and then yell ""SJW"" when someone points out how fucked up they are acting. Sure, it might reflect their dark, deep, and unfortunately genuine thoughts. But that's not what reddit has been about, nor what it should be.

SRSDiscussion,357rmb,Your_Yelling_At_Bots,22,Fri May 8 03:41:15 2015 UTC,"I've been here since 2009 and can't say anything at all about how Reddit has changed because I've learned to see it so differently since then.  The amount of soul-killing shit I've seen has been approximately constant because I manage it that way.  It's really easy for me to look at my front page and pick which threads to click on based on my current tolerance for emotional discomfort.  Honestly, I expect everyone else to be able to do that, too, so I don't have much sympathy for people who click on shitty threads and then complain about the shittiness therein.  If you've been here for more than a month, then you see exactly as much fucked up shit as you want to see.  Also, I appreciate the opportunity to be exposed to people I would never be exposed to IRL (aka meatspace, aka privilege-land.)  I'm a pretty typical progressive, consistent D-voter, and most of the people I'm exposed to are, too.  (At least they claim to be.  I suspect a lot of them vote Republican just because they're cheapskates about their taxes.)  For me, the internet is the only place where I can engage in meaningful conversations with people who vote differently from me, and I really appreciate sites like Reddit that facilitate that.  People looking for ""safe places"" are looking for the opposite; they're looking for someplace where they know they aren't going to meet anybody they fundamentally disagree with about important issues.  I think this is something that can be managed on a subreddit-by-subreddit basis, and I urge people to think twice before they declared Reddit ""worse"" because of the people they encounter here.  Discourse is a good thing.  Even when you see something and think, ""Jesus, is this person thirteen?"" keep in mind that they might actually be thirteen and that it's a minor miracle that horrible thirteen-year-olds with their horrifying thirteen-year-old minds are having meaningful exchanges with adults and being influenced by them instead of being stuck inside an inbred teenage echo chamber like they were when I was that age.    True story:  I was friends with a bunch of vegetarians in college, and I was like, ""Yup, you guys are crazy"" until I went to graduate school, and as soon as I was out of their sight, I started researching vegetarianism and then turned into a hard-core vegan.  Just because some thirteen year old is being a troglodyte and overtly rejecting the stuff you're saying to them doesn't mean they aren't actually listening and aren't going to be twice as fucking advanced when they're your age.  Communication and discourse are powerful!  Even though people sometimes prefer to hide how it changes them.  I've also become somewhat blind to a lot of day-to-day shittiness just because I've learned to trust certain subreddits.  When I see something heinous at +2 I often know it'll be below threshold shortly so I just downvote and don't feel bothered at all.  Subs that I can't trust like that I regard as battle zones.  Maybe I'll say something there if I feel brave and want to make a difference, but otherwise I just nope out and spare myself the carnage.    Also, some things I've learned to see very differently over time.  I post on /r/Fitness under various accounts and have become a lot less sensitive to things that I formerly regarded as infallible indicators of toxic masculinity.  There are behaviors and manners of speaking that are culturally associated with sexism that are exhibited by people who, if you drill down into them, aren't sexist at all.  That realization has made me a lot more relaxed about reading /r/Fitness.  Though I'm still oversensitive to the word ""bro.""  I hear ""bro"" and want to commit murders.  I don't care if you use ""bro"" ironically, I can't stop myself from assuming you're a fucking troglodyte.  I know how unreasonable this is, and I keep it in mind when I have knee-jerk reactions to people for other reasons.   If you can't name one trigger that you know is unreasonable and unmasks you as an unfair, stupid, biased person, then you're intentionally indulging yourself.  I have more than one... but ""bro"" is the stupidest.  The people I mind most on Reddit are the people who are proud of their biases instead of being embarrassed and learning something from them."

I don't believe people actually take the time to think about what they're going to click on and prepare themselves for what they're going to see. I rarely click on anything that I know is going to waste my time or trigger me in any way. I think people need to organize their front page a little better so that they can avoid shitty threads. I also feel like people are less tolerable for opinions that differs from their own. Tough crowd.

The George Zimmerman case was a major turning point in the polarization regarding race. It also happened at basically the same time Social Justice feminism exploded on the internet. People who were previously mostly indifferent to issues of gender and race felt like they were being attacked, and as a response a lot of them when from indifferent to actively hostile to feminism and social justice.  The election of Obama caused an increase in overt racism on the right, but among libertarianish  democrats  and moderates it was the majorly increased media focus on race  and feminism that seems by far the biggest  catalyst."

SRSDiscussion,357rmb,successfulblackwoman,10,Fri May 8 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"I remember a time when the comments in /r/worldnews were full of armchair political scientists posting really long explanations of why such and such would happen.  Posts were judged by length and composition, and you'd walk away feeling like you learned something.  That's not saying those comments were actually any good; I'd compare it to the posts you get from time to time in /r/AskHistorians where something looks great and gets highly upvoted, someone asks for source citations, the author flips out, and the mods purge the whole thread.  Just without the vetting process to realize it was a load of horseshit.  I remember that devolving to Southpark Fallacy style ""both sides are assholes"" non-thinking, then later loading up on racism against the Roma, Muslims, Jews, and basically everyone else in roughly that order.  There was also a time not that long ago when reddit's gaming sphere was only misogynistic in that they'd generally ignore the existence of women and some really tired Misogyny 101 jokes like ""women always include themselves in their photos.""  (Yeah, ""only"" that.) They didn't hate feminism in earnest until when Anita Sarkeesian started trying to post her videos, didn't actively go looking for new women to hate until Gamergate, and didn't start trying to say ""I bet the SJWs will hate this"" and get frothing about imaginary insults until the heat from Gamergate died down.  So yeah, it's definitely gotten worse.  The best subs now are better than anything that was around way back then though."
SRSDiscussion,357rmb,Engelgrinder,14,Sat May 9 22:19:01 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen (and keep in mind this is solely my experience), things have gotten notably worse over time. The whole anti-feminism/""sjw"" thing has gone from an edgy aside to a full-blown movement that dominates this site. Things were shitty before and maybe I'm just more aware of it now, but regardless the current situation is pretty awful regardless of how things were in the past. I've seen a generally positive change in many of the leftist subreddits I frequent, but mainstream reddit remains pretty bad."
SRSDiscussion,357rmb,Engelgrinder,6,Fri May 8 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely worse, I didn't get the point of SRS when I first found reddit.

SRSDiscussion,357rmb,Engelgrinder,4,Fri May 8 10:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah its still better than most website comment sections. I'm not even talking about Foxnation  or Breitbart, but even the CNN comment section was dramatically worse than reddit before it was closed down."

SRSDiscussion,357rmb,Engelgrinder,3,Fri May 8 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"A lot worse, both in terms of quality of content as well as not having shitty opinions. It used to be a hub for liberal hipsters and mild-mannered STEM nerds, then as it grew in popularity the circlejerk grew and eventually politically incorrect/""controversial"" opinions became celebrated. To be honest most of the shitty stuff posted in the beginning was more so out of ignorance than out of outright malice. I also think the rise of leftist social justice online, especially feminism, has awoken a sleeping giant of conservative politics."
SRSDiscussion,357rmb,successfulblackwoman,4,Mon May 11 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"I think what happened is race has become an enormously more focused on topic in the media in general in the last several years. The election of Obama brought out some increase in racism but shit didnt really start to take off until Trayvon  Martin. That huge increased media focus on race seems to have polarized people dramatically more than I remember even 5 years ago. Since then Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Baltimore have stoked the flames even more. Especially the Michael Brown case. Unfortunately  a side effect of a greater media focus on race definetly seems to be an increase in polarization on the issue.  The catalyst of the Zimmerman case specifically seemed to have a huge effect on racial polarization on reddit. The election of Obama had a significant effect in racial polarization in more right leaning circles, but reddit was overwhelmingly  supportive of Obama in the early years. It was the Zimmerman case that seemed to really break the dam.  Edit  I also agree 100 percent about the internet feminist explosion played a large role as well. Whenever there's a big trend like that there's almost always a backlash. It's just another side of the same sort of backlash about the massively increased media focus on race in the last few years. When people constantly feel like they're being labeled as horrible people a lot them respond by going from just indifferent to actively hostile to issues of social justice."
SRSDiscussion,357rmb,Engelgrinder,4,Fri May 8 11:43:04 2015 UTC,"Yep,  not just that but the demographics have changed. IIRc, the old stereotype of reddit was that it as a bunch of engineers and hipsters who were relatively ""normal"" but kind of nerdy. Then we start to see it attract more people who are lonely and bitter about the world (remember the friend zone? It's pretty much gone now on reddit but for awhile it was taken very seriously.) In general, those types of people are more likely to find a scapegoat, and minorities are an easy target."
SRSDiscussion,357rmb,successfulblackwoman,2,Sun May 10 11:06:04 2015 UTC,"Worse.  I'm not even talking about gamergate or some of the more recent stuff.  I just remember a period of time -- on an account much older than this one -- when articles were posted and the comments were about the article.  Lately when I read comments I find myself annoyed because there's a lot of politicizing and echo chamber.  People who disagree go off into their little subreddit corner and talk about how much the other group sucks.  Back in the day when ruby was dominating /r/programming and people were complaining that pictures were taking up far too much of what was formerly an article sub, the idea of community-created subreddits felt like wonderful freedom.  Now anyone could make their own sub, and govern with their own hand.  What joy!  But with that we got the implicit enabling.  Now a hypothetical /u/idontlikeobama could go to /r/niggers (thankfully banned) and feel like like they had camaraderie, not just on that subreddit, but on the entire site.  And emboldened with that behavior they'd walk out onto the site at large with... opinions.  Next thing I'm reading Advice Animals and someone is talking about how they hate black people and what?  When did that happen?  Maybe over the past 2-3 years it's gotten better, but I don't see it.  I'm still remembering what it was like eight years ago."

SRSDiscussion,357583,Dhamballa,11,Thu May 7 22:28:30 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you arguing here? Marx claims that  all oppression is now based in capitalist modes of production, and if you're a strict marxist I suppose you accept that, but others advance notions of intersectionality that imagine oppression more complexly, and more accurately, as a web of related injustices. If we accept these more comlete descriptions of oppression, we have to acknowledge that no single one is fundamental, that none are a foundation the destruction of which topples the rest. Instead, capitalism depends on a family of oppressions, related, but not identical, that both keep the proletariat divided in struggle and reify the notions of hierarchy and superiority, and patriarchy depends on the practical pressures of capitalism to make resistance or objection impossible."

SRSDiscussion,357583,piyochama,5,Fri May 8 01:06:10 2015 UTC,"The various forms of oppression serve several functions, arguably the most important of which is to reify conventions of hierarchy and superiority in the minds of individuals effected by it. We are interpolated into a systsm that demands an ordering, a lining up of people from best to worst. White people come first. Men, heteros, cis people, nonhandicapped: they come first. The suppressed premis being that superiority is possible, that it is natural. Without this presupposition,  exploitative systems of production become impossible. Also, these hierarchies makes unity impossible within the proletariat. Capitalism encourages these divisions because unity is key to revolution (ideological or violent)."
SRSDiscussion,357583,_flaminghomer_,4,Fri May 8 01:28:42 2015 UTC,"Without this presupposition, exploitative systems of production become impossible.   This is what I'm asking. Why is this so?"
SRSDiscussion,357583,piyochama,7,Fri May 8 01:29:30 2015 UTC,Because people will only suffer oppression when they believe they have no other choice. These other systems of oppression convince them they have no other choice.
SRSDiscussion,357583,_flaminghomer_,3,Fri May 8 02:16:17 2015 UTC,That's a circular argument.   People suffer oppression because they suffer oppression?
SRSDiscussion,357583,piyochama,4,Fri May 8 02:20:01 2015 UTC,"No. Well, yes, but no, it's not circular. Capitalism is by it's nature hostile to alternatives. It's destiny was always to globalize. To become pervasive. Like an abusive relationship, it disallows contact with others (other modes of relation) because it's dominance cannot be challenged. In the stifling of other modes of production and relation, capitalism has succeed. The other forms of oppression that we've been discussing are necessary to obscure this atrocity. They teach people to hate others, to hate animals, to hate the earth, to hate themselves. Capitalism makes resistance practically impossible from without, other forms of oppression make resistance unthinkable from within. It's synergy that makes the web of oppressions we're discussing possible."
SRSDiscussion,357583,_flaminghomer_,2,Fri May 8 02:43:19 2015 UTC,"How is it hostile to alternatives?  Market systems, sure. I can see what you'd mean if you were just talking about market systems alone.  But capitalism itself isn't necessarily hostile to alternatives - in fact, in a perfect world, it would be indifferent to any alternative, so long as there were willing buyers and sellers of whatever products were produced by those alternative systems.   If anything, it is alternative economic forms that are usually hostile to other systems - socialism and communism being the most hostile of the bunch (because if people are not 100% for it, it cannot function).   You're going to have to explain how capitalism is ""hostile"" to other systems. Without that assumption, your analysis falls apart."
SRSDiscussion,357583,piyochama,4,Fri May 8 02:49:11 2015 UTC,Capitalism is hostile to alternatives like communalism because these alternatives are healthier. They prefer the needs of people to the needs of corporations. To say that capitalism is accepting of competition is to reject the entire history of capitalists interaction with other modes of relation. Communism does no have to be universal.

SRSDiscussion,357583,Lobrian011235,3,Tue May 12 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that conception of oppression. Capitalism often exploits those already oppressed by other systems. But there is a direct correlation between societies that have passed from traditional economic and power systems into capitalist (or ""post capitalist"") systems and relative female empowerment and gender liberation.  Obviously if we mean different things when we say Capitalism our sentences aren't going to mean a lot to eachother.  I use capitalism as a term for an historical movement and greed-urge as Marx used it which must be distinguished from capital at this moment. Capital at a moment is often conservative, because it tends to rest in those who already have power. Capitalism is often liberal. Look at how corporations have responded to Indiana's "" religious freedom "" laws, they've done what's necessary to make money. Those corporations don't give a damn about progressive goals, they just want money."

If you use ""capitalism"" as used in the posted articles, that definition makes no sense - exploitation of that variety has been around since the advent of money and debits. If you use ""capitalism"" as described by academics and economists, then I would still disagree somewhat - has religious/family bondage really been broken? (That is assuming there is any of those forms of bondage at all)."
SRSDiscussion,357583,Dhamballa,5,Fri May 8 01:02:48 2015 UTC,"That's fine, I view ""Capitalism"" as the social movement described by Marx. You can of course define capitalism as capital at this moment, which often does exploit women. But I think that is capital existing and expressing itself through existing forms of oppression, not capitalism in its pure sense.  Has traditional bondage been broken? No. But that's because capital has never really won, never reached its true apotheosis of a total ""free"" market with no social controls. Female capitalists exist, trans capitalists exist, and they do nothing to mitigate the brutality of capitalism. Greed doesn't care about genitals."
SRSDiscussion,357583,piyochama,0,Fri May 8 01:42:30 2015 UTC,"In which case I would fully agree with you. I would consider myself closer to a capitalist than a marxist, but at the same time, the truest ""free"" market would be a terrifying thing to behold (IMHO).   There was a section in the first article that I think you and I would both agree with - capitalism, which is and always will be a function of greed, is opportunistic. It does not give any sort of care to what sort of oppression exists, just whatever it can exploit. I would haphazard that even in a perfectly classless, oppressionless system, capitalism as Marx described it would still function."

What I was a little disappointed with though, and maybe I missed it, but I don't think I saw any arguments pertaining to a specific, logically necessary link between patriarchy and capitalism.  They all seemed to be centred around justifying the idea that a link could be a possibility, based on historical and contemporary context, rather than defining or speculating on what that link might be.  The last essay openly states this:   In this text, I am more concerned with closing the conceptual gap referenced above than I am with nailing down the specificity of these relations that reproduce gender and race. That latter project is, in the end, the more important one, but here my goal is merely to show that if we are truly committed to a rigorous and unifying theory of capital, we must consider the possibility that race and gender are as logically necessary as class is to this mode of production."

I mean, it's not like there isn't some level of friction/tension/public debate in Norway between the Muslim immigrant population and the rest of society, there are stories of Norwegian kids bullied at majority Muslim schools for eating pork etc, and I can't wave my arm and dismiss all that as right wing propaganda, but fucks sake. 99% of the time anecdotally Muslims get along just fucking fine, there's so many of em in Oslo it's impossible to have the sort of cartoonish CULTURAL MARXISM IS BRINGING THE MUSLIM HORDE view that gets casually up voted on here.

Do not phrase it as ""masculinity is inherently toxic because it causes men to hurt women"". The fact that it's harmful to men should be reason enough to address it as a problem.  2) Assuming you're a self-identified feminist/progressive, take care to avoid shitty behaviour that enforced gender roles on men. The whole Male Tears meme has been a huge gift to MRAs and anti-feminists, because it plays into their notions that feminism is a one way street where the aim is to free women from their gender roles while firmly keeping men in theirs. That meme needs to FUCKING DIE already.   3) Make it clear that this is about detoxifying masculinity, not destroying it. It's still fine to be a manly man with a manly beard who chops down trees and smells of motor oil, it's just that men who aren't like don't have to pretend to be anymore.   4) Realise that men are way more fucking fragile than you might realise. There's a reason so many of us seem totally fine right up until we do something that shows we're clearly not. Bear in mind that because of the way we've been socialised, most of us would MUCH rather be depressed/angry/violent/suicidal than have to admit that we need help. I get why there's not a whole lot of empathy towards men in feminism, but if progress is to be made, it might require showing empathy towards someone who you don't like, and only see as privileged.   5) Did I mention empathy? I think I might have. But yeah, empathy. Empathy is a good start."
SRSDiscussion,354777,Bananageddon,22,Sat May 9 08:31:24 2015 UTC,"Emphasize that ""toxic masculinity"" doesn't mean having traditionally male personality traits or enjoying traditionally male activities is wrong. Men who genuinely don't get anything out of talking about their feelings, for example, don't like being told there's something wrong with them when that's just the way they are.   Honestly, MRA's have a lot of evidence on men's issues but apply it in the wrong direction. Toxic masculinity and social pressures are one of the causes of men's higher suicide rate. Doubling down on gender roles isn't the way to help desperate men who have been trained to mask their emotions. Explaining how men's issues like this are caused or exacerbated by toxic masculinity acts as a good counterbalance to MRA ""women caused all these problems!"" logic.  If you're talking about practical solutions rather than arguments about toxic masculinity, I'd say just do the basics: don't mock men for being emotional, teach young boys it's okay to express emotions other than anger, and speak out against toxic masculinity when you see it."

It's an enjoyable activity. Right now this is not the case and there is definitely a narrative of ""typical bros watching sports with beer and doing nothing"" but I don't think that's combated by simply NOT doing things I enjoy.

But discussing toxic masculinity is a great way to convince people (typically men) on the fence about feminism that the deconstruction of gender roles is beneficial to everyone.

Our former cleaning lady became the first female fire fighter soon after. Hes been invited as a key note speaker at women's issues conferences, where he was positively received.  Dad also provided advice when the inevitable legal action occurred as some women still failed the revised fitness tests. They proved they were accurate given the strength needed to lift and pull wet hoses across specific distances within certain time frames. Some women just can't do this, even many men who also failed. I think they avoided issues by simply not allowing anyone that failed overall to still get the job, male or female. Exceptions weren't made, though you could come back again in a few years and try again.  This is life and death stuff. If the tests aren't accurate given new technology being used then they should be revised. But the requirements may not always become less. Example, if the average weight of an adult male has gone up over the last 50 years then the requirements of how much you can carry may need to go up to reflect this.  I think the tests should be carefully reviewed every 3 to 5 years to ensure they're still relevant.  Disclaimer: I didn't get my dad to weigh in on anything I've just written so if I'm wrong then its not a reflection on him."
SRSDiscussion,34ujqy,d3rtus,31,Mon May 4 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is the perfect way to shut the conversation down. The Australian army had individual fitness tests that discriminated between age and gender. So a 20 year old male would need to perform better than a 20 year old female. And a 20 year old female would need to perform better than a 40 year old female. This drew A LOT of heat from soldiers on every rung of the ladder. You had an 18 year old guy who was doing the exact same job as a 45 year old woman and he was expected to complete his run 10 minutes earlier than her. It didn't reflect the battlefield situation at all.   So to cut the criticism they introduced job specific standards. To be a truck driver everybody from every rank, gender or age group needed to meet the exact same standards. To be an infantryman the exact same thing. It's fantastic. You know that your old gnarly warrant officers are meeting the standards. You know that the short chick who you can barely see under her pack is tough as nails. It smoothed out everything and made a great case for women to slip into roles previously dominated by guys.   True, most girls aren't completing the infantry, artillery or other combat position's tests. But if it were me I'd rather be told upfront that I'm not fit enough than go into a job I'm not prepared or physically strong enough for and weaken my team as a whole."

In the case of those fire department requirements, I don't think they nessecarily are - it really is a life or death situation: ""If there’s a weak link in the chain, either civilians or our members can die.”. We really can't assume ""she'll do more than fine in 99% of the situations she could encounter while doing her job."" - her time wasn't a few seconds slow, it was almost 5 full minutes, 25% longer than the limit, so I wouldn't call it minimally. To me that sounds like a lot, and women are already able to pass.  If experts decide the requirements are too steep and there is no extra risk - something that really can't be decided without knowing about firefighting - then lower the requirements. But if it really does represent whats required on the job, all it will lead to is more deaths.  However, requirements certainly can be sexist, if they're arbitrary or designed to exclude a gender for no reason, for example having a minimum height requirement to make the employees ""look professional"". A lot easier for men to meet, but doesn't actually affect job performance."

We can recognize that it would be ""good"" if a business owner decided to, say, not serve openly racist individuals. The business owner, as an individual in the US's democratic, capitalist society, can choose to do that. Conversely, the fire department is a public utility (watch someone with more knowledge of city planning come in and laugh at my terminology), and it would be bad if they chose which 'clientele' to help or not help. The fire department should help racists, non-racists, racial activists, etc.- they should help everyone.   Certainly, there's a sense in which a fire department is bound by capitalist interests just like a business is (the elite interest is that their stuff doesn't burn down because it costs money to fix), but the purpose is still different: public safety v. wealth-accumulation. In that sense, job requirements seem a little more... uh, important? to me. Because it's less about efficiently creating profit and more about efficiently putting out fires."

While it's certainly true that discussions about biological differences between bodies tend toward shittiness with alarming rapidity, we are talking about the discrimination of bodies on certain (classically 'masculine') characteristics, the easiest example being strength. There is no doubt that the concept of ""strength"" is a socialized oddity that is heavily influenced by images of masculinity, ethnic body type, etc. But we can also recognize the 'difference' of bodies when it comes to meeting a strength benchmark--individuals from every identity grouping imaginable (pertinent here: ""men"" and ""women"") can meet the benchmark, and individuals from every group can not meet the benchmark. It's like Irigaray's concept of bodily fluidity: the biological is a source of subversion and (puns) strength because it resists the boundaries society draws. In this sense, an imaginary ideal fire department could be seen as quite a bit more progressive than society: it draws the distinction between bodies--""firefighter"" and ""not-a-firefighter"" bodies--based on performed physical actions, not pre-defined groups. If your point is that contemporary fire departments don't do that... good point. But at least there's something strive for (and heavens knows we need firefighters)."

The fire department doesn't have a ""no women"" rule, it has rules that mean men have a much easier time getting in.   But lets say instead of ""white men only"", you went for my example of setting a minimum height and added in something like ""smart and professional looking"", which could plausibly used to only hire white men.   Now obviously the reason for the hiring policy wouldn't be arbitrary or for no reason, but I also said it has to be justifiable. So this would only be ok if you think the reasoning behind the policy is also justifiable and depends on the job.   I don't think appealing to racists and sexists qualifies as a justifiable reason. Making them more likely to shop there also isn't about expected performance, its a choice of target market, one you would never have to choose. Expected performance would be things like sales ability and stacking shelf skills, which obviously don't depend on race or gender.   Whereas with the fire department, expected performance is putting out fires, going into burning buildings and saving lives, which does directly depend on strength, endurance etc."

But hey, there is a way around this; we just have to make sure every store owner ""doesnt back down"" aka have laws against considering race in hiring. The threat of a lawsuit ironically is empowering, as it frees these nonracist storeowners from the fear that someone would cave to popular pressure, and can now hire as they wish, and the store is still exactly the same as would have been if they had all caved, as people still gotta shop somewhere.  Yet for the firefighters, the firehouse would not be exactly the same; if standards were lowered, then the average firefighter would be worse at their job. i think its a good rubric for separating the two  kinds of ""discrimination laws"", ones that solve collective action problems, versus ones that actually change worker quality."

And it's not like those physically requirements are going to change, no matter how equal in society men and women are.

SRSDiscussion,34ujqy,ratjea,29,Tue May 5 13:20:45 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the job.  In the case of firefighters, a firefighter needs to be able to do certain things, like carry heavy objects quickly and efficiently. The physical tests that the fire department uses are proxies for this. The fire doesn't change simply because a woman is using a hose, a person in a burning building doesn't get any lighter simply because its a woman who is about to carry them out. It isn't sexist to demand that people who want to do the job are capable of actually doing it, even if that disproportionately excludes people.  On the other hand, I think there are jobs where variable standards do make sense.  For example, I was a submariner, and like all non-combat jobs in the US military (I know, radicals, boo hiss on me), the standards vary between sexes and along age. This makes sense because the tests are not proxies for doing things like carrying heavy loads, they're proxies for being able to function after punishing your body with lack of sleep and being on your feet for hours. A woman who can only do 5 pullups is in a lot of ways, more fit than a man who can do 6, and unlike firefighters, that's what they want, fitness, not simply strength."

The logical conclusion following your arguments would be to just do away with the requirements alltogether and accept everyone so that they can be included. Which... to be frank, is not the purpose of firefighters.   I've tried to show similarity between this and affirmative actions at Unis and how being ""colorblind"" doesn't mean not being racist   There's quite a big difference between skin color and physical performance.

Which also, by the way, happen to be just as stringent as the reqs for over 500 other firehouses in the nation.  The Post and Moonie Times articles were written to cast this success in a negative light by highlighting that one probie — a woman — didn't pass a non-required physical evaluation. This evaluation, the FST, is unique to the FDNY and is a juiced-up version of the evaluation all probies must (and did) pass. It was made a requirement in 2008 in response to minority complaints of discrimination and an increase in female applicants. It was removed as a requirement after two classes.  The Village Voice in December reported that nationwide, it's considered standard to shoot for 17% female representation on fire departments because that's about the percentage that can pass physical tests that are based on male strengths such as raw strength and upper body strength, like firefighter tests are designed. And many major FDs have achieved this. New York, on the other hand, is around .5% — one-half of one percent — and not getting any better, and presumably that's because of sexist policies intended to keep women out of the department. Like, you guessed it, the recent requirement of the FST for graduating, implemented after women made more effort to join the department and dropped due to people pointing this out.  TLDR your group may not be sexist, just uninformed. What is sexist, though, is reading an article as the NY Post one, with such terrible sources, and just assuming everything in it by ""an insider"" and ""a source"" are true. I mean, nothing in that article is cited or backed up, and it's clearly written to cast Wax in a bad light. For anyone using critical thinking skills, that should have set off a million warning bells.   Show your group the Village Voice piece and then talk about sexism in the FDNY. Additionally, talk about weasel words like ""an insider"" and reading things that make your blood boil, and point out how we should always ask ourselves, why is this pissing me off so much? Was it written to push my buttons? What is the source for this? Is there any more information I could find to round out my understanding of this topic?

Probably not as severe as 0.5%, but definitely below the 17% female average.  EDIT: Upper body strength is generally where the greatest disparity lies because of the way male shoulders are versus female shoulders.

The basic PFT is just a health metric to ensure service members stay in good physical shape in order to lower medical costs, hence gender-specific standards. It would be sexist to have these standards be the same, because they have nothing to do with your ability to do your job. There's no reason to require a female military coder or accountant to be ripped while the men only have to be moderately in shape.  But then we get into combat jobs and jobs that are more physically demanding like SERE or aircraft maintenance. In those cases, yes, standards should be (and got the most part are) the same because it's about ability to do the job properly and safely. Now, if it's found that the old standards were unnecessarily high in order to exclude women, that needs to be stressed, but if that truly is the baseline to meet in order to do the job then it can't be compromised.

Wouldn't a pack ideally be as heavy as it needs to in order to serve its intended function so as to least hinder the performance on the job? I feel like there is an inherent optimization implicit in designing this equipment - namely that things will be as heavy as they need to be in order to function properly (i.e. an air tank will be sized to give X minutes of oxygen).

Not necessarily; these requirements could favor women instead of men.  Anyway, certainly some aspect of the weight of a typical package will be based one the user's expected weight and strength, but there are parts of a firefighter's job that are simply physical realities that must be overcome. For example, a smaller or lighter axe is going to do a worse job at cleaving through a door than a larger, heavier axe. The firefighter has no control over how heavy doors, furnitures, and fallen structures may be. The people that firefighters carry out are, statistically, getting heavier over time, not lighter. Regardless of how light and effective we can make the firefighters' equipment, which makes everyone's job easier and would be welcome by existing firefighters, a firefighter still needs to meet some sort of absolute physical standard based primarily on strength and endurance, and strong men are stronger than strong women. It's unfortunate, but it's true.

You see the same with say ""pacific islanders"", the group is too culturally not present to remember distinctions outside of specific contexts.   This of course connects back to economic power; Chinese Americans arent nearly as often lumped into ""asian american"" (it happens, but more often its mocked openly than not), because not only are Chinese Americans in positions of economic power, but China itself is a juggernaut of cultural exports, and its power makes its history more widely known (plus the actual numbers help too). i notice that in the West, South African as an identity does get more ""awareness"" as does Egypt, two of the largest economies in Africa.

Additionally black people from the US have a unique cultural background that is more informed by their ancestors experiences in America than by their more distant ancestral background in Africa.

We have local police stations being ""gifted"" military grade equipment, automatic weapons, and being trained in military style warfare. I just can't see them giving all that up and I worry that ""banning guns"" would really end up being ""banning guns for citizens"" and that's it. If it was done in a way similar to something like the UK where police generally weren't permitted to carry them either, then I could see that working, but since our police force seems to be just fine with murdering citizens in the street, I certainly wouldn't trust them to be the only ones carrying firearms.

The relatively rare occasions where you can pull out a gun and protect yourself are, generally, outweighed by occasions where guns escalate a situation or just aren't relevant.  Especially if your concern is violence from police or white people with guns, it's a lot easier to get shot than it is to successfully fend off an armed assailant.   Remember, the cops are trained professionals who openly wear their weapons. They can draw faster than you, probably shoot more straight, and there are always more of them. The idea that you can protect yourself from police brutality with a handgun is absurd. Similarly, when incidents of racist panic violence happen, we all know it's people being shot at suddenly and senselessly, often with no warning, and carrying a gun just makes that kind of incident more likely.  If it makes you feel safer or more confident to go around with a slightly heavy piece of metal designed to kill people, then more power to you, but you might as well just believe in magic and carry a fetish of amulet of some sort; depending on who you believe, it might actually be more effective."

Not that gun laws necessarily stopped the Panthers from sparking low-level insurgencies in various cities.

Charges for negligence need to be stricter, especially when children are involved. I'd ban concealed carry and open carry too. Keep it in a case if you need to.  The reasoning for this is that its tried, tested and true. Guns are not toys and need to be treated with respect. People using them to threaten others need to be stopped, people using them to escalate situations need to be stopped.  When it comes to guns, I think this study is the most important you can ever read: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9715182   For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides.   Guns simply aren't worth the risk, in my opinion.  Also be aware that the pro-gun brigade is one of the worst on Reddit. NRA propaganda is powerful."

If you're a teenager under 18, it is generally illegal to carry a gun in public. If you're under 21, it's almost impossible to legally acquire a pistol, let alone carry it legally (depending on state law). The easiest way, in many states, is to make your own pistol.   Teenagers can't carry guns, for the most part.   That said, good firearms-rights advocates support welfare to help people in poor areas defend themselves legally, groups like the Pink Pistols (LGBTQ-supporting gun rights group, their motto is ""Armed gays don't get bashed, armed women don't get raped."", and universal free education, so that less and less Americans will be driven to need-based crime.

It's interesting to see something as basic as exercise gendered.  Particularly because (a) people don't generally develop ridiculously toned muscles unless they're specifically shooting for it and probably using specific tactics and compounds which promote it and (b) testosterone tends to promote muscle protein synthesis and estrogen fat storage anyway, so different people will see different results even from the same regimen.  I've never understood competitive sports and only attend games with my dad as a bonding thing, so the gender gap in popularity kind of mystifies me. Some people want to see huge dunks and tackles and such, which biases the distribution of players toward the right side of the bell curve which due to height and potential to build a lot of muscle mass kind of favors a handful of male performers. But that can't be it: leaving that extreme sliver aside we even see the same bias toward men's sports in more general competition where any given person might have an advantage or disadvantage.

""Whitesplaining"" is when some white person tries to tell Asian people (for example) how Asian people think or feel about something or how Asian people ought to think or feel about something white people are doing to them.  Like, ""You shouldn't be so offended when I ask you where you're really from, because I'm just making conversation.""  I think it's dangerous to imply that white people can't have opinions on these matters when they happen to have the correct opinion, which they gleaned from listening to the people who are actually suffering.  And in this case, the racist comments being made are actually hurting everyone, from the black people being talked about (since those kinds of comments poison society and whatnot) to the white person listening (less important, true, but still at least somewhat relevant, because it should be painful to hear racist stuff if you possess some minimal amount of empathy).  Now, if the white person went around picking fights specifically with Asian people, that'd be one thing.  That'd be a white person disproportionately going after racism practiced by Asian people, and that's almost certainly problematic.  In this case, though, the racist came straight to her.  Yeah, it's not directed specifically at her, but she didn't ask for it, and it's wrong, so she's absolutely justified in doing something about it, even if that something is just starting a discussion.  Throughout, though, she is still obligated to be cognizant of everyone's perspective and to keep in mind where many of the ideas she's discussing may have come from, even if the relative badness of the ideas might not be obvious to her (for example, it's far less excusible for a white person to say bad things about China than it is for a Vietnamese person to do the same, and a white person starting a dialogue about racism with an Asian person needs to be sensitive to that)."

I think that can lead to racism going in both directions, and it's often not the same racism either group would face from white people.  I've experience both sides of this personally, too.  When I lived in the South, where Asian people aren't as common as they are in California, I faced a lot of really nasty racism, with a great deal of it coming from black people, who operated under the assumption that I was small and Asian and therefore weak and unworthy of speaking up for myself in any situation.  One particularly memorable occasion involved a black person saying that I wasn't allowed to report him for this same kind of misconduct because I was (allegedly) Chinese, and Chinese people aren't allowed to complain, or something.  It didn't quite make sense, but I was intimidated into shutting up.  Going in the other directly, of course Asian people have money and power.  This is sort of a hot-button issue for me.  Asia is a wonderful place, and one thing I love about it is that white people don't control it nearly as much as they think they do.  I don't have hundreds of years of oppression behind me; my family comes from a place where they're well-respected and rich, and even though my husband's family is in exile from his country (made poor by the thieves from North Vietnam when they invaded), they did well for themselves in the U.S. thanks to the fact that they never bought into any bullshit about rugged individualism.

SRSDiscussion,349ofz,gavinbrindstar,7,Wed Apr 29 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Nope. But it's more okay to burn property than it is to use the police to oppress an entire group of people.

I remember ten years ago when military pilots on ""Go Pills"" was all over the news.  Pilots were officially being given amphetamines to help them combat fatigue, which also caused them to have a lapse of judgement.  IIRC a US pilot managed to kill a Canadian ally on the ground.  In theory and on paper everything was prescribed and carefully handled.  In reality it was probably abuse and dangerous.  So you'll have a hard time finding evidence of ""abuse"" because no one will be calling it such."

SRSDiscussion,348f83,long-winded,24,Wed Apr 29 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm an Australian, another nationality famous/infamous for casual use of the c[slur].  I don't know its exact usage and meaning in the US, as I've never spent much time there. I understand, though, that it's a word which is mainly directed against women? With the implication that that is the only thing they are? (I'm thinking here of, say, its use in the first episode of The Wire when McNalty calls his ex-wife this and Griggs calls him out on it).  That's not how it is used here. Here, it is probably the strongest swear word you can use, the one least likely to be used affectionately (you don't really call your friends this, even as a ""joke""), the one most likely to get you punched in the face in a bar and, as our Irish friend says, a very clear marker of vulgarity and rudeness.  But it means something like ""someone irredeemably mean or despicable"".  It IS misogynistic, clearly as it's using a part of the female anatomy as a curse. But not in the same way that some others are. When used against a man, for instance (as it mostly is), it's not actually calling them female (like some other words would).  Interestingly, and I don't know if this is the same in the US, in some feminist circles (mainly campus or younger ones) women used it proudly or affectionately for their own gear. While the second-gen women regard it as completely beyond the pale.  All that said, there's no reason its use should be excused in an internet forum -- and even most Australians wouldn't consider that our nationality gives us an exception to that general rule."
SRSDiscussion,348f83,kissmekindl,14,Wed Apr 29 10:31:59 2015 UTC,"[in Australia](you don't really call your friends this, even as a ""joke"")   In some circles (eg the military and other hyper-masculine workplaces such as mining) it is used in this way and is sometimes combined with positive adjectives as a term of affection."

SRSDiscussion,348f83,-Sam-R-,4,Wed Apr 29 12:50:28 2015 UTC,"So as I understand it the gist is that c[slur] is a more vulgar and rude form of b#tch except that somehow   not in the same way that some others are. When used against a man, for instance (as it mostly is),  it's not actually calling them female   This is where my mind can't process the meaning behind your words. Maybe an example would help me: what other misogynistic word doesn't actually call the target female? Because everytime my brain looks at that sentence, all it can can see is When a 4channer refers to a straight person as a newf#g (as they mostly do), they aren't actually calling them a homosexual."
SRSDiscussion,348f83,kissmekindl,7,Wed Apr 29 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"Your chan/newf#g point is interesting and on point. And yes there could be some hand-waving involved here. (And like I said, I'm not denying it's misogynistic).  What I meant is that if I'm using any other gendered slur (b#tch or p#ssy) against a man, the insult is in saying he is showing ""feminine"" behaviour (submissive, or weak, etc.).   That's not in c#nt. Actually, as one of the other posters says, you call someone that when they're showing archetypically ""masculine"" behaviour (being cruel, or unreasonable, or mean).  Further, I've heard Australian men call other men c#nt thousands of time. I'm not sure I've ever heard an Australian man call a woman a c#nt.  Usage is very different in different countries. Its meaning in the US is not its usage here.  EDIT: just heard a practical illustration this morning. At the gym, two blokes talking about the fight. ""You putting any money?"" ""Nah, but we'll back Maywether"", ""Isn't he a bit of a c[slur] though?"" ""Yeah, I guess"". They're clearly not saying that Maywether is in any way female."

To be honest as a Brit I wasn't aware that in the US ""cunt"" carried an implication that somebody was acting in a stereotypically feminine or unmasculine manner. As you quote, yes the meaning is very similar to ""dick"" or ""prick"" but with increased severity. I was aware that it was considered a much stronger insult in the US than it is in the UK, but I wasn't aware of this difference in meaning.  I've long considered it a misogynistic insult.

In both places it is tied as the most offensive word one could possibly use.   I can accept that it ranks the same in offensiveness within each country, but what I'm trying to say is that if you compare a Brit's reaction to the word and an American's reaction, the American will be more offended by it.

Probably consumption of US film and TV   Another commenter brought this up, but I wonder if the presence of a watershed hour on UK television is contributing to this. There is no equivalent to this on US television, with even late night cable shows like The Daily Show having to bleep out words like ""cock"", so Americans just aren't exposed to swear words as often as the UK, which might explain why they are more desensitized to the worst swear the language has to offer?"
SRSDiscussion,348f83,slipperedpantaloon,2,Wed Apr 29 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the fact that we can actually hear people say certain swear words on TV probably has an effect on how palatable they are.

SRSDiscussion,348f83,slipperedpantaloon,10,Wed Apr 29 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"From Stewart Lee's book 'How I escaped my certain fate':   It wasn't a struggle to keep the work clean. On the whole I don't swear onstage anyway. That said, I am happy to use 'c[slur]', for example, as a swear word, as long as there is no risk of confusing the use of the word with a reference to a vagina, i.e. 'Richard Littlejohn is a c[slur].' Sometimes I might say cock, as in 'wee out of a cock', if I were momentarily and obviously switching the register of my performance...but on the whole, I prefer to use the scientific names for these things and avoid profanity.   Though Brits are aware of its meaning across the pond, I struggle to think of a situation where someone would call a woman a 'c[slur]' with the same mysognistic undertones that 'b[slur]' would incur. The fact that it's usage is allowed post-watershed in the heavily regulated world of British Television is perhaps testament to that.  Also - on a wider point about offense in comedy. The reason Stewart Lee is so widely respected is not because of his lack of profanity or slurs, but because his work is intelligent, self-critical and crucially aware of its context. It is a world away from clueless, shit, middle-class standups on TV, drooling out their poorly-researched, unoriginal, 'offensive' gags and then trying to legitimise them as some kind of bastion of free speech. From a Guardian interview with Jerry Sadowitz:   ""If I had known in advance that so many people would hijack the material I put across in my act, and what they would do to it, I would never have taken up comedy,"" he says in disgust. ""Never. I'm sorry I've given some very nasty people a good living.""...""I do find Frankie Boyle offensive,"" he says. ""He'll write a joke, or someone will write it and give it to him, and he'll do it without any thought. It's like someone quoting something without even understanding what it is they've quoted. My contribution to standup is not a genre. It's me and my issues. It was never intended to be mainstream."""
SRSDiscussion,348f83,kissedbyfire9,-2,Wed Apr 29 13:58:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quotes, this is the first time I've heard Stewart Lee reference that bit.   The fact that it's usage is allowed post-watershed in the heavily regulated world of British Television is perhaps testament to that.   Seeing as c[slur] is literally the most offensive word in the British language I'm not so sure that post-watershed-hours British Television is as restrictive as you make it seem   Brits are aware of its meaning across the pond   Again, this is the fundamental disconnect that I keep having. The meaning of the word in Britain is vagina. Americans did not invent this definition, the English invented this definition. There is nothing particularly American about this definition at all. This is why my brain doesn't even know how to begin thinking up a response when it reads sentences like this:   I struggle to think  of a situation where someone would call a woman a '{vagina}' with the same mysognistic undertones that 'b[slur]' would incur"
SRSDiscussion,348f83,CressCrowbits,3,Wed Apr 29 14:34:23 2015 UTC,"OK, I don't think vagina and c[slur] are so easily equatable - nor are the word's UK origins directly relatable to its meaning in the US presently.  Some feminists (off the top of my head - Germaine Greer, Inga Muscio, Carol Queen) have argued that c[slur] is preferable, as it was men who rendered the word offensive in favour of the more modest 'vagina' (from the latin 'sword sheeth'). In the UK c[slur] draws offence because it is considered improper to talk about female genitalia in such a forthright manner - not because it is degrading to women.  I'm guessing, though I'm not a linguist, that this is where the cultural differences in the word usage lies. P#ssy and b#tch might mean cowardice or disobedience - whilst c[slur] is incredibly strong and has power to shock. It does not fit the patriarchal stereotype of the weak, subjucated woman but instead encapsulates a more powerful femininity - the vagina dentata if you will.  Stewart Lee's use of the word is apt. I think a good t-test would be to imagine he said 'p#ssy' instead - it wouldn't get a laugh, at all.  C[slur]'s casual use amongst friends as endearment probably derives from a resistance against its perceived indecency by more conservative, churchy type people with 'traditional' values. Frequent swearing/taking the piss out of your mates is common here. I do not believe there is any mysogyny in this use, not even involuntarily. I'm guessing that people from the UK who express offense just comes from the transmission of it's meaning from the US, not that they should be ignored. I am male, so I recognise it could be my own short-sightedness, but I've never heard anyone take issue with it's usage in the LGBT scene I frequent, or amongst my more pro-active feminist mates - and I swear a fucking lot.  As for the TV thing - Ofcom (TV regulators) are super-strict, they legally have to investigate a show if it has just one complaint from a viewer. Its not perfect, but it's a pretty adequate barometer for moral-cultural relativism.  First minute of this might reinforce my point, not particularly funny though and lots of slurs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6YIEjDhjls"
SRSDiscussion,348f83,Critcho,4,Wed Apr 29 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"it is considered improper to talk about female genitalia in such a forthright manner   Almost as if feminine things are inherently wrong/improper to a degree that male genitalia are not.   I think a good t-test would be to imagine he said 'p#ssy' instead - it wouldn't get a laugh, at all.   Because the laugh requires him to carve in stone an insult just as strong/shocking (preferably more so) than ""whore"" and doesn't require any femininity to get. P#ssy is simply too weak of a word too fit the bill, while he could have used ""not somebody who works as a r#tard"" or some other equally shocking/strong/vulgar slur to get the same laugh.   C[slur]'s casual use amongst friends as endearment probably derives from a resistance against its perceived indecency by more conservative, churchy type people with 'traditional' values.   This is the exact same reasoning behind white people using the phrase ""my n#gga"", but that doesn't make it any less racist, and it doesn't make c[slur]'s use by non-women any less misogynistic just because they say it knowing it is ""wrong"" or ""indecent""."
SRSDiscussion,348f83,OneJobToRuleThemAll,10,Wed Apr 29 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"That was my point. C[slur] is profane in the uk because of ingrained conservative attitudes towards female sexuality. The 'offended' on your poll are those with such attitudes, not people who see a gendered slur. You might hear people say men can say C[slur] but woman cannot, because they think it is indecent. Lee uses the word to describe richard littlejohn - the epitome of the protestant, upper class white male establishment that finds this word so uncouth, that is why its usage is apt."
SRSDiscussion,348f83,CressCrowbits,19,Wed Apr 29 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"I have to ask, are you a man or a woman? Because I lived in the UK for 2 years, I found MANY women that took offense to the term cunt and absolutely said that it was gendered but that they often felt silenced by men who insisted that it wasn't. So I'm not going to take much stock in men claiming that it's not a gendered slur and speak for women and say that women don't feel that it's misogynistic, when it's outright misogyny that will keep them from hearing any dissenting opinions in the first place."
SRSDiscussion,348f83,OneJobToRuleThemAll,2,Wed Apr 29 08:09:11 2015 UTC,"I am a man. The topic has come up some times in conversations in mixed groups (gender and nationality, often general chats about rude words in different languages which is what people from different countries often end up talking about when they get together!) and the British women in the groups have always been clear that the word does not have the same connotations as words like 'bi***' or uk variants like 'slag' which are targetted at women.  I've never heard any British woman claim otherwise, and I would never try to dismiss their views on it. I know women who don't like the word, but it's more based on it being a strong curse word than it's gender connotations."
SRSDiscussion,348f83,oskomena,9,Wed Apr 29 12:49:03 2015 UTC,I'd say the typical usage and meaning in the uk is basically as a stronger version of 'bastard'.
SRSDiscussion,348f83,OneJobToRuleThemAll,15,Wed Apr 29 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"In the UK the word does NOT, it does NOT have the same connotations as in the US. It is not a word specifically targeted towards women or feminimity, calling a woman is not about shaming them as a women or calling a man it is not about lowering them as being like a woman as I understand it is in the US.  It is just a very strong curse word, just like fuck or shit or whatever.   You realize that the exact same rationale people always use to excuse the use of f****t?   The way you feel about it doesn't matter (really, not in the slightest). The word has a history and a connotation that might turn irrelevant some day, but that day is far away. As an easy proof, try using c*** to specifically refer to vagina. Do people around you understand you? If yes, your argument doesn't work, since you just proved that the connotation that makes it offensive elsewhere is part of your dialect too.  It's really as easy as that, you know what a dick is, both definitions, and you can't convince me you don't. So dick is also gendered by its nature, independently of who you apply it to. You can of course disagree, but that's just not supported by your argument and we are free to judge you for it.    Guess what? Different words have different cultural backgrounds in different countries   You're just ignorant of the words cultural background in your own culture, it's got literally nothing to do with U.S. centrism. If you were talking about Australia, you might have an argument there, but the U.S. cultural background for that word is British. Your recent background diverges, but you cannot cleanse yourself of your history by claiming it's an American thing, when the American thing is just a continuation of your own culture.

Yes, it is a word which means the female sexual organs, yes it is gendered, but that is irrelevant in it's usage as an insult. The words 'dick', 'twat', 'fuck' are also used regardless of the gender of the person using it or the target. The are very rude things to call them, but their useage in terms of the american context is VERY different.   You realize that the exact same rationale people always use to excuse the use of f****t?   No. It really isn't like that at all. No one is trying to change the context of the use of the term in the UK - It has been like that for as long as I am aware of.

I've since drastically expanded on my own distaste for gendered slurs in this post, but too few people are aware of the psychological effects of language.

SRSDiscussion,348f83,kissedbyfire9,5,Wed Apr 29 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"Not the guy you were responding to, and don't necessarily even agree with him, I just read this:   Please explain to me how literally calling someone a vagina does not have feminine connotations. I feel like I can be convinced on this point with the right argument, but as of now a grand total of ZERO people have even presented one to me when asked directly.   and saw it as an interesting challenge so, in the spirit of being Devil's Advocate, I shall attempt to convince you!   Men are called b#tches when they complain about the task at hand instead of just doing it, and women are also called b#tches when they complain.   So, this female gendered slur is connotatively connected to complaining.  Looking at the connotation of using another synonym of vagina as an insult, p****, we know that this female gendered slur is connotatively connected to cowardice, avoiding some undertaking or confrontation that one has some sort of perceived obligation to, because it is unpleasant, undesirable, or frightening.  Both of these words, when used as slurs, are connotatively connected to not gladly/stoically accepting whatever role/task/confrontation/situation you are somehow socially obligated to be involved with.  In general, if the word woman itself is used in a derogatory fashion, it has a similar connotation - that of shame connected to a refusal to stoically accept the roles/tasks/relationships you are somehow socially obligated to.  Now, if we look at words like cock, bastard, dick - slurs with masculine associations - the connotation is generally that of some unpleasant/unjustified act of aggression, or attitude of aggression in general. It's connected to imposing one's own behaviors on others - actively aggressive - instead of simply resisting the pressure to mold one's own behavior to what society imposes - passively ""aggressive"".  However, if you look at the connotative connections to behavior when c*** is used as a slur, they generally seem to fall into the latter category - it is used for aggressive, imposing behaviors, in the way that connotatively masculine slurs typically are, rather than being used for behaviors connected to demonstrating resistance to perceived socially normative obligations, the way that connotatively feminine slurs typically are.  I don't know if this goes so far as to show that    literally calling someone a vagina does not have feminine connotations.   but I feel like it's at least sort of on track towards being the ""right"" kind of argument to convince you."
SRSDiscussion,348f83,CressCrowbits,4,Wed Apr 29 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the effort, this is definitely the best someone has done to direct me towards understanding the thought process of the other side. My brain doesn't shut down any more, it sees a faint glow of an idea.  I know you don't necessarily believe this so I'm not going to force you to defend the viewpoint, but the reason this doesn't convince me is that lots of insults have moved away from their original meaning while still being hateful towards the original group.   If it is a guys night out at the bar and somebody brings their girlfriend along, his friends might lament ""why'd he bring her, that's gay"" as a way to express displeasure that it is no longer a boys night out and they will have to be less crass or whatever. Clearly the inclusion of a woman into what was originally an all-male outing is about as antithetical to homosexuality as possible, but it still makes sense because ""gay"" merely means ""unpleasant"". In a more extreme example, a man might complain that it was ""so gay"" that the girl he went home with last night didn't let him have anal sex with her.  But this circles right back to the Louis CK argument that ""calling OP a f#ggot isn't homophobic"", and at the end of the day intent isn't magical."

Clearly the inclusion of a woman into what was originally an all-male outing is about as antithetical to homosexuality as possible, but it still makes sense because ""gay"" merely means ""unpleasant"".   Hmm, perhaps I didn't fully fully understand what you mean by ""feminine connotations"" when you said   Please explain to me how literally calling someone a vagina does not have feminine connotations.   Because, in the way I had thought you were using it, I wouldn't qualify the usage of ""gay"" that you give as an example as having ""homosexual connotations"". It's offensive and homophobic, certainly, because it directly equates a label for homosexuality with unpleasant/bad, but it doesn't equate some stereotypically descriptive element of homosexuality itself with unpleasant/bad.   Hmm, this is just starting to sound like the Louis CK bit - I'll keep going for just a bit and see if it winds up anywhere useful.  Alternatively, I see a somewhat different negative interpretation of ""gay"" in your first example than simply ""unpleasant"" - one which does have that sort of negative associations with stereotypical perceptions of homosexual attitudes. Namely, one along the lines of equating ""gay"" with ""gross, sensitivity - real men should be stoic/crass"" as opposed to the stereotypical perception of gay men as being sensitive/emotionally vulnerable.  I don't think the former is necessarily any better or less offensive than the latter, although I think you could make reasonable arguments in either direction - but I think that recognizing which category a given use falls in to adds useful context for analyzing them, because it signals a different kind of association.  The equating of a label with a generic negative, e.g. gay/unpleasant, is like a homonym - it's a quirk or artifact of linguistic evolution. The artifact is proof/reminder of a shitty time/events in the past, like Nazi memorabilia, and it's offensive in the same sort of static way - no one wants to see it, keeping it around doesn't really serve a purpose, if you keep showing it off, people will rightly think there's something wrong with you - but the offense is historical, rather than active.  The equating of perceived stereotypical traits with a negative, on the other hand, e.g. being called gay is shameful because gay people are XYZ and being XYZ is shameful, is a sort of living hatred, because that usage works by actively implying that being homosexual is shameful, rather than simply being, effectively, a homonym which can mean ""homosexual"" OR ""unpleasant"" OR ""gleeful"".  The last thing I want to add is that, obviously, intent isn't magical - however, when we are talking about connotation, we are inherently discussing how something unspoken impacts a word's ""true"" meaning, which isn't very far removed at all from the idea of intent impacting ""true"" meaning. Instead of intent, though, what we are looking at is more like sociolinguistic context of a word's use, and how that real context impacts a word's perceived meaning."

I'm Australian and in my experience with my own culture it's used far more often against men than women (probably because it's a lot more offensive against women, which isn't a ringing endorsement!). It's definitely a slur and of course it is rooted in femaleness (in the same way cock is rooted in maleness), but I do think the difference is that it's not used against men as a way to feminize them in the same way pussy or bitch are. To me at least, the word has roughly the same connotations when used against men and women, though the connotations are stronger when its used against women.   Ultimately though, as with all these discussions, I think it's irrelevant as to how misogynistic or offensive the word because there is no objective misogynymometre to test this. I think it's important before you choose to use the c- word (or indeed any word someone might take offense at!) that you ask yourself ""who could be offended by hearing me say this?"", ""is this a person who I care about offending?"", ""how will people around me view me if I use this word?"". For me personally, though I don't avoid c**t entirely, I am much more selective about who I say it around and how often I do say it in situations I deem it appropriate than I used to be. In that respect, I do think discussions like this are important, because its from these discussions that I learn how other people view the word, but at the same time I think all the people trying to outright prescribe or proscribe its use are entirely missing the point of why we want to (self-)censor slurs in the first place."

I live in the UK, and where I'm from (this, by the way, does vary massively within the UK) the c-slur is used a bit like the word wanker. If I call you a wanker, I'm not making a statement about masturbation. In the same way, calling someone a c-slur isn't really making a statement about women or their genitalia. Men are called c-slurs way more often than women are here, but I don't think that's massively relevant in discussing whether a slur is misogynist.  I try not to use it on the internet (and around certain people IRL) because I know there are a lot of people who will read it and don't like it and I respect that. However, sometimes it slips out because there's no inhibitory process making me think ""this word is sexist"" because of the way that it's been used where I've grown up.  Now I do have a mental inhibition for the words ""pussy"" and ""bitch"", which I actually consider more a lot sexist than c-slur, even though they are widely considered OK to say.    B#tch is a generic insult. Men are called b#tches when they complain about the task at hand instead of just doing it, and women are also called b#tches when they complain. It doesn't matter that both men and women can be referred to as b#tches, it is still a misogynistic slur because the root of its power comes from the fact that the word is a synonym for female dog.   What makes it a misogynistic slur, in my opinion, is that it is used as one, not where the word comes from. Calling an man a bitch always means insulting his masculinity. Calling a woman a bitch? Well, she's being mean in a way that is implied as unique to women. The word is actually misogynistic within the context of the statement in which it is used. Saying and hearing it feels sexist in a way that c-slur doesn't.  Another thing to note is that here nobody really calls a vagaina a c-slur. They might say ""I'm going to have a wank"", or refer to their penis as a dick or a cock. C-slur, however, is pretty much never used as its technical definition. A lot of kids (such as myself) use the word in the playground for years (I learned it when I was 8) before learning what it means (which I learned about 5 years later).

In the UK the word 'cunt' is generally not considered to be a gendered slur to begin with, nor has it historically been used as such. Now if a British person went to the US and started going around calling women 'cunts' and then said 'but I didn't mean it as a gendered slur' then context isn't magical would apply because of course in an American context it is a gendered slur and would be taken as one."

It would be a mistake to only believe the people who conform with your view. The UK is small, but it can differ massively region-by-region and there's a massive class system as well, which also contributes to differences in ""socially acceptable"" behaviours.  The UK is fairly split on the word- As I said before, when/where I grew up in it was just used like any other swear word (albeit a bad one), with the exception that it was never used to describe what it technically is (as opposed to fuck being used to mean sex, for example). Other people consider it to be sexist because of its meaning. However, I've never seen it used as a gendered slur in the same way words like ""bitch"" and ""slut"" are used. That doesn't mean it isn't used that way, just that I've never seen it in real life and when I see people using that way on the internet it looks... I dunno... weird? Like, it's jarring because it's not being used in a way that I would expect it to be used.  None of this justifies its use, and I'm not really interested in doing that.

I'm not convinced the word is entirely free of misogyny, but it's usage and meaning is markedly different there as it is here.  It is an exceptionally vulgar term.  In any society, I think there's an unwritten ranking of curse words in terms of their vulgarity, and the c-word probably tops the list at home, and I'm not surprised it top's Ofcom's list in the UK.  However, how vulgar a term is perceived doesn't really have anything to do with how problematic a term is.  For example, I think ""slut"" and ""whore"" are clearly far more problematic than ""fuck"", but ""fuck"" would definitely be considered more vulgar by most.  In the US, I've found it's used extremely rarely.  Most of the time, when it's used, it comes across as intensely misogynistic, probably the most misogynistic swear word there is.  At home, it's liberally used, and used in the same context as ""asshole"" or ""dick"" would be.  It's not used to disparage masculinity, and the connotations are, somewhat weirdly, more to do with exercising stereotypically, overtly ""masculine traits, like cockiness, brashness, or meanness.  Despite its fundamental meaning, most of the time, the misogynistic connotations just aren't there.  Which isn't to say the liberal usage of it is right.  And also isn't to say that just because it doesn't carry the same misogynistic weight in the UK and Ireland that that makes it ok to use casually by anyone on American or international internet forums, so tbh, I agree with criticism of redditors (particularly American redditors) who try to excuse their usage of it by saying it's fine in the UK.  However, I think it's up to UK/Irish feminists to have the conversation about how acceptable it is when used in the UK/Ireland, or on specifically UK/Irish online forums, and that you can't just apply an American feminist perspective to it.  Personally, I'm on the fence about it.  I don't live at home any more, and wouldn't ever use the term over here, so it's mostly a non-issue for me.  I'm also not a woman, which reduces the importance of my opinion on the matter.  I'd be interested in reading anything UK/Irish feminists have written on the subject, actually."

How ""vulgar"" a word is says nothing about how problematic or harmful it is.  There are plenty of obscene slang terms for vaginas/vulvas which have heavy misogynistic connotations, which are considered much less vulgar than ""fuck"", which is not in the least bit problematic (well... I'm sure it could be argued from some angle, but you know what I mean).  Words being offensive, problematic, and/or harmful is something we can think about and make reasoned arguments about which can be backed up with social and historical context.  Words that are vugar just... are vulgar.  There's no consistent logic behind why any word is deemed vulgar*, it's simply a classification based on classist and elitist notions of how people should speak, as a means of disparaging and othering people ""beneath"" those who speak ""properly"".  I reiterate that I'm not necessarily trying to defend the liberal use of ""cunt"", I just think that arguing that a word is problematic based on its perceived vulgarity is a really poor argument.  *There are a few common themes in words which are considered vulgar, but there's no consistency between root meaning and how vulgar a term actually is."

Shit and sex are themes of vulgarity in most European languages, where vulgarity is linked to the perceived bluntness of the term. You need to use technical words or metaphorical descriptions in order to not be considered vulgar. Why? Because the act of having sex was considered vulgar, and by proxy, talking about it was also considered vulgar. ""I slept with him"" is vulgar, ""I had sex with him"" rises on the scale, ""I fucked him"" is vulgar. Metaphorical, technical, vulgar.   Why do you think euphemisms are a thing?

The point I was trying to make was that the scale of vulgarity and the scale of harmfulness of terms are not aligned, and don't have an awful lot to do with one another.  Plenty of harmful terms/slurs aren't generally considered vulgar, and plenty of vulgar terms aren't harmful.

It's that this discussion so often involves the application of North American feminism to the UK/Ireland/Australia.  Regardless of whether the criticism is fundamentally correct, it comes across as really condescending and 'splain-y when someone criticizes another culture ultimately based on their own values.  It's one thing to politely inquire about an aspect of another culture that appears to be problematic.  It's another thing entirely to harshly denounce something in another culture without having lived experience as a member of that culture (referring more to the OP in this case rather than you).  You almost never hear criticism of the UK's* liberal usage of the word ""twat"" by North American feminists, despite it being possibly more prevalent, and fundamentally meaning the exact same thing.  Hell I would say the misogynistic connotations of that word in the UK are generally stronger than ""cunt"".

SRSDiscussion,348f83,yiyiyiyi,0,Thu Apr 30 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"Your point about not applying one cultural context to another to assess whether something is sexist is generally fair. However, I'd like to raise this point by a feminist blogger:   Some segments of British society are indeed fond of using the word cunt a lot. There are pubs in London where three seconds doesn't go by without someone shouting ""yeh feckin' cunt!"" at his or her mate...  It also, btw, has nothing to do with whether it's intrinsically sexist. There are also bars in America where not three seconds pass without one guy calling another guy a fag. The frequency of its use in specific regional areas doesn't make it not homophobic—in those areas, or anywhere else.  Relatedly, the attempt to rip misogynist slurs from their roots to try to redefine them doesn't fly. ""I'm using it in the European way"" is just a cynical ploy to justify the continued use of misogynistic language that feels good to use. ""Asshole"" just doesn't have the zing! of ""cunt,"" which is why we get these tortured explanations about how ""cunt"" isn't being used in the misogynistic way, but in the British or European way, where the word's ubiquity is fallaciously used as evidence that the word has lost all its meaning.  Throwing around the word cunt as if it has no meaning anymore—or some ""new"" meaning separate from gender—is ignorant and lazy, and contributes, in spite of all protestations to the contrary, to a culture of inequality.   Lastly, your point about twat doesn't hold much water. I get what you're saying, but at the same time if you even listen to the very people in this thread, they themselves are saying that the most vulgar swear word in the british vocabulary is ""cunt"". Cunt and twat mean the same thing essentially (term for a vagina), and I think if twat was the most vulgar word in the british vocabulary, we'd still be having the same discussion."

Getting a house in a nicer neighborhood, then, is impossible.  Renting an apartment instead is just a bad idea, and I'd never tell people that they should feel obligated to do so.  So, that person making $80k is pretty much forced to seek out the cheapest available houses.  (Condos are awful, too, since condo fees aren't much better than rent.)

Not that condos don't pop up in these neighborhoods, but the driving force of gentrification is not people looking to buy their first home in Bushwick.  Like, obviously 80k is not enough to buy a house in NY or SF, but that's why gentrification is driven by white 20 somethings looking for cheaper rent. But just because 80k doesn't go that far, it certainly goes further than the $15 an hour the service worker being displaced by gentrification makes.

But if you do rent an apartment on an $80k salary, then yeah, with $500/month student loan payments, you kinda are forced to look for rent that's $500/month cheaper, and it's silly to insist that people must by more expensive housing just because they can almost afford to do so.

Even post-crash, my house costs more than twice what it did in 2000, and I got an amazing deal from a company having trouble selling it.  Most property now costs two or three times what it did back then, even with the crash.  Salaries and wealth haven't tripled in 15 years, have they?"
SRSDiscussion,346dok,Jkid,1 point,Wed May 27 03:35:31 2015 UTC,"I just don't really understand why you're so concerned about shifting blame to the developers. Obviously the developers play a crucial role in the process of gentrification, but the fact that there are economic pressures on yuppies doesn't explain the entire process. It's not simply a demand for cheap housing, which is why people want to live in Brooklyn and not Hoboken, even though the later is both cheaper and more convenient in some ways.   But, seriously, victims? Look, I live in a gentrifying neighborhood and so does almost everyone I know. Trying to save money on rent doesn't make you a bad person, but how you occupy a space certainly can. And yeah, living paycheck to paycheck isn't secure, but you're fucking kidding yourself if you think white people are moving to Brooklyn just so they can afford to eat. They're not. They're doing it because it's cheap and it's hip and they don't really care much about the people who live and used to live there.  Student loan debt is a separate issue and it's not like all yuppies are burdened with debt forever. You think someone who makes 65k their first year out of college is going to stay at that salary level forever? Yeah, salaries and wealth aren't linked, but absurd amounts of new wealth is being created precisely where gentrification is happening the fastest: young kids working in finance, tech.   So sure, let's keep a strong focus on developers, but let's also try to change the culture of kids getting college degrees who don't give a fuck about PoC communities because paying $500 extra a month sucks (it does) and warehouse parties in BK are cool (they are).

I'm not really sure what that means, but then, I'm not really up on how white people live.  If they're really just trying to be cool while looking down on their neighbors, then that's not so good, I guess?  Maybe this whole issue is a New York thing, and California is completely different.  Is the issue that people live someplace cheap so they can spend money on wasteful extravagant things while  looking down on their neighbors?  That I get.  The way I did it was I looked for the cheapest place I could rent so I could get a down payment ready for my house as soon as I could, because saving 20% gets harder and harder as real estate prices go up faster than inflation, and pretty much the only way to do it is to ignore the ""30% of your salary.""  I managed by renting a place for about 10% of my salary until I could afford to move out.  Then again, especially when you have a family, spending more on rent or a house (or a car or fancy gadgets or anything) is, in my opinion, irresponsible.  I mean, I have a nice job today, but there's no guarantee I won't be fired tomorrow.  I harp on student loans because they were one of the things that forced me to seek out the cheapest housing I could, largely because I don't qualify for anything else.  (I also think it's wasteful to spend more than you have to for a home.)  $500 per month in student loans requires $1500 a month in income to overcome when qualifying, so it's not trivial.  In conclusion, this is probably more of an issue in the Northeast, since California housing is weird in a lot of ways, and neighborhoods here aren't as well-defined or economically segregated."

I got it because it's one of the only houses I can afford, since even with the 2008 crash, prices have risen much faster than inflation for quite a while, and houses that would have been affordable in 1998 or so are now so expensive that I wouldn't have qualified for a loan for one.  Most of my neighbors, of course, bought their houses in the 90s or before.  Currently, housing everywhere is so ridiculously overpriced that it's hard to avoid contributing to gentrification unless you've been established somewhere for a long time.  Edit: At least California has Prop 13, so rich people moving next door doesn't drive property taxes up.  None of that helps people stuck in the rent trap, though."

The coffee shops and bakeries and cute vintage stores were awesome; the fact that a studio apartment in the new construction coming in would be $1400 was not.  To me, the solution is more genuinely mixed income housing - for every luxury ""lifestyle"" apartment a developer wants to put in, they have to also build some amount of affordable/subsidized housing. Instead, as soon as a neighborhood gets popular, it's shiny new complex after shiny new complex.   The onus and blame needs to be placed on developers and landlords taking advantage of neighborhoods trying to cultivate community vibrancy and becoming ""trendy,"" (not misdirected at the vegan bakeries, because small businesses get priced out after gentrification happens, and get replaced with fancy chains and banks.)"

Any chance you are in the West Coast?  I'm from the Bay Area and I see this rhetoric thrown around a lot about unrest around here.    I also think its a pretty nasty narrative, given how 1) it echoes reactionary narratives during the '50s and '60s about ""White agitators"" who were going down to the South and riling up a bunch of Black people who before were apparently perfectly content with things, and 2) how it takes away agency from people who carry on riots.  In any case, I gotta say that from my own perspective, riots in the Bay Area are as close to a post-racial society as America has gotten so far.      As for the question of non-violence in general, you're really stripping non-violence out of its historical context.  Non-violence has power in very particular political and historic conditions, meaning that you cannot just adopt non-violence as some kind of overriding philosophy or lifestyle choice, as it seems to be the case with folks today.   Civil rights legislation wasn't passed because of fear.  It was passed because of the thousands of people who refused to be owned.   This doesn't make any sense; it is precisely the resistance of thousands (really, hundreds of thousands) that struck fear into the hearts of elites, and it wasn't just non-violence mass mobilization that did this--are you forgetting about the massive, massive riots that were engulfing cities during the '50s and '60s, that continued even after civil rights legislation was passed?

Economies of evaluation necessarily require calculability.35 ... Once rendered calculable, however, units of account are necessarily submissible not only to valuation but also, of course, to devaluation. Devaluation, logically, can extend to the point of counting as nothing. ... There is nothing abstract about this: the declension of economies of value leads to the zero point of holocaust. However liberating and emancipating systems of value—rights—may claim to be, for example, they run the risk of counting out the invaluable.

It's very dangerous.   EDIT as per request: Somebody has already posted that article about how to be a fan of problematic things so read that, it's good  Furthermore, almost all media we consume is problematic because the society we live in is problematic. Being progressive and actually meaning it isn't really about lifestyle changes (what in the leftist circles they call ""lifestyleism"") but actually being critical and speaking out.  Also if you look hard enough, or critically enough you will find problematic aspects everywhere not just related to sexism or racism. For instance in the Guardians of the Galaxy they use tasing as a physical gag. And that has not the only movie that did it. It's bad because it normalises it, it creates the illusion that getting tased is a moderate discomfort that can be played for laughs - like kicking someone in the balls [inb4 it really hurts, I know it does, I have them) when in fact getting tased is extremely painful and has often lead to death. Especially when the officers were ""double dipping"".   But does that mean you shouldn't watch the movie? It's your choice really, you can decide where your boundaries are. For instance I don't watch exploitation movies because the gratuitous violence makes me feel bad. I will however play Mortal Kombat because the hyperviolence is so severe it almost deconstructs itself.  Finally, I will concede that there may be certain media that is really harmful and should be boycotted but we are talking RapeLay levels of bad here, we are talking propaganda movies calling for genocide bad.

But see—I think a form of objectivity and distance from emotion is helpful here. Sexual assault is a very loaded topic because there's more of a movement to condone, deflect, and even justify it than pretty much any other brutal crime under the sun. And the fact that any legal system is going to be imperfect and wind up with some false positives and false negatives (how awful is it to let a guilty person walk free, or to punish and defame an innocent one?). Still, you do what you can.  I think the worst thing you can do is what a lot of people on the internet do—to forward around each and every story of say a false rape claim as latent evidence that women do x and y and that there's some war against men. It's only marginally less toxic to take some personal anecdotal experience and elevate it to the level of a rule (for example, I actually know a woman who admitted to me that she went through a ""bisexual"" phase that she later realized was just an attempt to seek out much-needed novelty in her life, but that's such a ridiculous stereotype about women in general and applies to so few cases that me posting it in some AskReddit thread for everybody else to upvote and gild because it conforms to their stereotypes would be disingenuous). .

There are a lot of elements that come into context for this, especially the assumption that accusers are hysterical, jealous, extortionist, attention-seeking people who really wanted it in the first place. I don't see how it can be fair for the victim, when the only recourse is reporting to authorities, only to have these assumptions thrown at them, while dealing with a small -- but omnipresent -- contingency of people who will think this. As a result, the current trend -- trying to control the narrative by going public -- makes sense. But with that said, support networks are tasked to take the victims side. Their job is not, nor should it be, to dissect the story for inconsistencies. That is the media's job, that is the prosecutor's job. Some of the stories that get out are going to be wrong, and from that, you will have people suing for defamation.   I don't think the solution is advocacy-based journalism. This is what landed Ederly in the shitstorm of the UVA case. Advocate Journalist hybrids who write for sites like Jezebel and Salon who push these kinds of stories find themselves in situations in which they had to backtrack more than a couple of times (in Conor Oberst's case, there was merely a correction at the bottom.)  This extends the microphone, creates the false narrative of denialism, and causes more harm than good when it turns out to be false.   The fairest way? Change culture to end sexual assault.

And as you said, I agree that advocacy-based journalism isn't a solution for the institutional issues we find with rape prosecutions, at least not in the form that it's done today. It's not only when there's false accusations. It makes the validation of a survivor dependent on the court of public opinion – something that I don't think the public (and that includes me) is well equipped to do. I think the general public has the responsibility to review its attitudes on rape, but I don't think the general public can be given the responsibility to punish rapists in lieu of a real verdict in an actual court.  Journalism can play an important role in advocating for victims of rape, but not in the way that it's being done today. The court of public opinion is a piss-poor replacement for an actual court."

Everything we can effectively criminally prosecute as rape can be better prosecuted as battery or assault.  The criminal Justice system, with its high burden of proof and its harsh punishments, is an inappropriate tool to deal with sexual assault today. Absent confession or video or physical evidence (even that is unreliable), it's impossible for me to envision a rape that actually clears ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" This leads to the vast majority of rapists going unpunished, and any effort to correct that has an unpardonably high potential error rate.  Instead we should be dealing with rape through the social system. Decoupled from the justice system, people will learn ways to make clear who is and isn't a rapist socially, and to foster a culture of consent. Clear instances of rape would still be prosecuted as assault."
SRSDiscussion,33r0ib,mitogen7,4,Sat Apr 25 04:31:52 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting view. I've got a few questions for you.   Instead we should be dealing with rape through the social system. Decoupled from the justice system, people will learn ways to make clear who is and isn't a rapist socially, and to foster a culture of consent. Clear instances of rape would still be prosecuted as assault.   Why are you certain that this will happen? Why hasn't it happened already? I can't imagine the system you are proposing would be any better equipped to solve the problems you outlined, namely:   the vast majority of rapists going unpunished, and any effort to correct that has an unpardonably high potential error rate.   If anything, your system sounds like it would make things worse in both regards."
SRSDiscussion,33r0ib,Dhamballa,3,Sat Apr 25 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"It would change the laws mainly for adult acquaintance rape. Stranger rape, rape with clear evidence of coercion, and statutory rape would remain more or less the same as they are now.  The incompatibility between rape and the 21st century American criminal Justice system is that the CJS inflicts awful punishments (especially today in the age of background checks and sex offender registries), but because the punishments are so awful it also requires higher burdens of proof to impose those punishments. Rape cases can almost never meet that burden.  Rape is second only to murder in terms of the severity of sentencing, it's a grave accusation. So, for example when Ben Roethlisburger or Jameis Winston gets accused of rape, people naturally import the appropriate criminal Justice burden of proof into their own mind: I won't say/accept that he's done it until he has been properly tried before a jury of his peers. That becomes the discourse: innocent until proven guilty. That discourse makes it impossible to deal with the majority of cases. That's what is so frustrating about Men's rights lunatics arguing that rape counselors should require proof in triplicate before they help victims, it would exclude almost all actual rape victims.  A high burden of proof is a vital value of a free society. But it makes prosecuting most cases of rape impossible unless you lower the burden of proof to the point where the risk of error becomes unacceptable.  To facilitate a lower burden of proof, without compromising essential freedoms, it's necessary to take criminal punishment off the table.   To be honest, I'm not sure what my ultimate solution would look like. A rough image would be exchanging nailing the few rapists we get now to the wall, for a lesser (social or civil) punishment of more rapists. Candidly, I'm not certain it's the perfect solution. But I'm certain that the answer does not lie in the criminal Justice/law enforcement paradigm."

I am a straight man, and when I hear about a complaint of sexual assault, I tend to just assume that the complainant is truthful and the accused is guilty. Because that is almost always the case.   However I recognise that the possibility of false accusations exist. Very unlikely, very rare, but certainly possible.   I don't know... I consciously avoid ""rapey"" behaviour and I can't picture ever being in a relationship so toxic that my partner would ever dream of falsely accusing me of sexual assault. I have literally no fear that it would happen.   I have to be careful not to victim blame falsely accused dudes, because it's very tempting to just look at them and say ""well you must have done SOMETHING wrong!""   I think the reality that false accusations are so bloody rare means that prioritising the testimony of the victim makes sense. While this inevitably would lead to some bad outcomes for the innocent, we kind of need to recognise that justice doesn't work perfectly in ANY context, so getting overly bent out of shape in this particular context is kind of irrational.

There is no legal requirement for you to presume innocence unless you are a judge or juror.   Let me ask you this: if your friend comes up to you and says ""help that man just stole my cellphone"" are you going to not presume the man's guilt? This is why rape culture is so fucked up and insidious. Because as soon as the crime becomes sexual in nature, suddenly there are doubters everywhere, suddenly we care about the accused's feelings.

Why is it most correct for me to trust the complainant completely over the accused, assuming I have no information about what transpired apart from the allegation of the complainant and the denial of the accused? The reason I prefer the labels complainant and accused is simply that it does not pass judgment on the merits of the allegation, because I simply do not know.  You can extrapolate the same consideration into other crimes. It is not a question specific to sexual assault, it is simply a question that comes up more often in sexual assault crimes - and you're probably right that it has to do with biases based on the nature of allegations. But that doesn't mean it's a bad question, even if it is regularly asked for the wrong reasons.  If my friend comes up to me and says X stole my cell phone or Y sexually assaulted me, I will believe him or her because he or she is my friend, and I trust my friends. I am no longer a neutral observer. If a stranger comes up to me and says either of the above, I would be more inclined to forestall judgment of the alleged thief or assailant."

SRSDiscussion,33kmur,LawnJawn,9,Sun Apr 26 06:10:34 2015 UTC,"but more that if Chris H. was concerned about exposing criminals, why not just report on whats going on? Why set up stings?   He's a television personality.  It's his job.  This is 'entertaining', it draws people in, so he does it.   Its so ass backwards in my mind. Its like if the show COPS gave booze to homeless people so they'd have something to film   It is ass backwards.  But for police officers, that would be illegal - it would be very illegal.    Chris Hansen is not an officer, he's a regular guy.  So he is allowed to do things like this.  It's morally gray, but it's completely within his rights.  That's part of why this kind of thing is okay to most people.  He's a TV personality, so of course it's exploitative.  Exploitation is profitable.    In a sense, he's trading gruntwork (chatting up guys online) for being able to televise this stuff.  Cops can't afford to waste their time baiting random pedophiles online.  They're busy setting up actual stings (I hope)    Chris Hansen brings in some people to arrest, the police get easy convictions/arrests for no work, and Hansen gets to film it all.  This is 'small-time' stuff, not a serious danger to most of the public.  So filming it all and releasing it is okay.  Police would never allow this to happen with actual, meaningful, real stings.    Hansen is working for the public good in exchange for 'sensational', popular material."

I think a half assed, BS rationale is: if you televise it, potential predators might rethink their behavior... yeah no, they'll just be smarter about it.   How do you expect a predator to have sex with a kid they don't know without going to their house? There aren't too many ways they could get ""smarter"" about it, and one of those involves not trying to fuck kids in the first place.  Also, the definition of entrapment is provoking someone to commit a crime they would not have otherwise committed. Some but not all sting operations are entrapment.

You're presented with a person who has a life story, family, friends, hobbies, etc., and you boil that person down to exactly one attribute: their disgusting urges. I'm OK with the sting operations themselves, but the show's success hinges around this blind hatred of people with absolutely no context.

They don't attempt to correct for anything like the fact that their ""candidates"" have nothing on the line, haven't held a job, and are answering a survey on the computer, not actually meeting a person.  You use the analogy of using the Crab Nebula's x-ray emissions, but in that study, the scientists performed analysis in order to determine how much Chandra's mirrors were scattering the x-rays in order to correct for it. They addressed the weaknesses of their method and compared their results to previous calculations.  A better analogy for this study would be surveying a bunch of high schoolers about Medicare subsidies and then extrapolating them to the entire population.

High schoolers are a lot farther from Medicare and tax subsidies than they are from negotiation for compensation.  Quid pro quo is something we learn in kindergarten, as does our lifelong practice of negotiation for compensation.  Moreover, measurements of margins of error are present in the aforementioned studies, just as there were measured flaws in Chandra's mirrors.  The irony is that you're pining for a quantitative measure of the study's bias, while the whole point of the study is to suss out a quantitative measure of bias!  Humans aren't atmospheres; it's a lot harder to measure how our brains diffuse the notions we put into them.

Take Patton Oswalt. Anti-gamergate, pro-equality, as liberal as the day is long - and yet you get that long twitter rant in defense of Trevor Noah. And I think there are some interesting things he's saying that kind of explain why this tension exists. If folks haven't read his Salon interview from last month, it's really worth a look - I don't think Oswalt is totally convincing on everything he says, but I think it's interesting to see someone who's clearly smart and progressive explaining the qualms that a lot of progressives have with the social justice movement.   http://www.salon.com/2015/03/11/salons_patton_oswalt_peace_summit/  This bit in particular jumped out at me:   I hate to talk in terms of our side, this side, that side. But our side, the liberal progressives, the open-minded people –  I don’t want us to be the scolds and the shushers. That was always the role of neoconservatives and the religious fundamentalists, to restrict and remove words. I don’t want our side to be the one that’s parsing language.  It just really, really bothers me, if the liberal progressives have now become the scolds. We were the Grouchos! We’re not the Margaret Dumonts — and we’re turning into the Margaret Dumonts on a lot of levels. That lets the misogynists and homophobes and racists seem like the rebels: “Well, we’re saying what people can’t say anymore.” We should be having way more fun with language and jokes and going too far. If our side starts doing that, then I think we’re fucked in terms of moving forward as a society.

The way Patton Oswalt expresses his points definitely comes off as being spoken by a white, male--and I don't think that he gets everything 100% right, but I think the bigger message is largely correct.  We should try to embody a ""sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me"" ethos. That's not to say that words can't hurt, but sticks and stones most certainly fucking can, and when we focus on bad words, sometimes it's too easy to get caught up in what should be small moments of education, not some giant battle on language."

Nobody knows about it other than that crowd, and unless they're one of the fifty most famous comedians in the world nobody pays any attention to what they do anyway.  The people in the club have made a decision to come there to be entertained, and by and large have at least a passing knowledge of the norms of standup comedy.  If an audience member is offended, it's not considered the comic's fault, and worst case scenario the person will just heckled the comic and leave.    The problem is that comedians are treating Twitter like it's an open-mic night, or a 5 minute spot at a comedy club.  They're workshopping material to find out what works.  Comedians behave like they're in a comedy club, where the traditions and norms of comedy say they can say and do damn near anything because they're in artistic control.    They believe it's their show, you made the decision to watch it, and if you don't like it that's your problem.  When they get called out  for negative language, they are aghast.  They feel like they are being criticized for doing something that is not only perfectly acceptable, but should be welcomed by the audience as an attempt to provoke and amuse.    But that's not what Twitter is.  It's ignorant of them to expect the same social norms that exist in a comedy club to extend outside their walls.  Twitter is a broadcast directed at every web-connected human being in the world.  It's like a super-size version of a Tonight Show spot.     There is no such thing as a comment being taken out of context, because there is no context.  There are no shared cultural assumptions between the writer and the audience.  The assumption that the shared culture of standup comedy exists on Twitter is a failure of the writer to understand the medium, not on the audience for failing to understand the writer.    Moreover, Twitter is permanent.  They are intentionally making a public document and publishing it for posterity when they tweet.  Knowing all of those things, how can a comedian possibly think a bigoted joke is going to be given the benefit of the doubt when it misses the mark?  There is no context for a person to interpret a tweet other than their knowledge of the author, and with an unknown comedian that context does not exist.  Audiences only see the message.  It's absolutely insane for them to expect anything other than a negative reaction."
SRSDiscussion,33geqf,MrApophenia,8,Thu Apr 23 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"I don't want to completely defend Oswalt, because I don't totally agree with him point by point. But I think the idea he's driving at is not necessarily that everyone should be cool with what comedians say on Twitter, but rather that immediate shouting outrage and attempts to police what people say - or get them fired from their jobs - may be more counterproductive than other possible responses.  I think what I also find interesting about this is that the objection seems to be not entirely about the poor, put upon comedian (although there is a lot of that too). It's about what the 0-to-outrage culture of the internet is doing to liberals taking part in it, and how they're perceived by society at large. We're taking on the style and tactics of the shrieking culture enforcer that used to be the bastion of the other side, and other people are reacting accordingly."
SRSDiscussion,33geqf,JohnHenryAaron,-1,Thu Apr 23 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fair point, but I also think it's a sort of red herring.  I don't wade into Twitter debates and comment sections and I live in a very conservative state so maybe I'm just ignorant of what is happening in certain cultural environments, but I certainly don't see very many reactions that could be characterized as a ""shrieking culture enforcer.""    With the Trevor Noah thing I didn't read anything that was stronger than, ""This is the guy they picked to anchor the Daily Show.  He wrote some nasty stuff on Twitter. ""  It's hard for me to understand the backlash in that case in particular, given the rather benign reaction."
SRSDiscussion,33geqf,MrApophenia,5,Thu Apr 23 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"Being completely honest, I'm pretty disconnected from social media myself, too. I don't go on Twitter at all, because I don't understand you kids and your new-fangled tweets and tumbls, so most of what I am getting is second-hand from reading articles on sites like Slate and Salon. Which could absolutely be portaying things inaccurately.   From that second-hand viewpoint, a lot of writing has been done of late - including by a lot of progressives - on an atmosphere of outrage that has sprung up on Twitter and Tumblr where people see someone say something they consider offensive or oppressive, and then engage mass online activism against them because of it.  But it's very fair to point out that I'm not really in a position to have much of an informed view of it personally beyond the fact that there seems to be a debate about the pros/cons of that culture - the fact that there is a debate does not automatically mean the thing the debate is about is actually happening, or that it's happening the way it's portrayed."
SRSDiscussion,33geqf,JohnHenryAaron,4,Thu Apr 23 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"I can't speak as an expert on the culture, but it is entirely foreign to my personal experience.  I also find it weird that online conversations are very easily referenced, yet there are remarkably few concrete examples of that type of behavior being discussed.  It's always discussed in the abstract.    Obviously there's an inherent personal bias from only engaging with media that I think is thoughtful in the first place, but barring significant evidence to the contrary I see it as a more sophisticated viewpoint than just yelling ""SJW!"" and ranting about feminism, but still an inherently reactionary argument being pushed to avoid having to engage with the actual content of the criticism."
SRSDiscussion,33geqf,Trivesa,13,Thu Apr 23 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"Obviously it is possible to have SJ-friendly comedy.   That said, the two groups in general are always going to have a lot of tension between them, because comedy is largely based on violating social norms and expectations that the audience is a safe distance from.   The stronger the norm being violated, the funnier the joke (for those who have that distance), which makes humor very subjective.  And many in the SJ community are simply not at a safe distance from some of the strongest taboo subjects -- racism, sexism, rape, etc., to ever find jokes about those topics funny (and really, saying such jokes are oppressive, punching down, etc., are all ultimately pretentious ways of saying unfunny).  Whereas, those topics are also going to be the ripest topics for humor, precisely because talking about them seriously is always so fraught, and because those in the majority generally aren't personally impacted by them.   This wouldn't lead to such tension if it weren't for the moralistic character of the SJ community's views on humor. Very few members of that community ever say ""whelp, I don't have the distance needed to find this funny, time to move on to a different show"". Instead, they view the humor as inherently unfunny, and politically and ethically immoral.  And the moralist is the natural enemy of the comic, regardless of what moral code is being adhered to. It's why the religious right hasn't spawned a ton of comedy clubs, for instance."
SRSDiscussion,33geqf,Suddenly_Elmo,36,Thu Apr 23 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"Well, no, of course not. Unless you believe it's impossible to be funny without also being oppressive. It really depends who you're watching - mainstream stand-ups will sometimes ""punch down"" and make oppressive jokes because they are reflecting mainstream culture. I can think of plenty of comedians who go against this trend though - Mark Steele, Josie Long, Stewart Lee, Simon Amstell... Al Murray actively satirizes reactionary attitudes with the character he plays on stage. I was going to apologise for all the Brits but perhaps that's part of the issue - in the UK you will often hear right-wingers lament the dominance of left wing/radical/feminist comedians, a situation that may be reversed elsewhere in the world.   ""political correctness"" is the common enemy   Stewart Lee has a good bit on how political correctness is actually a good thing; worth a watch."

For example, Seven Dirty Words targeted US conservatives and Aamer Rahman's well-known bit on reverse racism targets offended white people, etc.  If PC backlash in stand up is getting you down, this might be a good opportunity for a thread about comics who are mostly politically progressive and take it somewhat seriously.  (Trigger warning for all of these links.)  The Todd Glass Show is half bizarre improv and half discussion usually on the topic of Todd's continuing evolution on politics.

This is not my job nor is it something that I consider part of my identity. Not being oppressive is something that should be a given. I think it is excessively factionalist and isolationist to think there is such a thing as the SJ community. It also restricts progression of the discussion, individual thought and critical reflection. The factionalist notion of a SJ community is at odds with an academic approach towards social issues.  That having said, you can be funny without oppressive. I am somewhat conflicted regarding black humour. I believe black humour helps us cope in certain situations. However, sarcastical observant rants interspersed with slurs don't equal humour. A Louis CK relies on this poor excuse for humour for example - it is the classic high school humour that confuses smug rants with comedy."

Comedians have a knack for presenting observations that we don't normally think about, such as things like privilege, racial stereotypes, or the gender binary, and can present them in such a way that makes you think ""holy shit I actually make those absurd assumptions all the time."" I think that's generally good thing, even if the joke can be construed as offensive.  The grey area lies with the fact that this type of offensive joke can be misinterpreted as the ""haha minority"" type by bigots who selectively hear what they want to hear, or if the joke is simply performed badly."

Just this morning my mother was proud that she found an all-natural recipe for pear jam that ""has no pectin in it."" She didn't mean the recipe had no pectin in it, when asked to clarify- because plenty of recipes for high pectin-producing fruits like pears don't add extra- she thought that the end product had no pectin in it.

But she didn't want it as an additive or otherwise- she got upset when I eventually told her there was naturally pectin in her pear jam.

The spread of Green Revolution agriculture affected both agricultural biodiversity (or agrodiversity) and wild biodiversity.[41] There is little disagreement that the Green Revolution acted to reduce agricultural biodiversity, as it relied on just a few high-yield varieties of each crop.   And you said:   Biodiversity isn't a GMO problem, and GMO hasn't exacerbated it.   ...   This has led to concerns about the susceptibility of a food supply to pathogens that cannot be controlled by agrochemicals, as well as the permanent loss of many valuable genetic traits bred into traditional varieties over thousands of years. To address these concerns, massive seed banks such as Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research’s (CGIAR) International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (now Bioversity International) have been established (see Svalbard Global Seed Vault).

How is it full of first world privilege, and not just, in your opinion, technically incorrect? There are grassroots movements against GMOs and restrictions on seed saving all over Latin America, and in India, so it seems to me you are simply wrong about this being a first-world-only concern.  Nobody said GMOs per se are bad--I'm aware that they've increased yields and made crops able to grow under different conditions; I was arguing that the IP law to which they are subject eliminates what I understood to be the usual pathways by which diversity is preserved.

SRSDiscussion,33cz8d,piyochama,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, when did they stop? And why is it necessary to make it illegal if they weren't doing it anyway?    For the most part, they don't.  It usually does make more financial sense to just buy new seed than to sort the seed out of a previous crop and store it for months.  There are cases where people try, but it usually has to meet the following criteria:  1) The seed has to be part of the existing harvest(so they don't have to do extra work to get it) and 2) the seed has to store in a silo for 6 months+.  Otherwise, the money you would spend harvesting the seed and storing it in proper conditions for future use would end up being more than buying it.  This is the primary reason why biodiversity is a problem that is larger than GMO's:  This logic would hold true regardless of the type of seed.  Since farmer's are mostly going to be buying their seeds from large companies, we're always going to have an issue with farmers tending to buy one or two successful seed variants.  One possible solution that has been suggested/tried on small scales is to have government regulations/incentives to prod the seed-sellers to introduce genetic diversity into their strains(aka it's not all one strain, it's a bunch of strains that share the desired trait).   Why not make strains that produce viable seeds instead of the single-use ones they have today?   As far as I know, all commercially available strains are viable.   There's research variants that are sterile, but I don't think any are on the market.    The situation in the third world is certainly  different, but at the same time, I don't know of any rules that force third world farmers to use GMO crops.  If seed saving is important to them, presumably they can use the non-GMO variants that don't come with those restrictions that they were using before GMOs existed.  I suspect the tension is that they want to use the GMO seeds, but they also want to save seed."

I don't see how this is any different than convincing people to rely on petroleum fertilizer systems that force them to continue buying the fertilizer once they've sunk the cost into transitioning to that system.
SRSDiscussion,33cz8d,sha742,18,Tue Apr 21 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"Ya, sorry I typed that right as I was falling asleep for a nap.  Monsanto, and only a few other global companies, protect their ""patents"" like lots of other companies in the tech and agricultural world.  Unfortunately lots of their genetic patents depend on indigenous knowledge - what plants/herbs could provide the genes for drought or pest resistance - and the indigenous peoples who provide that knowledge to Monsanto aren't appropriately compensated.  Indeed GMOs (or pharmaceuticals for that matter) that arise from traditional ecological knowledge often end up costing indigenous peoples and rural farmers more in the long run than they are compensated for assisting in early stages of GMO development.  Another level of this ""bioprospecting"" that is problematic comes at the national and international scale.  Monsanto works with national governments, the World Bank, the IMF, and other development institutions to insert supplies of GMO crops into humanitarian relief efforts, developmental aid packages, or national loans.  These deals can take a variety of forms, but importantly they often force open local/rural markets for proprietary GMO crops.  When subsistence farmers use a nonreproducing GMO crop for once season - that is to say a variety of corn or rice that can't reseed itself - farmers must continually purchase seeds (often at exorbitant prices) from Monsanto or other GMO outfits.  This example is not unlike the one you provide for fertilizer dependence.  In fact the two are often complimentary efforts built into the development programs (aka: neoliberal privatization efforts) I mentioned earlier.  Another problem, and one that political ecologists, anthropologists, and other scholars are studying looks at how GMOs provide a conduit for neoliberalism to extend to the genetic and molecular level.  The discourse surrounding GMOs depends on both neoliberal notions of market management (that is to say ""free"" markets) and the ability to patent genes.  Both of these discourses reduce complex political systems down to simplified, neoliberal logics.  One where the ability to patent a gene or control the distribution of a plant seem not only reasonable but necessary parts of global agriculture.  There is an inequality built into every step of the GMO process (like all commodity chains), but in this instance the discourse of this process has become inextricably connected with reregulating food markets for the benefit of Monsanto and other GMO producers.  In many ways this genetic-reductionist discourse erases the social and political causes for the crises that GMOs are popularly seen as solutions to.  For example, a drought resistant strain of rice seems a practical solution to water scarcity in parts of Africa or Asia.  Right?  What the discourse of GMO as savior hides, in this instance, is that often water scarcity arises from corruption in governmental structures, or more commonly the neoliberal privatization of water resources. GMOs are then a solution to anthropocentric (largely neoliberal, free market, and trade specific) problems, but the discourse surrounding them, and the ""intellectual property rights"" contained within GMO genes, renders those issues moot.  It reduces them to an issue correctable by increasing market penetration for GMOs, for tearing down trade barriers, and for globalizing the intellectual property system.  Farmers and indigenous peoples often find themselves at the bottom of a huge, neoliberal dung heap.  Where the proposed solutions (GMOs) to their problems (politics) leave them more vulnerable to environmental and economic forces then they were initially.  This all stinks because GMOs could be a positive force for global food stores.  Unfortunately, they are so wrapped up in systems/structures of inequality that their deployment is problematic (to say the least).  (I'm sorry if this is sloppy.  It's dinner time and I don't have time to reread this, and stopped short on the last point.  Also, didn't get to say why I think GMOs are different from other systems like the one you mentioned.  I hope my point is clear from the bit I mentioned about indigenous intellectual property rights and the politics of non-reproducing crops.  Basically, I just wanted to say there is a political difference between GMOs and other consumer technologies - I understood the post I was replying to as talking about consumer products like iPhones, computers, or John Deer tractors.)"

We consolidate that by the fact that while we harm hundreds of thousands, we better the lives of hundreds of millions.  Hell, look at the historic price of rice (actually don't, its incredibly boring). In 1974, rice farmers were selling rice at $2000/tonne. Now it's down to about $300ish/tonne. Sure, thousands of farmers have been displaced and forced to sell their land, but like, eggs and omelettes."

I'm not sure about the decision calculus (harming several hundred thousand to better hundreds of millions) at play here.  I think that statement glosses over lots of other political, environmental, gender, and (post)colonial problems.  Who is being harmed, and why them?  Who benefits the most, and why them?  How could the system be more equitable?  What role does the World Bank, IMF, or UN play in the disenfranchisement of farmers?  And so on...  The point I'm trying to make is the changes in agriculture you suggest are ""better for the group"" are not natural or inevitable.  Changes in agriculture that are forced on farmers or indigenous peoples are inherently political.  Meaning, among other things, there are ways for us to do it better."
SRSDiscussion,33cz8d,TheSpaceWhale,2,Wed Apr 22 12:10:07 2015 UTC,"I do make the assumption that capitalism is a good system, but when we're talking about the world economy, it becomes a bit more difficult to classify it as a capitalist system when you consider some of our largest trading partners have nationalized industries and a range of capital controls.  But those are nuances. We'll group everything together with the term 'market economy' and add adjectives as need be.  My personal belief is that we should make decisions with the world's benefit in mind but understand the importance and significance of autonomous states. Ignorance toward laws and cultures leads robust theories to limp-in-practice.  So in the instance of abundant frankenfruits, where we suddenly have much less need for farmers and land, I think the IMF should work directly with the governments of those nations so that the land and laborers can be repurposed."

Maybe advertisers will start to think ""Instead of making women feel horrible and ugly, by making them feel beautiful and loved the way they are they are more likely to buy our product!""

With that said, even though I think we should be careful to penalize people for seemingly consensual sex, on a personal level I wouldn't recommend people trying to hook up with someone whose psychological maturity is much lower. I guess my point is that laws that focus on differences in degree tend to be quite a bit more arbitrary (and questionable) than laws that focus on distinct actions, etc. Hope this makes sense!  And when it comes to which substances someone should be allowed to consume I think the principle of individuals owning their own bodies  is much more important than whether or not consumption of some substance may have some negative side effects (even water can kill if you over-consumed).

Yeah, Obama's drone program is hugely problematic and has killed thousands of innocent people. You know what it isn't, though? A decade-plus land war that killed hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Iraqis, and created a giant power vacuum in the Middle East that is currently being filled by ISIS. This type of analysis goes as deep as ""Bush did war stuff, Obama did war stuff, Bush and Obama's foreign policy is identical."" Or the classic ""Obama has bombed more countries than Bush."" Yeah, okay, here's some news: targeted missile strikes for a few weeks in Libya is not the same in scope as invading and occupying a sovereign nation, in the process killing hundreds of thousands of civilians. Nor are drone strikes in Pakistan or Yemen. Obama has massively drawn down troop involvement in Iraq, is trying to avoid war with Iran, didn't start wars in Syria or Ukraine when he was heavily pressured to do so. You think a Republican president would have done any of that? Republicans want nothing less than to join Israel in setting off World War III in the Middle East and crushing the institution of Islam, and would be well into that process if there was a Republican in the Oval Office. If you think Democrats are indistinguishable because you can't tell the difference between that and running sporadic drone strikes on suspected terrorists, sorry, but that's laughably childish.  And this hasn't even touched on domestic or economic policy. If there was a Republican president with the current congressional makeup, we'd be seeing massive, across the board cuts to social programs, federal hate legislation against the LGBT community, enormous tax cuts for the rich, attacks on reproductive freedom, a Supreme Court packed with corporatist Justices for decades, and so on and so forth. This ""they're all the same"" bullshit ignores the wildly, unconscionably regressive policies that unfettered Republican leadership would bring. It's just a naive, petulant ""any president who doesn't give me every single thing I want is identical to any other president who doesn't give me every single thing I want.""

Just picking random schools, I can't imagine that University of Michigan, with a 10 billion dollar endowment or even Ohio State with a 3 billion dollar endowment and University of Kansas with a billion dollar endowment will teach creationism, funding be damned. Certainly private schools like Harvard with a 32 billion dollar endowment, Amherst with a 2 billion dollar endowment, and Syracuse with a 1.2 billion dollar endowment don't particularly care. All this is to say that there are a lot of colleges, and there is a lot of money in those colleges.

The real universities that matter are state schools, and republicans have been doing their damnedest to cripple those for years.  Take Scott Walker.  He chose to freeze tuition increases while simultaneously freezing funding to the university of Wisconsin.  End result?  Research gets cut.  That's the ONE thing we really do better than anywhere else in the world,  we generate world class research in our universities.  But Scott Walker, like many republicans, views universities with a degree of skepticism, thinking they just generae liberal propaganda.    This attitude of cutting funding has been seen in many republican states.  The only really progressive financial move I've seen from republicans shockingly came from Florida with an investigation of how to pull out a 10k bachelors.  Going back to the general attitude ofte party, you have people like the Texas Republican Party, who wrote into their platform that they were against teaching ""critical thinking"".

Republicans would've done the same thing if their neck had been on the line.   ACA   He killed the public option despite it having 70% public approval according to polls at the time, and implemented a system model on Republican ideas from the 90s.   Dream act   Immigration reform still alludes us. He has deported more undocumented immigrants than any president in history.   Allowing gays to serve openly in the military   I've got to hand it to him for that one.   Federal recognition of same sex marriages   That one too. I can't fault Obama for his support for gay rights. But I think the tide has been turning for a while and even a (moderate) Republican president would have been pressured into doing this eventually.   Not going after states that have legalized marijuana (since the Feds technically have the right to arrest anyone doing it)   I don't know what you're smoking, but he's gone after them like mad in CA where I'm from. The feds even raided a dispensary in my home town during his first term.   Withdrawal from Iraq   That was Bush's doing; Obama tried to find a way out but was legally obliged to abide by the agreement GWB made with the Iraqis. His broader foreign policy has been like GWB on steroids. Nobody worth talking to would defend his warmongering.   The Jobs Bill (which didn't pass and was a pipe dream at best, but still)   Yep, nothing but talk. He also turned his back on unions quite famously during the whole Wisconsin thing."

Which really leads to the problem with people who won't play in the middle, they aren't willing to compromise their ideology.  This is just as true for the hard left as it is for the Tea Party.    The reality is that people on the extremes think politics is a game of checkers when in fact it's a game of chess.  Their goals are too stark, their victory conditions too simple, and they lack the ability to play the long game.  Extremists do serve a purpose in creating a little modulating pressure on the system, but it's usually not that's significant, the Tea Party has been a bit of an anomoly in that regard.  Generally though they are a forgettable blip in the system.

SRSDiscussion,33cz8d,sha742,13,Tue Apr 21 19:16:00 2015 UTC,"It was in college, I lived in a housing cooperative.  Member owned and all that.  I operated at multiple levels of leadership there ranging from house level stuff to organization wide financial director.  The main thing I remember were the meetings.  Things were supposed to be by consensus, which would imply that everyone agreed.  Which is nothing near the truth, consensus voting is a terrible system.  For one it carries a heavy chill factor that keeps shy people out because they don't want to rock the boat.  It also allows ego maniacs to hijac even the most mundane of agreements by refusing to consent.  You could have multi-hour conversations about what kind of toilet paper we were going to buy.   This wasn't true for all the houses (some did straigh up and down votes), it was far worse in the more politically active houses.   You would see lots of other issues as well.  Free riders were a big problem, even with the fairly structured system of labor we had people could get away with doing little because people weren't always willing to enforce the rules.  Moreover some people were just willing to contribute a LOT more to the house, and people would rely on them to pick up the slack.  In my case I was able to get out of work by joining the leadership, which is so clearly similar to what often happens in communist dictatorships that it's hard not to laugh.  In truth I did do a lot of work in leadership, but I didn't get my hands dirty often.  Then there were just the realities of living with a bunch of people on very limited resources in tight confines.  In all fairness it was actually a great experience, and I don't regret it for a second, but I also look back on it with a better perspective of what it means to be a member of a group, or what it means to manage said group.    It's actually led to me being a significantly better employee as I've gotten older, I'm very good at cutting through bullshit in meetings and bypassing petty personal crap to get things done.  These were skills I learned there.  It also left me with a ton of great friends, a few good lovers, more bad ones, only 1 rash, and a good set of skills in a kitchen."

Of all the trans-exclusionary issues with our language, this is not the battle you want to fight. The English language just isn't equipped to respect people with genitalia unexpected for their gender identity, and any attempt to include these marginal cases in everyday speech will be clunky.

This rhetoric dialectically reinforces and is reinforced by the same essentialism that it becomes in practice, e.g. putting trans people in the wrong prisons, requiring genital surgery for legal sex recognition, etc. It also enforces the gender binary, something that will always oppress nonbinary people and whose existence needs to be recognised by laypeople. What are we but laypeople ourselves? Or does layperson here mean cis people?  Furthermore, you're being prescriptivist as hell.

SRSDiscussion,33fqku,piyochama,2,Thu Apr 23 01:06:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think it's Macklemore's responsibility, if he claims to have any awareness of issues within hiphop culture (or his own privilege, which we can safely conclude he nominally does), to realise that was an inevitable consequence of his platform, perceive the racial (and at times gendered) role it casts him in externally and internally, and subsequently to consider minding his mouth.

He was an underground dude for a long time. In a lot of ways he's paid his dues in hip hop.  I agree that the way critics treated him is fucked since, like others have pointed out, POC in the hip hop community have pointed out the same issues before and get not nearly enough attention.  But can you blame a dude for a song that ended up getting huge out of seemingly no where?"
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,yhwnoitareneg,2,Thu Apr 23 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"Both Thrift Shop and Same Love are being discussed, apparently (cf. some other discussion I had with OP in this thread). I consider Thrift Shop his breakthrough hit but that's neither here nor there. He was underground for a long time, yes.   But can you blame a dude for a song that ended up getting huge out of seemingly no where?   I have never blamed him for being successful, although I have pointed out his whiteness very likely has something to do with it given current trends. I don't think I even made a comment on the quality of his music ever except that I hated the message of Thrift Shop (ironically the only Macklemore song I'll listen to) and thought it failed at its anticonsumerist intent. I don't buy 'seemingly nowhere' though because he paid to use Warner Bros.'s independent music promotion vehicle for The Heist, although that obviously isn't a guarantee the music would catch on and it was nonetheless pretty impressive.  What I blamed him for was not, as I stated, 'minding his mouth'. The fact he was in hiphop for a long time only lends weight to my argument that Macklemore, as someone positioning themselves as aware of the issues within hiphop culture and the political climate around it, and very much positioning themselves as an ally, is responsible for knowing his comments are going to be given more credence automatically than black queer hiphop artists' and that they will be pointed to by bigoted outsiders using 'hiphop culture' as a thinly-veiled way to talk about the innate savagery of black people. This is not a new issue; it precedes Macklemore and certainly continued well into his career as hiphop gained more mainstream and commercial prominence."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,asublimeduet,3,Thu Apr 23 04:47:21 2015 UTC,"Thrift Shop probably is his break through, you're right. That said, I'm pretty sure they're both on The Heist so you're right that it really doesn't matter since one would carry the other no matter what.  I definitely agree his whiteness has something to do with his success.   although that obviously isn't a guarantee the music would catch on and it was nonetheless pretty impressive.   I think this is very important considering how many artists likely don't make it anywhere.   his comments are going to be given more credence automatically than black queer hiphop artists' and that they will be pointed to by bigoted outsiders using 'hiphop culture' as a thinly-veiled way to talk about the innate savagery of black people.    My only argument in defense of Mack here (and note, I'm not a huge fan of his music either) is that he is and was a part of hip hop prior to these songs taking off. He was an insider most definitely. And I'm not sure how much you can blame an insider for the poor views of an outsider. I'm Jewish. If I do something that is stereotypically ""Jewish"" but is in no ways wrong otherwise, I shouldn't be blamed for a neo-Nazi taking my actions as a reason to bash Jews.   Now, if you're famous, you definitely can argue that you have a greater responsibility to be a model citizen of whatever group you're claiming to be a part of. But Mack wasn't big whatsoever before The Heist and I think it's unfair to say he can't speak out for the communities he is a part of. Do I think it was unfair to point out hip hop as being homophobic when most of society is in fact homophobic? I think so, to a degree. But should he be responsible for a bigot's views as an underground rapper? I'm not sure I agree.   Macklemore and certainly continued well into his career as hiphop gained more mainstream and commercial prominence.   Forgive me if I'm interpreting this incorrectly, but are you saying that Mack has done additional things to fuck over the hip hop community and/or black Americans since becoming famous? Can you point out what? I'm not defending him or anything here, I'm just genuinely ignorant on the topic of what Mack has been up to lately."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,yhwnoitareneg,3,Thu Apr 23 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, the last part was unclearly worded. I meant that the popular perception of rap and how it was used to demonise black people only became more prominent and damaging during the 2000s, when Macklemore was underground, so he was around to witness it. I don't really follow what he does in recent years so I have no idea since the time The Heist got big.  Also, I don't think your analogy really applies, although I do think you sorta got what I said.    I'm Jewish. If I do something that is stereotypically ""Jewish"" but is in no ways wrong otherwise, I shouldn't be blamed for a neo-Nazi taking my actions as a reason to bash Jews.   This is 100% correct. But the thing is, Macklemore's actions aren't going to used as an example of a typical rapper. They're going to be used as foil to a 'typical rapper' (as a dogwhistle extension of black people at large) and any comments he makes are going to be seen as necessary white intervention (the same as with any 'black issue', people demand accountability from supposedly monolithic black communities while ignoring the actual discourse going on, but will listen to and loudly applaud any white person who 'sets a good example'). So it's not Macklemore's fault he's a 'clean' and 'palatable' act although I'm sure he's aware it's a good sell, but it is his fault if he allows his voice to be used to attack black people in that very culture he's profiting in, and he does have the responsibility to know that the things he says won't be taken on merit alone and will drown out the opinions of black people.  It's not so much about whether Macklemore is in hip-hop culture, it's about his whiteness. If Macklemore made a diss track against Eminem I'd likely laud it. And Same Love was lyrically tied to the civil rights movement and historical black oppression, so it definitely wasn't about Eminem; it was racial policing, because Macklemore is aware of the political black context of hip-hop as well as anyone else. Which sorta illustrates my point, I think."

Whether or not his response to the criticism is satisfactory is up for debate, but people here are discussing this like he's ducking the question, which is absurd.   Also, if we having a throwback party, I've got some issues about Miley Cyrus' cultural appropriation of twerking that I'd like to discuss."

It remains heavily associated with black America both because it's still very much theirs and also because of the perceptions of people who aren't black. It frequently deals directly or indirectly with black American struggles as well, which I think is a very important point that Macklemore cannot relate to.  It would help if OP posted the specific criticisms or the lyrics of the song(s) in question or interviews or whatever, there are many external critiques on hiphop (and often, by extension, black people, especially black men) made daily.

SRSDiscussion,33fqku,nomadbishop,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:59:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, it makes sense. Your opinion is the majority opinion I encounter. I feel I already addressed that certain forms of 'artistic expression' are objectionable by definition. You're not obliged to agree or find it pleasant, but I've established my opinion on your opinion, I guess. This is not related to Macklemore, but do you not object to hate speech on principle? If you mean that you find it frustrating, then I'm not sure why you're choosing to participate so declaratively in a discussion where the parameters have been set specifically thus; if you want to defend the criticisms, I already asked OP to post them and they declined, because they preferred a generalised discussion (I inferred)."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,asublimeduet,6,Wed Apr 22 05:02:24 2015 UTC,"I forgot about that. For example, he said about Thrift Shop:  ""Rappers talk about, oh I buy this and I buy that, and I spend this much money and I make it rain, and this type of champagne and painting the club, and this is the kind of record that's the exact opposite.""  And for Same Love:  ""Misogyny and homophobia are the two acceptable means of oppression in hip hop culture. It's 2012. There needs to be some accountability. I think that as a society we're evolving and I think that hip hop has always been a representation of what's going on in the world right now."""
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,asublimeduet,4,Wed Apr 22 05:10:51 2015 UTC,"Oh. Those were pretty bad comments. I think everyone's been through Thrift Shop (and I personally have a loathing for it as someone who grew up in an eventually-gentrified neighbourhood and dressed out of secondhand stores as a child), but it's not only completely ignorant and playing into popular stereotypes of (black) rappers as stupid and materialistic, but ignoring the fact that black people have been historically oppressed and singing about attaining wealth and acquiring status symbols is intended and interpreted pretty differently. I'm not sure Macklemore is self-aware at all when he posits himself in contrast to that.  I think the comments on Same Love are more tempered but still unfair and ignorant (as well as excessively limited in scope, funnily enough). There is accountability within and without, Macklemore saying there isn't both implies that he is providing accountability that black people couldn't (which I really hate because this comes out with any sort of racial issue, WHERE ARE THE COMMUNITY ELDERS?, which is what I was getting at before with racial policing and character casting). There's also the obvious and repeatedly dragged out contrasts to pop music (which Macklemore also dabbles in arguably) and rock, which are incredibly misogynistic and often homophobic and transphobic as hell whenever the issue comes up."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,nomadbishop,3,Wed Apr 22 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"If the parameters of the discussion are as simple as ""Should a white man born into wealth publicly criticize black culture?"" then the answer is obvious.

It really isn't a coincidence that there's an increasing amount of mainstream white hiphop artists that the average hiphop hater is okay with while other popular hiphop artists of colour are still condemned (compare white supremacist Iggy Azalea and Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, etc. Eminem was one of the originals as well)."

White activists refusing to talk about hip hop homophobia or hip hop rape culture is an ABANDONMENT of queers and women of color.   Power structures don't disappear in minority communities, if anything poverty and poor opportunities (thanks White America) make them even more vicious as straight men act out exaggerated violent masculinity to maintain self respect and women have fewer options to escape abusive situations."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,asublimeduet,6,Wed Apr 22 11:30:52 2015 UTC,"I like some hip hop, but there is a lot of problematic material in it, and just because Macklemore isn't black doesn't mean he can't address it, there are plenty of black (and white) rappers who do it better than him, but it's still good that he's bringing up issues."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,Ad_Infinitum_Upward,6,Wed Apr 22 05:06:16 2015 UTC,but he does seem to be the biggest voice in these criticisms.   He's the biggest voice because he's white and his whiteness is not irrelevant. It's his marketability. There are queer and female rappers who have been discussing homophobia and sexism in hip-hop for years now.   My problem with him is that second verse in same love where he suggests that the homophobia in hip hop is somehow worse than homophobia in other communities because the black community has also been oppressed.

SRSDiscussion,33fqku,asublimeduet,3,Wed Apr 22 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know shit about mainstream hip hop. I should have mentioned that.  Regardless, he still is a major hip hop artist. He certainly is a part of the community, despite his skin color.  Ostricising people due to factors beyond their control seems rather regressive. I dunno if this quite applies but Antia Sarkessian is a critic in a predominately male environment. Does that make her opinions worthless? I certainly don't think so."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,TrueArmenianHero,2,Wed Apr 22 04:19:31 2015 UTC,"Your analogy isn't even good. Gaming isn't predominantly male anymore, women don't oppress men (for being men), and women have as much place as gaming as men do, which shouldn't be up for debate. Whether white people have as much right to speak on hiphop should and is up for debate (by the posting of this thread) all the time because of its close ties to black culture and black people, and the fact that such critique has often been ignorant and used to attack and demonise black people themselves.  So, perhaps if you cannot think about this issue without layers of abstraction, because you know nothing about hiphop, and your primary instinct is to assume nobody else is making meaningful criticisms of hiphop except Macklemore, you are out of your lane, so to speak.  His opinions might not even be necessarily worthless (as stated I haven't even read the criticisms, I think they are probably relevant but not necessary to speak to the question in the OP, which is 'does Macklemore have a place critiquing hiphop culture as a white person?'), but that doesn't mean he should say them or that someone else can't have them and say them from a place of far more meaning and experience.  This isn't just because Macklemore is white, or even because of the oppressive history of white people suppressing the expression of PoC and casting it as immoral in contrast to their own, but also because he essentially becomes a clean white figurehead through which racists can continue to attack hiphop and because his privilege (something he has made songs about before, incidentally) means his opinions will be weighted more favourably by outsiders regardless of their merits. It also masks the conversations that black people have about hiphop all the time, turning it into an issue of racial policing and undermining other participants in the community.  It's also not ostracism to say that it's not somebody's place to talk on a specific issue because of power dynamics."
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,asublimeduet,6,Wed Apr 22 04:25:11 2015 UTC,"The main thing I've seen Macklemore talk about is homophobia in the rap community and the use of homophobic slurs. Hip Hop, more than any other genre of music, uses homophobic themes and slurs in their lyrics. For me this is a confusing issue, because the issue isn't just white/black power dynamics, but also straight/LGBT power dynamics (specifically gay men when it comes to Hip Hop).  This could be viewed as less of a ""white person telling black people how to act"" and more of a ""straight person telling straight people how to act"", which is different. I know Macklemore's straight, but for nothing but to help me learn more about these issues, would a gay white man have a right to speak about hip hop culture when they are a direct victim here?"
SRSDiscussion,33fqku,Ad_Infinitum_Upward,0,Wed Apr 22 05:19:11 2015 UTC,"It's both, though, and the things I stated are still relevant due to the positioning of hiphop. There are queer black hiphop artists with a lot to say about this themselves, by the way.  I don't talk about rights in this context. It's also different when a famous person does it and a bystander does it, although the bystander is still capable of perpetuating harmful nonsense. I think a gay white person's criticisms of homophobic music are legitimate, but they should be carefully considered in a way they usually aren't when it comes to hiphop. I'm queer and trans FWIW and I don't have any problem with white straight people saying 'it's unacceptable to use homophobic slurs, especially as a straight person'. I do often have problems with their conclusions when applied to black artistry though or culture in general."

That sort of exemplifies my point that the major problem with Macklemore isn't what he says but how everyone instantly gives him more credit because he's a white guy in hip hop. He should be a voice among many lending his support, not a major spokesperson.   I don't have any problem with white straight people saying 'it's unacceptable to use homophobic slurs, especially as a straight person'. I do often have problems with their conclusions when applied to black artistry though or culture in general.   It's not a problem with black people or culture, and white people are in general just as homophobic as black people, but it is definitely a problem with hip hop more so than any other music. And I don't think just because it comes from black culture doesn't mean it's untouchable unless you are black. R&B, jazz, blues, and soul never had this issue. I don't have any exact specifics, but it's obvious that homophobic slurs and themes are far more prominent in hip hop (historically and currently) than any other genre of music. If Country or Indie Folk music had the same disproportionate use of vitriolic homophobia, we wouldn't mince words and keep it aimed at generic straight people, we would call out that genre of music. Of course this is a sensitive issue with many intricacies, and of course a black queer person would be the best to speak out about this, but we shouldn't allow one unprivileged group to disenfranchise another separate unprivileged group. Homophobia isn't tied to black culture any more so than it is to white culture, there should be no issue in calling it out."

He should be a voice among many lending his support, not a major spokesperson.

It's not a problem with black people or culture, and white people are in general just as homophobic as black people, but it is definitely a problem with hip hop more so than any other music.   I actually wonder how much of this is a function of mainstreamification.   R&B, jazz, blues, and soul never had this issue.   I find this bizarre because all of these were promptly appropriated by white people and deemed acceptable when white for the most part. And with a few exceptions hiphop is incredibly more outspoken than some of those genres. It's also a completely different point in history.   I don't have any exact specifics, but it's obvious that homophobic slurs and themes are far more prominent in hip hop (historically and currently) than any other genre of music.   I'm not disputing this, and I hate it every time I hear it. It affects me too.   If Country or Indie Folk music had the same disproportionate use of vitriolic homophobia, we wouldn't mince words and keep it aimed at generic straight people, we would call out that genre of music.   Would we? We might, but articles calling out the indie folk and rock scenes for racism have met substantial backlash. Traditional country music is often incredibly misogynistic and I rarely hear criticism of that in comparison to hiphop's misogyny.   Of course this is a sensitive issue with many intricacies, and of course a black queer person would be the best to speak out about this, but we shouldn't allow one unprivileged group to disenfranchise another separate unprivileged group.    I agree with you! And they are speaking out about it! But I think you're looking at this in a vacuum of axes of privilege and missing a lot of how race ties prominently into identity, especially in hiphop, making intersectionality increasingly relevant. But weirdly we are getting into 'all hiphop' territory again instead of 'hiphop predominantly', which is exactly my point, and it's also pretty shitty to the queer people in hiphop who are aware its a conscious form of music and don't push homophobia (the examples I list are just two who activel ycombat it) but still recognise its importance (Angel Haze and Frank Ocean are some great examples).   Homophobia isn't tied to black culture any more so than it is to white culture, there should be no issue in calling it out.   It really depends on your conclusions, like I said, and white people should still be aware of their incredible power over black people.  edit: A better genre to compare hiphop to might be emo, which, especially as scene music grew in popularity, is almost all predicated on incredible misogyny, transphobia, etc. and violence against women, and is extremely white and male, unlike hiphop, which does have a women issue but women have fought hard for decades to gain prominence and success within it. The kind of music I'm referring to gained in popularity commercially as hiphop came into prominence and honestly got cut a lot more slack than hiphop did, this is indisputable. I was heavily into scene at the time and I can think of literally one song that condemns violence against women (Face Down by The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus... I guess I'll give props to Gerard Way from My Chemical Romance, he's a great trans ally, but I got nothing to say about their music). It's interesting that the power dynamics are very simple and straightforward here but nobody (in the mainstream, because both hiphop and emo receive feminist critiques) except concerned parents had anything to say about emo. In fact, most attacks on emo were directed at the 'effeminate' appearances of the stars and were as misogynistic as emo is itself and full of homophobia."

If they were only talking about their own countries then it would be based on their opinions, I suppose.  I really reject appeals to rights like that, and, no, I don't think 'whoever produces good music has a place in hiphop' because good music is subjective. Plenty of people think Iggy Azalea makes good music and I think she has no place in hiphop because she is a white supremacist (which is a subject of debate within the hiphop community, in fact) and her place is used to oppress among other things. People can make hiphop without being black but they should respect its cultural significance and importance to black people, and they should be careful in what they say and from the position they say it in because their privilege will allow them to get away with a lot more ignorance, prominently."

SRSDiscussion,339ttw,c_mad788,2,Mon Apr 20 20:10:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I hadn't heard of Noel Ignatiev before this post. A fascinating figure! I found a 2002 Washington Times article that sums up the controversy well and has some interesting quotes from his Harvard colleagues, although I don't think it will tell you anything you don't already know.  Robyn Wiegman cites Ignatiev in her essay ""Whiteness Studies and the Paradox of Particularity"", and is commenting on the way Ignatiev and others use the history of the Irish in the U.S. as a way to imagine the anti-racist white subject:    ""The 'fact' of the Irish's originary blackness, in other words, sustains the belief in the transcendent possibility of reversing history, even though the language of race in the United States by the early nineteenth century was tied quite resolutely to an economy of corporeal visibility. [...] The fascination within certain trajectories of whitness studies with the Irish speaks to the very desire that motivates liberal whiteness in the popular sphere: the desire to liberate ourselves from a corporeal identity that signifies the universal privilege of white skin"" (The Futures of American Studies, p 295).    Earlier (around page 289), Wiegman is exploring Ignatiev's conception of whiteness and argues that for him whiteness is an ""inscription based on skin which can be consciously refused,"" as opposed to whiteness as learned psychological roots that deeply define individuals' identities. Not really what you're looking for, but at least it's more commentary on the subject.   To be honest, OP, I'm a bit out of my depth in this field, I'd love to hear your thoughts on Ignatiev and the possibilities of white folks resisting whiteness. If you've done much reading in the subject, I'd love if you could recommend any articles/books!   P.S. I also found a review of Ignatiev's book by Peter Quinn, which I can't link to because it's on an online database, but I was able to get to it using my public library's system. The review is mainly positive, but is also critical of certain aspects of the book.   Quinn, Peter. ""How the Irish Became White."" America, 1996., 14, Expanded Academic ASAP, EBSCOhost (accessed April 21, 2015).   In the review, Quinn disagrees with Ignatiev's starting point:    ""There is much that is worthwhile in this book, and it deserves to be read, as Ignatiev asks, on the basis of the questions it raises. The problem is this: The fundamental question implied in the very title of the book--how did the Irish become white?--is flawed and misleading, and therefore cannot yield a useful answer.""    Quinn thinks the basic duality of ""white"" || ""people of color"" that progressive theory often uses is too simplified to be useful. I don't fully agree with Quinn, but having just skimmed the article it seems he's contesting Ignatiev's grasp of Irish history. Quinn argues that a better framing for the Irish identity shifts in the United States would be their uniquely Irish identity:    ""The story of the Irish exodus to America is not about how they became white but about how they stayed Irish--how they survived the destruction of the rural society that supported their culture [...] If the question of Irish acceptance were simply a passage from one color to another, the Christian, English-speaking, white Irish should have rapidly blended into America's Anglo-Saxon woodwork. That they didn't--that they remained a distinct group replete with a separate parochial educational system largely of their making--is testament to both the external prejudices they faced and the internal dynamics of their own history.""   I get the sense that Quinn maybe didn't fully understand ""whiteness"" as Ignatiev was conceptualizing it, but Quinn does seem to have a point as well. If you can, check out the full review, it goes into a good bit of detail on some of Ignatiev's treatments of Irish history."
SRSDiscussion,339ttw,Priorwater,4,Tue Apr 21 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the lengthy response.  I haven't read the Quinn article but based on those quotes, I think I'm maybe sympathetic to the claim that white/POC is not a clear-cut duality but it does seem that he's really not grasping Ignatiev's definition of whiteness. Basically, Ignatiev understands whiteness as literally identical with being the dominant racial group in America, nothing more and nothing less. That can seem a little bit like begging the question at first, but he does spend some time in HTIBW explaining how attempts to define whiteness any other way lead quickly to absurdity (e.g. ethnic definitions of whiteness make no sense because a white mother can give birth to a black child but a black mother can never give birth to a white child).   On that definition, Quinn is especially wrong here:   If the question of Irish acceptance were simply a passage from one color to another, the Christian, English-speaking, white Irish should have rapidly blended into America's Anglo-Saxon woodwork.    ""Christian"" is misleading because the Irish were Catholic whereas most Americans/German immigrants at the time were Protestant and that was seen as a huge difference Yes many Irish were ""English-speaking"" but many others still spoke Irish ""white"" completely begs the question by assuming that skin color was the determining factor in whiteness, when the whole point is that it never was   You can get a very clear sense of Ignatiev's racial project here. (He's of course been accused by borderline neo-nazis of advocating for ""white genocide"" and telling his white students to kill themselves.) He's clearly a brilliant guy and an important thinker.  I was mostly interested in what he's said WRT his own Jewishness. He of course has opinions about Israel which I don't feel qualified to debate about, but I understand why he thinks those things and I understand why people are mad at him. But then there's the Toaster Incident, which...I'm just at a loss with. That seemed...really misguided. Like a severe misapplication of his own ideas."

Getting people to not be bothered by it would probably involve changing the understanding of sexuality in general, and divorcing people's ego from their sexual identity. If others can ""legitimately"" be gay, for example, then one person's unexamined identity as straight comes into question, and if their self-esteem is tied to that, they'll resist that questioning at all costs. Acceptance seems more important. And I would add that people passed a certain age probably cannot change on the level of gut-reaction to non-straight sexualities.

Plenty of folks who acknowledge the immutability of various stigmatized traits still abuse those offspring who exhibit them (see: virtually any ""anomalous"" minority - those whose parents are unlikely to share their marginalized status). And you don't need to talk to many survivors to know that while it is a particularly horrific form of abuse, reparative therapy is not at all necessary for mistreating one's children. I'll be glad to see it stamped out, but we're still treating the symptoms and not the underlying cause.   That's another battle.    It's a branch of the same poison tree."
SRSDiscussion,333ekq,ampersamp,39,Wed Apr 22 05:32:04 2015 UTC,"The point of ""born this way"" language is to stop some of the most harmful and destructive misconceptions about homosexuality, namely that gay propaganda can turn your kids into homosexuals (see: Russia's Anti-Homosexuality laws) and that if you find a gay kid you can pray away the gay through a psychologically scarring process (see: gay conversion therapies).  If for no other reason than to prevent those two misconceptions, it is extremely important to keep the ""not a choice"" meme in the popular consciousness. It does orders of magnitude more good than harm, as there is a difference between questioning/being confused about your sexuality causing you have an ever-evolving understanding of yourself vs. choosing your sexuality/presentation/pronouns like you choose a shirt."

SRSDiscussion,333ekq,finnigans_cake,5,Sun Apr 19 11:31:31 2015 UTC,"There was a discussion of this here about 3 weeks ago - http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/30meuk/i_think_queerness_is_not_a_choice_is_a_poor/  The point I threw out in that thread, because I've seen this conversation before in lots of places, is that there have been historical shifts in how LGBT people have talked about where queerness comes from. When homosexuality was medicalized, the ""not a choice"" language was roundly rejected because of the associations with it being a mental illness, but later, especially after the AIDS crisis, the language flipped. When the solution to ""gay men are getting HIV/AIDS"" is ""well don't be gay"" or ""don't have sex,"" homosexuality (and by extension queerness as a whole) being ""not a choice"" was important. Similarly with conversion therapy and the fight against it. So ""born this way"" language absolutely can be relevant for individual people who are being forced to try to change who they are.   Of course queer people deserve rights and support (way beyond tolerance) whether who you love/have sex with/whatever is a choice or not. And I do think it's probably time for another rhetorical shift (to ""it doesn't matter whether it's a choice or not"") because the fights the LGBT+ community is facing are ones where that is more important. But it's language that comes with historical significance, and it doesn't just come from allies."
SRSDiscussion,333ekq,MySilverWhining,4,Sun Apr 19 20:09:08 2015 UTC,It's not that that the statement itself is problematic. It's more that the idea that the only reason you should treat people with respect is because it's not a choice is massively fucked up.
SRSDiscussion,333ekq,nineleaflotus1,5,Sun Apr 19 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"You're correct that ""not a choice"" can't move people beyond tolerance, and it would be a terrible standard to settle for, for exactly the reasons you gave.  People should be free to express their sexuality and gender identity according to their own choices.    However, I think ""not a choice"" is an important tool for moving people along the spectrum from outright anger and disgust towards tolerance.  In other words, it operates most effectively on the most LGBT-hostile end of the spectrum, so it's an effective rhetorical tool against the attitudes that are currently holding up civil equality reforms such as gay marriage and anti-discrimination laws.  Because of that, I don't agree that it does more harm than good, at least not right now.  tl;dr  As a rhetorical tool, it has a finite useful lifespan, but it has a lot more work to do before we can put it out to pasture."
SRSDiscussion,333ekq,NoKey33,3,Tue Apr 21 03:40:20 2015 UTC,"It also ignores that even if it was a choice, you should still respect it and shouldn't deny people their rights.   Many religions require believers to actively and continually choose to believe in their tenets and traditions (yes, some people are culturally religious, but many do require a continued choice, it's tricky, I know) and no one, particularly the people saying ""gay/trans is a choice"" would argue adherence to a  religion shouldn't be respected because it's literally a choice."

SRSDiscussion,333ekq,PlushgunMusic,2,Sun Apr 19 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like the ""choice"" line provides some solid bedrock for acceptance, and it's true that there are plenty of places in the world where tolerance would be a welcome high bar. But I also feel like it sets an arbitrarily narrow limit on the stories people are allowed to tell about their sexuality or their gender.* There's a cavalcade of ""choices"" that are really embedded in the ""it's not a choice"" line. Is desire a choice? Is identification a choice? The ways we express our identification? Are individual acts a choice?  When we take the ""choice"" line, we invite homophobic people to say ""no"" only to the first question. The other aspects of sexuality, the foundations of a queer community, then get turned into ""choices."" It's a choice to deviate from gender roles. Don't do that. It's a choice to act on your desires. You can choose to resist.   Embracing choice means rejecting the premise of these attacks on queer legitimacy. It's not always a practical line to take, but it's a line full of much more long-term rhetorical power than ""it's not a choice.""  .* It's a little more complicated when it comes to trans issues. ""Not a choice"" might be necessary in legitimating insurance companies and the government to provide trans inclusive healthcare, so I'm more inclined to think it's a politically necessary evil."

SRSDiscussion,32vbft,piyochama,35,Sat Jun 6 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"This is a complicated issue, and a lot of it depends on how you view social justice and politics in general.  Personally, I feel that not voting is the worst thing that you can do. The reality of American politics is that a lot of it just falls down to demographics. Who votes for who? Why are they voting that way? How can we target them?  My favorite issue to show how the system works is cannabis legalization. I realize you are looking past domestic borders here, but hang with me for a second. Theoretically, it should be a pretty obvious choice to any candidate that it's a good idea to support legalization. After all, the latest polls show that the majority of the population approves it! Yet, if you break down that majority, what you find is that while a majority support it, a voting majority does not.  If, for some reason, the demographics shifted and turnout was huge one year for younger voters, you can bet your ass cannabis reform would be THE issue. Now, while something like social justice or international politics aren't quite in the same bag, demographics matter there, too. I mean, let's be real, social justice, pacifism, human rights and the like all tend to be ideals that resonate with younger people. There's a reason why late cycle presidential debates are dominated by talk of social security and medicaid/medicare.  Personally, I live in a blue state, so I know my vote doesn't really matter. With that said, I vote anyway (usually third party), just so I'm counted for the hell of it.  But for those in swing states, it's also often a matter of pragmatism. You're totally right. Neither side offers an acceptable platform for human rights (here or otherwise). But often there is an option that causes marginally less harm than the other. Is that great? No. Is it enough? No. But sitting home and not voting, to me at least, does not convey a protest of that issue -- instead, it conveys apathy.  edit: I don't mean to come off like a pure utilitarian here, but pragmatism is becoming an increasingly larger part of my social justice beliefs on a practical level. American politics are slow. I dislike that, but if I want to see the world become a better place, I need to work with what I've got. Falling into a Zizek-hole isn't really useful if I want to reduce harm on a larger scale."

The Democratic Party is imperial because it is a party owned and run at the highest level by Wall Street. These capitalistic enterprises, which fund and thus select the policy of the party, rely on good hearted people of the left like you and me to do the hard work of organizing, but at the end of the day the marching orders come from on high.  It is the nature of a liberal, non workers party to act in the interest of the funders. Do the Dems rely on member dues or millionaire donations? Do they ask you to come to regular meetings or just pull the lever on Nov 4th? Do unions control policy or are they just another ""special interest group"" like the banks or arms manufacturers that had to compete for attention?   I am a member of a workers' party called Socialist Alternative. We have one city councilor in Seattle, Kshama Sawant who helped get a $15 minimum wage amongst other projects. We are fiercely anti imperialist because we recognize, as you do, that we shouldn't privilege the West over the 3rd world. We are more than just our ideas though - we organize in ways that specifically force us to be accountable to the needs of average workers. So we don't take corporate money and we organize nationally, not just locally here in Seattle. We are affiliated with an international anticapitalist organization, which means we fight struggles over the global for social and economic justice."

Here's where a lot of what I'll call ""unwavering leftists"" are unwilling to view the political reality to advance their political causes.

While I think there's certainly a valuable debate to be had about localism vs ""global"" ambitions, the notion that voting dem to prevent a conservative president is a ""no brainer"" is problematic to me on a number of levels.   Most simply, it's a kind of ""lesser of two evils"" logic that has been criticized extensively within critical theory (Arendt to Zizek) as a dominant mode of decision making in the West. The problem with the lesser of two evil arguments is that it's almost trivially true. Obviously Rand Paul collapsing the global economy would be a terrible consequence of an election--the problem is when you begin to frame it as a moral or ethical duty to prevent that disaster by voting for another candidate who is only going to continue murdering brown people all over the globe.  Of course, it's always a question of alternatives: what are you going to do ~radically~ if you won't even try to participate in our political system, which admittedly can do some good on a local level. For me personally, criticizing democracy is more about criticizing the attitudes that surround it rather than the mere act of voting itself. I'm not an accelerationist--In some ""rational"" sense, I'm obviously glad that we'll just have Hillary instead of some reactionary whackjob. Especially, when in the confines of a two party system, voting for the lesser of two evils just tends towards the ""least"" version of a repressive government, that is still willing to maintain genocidal imperial ambitions, just of a less explicit nature."

I'm not going to reproduce an entire criticism of pragmatism. You can read a good summary of one of the potential arguments here:    Indeed the principle of the ‘lesser evil’ has become so prominently identified with the ethico-political foundations of liberal capitalism (and its political system that we like to call democracy) and so firmly naturalized in common speech that it seem to have become the ‘new good’. Commenting upon the comparative merits of democracy shortly after the end of World War II, Winston Churchill may have inaugurated this trend when he sardonically noted that ‘it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time’. Since then, and increasingly since Soviet (and Third World) horrors began to be exposed a decade into the cold war, the projection of totalitarian horrors has been mobilized, beyond a frank concern for individual rights, to stop all search for a different form of politics. It was ultimately the mediated spectre of these atrocities that compelled the public to constantly weigh liberal disorder against the worse evils of totalitarian tyranny in favour of the former. In comparison to the horrors of totalitarianism, this inegalitarian and unjust regime was presented as a responsible ‘lesser evil’, ‘the best of all worlds possible’, and as a necessary barrier against regress to bloody dictatorships.1 This multifaceted political shift within the left was largely promoted by post-1968 western ‘radicals’ who switched the focus of their political engagement to criticizing left-totalitarian regimes across the second and third worlds, while arguing for the autonomy of civil society at home. The notions espoused by these largely French nouveaux philosophes—‘let’s hold on to what we have, because there is worse elsewhere’—demonstrated that for liberals ‘evil’ was always somewhere else, lurking behind any attempt at political transformation.2"

It made some interesting points:   it’s going to be Hillary Clinton or a Republican in 2016. It really breaks down to these two options:   Either get on board with Hillary Clinton, even if she’s not everything you’ve dreamed of. - or – Whine and cry because Elizabeth Warren isn’t going to run, become apathetic, then let Republicans win the White House in 2016; likely replace four Supreme Court Justices over the following 8 years; start a war with Iran; ruin the planet; destroy our economy again; and undo all the good that’s been done these last 6 years.

Now, this is not an analysis or an insight; it is a cliche, and a very tired one, and it often comes in the same package as the insistence that there is no difference between the candidates. You can reframe it, however, by saying: we get a choice, and not choosing at all can be tantamount in its consequences to choosing the greater of two evils.  But having marriage rights or discrimination protection or access to healthcare is not the lesser of two evils. If I vote for a Democrat, I do so in the hopes that fewer people will suffer, not in the belief that that option will eliminate suffering or bring us to anywhere near my goals or represent my values perfectly.

So if we cause something (like removing the top predator from a system) on our timescale, we mess with the ability off the ecosystem to respond to that change.   Deer hunting can actually be quite important ecologically in places where the top predator populations were so low. Instead of top-down control, instead you get a burst of deer overpopulation, a huge over-consumption of vegetation, followed by crashes in both populations as the vegetation gets too low and then deer starve to death.   Additionally, the ecosystems we understand in the US today? Have had people hunting in them for 10,000 years. The situation is a problem today because of habitat loss and periods of major over-hunting (again, esp. of predators), but that doesn't mean a well-managed and conservative hunting policy can't be part of a management plan from departments of natural resources.   None of that is particularly relevant to the topic of the OP, since big game trophy hunting has none of these ecological considerations, and African charismatic megafauna are probably much more likely to be threatened or endangered than white-tailed deer in the US or Canada."

By far the biggest issue here is poaching, either for food or organized crime selling rare animal parts for placebos in Asia.  Without commercial hunting and the money that brings in there's little incentive to breed, protect or assign space to wildlife.  This definitely has its downsides, but better than large scale extinction or population crashes.  For example, around 2003 the country's economic crisis caught up with cheetahs in Zimbabwe - there were no tourists (specifically hunters) to finance private game reserves, and land siezures by paramiltary groups.  The Zimbabwean population of cheetahs was extinct within a year.  I'm a vegetarian myself, I find big-money big-game hunting in Africa to be particularly tasteless and contemptible, but there's no realistic alternative to pay for wildlife breeding and preservation.  edit: to be clear, I'm from rural Zimbabwe and have met some of these tourists, and have also shot wild animals myself when there is a need - rabid jackals and such.

This happens where there are lots of animals and it's strictly based on season/off-season.  For big game hunting, the only animals they allow you to hunt are the ones who are sick, disrupting the other animals or got kicked out of the herd and would've died in the next few months. The permits to hunt animals like this cost a ton. Few people can afford them. When someone buys one all that money goes into preserving the species with all it's healthy individuals.   With the exception of poachers, hunters care about the animals they hunt and they actively try to support the animals. For example, sometimes invading species come from other parts that could destroy the fauna in that area. The hunters are the only ones who try to push the invaders back. Think of it this way. All the hunters (and I'm talking about the guys who have a permit and pay taxes, not scumbags) would kill about 1-3% of the population of a specific animal. The invading species would kill around 15-20% of that species and hurt people who raise cattle.    Hunters have learned how to live in harmony with animals. Other people haven't yet learned."

With the exception of poachers, hunters care about the animals they hunt and they actively try to support the animals.   That's a big problem though because they only care about that species and no others, or only the ones that support said species. Elk hunters are not happy to see wolves return to Yellowstone and other parts of the US Rockies as they are seen as competition. Wolves though are absolutely instrumental to maintenance of the biodiversity in said ecosystems.   Hunters have learned how to live in harmony with animals. Other people haven't yet learned.   Not really."
SRSDiscussion,32ssxc,thetristantomes,28,Thu Apr 16 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"The first part I know from experience in my country. It is one of the last countries that has wild Brown bears and wolves in Europe. A lot of people from France and Germany come here to hunt these animals and the hunter associations sell very few permits. Only the people with a lot of money manage to buy these permits. Sometimes eco groups make the news cause they want to save some sort of animal, but just listening to their leaders speakings makes you realise they know nothing about the bears or wolves. Thanks to the efforts of the Hunter association the Brown bear population is bigger that it ever was.   For the second paragraph. I haven't heard of cheap reservations where you can go and hunt the biggest wildest lion. Those things exist on a black market, but people are trying to put an end to them.   As for the third paragraph I haven't heard of hunters that only hunt a specific type of animal. That just seems stupid. When I wrote that part I was thinking of what is happening in a part of my country where jackals came from somewhere in the South and started decimating the local rabbit population and eating sheep. Jackals weren't seen on that territory for a long time and now they came back and don't have any predators and started multiplying. Without the culling done by the hunters they would've killed most of the rabbits in just a few years.   I've talked to a lot of hunters and with the exception of some assholes who were just bad people most of them cared about animals more than everyone I've ever seen. They hated when people tried to build stuff that could pollute the area and fought to keep the animals safe. They also support the local reservations as much as they can.   The people you talk about that don't like wolves coming back to the mountains are just dumb. I'm not familiar with the Yellowstone ecosystem, but I think that there aren't a lot of wolves to actually cause problems."
SRSDiscussion,32ssxc,vezokpiraka,5,Thu Apr 16 15:19:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying that a well-managed hunting system can reap rewards to local wildlife through local conservation and money being put back into the system. In some ways, it can be better than eco-tourism in the sense that fewer people are out there for only a defined period of time and are moving in such a way as to cause the least amount of disturbance.  I just think that there are significant problems that can crop up in a non-optimally managed system, and to me, your paragraph sounded like you were saying hunting in general was good.  I'm not sure about Europe, there are probably some good regulations which makes sure that hunting is beneficial to local wildlife (though I would hate to make a general statement that it is optimal everywhere in Europe especially since I lack the facts). But in other countries, the regulations aren't there, due to a lack of laws or lack or enforcement, and if they are, they could be non-optimal. Wrt lions, this documentary explained that Bighorn Sheep in the US could fetch up to 100,000 USD per permit to shoot but lion permits in Tanzania may only cost 50-60,000 USD per permit, meaning it's cheaper for an American to hunt an IUCN Vulnerable animal than a IUCN Least Concern, Lion and Bighorn respectively. Markhor go for about the same as lions (The video also mentions other problems with regards to trophy hunting wrt economics and distortions).   I also don't buy that trophy hunting is an effective ecological solution to invasive species. Firstly, a lot of invasive species, particularly the ones that are most destructive, are not exterminable by hunting (even in general) due to being plants, fungus, insects, or animals without any trophy value like Zebra Mussels or having such high populations like rabbits in Australia that any effective hunting solution would be prohibitively expensive. Secondly, native invasives will automatically respond to the ecological dynamics of the system. In your example of jackals and rabbits, if the jackals did severly reduce the population or rabbits, then the population of jackals would have also fallen, meaning the rabbit population would have rebounded again (see oscillatory predator-prey dynamics, e.g. lynx-hare), or the jackals would have found another food source, easing predation on the rabbits allowing the rabbit population to rebound (I also just have a general philosophical disagreement with the idea that there is any ideal population level. Ecology is dynamic and fluid and trying to come up with 'ideal' equilibriums is ultimately futile). Thirdly, hunting cannot replicate predation fully. Predation works to depress populations in two main ways: lethal and non-lethal effects. Lethal effects means what it means, killing the prey which hunters do. Non-lethal effects though are effects which come about due to fear or predation, including increased stress, less grazing/foraging, always being on the move, and delayed reproduction (see ecology of fear and non-lethal predation effects). These effects are just as important, if not more, in limiting prey population, but can only be achieved through the constant presence of the predator, which hunting does not and cannot replicate except if the hunter belongs to a nomadic hunter-gatherer society.  I am not saying that hunting is never the answer. I do believe it has a place in the effective management of species. I also do not believe that all hunters are anti-conservationists who solely care about their own particular species. Many of them do care about the status of the entire ecosystem. I do recognize though that hunting is a small part which when non-optimally managed can lead to pretty severe consequences for the conservation of a species and the ecosystem more broadly."

To most people in the U.S., the individual is sacred, and nothing should have any influence over an individual that said individual does not want or says is wrong.

SRSDiscussion,32ssxc,tilia-cordata,12,Thu Apr 16 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"I live in Minnesota, where hunting is a big part of the culture here, and I'm ecology grad student (who studies plants, but is interested in the whole thing.) So I know less about big game hunting abroad than I do about how things work here, but my thoughts are a bit complicated. TLDR: Hunting does have the potential to help conservation efforts by preserving whole ecosystems, but big game hunting in Africa isn't coming from that framework and is super associated with imperialism.  There are hunting organizations that are strong, strong supporters of local conservation efforts - examples are Ducks Unlimited and Pheasants Forever. One of the great things these organizations do is get hunters to help support conservation of the whole ecosystem - getting the idea into people's heads that you can't just protect individual species, you have to protect the whole habitat. Giving out a limited, ecologically sustainable hunting permits that help protect many acres of native habitat is awesome. I actually took a bow hunting class from the Department of Natural Resources (because I wanted to learn archery, we only ever shot at targets), and a lot of the women I was in the class with talked loving hunting for about spending time outside, how much they enjoy it even if they don't get anything, and especially how much of a family tradition it was.   However, there are lots and lots of people who exploit this system. At the state fair, the DNR and Fishing and Wildlife Commission have a ""wall-of-shame"" of people violating their permits, over-hunting, hunting out of season, or taking animals they're legally not allowed to take.   My biggest concern with trophy hunting (of Americans/Europeans going to Africa to kill big game animals) is that people don't have the connection or understanding of the ecology of the places they're hunting. I have a friend who studies vegetation/herbivore/predator relations in the Serengeti - it's quite complicated and not very well-understood. I suppose there are conservation-minded big game hunters, but that's not the impression I get as compared to local duck and deer hunters.   Big game hunting in Africa is also so strongly tied to imperialism it's really hard to see it as anything other than problematic, ecological and animal rights concerns aside."

I do know that when wolf populations are low, deer populations shoot up, which has pretty detrimental effects on the vegetation/overall ecosystem health. I think very very careful population monitoring and very conservative limits on tags/kills allowed could possibly let it be sustainable. I think trying to open a hunting season immediately after de-listing from the Endangered Species Act was a bad idea (I think a fair compromise might have been to permit people to kill wolves that attacked pets or livestock, but not an open hunting season.)   It's also weird to realize how political listing/de-listing an endangered species is - this is something that should be ecologically motivated, not driven by the desires of interest groups."

From the animal's point of view, it lived a life in the wild, and then a person killed it for food.  It's probably a better gig than being one of the billions of meat animals slaughtered in the United States every year.  The factors that offend people in this case are factors that provoke an emotional reaction in people but make no difference to the animal at all.  It's fine to use the emotional reaction to motivate positive action, and I acknowledge that the death of this giraffe could be more significant that way than the death of a billion chickens or a million cattle.  However, if you want to argue that what they did to that giraffe is ethically different from what we do on an industrial scale, I think you have to look past the aspects that got a rise out of you — the pleasure, the posing, the beauty of the oh-so-charismatic instance of megafauna — and point to consequences that aren't just in the eye of the beholder.  Otherwise, you're just chiding someone for taking an unpleasant and possibly shameful aspect of our culture out into the open.  Hiding a problem away is never the first step towards solving it, or else we wouldn't have hidden away our slaughter of animals in anonymous industrial-looking buildings scattered around the countryside, where the meat industry tries to keep out video cameras while animal-rights activists try to smuggle them in.  As a society and a species, if we manage to hide something away that offends our sensibilities, we tend not to give it a second thought, so enforcing hypocrisy about something (which I think is what this whole kerfuffle is about) is a way of avoiding dealing with it."

I think his point is that while these people may be suffering, someone who is dying of malaria and has no access to adequate health care or someone who is going hungry practically every day is suffering more. And it's really hard to argue with that. I'm grumpy when I get a late lunch or I get a headache, and I know that's temporary. For some people, their hunger and sickness becomes a part of their daily life.  I think Singer would be fine with you volunteering your time with the organizations you mentioned since you can do much more in person volunteering locally, but dollar for dollar, it's simply more effective and will help more people if you give your money to an organization like the Against Malaria Foundation."

Singer is objectively correct that money helps more people when applied to poor countries.   You're not wrong in allocating your money to causes of personal interest, but you need to recognise that your altruism is not optimised for efficiency. That while you effect positive change absolutely, you could effect more positive change with the same work and money if you applied it to malaria prevention, for example.   I think Singer's argument breaks down by refusing to acknowledge that humans are not perfect utilitarian machines. You put your energy and resources into causes you care about personally... Maybe you're queer or have queer friends, for example, so queer rights on are your radar.  It makes sense that you want to allocate your resources to that cause, and it's not wrong. But it is overall less effective at reducing suffering.   You don't need to change your allocation, you just need to own the fact that your altruism is ultimately dictated by your personal passion."

SRSDiscussion,32q032,piyochama,5,Thu Apr 16 00:52:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry to interject, but I think you might be unintentionally characterizing Singer's (and the EA movement's) points on superobligation.  Singer himself says that the purely optimal path of donating every single spare dollar and living in poverty is foolish because it fails to recognize the fact that people aren't perfect. If taking a vacation or consuming a few luxuries allows you to continue earning at your maximum capacity (thereby increasing future donations), then it's the right thing to do. This also applies to your charitable giving. Maybe AMF is the most efficient use of your money, but if it does nothing to motivate you or make you feel like a good person then you're far more likely to burn out and give nothing at all. The solution to this is to recognize the fact that you aren't perfect and instead donate as much as it takes to motivate you to whichever cause gives you the most satisfaction, and then donate the rest to the most efficient cause. Basically the point is to try to optimize these two separate goals separately, through different charities, rather than trying to do both at the same time (which will end up being sub-optimal on both fronts).   Also, Singer/EA's recognize that a highly demanding moral commitment is unlikely to appeal to many people, and that a larger number of people making smaller individual commitments will still have more impact overall. That's why organizations like Giving What We Can have people take pledges to donate 10%, since that's enough to make a large difference, but not so much that it would fundamental alter anyone's lifestyle. The more radical folks can keep giving away the majority of their income, but there's no reason to make that the public face of the movement."
SRSDiscussion,32q032,Shill4Shekels,2,Fri Apr 17 07:16:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but his metric is pretty flawed. If you base your donations on a single factor, that's fucking stupid. Any approach should be multivalent. What is strange is that his position values human lives equally to the detriment of other considerations. Many charities have indirect aims that do not necessarily save lives, but have structural, cultural or other long-lasting changes in mind. You can't build an objective hierarchy of bad things to attend to so shallowly.  For example: Let's say that studies show those who tell and enjoy rape jokes are 25% more likely to commit sexual assault. Perhaps they find a link between the ideas within these jokes and a subtle reinforcement of not-always-externalized misogyny. If you have a charity that aims to, through multiple channels, reduce the cultural currency of this humour, one might argue it is not saving lives. In the long run, however, it could indirectly lead to a reduction in sexual assaults by preventing the affirmative cultural attitudes towards it."
SRSDiscussion,32q032,Shill4Shekels,4,Thu Apr 16 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"In the end it's still accomplishing the same thing though, it just takes a more roundabout path to reducing human suffering. That makes it harder to measure, but you can still get some kind of an approximation that, if accurate, would allow you to compare it with, say, the Against Malaria Foundation.  Also, just a note, 'lives saved' isn't really the best metric to use when comparing interventions, and it's not what Effective Altruists go by when choosing charities. Saving someones life in an environment where the average lifespan is only 40 years obviously isn't as valuable as saving one where the average lifespan is 80. Likewise, saving someone who will live out the rest of their days in excruciating pain isn't as valuable as saving someone who will lead a happy life. These are just a couple of the many issues with 'lives saved', but it's also problematic because it's sort of impossible to measure.  Instead, organizations like Givewell use Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY's) which take all these factors into account and allow for more accurate comparisons."

With something like malaria there isn't the risk of dependency because treating the symptom actually treats the underlying cause. Any reduction in malaria prevalence is a step closer to eradication, which can happen withing a single generation. That criticism is valid for some food interventions, but in other cases it can be extremely effective at combating the underlying poverty because it allows children to reach their full economic potential without the burden of malnutrition."

I identify as a member of the Effective Altruism movement, so I thought I might pop in here and address a few misconceptions I've seen (I really enjoy discussing this in an a respectful environment where people don't immediately fall back on 'but muh objectivisms!').    I like the idea of Effective Altruism, but it should be concerned with 'X' issue since it would be higher impact. (Where 'X' is systematic change, global warming, scientific research, animal welfare, etc.)   All of these views are completely welcome in the EA movement, as long as they can reasonably be supported with evidence. As Effective Altruists, we try really hard to be cause neutral and evidence based, which means that if a new cause comes along that appears to be better than what we're doing now we'll drop everything and move to that.  The movement may appear to be focused on direct interventions in the third world, but that viewpoint tends to be over-represented in the public outreach that we do (mostly because we've found that this is the most intuitive and thus the most effective at convincing people). Withing the movement you'll find people arguing for and donating to pretty much any cause mentioned here, plus a ton more. The only standards are that you keep an open mind, use evidence to support your position and actively do as much as you can to contribute to the cause you select.    EA fails because it assumes all people are perfectly rational.   The EA movement has a lot of similarities with the rationalist movement, which is all about recognizing that humans are, in many ways, very irrational, and then trying to correct that. This attitude remains strong in EA, and you'll often find people discussing cognitive biases and how to avoid them.  EA's also recognize that no one is perfect, and that expecting perfect commitment or actions just turns people away. Instead there are different organizations that cater to people at most significant levels of commitment.  We also recognize that it's impossible to sustain a complete commitment to one ideal, and that trying to do so will lead to burnout and less overall good done. Even the most radical people earning-to-give accept that sometimes you need to spare some money for a luxury, just to keep yourself going. People who have chosen to donate 10% or similar don't run into this problem at all.  In a similar vein, if a local charity does more to motivate your giving than an effective international one does, then by all means give as much as it takes to the local one to keep yourself motivated. As long as you're honest with yourself and think about it as something you're doing for yourself rather than for the impact then there's no contradiction, just like buying food is fine because it allows you to continue earning money to donate."

It's interesting that these countries are buffeted by imperialist economic sanctions and wars against them and still make do so well in those conditions (Cuba, for example, is a very altruistic state within and without), especially in quality of life measures.

The reason he's an academic utilitarian isn't becuase he objectively assesses that this is the best way of maximising human preference, it's becuase he wants to be. If he genuinely considered that he had a moral obligation to maximise human preference, he's spend his spare time training to be an ob/gyn and travel around performing fistula repair operations. Or he'd be genetically engineering new strains of crop, or solving the logistics problems that are at the heart of famine. He's clearly intelligent enough to try his hand at these things, and on any objective analysis these would be a much bigger impact on human preference.  I'm not saying Peter Singer is a compromised moral agent becuase he doesn't do these things. But his moral theory kind of is.  Essentially, he's made the mistake all utilitarians do and assumed that the very useful tool of ""consequence analysis"" can stand in for an answer to the fundamental question of ethics; how should we live? Put in those stark terms it seems pretty plainly absurd, and yet here we are.  The better account of ethics is virtue ethics; our decisions should focus on making us the best moral agents we can be. Consequence analysis will be part of that, but only part.  What's kind of really weird about Singer is that this kind of straight-bat Aristotelian virtue theory approach had typified his work in the last few years. I just think he's in too deep as a preference utilitarian and can't bring himself to say ""oh, yeah, turns out much of my earlier work - while still useful - contains an incorrect assumption that needs to be corrected, here are the consequences of that.""

SRSDiscussion,32q032,TheEvilSloth,3,Fri Apr 17 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"Singer pretty much singlehandedly started the Effective Altruism movement, which has in turn influenced hundreds of millions of dollars of donations and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Compare that to the doctor who may cure or prevent a few hundred or maybe a thousand fistula cases, I'd say he made the correct ethical choice."
SRSDiscussion,32q032,Tidorith,2,Fri Apr 17 07:13:04 2015 UTC,"The reason he's an academic utilitarian isn't becuase he objectively assesses that this is the best way of maximising human preference, it's becuase he wants to be. If he genuinely considered that he had a moral obligation to maximise human preference, he's spend his spare time training to be an ob/gyn and travel around performing fistula repair operations. Or he'd be genetically engineering new strains of crop, or solving the logistics problems that are at the heart of famine. He's clearly intelligent enough to try his hand at these things, and on any objective analysis these would be a much bigger impact on human preference.   I wouldn't exactly say that. Part of preference utilitarianism is also the maximization of certain types of gifts - in Singer's case, it is more than evident that he has made the right sort of decision."
SRSDiscussion,32q032,TheEvilSloth,5,Thu Apr 16 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"No, maximisation of gifts is classic unmitigated virtue ethics. A preference utilitarian - the kind of serious hardcore preference utilitarianism Singer likes to throw at people - always balances the individual agent's preference in developing gifts in the preference calculus. So if I'm a brilliant ethicist and I throughly enjoy it, but I could be an above-average ob/gyn or geneticist and hate it, you still have to balance my detriment to preferences against society's benefit. On the kind of preference calculus analysis Singer routinely deploys against others - the kind he undertook in that very AMA - he's never going to be on a winner. Fred Hollows wasn't the world's most brilliant opthamologist. But his dedication meant he saved the sight of countless thousands of people, to say nothing of the foundation he set up. Tens of thousand's of people's preference for sight - a gift Singer clearly is intelligent enough to learn - seems to be a really big volume of preference to weigh against anything else Singer would prefer to do with his life.  Let me be really clear here; I think Singer has made the right choice. He's an intelligent and dedicated man who has made an important contribution to ethics. That's a good way to live.  What I'm saying is that - deployed as he uses it against others - his own ethical theory doesn't support his choice. That's not a problem with the choice, it's a problem with the theory."

SRSDiscussion,32q032,TheEvilSloth,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"No, I'm a virtue ethicist. My moral theory tell me me how to be good.  The problem for Singer is that he's set up a moral theory no-one will ever live up to. It defines the moral act as the act which maximises preference/utility (he squibs the question of which we should be maximising these days), without regard to practical limits.  Virtue ethics is about being good in practice. The Fronimos isn't a theoretical ideal against which we always fall short. It's the person who has lived and does live a virtuous life, within the bounds of practical reasonableness.  Singer explicitly rejects practical reasonableness, and with it any hope of a coherent or possible ethical theory. He does not think it is relevant that the practically reasonable actor might seek to maximise outcomes for his immediate family before maximising utility for a stranger. Singer argues - absurdly I suggest - that if we all just acted in a way that maximised utility generally we'd somehow solve all these problems. But that doesn't take account of the world we actually inhabit or the people who live in it. It's an ethics for a world that is theoretical, not real, so consequently fails the most basic test of ethics; are you answering the question ""how should we live""? Singer's not answering that question. Not really. Otherwise he'd be trying to live as his ideal suggests and he's patently not.  Let me take an example here. My daughter was born with a serious physical defect. It would have led to obvious and permanent deformity, which would have impacted her psycho-social development and her happiness in life regardless of however much I tried to compensate for it. Fortunately - thank God - there was a surgical cure. A complicated, expensive but safe and 100% effective surgical cure.  Singer tells us that my choice to spend a huge amount of money on that cure was ethically compromised. That I could have maximised utility by spending that money helping other people more in need. That helping my daughter in that circumstance was the wrong choice, ethically.  And that's absurd. Any parent at any time in the history of the world would have made the choice I did, because it was the right choice. Because my duty to my daughter outweighs other duties I have. Because being a good parent is central to my being a good person - more central than being a good philanthropist. The virtue of loyalty speaks as loudly as any other.  Singer is wrong because he's confused maximal utility/preference with ""good"". He's mistaken a very useful and necessary tool for ethical analysis as the only relevant consideration in ethics. Consequently he's forged an ethical theory that's not only useless in practice, it's also impossible to live up to and frequently wrong.  You misunderstand the core point of my criticism of Singer. I don't object that he is a hypocrite and therefore we should ignore his ethical theory. I object that his ethical theory is utterly divorced from reality and thus useless. That he doesn't live up to his ideal isn't the problem; that no-one could ever live up to it is symptomatic of the bigger problem with his reasoning."

Even Peter Singer explicitly says this and is not being misinterpreted, then I simply prescribe to a moral theory which is completely identical, except that it replaces the word ""the"" with ""the most"".

Preference and utility should not be understood to be two separate things, as someone's preference being met a positive contribution of utility.   As to virtue ethics, I don't believe they are in conflict with utilitarianism. I believe that utilitarianism defines and describes what the perfect world is, and what the perfect actions are. To that end, deontological systems are the best for running a society, and virtue ethics is the best code for any given person to live by.

Utilitarianism demands that you make your decisions based on the framework that - when taking into account that you do not have unlimited computation power, and that you do have your own biases - will lead to the best outcomes, on average.

SRSDiscussion,32q032,NiallHeartfire,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"So here's my take on this idea.  I agree with the idea of effective altruism; that people combining social and economic power to focus on the issues that will have the most impact is the best way to go.  However he seems to only be thinking in a narrow way about it, and ends up coming to an incorrect conclusion. His reasoning is that since money goes farther in poorer countries, that it's more economical to send more money to those countries.  I disagree with that sentiment strongly, and here's why:  A huge part of the reason many countries are poor and have so many humanitarian issues is greatly influence by the capitalistic activities of the United States. In the US we basically hold all the power, because we have so much of the world's resources concentrated here (25% for 5% of the world's populace).  So if we are to spend time and money for the greatest good, the most effective route would be to curb the influence of money on politics. Not only would this help free a lot of exploited countries around the world from the grasp of U.S. activity, but it would be the most effective way to really cure a lot of the internal social problems that plague the U.S.; many of which people in this board and other feminist circles are extremely passionate about.  If you doubt my reasoning please take some time to see how impactful the influence of money on political systems and power structures really is; I simply could not do it justice in this short space. All I can say is some examples of the logic path. Feminism cries out for the equal treatment of women in power structures, but since our economic is selfish and people prefer those who are more similar to them, this maintains the upper echelon of power in the hands of old white rich men. And since it is cheaper to simply modify the rules and legislations than actively change business activities, they influence the public and politics to vote in their favor. Curbing that practice will go a long way to fixing many feminist issues. You can also say the same with animal rights activits (animal breeding conditions, factory farms), environmentalists (massive oil spills and climate change denial). Even gender issues largely fall on economic impacts to LGBT folk (poverty, homelessness).  Until the economic issues and political motivation problems are solved, I feel any and all social action is blunted and ineffective due to just how slanted the current power structure is due to the influence of money."
SRSDiscussion,32q032,TheEvilSloth,0,Thu Apr 16 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"I fully endorse effective altruism.  Ethically speaking, however, all problems aren't equal. We'll fulfill the expectation that all people on Earth have access to clean running water by following a roughly linear technological timeline. In this case, it's not unethical to allocate funds to big cities before remote areas.  On the other hand, problems of injustice can't be tolerated for any amount of time in an ethical fashion. Oppressors actively oppress in the here and now. An ""effective altruism"" that quantifies levels of suffering under injustice is unethical and untenable."

SRSDiscussion,32q032,TheEvilSloth,0,Thu Apr 16 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"Well here you get into two problems. The first is the one my analytic philosopher friends like to throw at Singer, and it's a fair one; quantify that. Even before you get into difficult calculations like whether it is preferable to allocate money to victims of sexual slavery or women who need fistula repair (I think an excellent example of precisely the kind of intractable problem utilitarianism can't solve, but literally the example Singer chose to go after someone on...) solve even simple problems with it.  He claims a foetus' limited development means it's preference for life will never outweigh a mother's preference for an abortion. If I accept that model of reasoning, then why does a chicken's limited preference for life outweigh my preference for a chicken dinner?   I don't want to equivocate between the two moral claims; that would be absurd. My problem is that utilitarianism literally and by definition does so equivocate.  This leads me to the second problem, and it's the problem I - and every other virtue ethicist on the planet has with Singer - moral propositions are more complicated than causation focused consequentialist reasoning can grapple with. If you're not considering questions like ""how do we make each human a better moral agent"" in the answer to your questions, I don't even think you're really doing ethics. You're just applying abstract mathematical concepts to human interaction and calling it ethics. Fundamentally the question of ethics is one of how we ought to live. Consequentialist, utilitarian reasoning is a part of the answer to that question, sure. But to pretend it's the only way to answer that question is hopelessly naive."
SRSDiscussion,32q032,NiallHeartfire,3,Thu Apr 16 04:52:11 2015 UTC,"He claims a foetus' limited development means it's preference for life will never outweigh a mother's preference for an abortion. If I accept that model of reasoning, then why does a chicken's limited preference for life outweigh my preference for a chicken dinner?   Well those views are still consistent, considering a foetus (up until a certain stage) is not mentally developed enough to have preferences ' whereas an adult chicken does have that ability. Also In factory farming the chicken is suffering greatly and the chicken's preference to not suffer greatly arguably outweighs your preference for chicken, rather than some other meal. I Don't see that as absurd, if you accept maximising preferences as a goal, why is it absurd to start comparing values or the 'strength' of different preferences?  Sorry, but when you say;   'If you're not considering questions like ""how do we make each human a better moral agent"" in the answer to your questions, I don't even think you're really doing ethics. are you saying utilitarianism doesn't focus on encouraging people to be more ethical? Because it most surely does, or are you saying it doesn't encourage people to be better at studying and practicing ethics?   Which also brings me onto another point you made in a different comment.    If he genuinely considered that he had a moral obligation to maximise human preference, he's spend his spare time training to be an ob/gyn and travel around performing fistula repair operations.   I'm assuming that he thinks, as I do, that being a well known utilitarian philosopher, writing 40 books, and advocating utilitariansim ends up maximising utility more than being an obstetrician. As you can see he calls for more funding of these organisation and consequently more funding for obstetricians.  He also admits that he is a flawed moral agent, as all utilitarians are. It would be the logical conclusion for utilitarians to give all their money and time to maximise utility, whilst living in a sackcloth. However humans have their limits and sometimes don't fulfill their ethical obligations, especially if they're as demanding as utilitarianism. There's also the point that Singer makes, that if all utilitarians were complete aesthetics it may well put people off utilitarianism and not maximise utility."

Quantify that. This is central to the utilitarian's claim; that these problems can be solved in a like-for-like manner. Show me how you go about consistently and systematically comparing these things. This has been - since Mill - the central problem facing utilitarianism and as yet no-one has come close to offering a sensible solution. Utilitarians act as though they've solved ethics, yet when it comes to the most basic claim of their methodology - we can compare certain happinesses/pleasures/preferences/interests whatever - we've had no significant movement on the problem since the mid 19thC. Preference utilitarianism was yet another attempt to kick the comparative can down the road, and it too has failed. Your example, too, has gone down the same path; you've tried to 'maximise' the chicken's quantity and quality of suffering to force the moral issue. Singer specifically looks to avoid that comparison by taking the 'preference' route. Singer specifically avoids the problems with those 'quality of pleasure/pain' arguments by resting on the chicken's supposed 'preference' for life over death.  Ergo, Singer thinks me killing a happy, healthy, well cared for chicken quickly and as painlessly as possible is morally culpable because my preference is outweighed by the chicken's. I ask why, and on what basis do you make that claim?   I'm assuming that he thinks, as I do, that being a well known utilitarian philosopher, writing 40 books, and advocating utilitariansim ends up maximising utility more than being an obstetrician.   How tremendously convenient for him! It seems utterly remarkable that out of all of the infinite possible ways of living a human life and contributing to the great multitude of human preferences, Singer just so happens to be living the life that - for him - is the precise path to maximising sentient preference.  This is the problem; Singer's a smart guy. A really smart guy. A guy who could no doubt turn his prodigious intellect and capacity for hard work into huge successes in any field of human intellectual endeavour he turned his hand to. Sadly, I'm going to take rather a lot more convincing on the point that being an academic ethicist who asks for more funding for things is actually the best possible use of his undoubted talent - that him being an ethicist achieves the maximal acquisition of preference.  Again, this is not my position. I'm perfectly happy for him to be an ethicist, even if that doesn't maximise preference. I think he's a decent person and choosing to be an ethicist because he finds it enjoyable and fulfilling is a perfectly acceptable - even laudable choice. My ethical world view is perfectly consistent with Singer making a genuine attempt to live the best life he can while developing his unique talents, even if there might be some theoretically more maximal quantity of preference he could achieve. His ethical world view is not consistent with that. I think it follows that there's a problem with his ethical system."

Show me how you go about consistently and systematically comparing these things.   I'll just clarify now that, unlike Singer, I am in fact a hedonistic utilitarian and do focus on pain and pleasure, so I understand that version more. However your criticisms are relevant for both versions of utilitarianism, so I'll try to defend both.  You're right, I can't give a completely infallible way to quantify and compare these two preferences, but by using what we know about biology and psychology, I can assume that one is worse than the other. Calculating utility is difficult and imprecise to say the least, that doesn't mean the ethical theory is invalid and we cant try to compare these things. By going on what we know about humans who have experienced torture, and the experiences they have related to us, we can assume that torturing one person to reveal the  hiding place of a tasty chocolate bar does not maximise utility. Similarly we know how chickens dislike/try to avoid injuries and conditions prevalent in factory farming and we know how the preferences of humans, like the preference to have meat rather than vegetables, compare to other human preferences, by asking humans questions about their conscious preferences and analysing psychology. After understanding this, I think we can at least try and quantify these things.  There are also larger scenarios that preferences or pleasures and pains can be more easily weighed. Things like effective altruism, for instance and large social welfare programs. I think it's reasonable to conclude that channeling £10,000 into art's funding maximises utility less than £10,000 of poverty relief. Similarly £10,000 pounds given to stop malaria maximises more utility than £10,000 given to an orchestra.  Given our knowledge of human psychology and experience, I would say it is reasonable to quantify these things, even if we can't do it perfectly. Also it may be that with a greater understanding of biology and psychology, we will be able to more adequately quantify and compare these things in the future.   Utilitarians act as though they've solved ethics.   Sorry if you've encountered a lot of pompous utilitarians, I know there's a lot out there, but that seems like a little bit of a generalisation. It's just a normative ethical theory, like Virtue ethics, I just agree with it more than any other normative ethical theory, as I'm sure you do with Virtue ethics. I don't see how the value system of utilitarianism, is any less arbitrary or inconsistent than kantianism or Virtue ethics.    Ergo, Singer thinks me killing a happy, healthy, well cared for chicken quickly and as painlessly as possible is morally culpable because my preference is outweighed by the chicken's. I ask why, and on what basis do you make that claim?   I know this isn't central to your point, but Singer is mainly against factory farming, he would be fine with you eating an ethically sourced chicken (although he might have qualms about the sustainability of ethical meat production, with it's greater production of CO2 and Methane). But looking at what we know about human and animal biology/psychology I think it's fair to say A chicken suffering in intensive farming is not worth the preference of humans to eat meat.   How tremendously convenient for him!   Well it may well be convenient, but I think it's obvious that his way of life maximises utility. First of all, I believe he became a utilitarian towards the end of his education, so it might have been a bit difficult to switch specialisation and become a logistics manager for a charity or something. That and even if he did, a utilitarian would still think philosophers and bioethicists are necessary in a perfect world, especially ones that promote utilitarianism. Singer has championed many causes, most notably animal rights, where he has written, the often named 'bible of the animal rights movement', the book Animal Liberation. That book on it's own went a long way to encouraging many hundreds, if not thousands of people to join the animal rights movement and stop supporting factory farming. He has also debated and championed environmental causes and effective altruism to a similar extent. Singer even stood for election as green candidate in Australia at one point.  I would estimate that Singer has convinced at least a few hundred people to become effective altruists, if not more. If this is the case the money they have given would fund many more things than he himself could accomplish as an obstetrician or doctor in a poor area. That on top of the money he already gives himself, and the amount of people who are now more utilitarian because of his arguments easily justify him carrying on his work in it's current form."

I object to hedonistic utilitarianism on many other grounds that aren't important here, but your analysis of preference utilitarianism doesn't seem to accurate address the central claim; that it is the chicken's preference not it's experience of pain/pleasure that is at issue. That's the bit I accuse of absurdity in quantification.

And again, I'm sorry but there's just no way that's true. It is almost untrue by definition; of course there's something better he could be doing. To claim that Peter Singer - a legitimate giant of human intellect - couldn't come up with a better way to maximise human preference than running as a Greens candidate and convincing a few hundred people to donate more effectively seems patently incorrect. Bill Gates achieves more than that most mornings. Of all the possible work Singer could be doing, there seems to be a whole list of things that would better maximise sentient preferences.  Singer's own criteria sets him up to fail on this point. It's one of the biggest and most glaring inconsistencies in his philosophical framework.  Like seriously, if ""was a candidate for the Greens"" is the bar you need to hurdle to maximise sentient preference, then probably we can just call humanity a failed project."
SRSDiscussion,32q032,FeloniousMonk94,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:59:31 2015 UTC,"You're still deeply equivocating between hedonistic and preference utilitarianism.   Apologies if I'm not being clear, Peter Singer himself has said he's becoming more of a hedonistic utilitarian of late. But even so, I think that the preferences can be measured, relative to each species and on their own. I think it's justifiable to say a chicken's preference to be free of injury and severe distress is greater than a humans preference for chicken. We can see this by both the chicken's and a human's actions and by what we know of each of their psychologies.  Also, with factory farming it's generally more than 1 chicken because with most of the industry, the vast majority of male chicks are killed (but as we've discussed, a chicks ability to have preferences would be almost, if not completely negligible.) and a large amount die to disease, so when you eat a chicken you're contributing somewhat to the other deaths as well. Even then it doesn't have to be that your preference is smaller, although I and I believe Singer would believe it is. It would still be unjustifiable from a preference utilitarian ethic to eat factory farmed chicken, because it doesn't maximise utility compared to eating vegetables, which have no preferences to sacrifice anyway.   To claim that Peter Singer - a legitimate giant of human intellect - couldn't come up with a better way to maximise human preference than running as a Greens candidate and convincing a few hundred people to donate more effectively seems patently incorrect. Bill Gates achieves more than that most mornings.   Well even if Singer retired now and never bothered maximising utility again, that would make him a massive hypocrite, but it wouldn't invalidate the philosophy. The existence of bad christians, does not invalidate Christianity.  The very nature of utilitarianism, makes it too demanding for the vast majority of people to completely meet their obligations. Although it is not completely improbable for someone to very nearly meet those obligations.  But even then, I think Singer does very well, you mentioned Bill Gates. I know Gates is just one example that you could use, but Gates does good now, by donating huge amounts of  the money he's made and giving talks and encouraging philanthropy. This is a lot of what Singer does. Animal Liberation has sold over 500,000 copies, the royalties of which have all been donated to charity. And that's just the most popular of his 40 books. He must earn a sizable income from his academic jobs as well, and he lives relatively frugally for his income, giving the rest to Charity. He spends the rest of his time doing debates, giving talks, including answering AMAs.  I also think you're exaggerating his capabilities and how easy it is to do large amounts of good. Singer, whilst intelligent, is not the most charismatic of people. Even so he writes many convincing books and enters many debates. This is what he's good at, I can't imagine his skill set would be easily transferable to other areas. I don't know whether he has the skills for starting a multi-million pound business or organising logisitics for a charity, I doubt he would have a better chance of maximising utility that way, than what he already does. And even if he could, it would still be a gamble, he knows he can do a lot in the position he's already in, how can he be certain he'd do any better in any other situation? As Bill Gates knows, for every Fred Hollows there needs to be thousands of dollars of funding. Funding which Peter Singer is probably best suited to get using his current methods.    This is classic - classic - utilitarianism. Defend any of those claims.    100 people was a conservative estimate I gave, to avoid being called out as hyperbolic. I'd say it's actually much higher than that. As I've already said Animal Liberation sold 500,000 copies, The founder of PETA even said that the book, introduced her to the animal rights movement, including the friend who helped her get into it. Even though their methods are questionable, PETA have probably done more good than harm, and it certainly shows Singer's ability to convince as a writer.  He's done a TED Talk about Affective altruism too, seen by 1.1 million people. At the end he talks about somebody who saw a previous talk, who anonymously donated a kidney because of it. That at least shows he must be encouraging many people to give effectively.  I think it's safe to say His lifestyle, most probably does maximise preference utility."

Fred Hollows personally saved 10,000 people's sight, and he wasn't even a particularly brilliant ophthalmologist. That's a lot of human preference to weigh against an academic career.

SRSDiscussion,32oql2,EvilRethuglican,8,Wed Apr 15 14:20:03 2015 UTC,"Quick Google turned this up:   The results of three experiments supported the hypothesis that exposure to sexist humor increases tolerance of sex discrimination among people high in hostile sexism. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that for participants high in hostile sexism, exposure to sexist jokes led to greater tolerance of a sexist event in comparison to exposure to neutral jokes or nonhumorous sexist communications. The results of Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that the activation of a noncritical mindset presumed to be a natural byproduct of humorous communication is critical for sexist humor to increase tolerance of sex discrimination. When sexist jokes were interpreted in a serious, critical manner, either as a result of explicit instructions (Experiment 2) or contextual cues such as the group membership of the joke teller (Experiment 3), the effects of sexist humor were nullified among participants high in hostile sexism.   So at least in that study, sexist humor to an uncritical audience does increase tolerance of sexist events.  e: And this.   The results of two experiments supported the hypothesis that, for sexist men, exposure to sexist humor can promote the behavioral release of prejudice against women. Experiment 1 demonstrated that hostile sexism predicted the amount of money participants were willing to donate to a women's organization after reading sexist jokes but not after reading nonhumorous sexist statements or neutral jokes. Experiment 2 showed that hostile sexism predicted the amount of money participants cut from the budget of a women's organization relative to four other student organizations upon exposure to sexist comedy skits but not neutral comedy skits. A perceived local norm of approval of funding cuts for the women's organization mediated the relationship between hostile sexism and discrimination against the women's organization.   e. e: This paper does a literature review in its introduction."

SRSDiscussion,32oql2,PeopleDoNotThink,2,Fri Apr 17 01:22:47 2015 UTC,"On a somewhat general note, Critchley points out in ""On Humor: Thinking in Action"" ( a great book on comedy as social commentary) that humor basically does one of two things. Most humor falls into the category of reinforcing, or at least not questioning, established hierarchical realities/power structures. The other type of humor about society DOES call norms/structures/stereotypes into question, but that's not what you're asking. The jokes you refer to fall firmly into the first category - as they clearly fit within what is, unfortunately, still a racist, sexist, et al society on many levels.  Considering the history of comedy, one could consider minstrel shows as an old form of oppression-reinforcement, while something more recent like the 70s-80s ""but women amirite"" tropes then modern edgy humor fall into a similar category. Society... ain't it grand?"

But, onto your point: an ad hominem is ultimately about the character of a person. An ad hominem is not automatically a disqualifier in a discussion, particularly when the topic is the character of a person. It's very hard to say, ""the Food Babe is misleading its readers"" without also pointing out the various conflicting interests that Hari has (sponsorship deals spring to mind).  As a mod, no, I don't like comments that consist of nothing other than ""fuck you"". The ""fuck you"" part, however, is not the problem, it's the lack of discussion afterwards.

The opinions of racists, bigots, sexists and other general assholes aren't welcome on this site, and pointing out that someone holds shitty, shitty opinions is not the same as silencing.   My statement, ""TiA posters saying blatantly reactionary things are hoping to get a rise out of people, and have no interest in actual discussion"" isn't an ad hom or a conspiracy theory, it's a predictable pattern that bears itself out over and over again, formed from my experiences.

At face value, it's a male variant of feminism, fighting for equality and an abolishment of outmoded gender roles.  So the objection towards preventing people from posting on certain subs and also posting on SRS is still open, and so I must ask:  How do you decide who is a troll and who is simply seeking information? Is it so unreasonable to assume that a truly open-minded person would post on subs on both sides of a debate? Is the risk of allowing one troll in worth the risk of exiling one potential ally?"

I think the complaint isn't the use of ad hominem specifically but that assertions are made about the Food Babe's motivations and character which are then justified by attack her science (instead of actually backing up the specific character insinuations)."
SRSDiscussion,32hds5,BastDrop,21,Mon Apr 13 21:18:38 2015 UTC,"I don't really see how it's pseudoscientific, seeing as it makes no claims towards being a scientific article. The author is using her own qualifications to point out where Hari is using scientific-sounding jargon in order to present herself as an authority on food science, when she clearly is not.  The Gawker article focuses on Hari's conduct, and what she's done. It's an ad hominem inasmuch as it focuses on the fact that her conduct has been extremely suspect, to put it lightly. They're not ""attacking her science"" because Hari was never scientific to begin with. She was simply using the language of science, and scientific discourse, in order to masquerade as a scientific authority. Those are not assertions about her character: the entire article is doing a pretty standard argumentative pattern of ""make a point, back it up, summarize.""  For example, let's look at the section titled, ""Feel Better—Detox and Definitely Don't Vaccinate!"" and break it down.   Food Babe has written that, in order to deal with the flu, you should take vitamins, get sunshine, and "" encounter the flu naturally."" In other words, her advice is to get the flu, an infection that kills an average of 31,000 people annually.    Pretty basic opening. If we take the title of the section as the topic sentence, this is just a simple laying-out of what Hari's point is.   A PSA: Please remember that when you vaccinate, you help protect the people around you who cannot vaccinate. You protect people who are immunocompromised, who are going through cancer treatments, and who are on immunosupressants. If you catch the flu, you become a disease vector and can easily infect more people.    Counter-point, explaining why the presented point from Hari is illogical/irrelevant/just plain bad. Also that stuff about immunization is what I learnt in high school, so I'm not seeing any pseudoscience here, just... science.   ""I won't eat any of these ingredients or even put them on my body,"" Hari wrote of the components that make up the flu vaccine. ""However, the mainstream medical community, government agencies and pharmaceutical companies suggest that I directly inject these ingredients into my bloodstream? And I need do it every year until I die? Are you freaking kidding me?""   Point. Quote, in fact.   Nope! Not kidding. The flu is serious. To scare people into not taking every measure they can against a deadly disease mortifies me. Hari has denied that she's anti-vax, but all the reasons she has for avoiding the flu vaccine are ones anti-vaxxers hold near and dear to their hearts for letting their children suffer. Toxins. Aluminum. Mercury. The usual suspects.    Continued point. Comparison between her tactics and anti-vaxxer tactics, which again is completely valid given the topic at hand and the undeniable similarity.   But hey, the next time you're down with a bug, follow Hari's lead and detox your way out of it. Who doesn't want to lose a few pounds, feel better, and have more energy? Hari will help, for only $9/per bottle from her sponsor, Suja [...] But wait, didn't she say that the Pumpkin Spice Lattes had a toxic dose of sugar at fifty grams in a grande? So why does she endorse Suja when it has forty-two grams of sugar and even comes with a warning on its website that it's not suitable for diabetics?    Point by author, focusing on Hari's conflicts of interest in promoting this advice that directly benefits her via a sponsorship deal, plus bonus hypocrisy by comparing Hari's claim to her earlier statements.   It's probably because detox is complete bullshit. In order to buy into the premise that you need detoxing, you first have to be ""toxed."" The common enemies they claim that juice can clean out of your system are heavy metals and pesticides. The bullshit? Those don't cause allergies, acne, weight gain, or whatever symptom she's using to scare you into buying overpriced juice this week. [...] You're constantly ""detoxing"" just by living. Your kidneys and liver take care of cleaning out unnecessary things in the body fairly efficiently on their own. Proof? The toilet paper industry.    Author's hypothesis (supported by evidence given above), and continuing the theme of pointing out commercial interests in this ""objective"", ""scientific"" advice.  There's literally nothing out of the ordinary, with regards to rhetorical style, with the Gawker piece."
SRSDiscussion,32hds5,minimuminim,10,Mon Apr 13 21:34:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm kind of confused as to where the piece turns into a character attack. Most of it seemed like your average well researched piece.
SRSDiscussion,32hds5,BastDrop,-5,Tue Apr 14 07:25:59 2015 UTC,"I think maybe I wasn't clear enough about the part that bothers me. I came into this with no background having never heard of Hari or d'Entremont before reading the Gawker article.  What I find questionable, looking at the part you quote, isn't everything about flu. Obviously Hari is saying some incorrect things about vaccination. The problem is this:   But hey, the next time you're down with a bug, follow Hari's lead and detox your way out of it. Who doesn't want to lose a few pounds, feel better, and have more energy? Hari will help, for only $9/per bottle from her sponsor, Suja.   Of course she's advocating use of her sponsors product! That's why they sponsor you. It's like criticizing LeBron for advocating Nike over Adidas without a scientific study to back him up. I don't know, but if I had to guess how the sponsorship came about, Hari was writing about detoxing on her site and Suja came to her and said, hey we make this great detox product, we'll pay you to mention it. There's nothing wrong with that, and it's in no way misleading or nefarious.  Attacking Hari in this way is ad hominem, with no support, and surrounding the mention with a bunch of links about how detoxing isn't a real thing is intentionally deceptive rhetoric.  The other part that really bothered me was this:   With a background in genomics, Senapathy is a science writer and likewise an Indian American woman, but I'm sure it's a much more comforting narrative in the Food Babe Army to say that we're all just sexists and racists.    So just because an Indian American woman has a problem with Hari's science, none of the other criticisms come from a sexist position? That's an ""I have a black friend"" level argument. I seriously doubt the TiA types would have such a big problem with Hari if she were a man. That's not my opinion based on anything I know about this specific situation, which again is very little, but just based on their pattern of behavior. Which I think pretty much agrees with your original point about ad hominem to bring things full circle."
SRSDiscussion,32hds5,Intortoise,17,Mon Apr 13 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"Er... I think you miss the part where Hari, as the ""Food Babe"", paints herself as an authority on food, and she is using said authority in pretty messed-up, self-serving ways. It is misleading and nefarious to say that, ""hey, you need to detox, detoxing is this huge problem in our society, and by the way did I mention there's this company called Suja who makes detoxing drinks? Oh and never mind the sugar content of their product, despite my earlier claim that 50g of sugar is toxic!"" She's using her position and her power in order to create the market for this product. She is part of the movement that invents this anxiety over diet, and she profits off of this. Whether or not she is as cunning as described, that's the consequence of her behaviour.  Even if it's an ad hom to point out this conflict of interest and the manipulative way she is using her position, it's still a completely valid criticism of her and her company.  Here's the other part: cries of racism and sexism can, and are, used to shut down arguments. Notice that none of the arguments put forth by the Gawker article have anything to do with Hari herself, nothing to do with her status as an Indian American woman. The problem lies in how Hari hides behind her status as a minority in order to discredit all criticism. That's what's happening here, not that she's some kind of WoC who needs defending from racists and sexists.   There are no ""TiA types"" in this discussion because this discussion has absolutely nothing to do with reddit, that subreddit, or any such strain of virulent anti-social justice thought. Your comparison makes no sense. I would strongly advise you read up on this matter, and at least investigate some of the links in the Gawker article in the OP."

I promise I'm not - I'd consider myself a pretty hardcore feminist.  It's not something I've really noted on SRS or SRSD, but more IRL. One place I do deviate from the social justice movement is in the area of self-diagnosis, for example. If you'll hear me - while getting a proper diagnosis is hard and expensive, and often can't be done, it's still an important step. Even trained doctors are advised not to diagnose themselves, because you tend to lose the nuances of the diagnostic process and succumb to your own biases about yourself (hypochondria, etc.); so, I tend to squint when people can get to a doctor's office with some ease (not that this applies to most people, including myself and most of my friends).  I brought this up because it's an example of something a lot of people don't want to hear - especially in leftist circles. When it comes up, and people ask me what I think, I - not too brightly - tell them what I think. That immediately sparks a discussion; in my own experience, a lot of the times it's led people to tell me to shut up, because it suddenly became a sensitive topic to them - though they were discussing it of their own volition just half an hour before.  In my experience, people don't like to lose control of conversations - hence, they use rhetoric to stop the conversation before anything productive can come out of the discussion.  Also, it's one thing to stop a conversation because you're seriously uncomfortable with the content; I get the feeling, though, that a lot of the time people are trying to put an end to the conversation because they don't want anyone to upset their worldview (not that I could effectively, but still).

A lot of people in these movements and on these subs aren't necessarily hateful; they're just young or new to this type of discussion or swayed by one argument or another, and treating them like a human being (tone argument aside) seems to result in a lot of ""thanks, I never thought of it that way"" comments which seem sincere.

I guess an apt analogy to your vegetarian idea is if the person ultimately agrees with not eating meat, but regularly states current vegetarians are making faulty arguments and policies for doing so. There's more than one way to skin a cat. The main problem is that these anti-feminists are often more hostile than the feminists they claim are. They have fanbases consisting of a host of reactionary and conservatives who have no interest in skinning the cat at all.

Liberalism is mostly center or center left, with many referring to progressive liberalism when they talk about liberals being on the left.   With regard to conservatism, yes, that is a right wing ideology, though history has shown it can pop up in extreme leftist ideology. But for the most part this is correct.  Now for libertarianism. Libertarianism is pretty much like liberalism, and is more specifically another term for classical liberalism. Classical liberalism reflects a free market with liberty for people to do as they please. This is reflected by the libertarian party in America, which has been taken by social conservatives.  So essentially, libertarianism is in theory center left like liberalism, because it pretty much is liberalism. But in practice, libertarianism has been associated with social conservatives like in the Tea party movement. General liberalism on the other hand has been taken by progressives who want government to ensure social and economic policy reform to ensure equality. This is what conservative critics are referring to when they say ""liberals are doing x wrong"".  U.S. politics man..."
SRSDiscussion,323a5q,Lobrian011235,2,Wed Apr 15 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"Classical liberalism reflects a free market with liberty for people to do as they please.   Yeah exactly, right-wing. The republican, democratic, and libertarian parties all believe in a free market where there means of production is privately owned.   Left-wing refers to anti-capitalistic ideologies and parties."
SRSDiscussion,323a5q,Yrale,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:21:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, capitalism is rather status quo. However it's important to know that in classical liberalism's context, advocates of it were living in societies with monarchies and authoritarian leaders, very right wing concepts. The idea that individuals should pursue their own economic and personal opportunity was a very radical shift from traditional adherence to monarchies. So in this case, true capitalism was more of a center concept.  Due to this and other factors, I think we should still consider libertarianism and classical liberalism at least center if not center left because they counter several elements of the right. The right argues for a status quo and authoritarianism. Classical liberalism still emphasizes liberalism, and private ownership does go against traditional right wing ideas. The right argues for a large army with an interventionist policy, while libertarianism looks to as minimal a government as possible while still having a republic that can meet the common needs of justice. Now again, in the U.S. social conservatives have sort have changed libertarianism, but this general idea of minimal government and non-overreaching foreign policy still applies.  Finally, remember that classical liberalism still does have some similarities with its cousin progressive liberalism. It still argues that people do as they please, and the government stays out of people's lives, even if modern social conservatives have changed that in America's case. Overall, with a global and history-conscious perspective, libertarianism appears more to be center than right wing."

SRSDiscussion,320cbz,jfpbookworm,42,Thu Apr 9 15:46:38 2015 UTC,"Well, so disliking ""ghetto people"" isn't just racist, it's classist. Who lives in ""ghettoes""? Poor people, black as well as white. Class and race are so tired up in American culture that prejudice can express itself in interesting ways, hence a person can like Africans, 'educated blacks,' etc. but dislike ""ghetto people."" In his/her mind, he/she 'likes' an 'educated' black person just like he/she 'likes' a white person. But many race theories question this--does she/he truly treat an 'educated' black person the same, or is does the black person find her/himself othered? Is the 'educated' black person treated as an exception to the rule?  Franz Fanon explains it much better than I (from Black Skin, White Masks, 1952) (pg 116):   [here Fanon is imitating and commenting on the statements of his white colleagues:] ""Oh, I want you to meet my black friend... Aimé Césaire [one of Fanon's teachers/contemporaries], a black man and a university graduate...""  Shame. Shame and self-contempt. Nausea. When people like me, they tell me it is in spite of my color. When they dislike me, they point out that it is not because of my color. Either way, I am locked into the infernal circle.    On a somewhat related note, I must add that I agree with some of the voices in the linked thread--I don't think calling OP racist (or classist) is particularly useful or accurate. Disliking the ghetto is the emotional reality by which the racist system works. It is how one deals with the ""ghetto"" construct that defines one morally: if you conclude the ghetto is bad because of black people, that's racist. If you conclude the ghetto is bad because of the white system and that that system needs to change? Suddenly, you're an activist."

It's a similar thing with this ghetto culture business: as long as you talk, walk, and dress like white people, you can be accepted.

The comments on the video where the black guy had his children showered with broken glass because he couldn't follow urgently barked, contradictory instructions instantaneously were disgustingly racist even on mainstream news sites, and there's seemingly no bar for behavior other than being completely sycophantic and acting 100% optimally that won't have people celebrating the death of any old black person killed even under unambiguously abusive circumstances.

Here's some practical ideas, which should hopefully yield concrete results.   1) Become aware of language-use I. Who interrupts who in meetings? What can you do to help facilitate everyone's voices being heard? ""Sorry David, this sounds really interesting - can I just double-check, it looked like Melissa was about to say something."" Use your privilege to benefit those who systematically get silenced in work-environments.   Employees feeling safe and confident to come forward with ideas and input are happier, more productive, and work better together. You can be pivotal in creating that respectful, aware, equal environment.   2) Become aware of language-use II. How are emails/literature/marketing constructed? What pronouns are used, what pronouns are NOT used? Who is included in the emails? Who is excluded? Is this based purely on merit/position? Is there language being used which might exclude some people on the email list? In-jokes being repeated unnecessarily to reinforce exclusivity?   3) Become aware of images used. Obviously depends on your place of work. Are images in your literature/marketing representative? Do you include pictures of marginalized people? Are you choosing stock-images which can help foster a sense of inclusivity? Make sure the default is not straight, white man.   4) Think about where major decisions are made. Are they made in spaces where marginalized voices are less likely to be present? A hotel bar? A late-night event? Think about how these decisions can be brought back into the work place, during work hours, where all relevant voices can contribute and have agency in the running of the business.  5) Ask your employees. Have an anonymous method of people leaving complaints/suggestions for improvements over equal opportunities in the work place. There might be issues you haven't even considered, like there being no gender-neutral bathroom for example, which actually could make a huge difference to people's lives. Encourage your employees to be open about their vision for their work environment.   6) Lead by example. Talk to your friends and ask them their experiences. Read, read, read up about everyday sexism experienced in the work-place, and try to either rectify or pre-empt similar issues in your own sphere. Encourage respectful behaviour and language about colleagues. If you're not sure about a specific issue, seek advice. Acknowledge your own uncertainty in a situation. You don't have to have all the answers, but if you deliberately and consciously try to establish a better environment then your employees will follow. You have the opportunity to set the tone, and you can make it very clear what you expect from the people around you.   Good luck. I think it's amazing that you're actively seeking advice and input.

Taking care to ensure that you don't talk over women won't change the fact that they're systematically paid less than men for the same amount of labour.

I will say in my own personal experience women seem to interrupt far less often in any situation than men and the part about them sitting in the back/off to the side is really noticeable once you start looking for it.

Whether we like it or not, people who don't agree with us (at all, or only partly) are watching. That has to be taken account, I feel, when our actions can antagonize them and have repercussions for the marginalized people that the 'watchers' come into contact.

Historically, progress has required careful strategy and unsatisfying compromises.  There were other Rosa Parkses before Rosa Parks, but she was chosen because she was squeaky clean.  The civil rights movement didn't stick up for the other Rosa Parkses because they were waiting for someone they could use effectively.  Was it ""right"" to pass over less marketable people and put all their support behind the most politically advantageous person?  It's obvious what the answer is if you judge by results, but the answer is different if you look at each case in isolation.  Everybody is equally as deserving as everybody else no matter how politically useful they are.  For most of us, we get to have our cake and eat it too, because nobody cares what we say unless we're saying it to them.  We can vent in one context and speak effectively in another without worrying about the inconsistency.  It's only people and organizations in the public eye who have to make careful use of the attention they work so hard to earn.  I have no problem prioritizing effectiveness in my speech among people I want to influence because I know I have plenty of private opportunities to say what I really feel."

For external balance, take an organization like EverydayFeminism, which has gone through lots of growing pains as they seem to be striving to appeal to a mass audience without losing their radical base.

For    2) there is greater attrition among black and Hispanic students.   I also think that we shouldn't be just helping disadvantaged students get in but also stay in. I agree supporting them post-graduation (as mentioned) as well as having tutoring programs in college to support those students.   As for Asians and AA, I fully support AA but also think that Asians are discriminated to a degree (like being stereotyped as ""smart, but no personality"" or ""studies all day."") I'll link a study later if I can find it.  However, you do bring up a good point that many Asians are a model minority and do enjoy some benefits, like having a higher income than many Blacks and Hispanics.

Part of the problem is that people don't understand how AA works or why it exists, so education would be goal #1. Another aspect is to continue, as universities are already doing, to account for other factors, like subgroups of Asians that are terribly underrepresented or whites from rural areas. I know my university does this; it's just not very well publicized. Moreover, I think, as a lot of people have brought up, people don't recognize the impact of legacy admissions (and interestingly, people don't usually accuse people from fancy private schools for getting in based on legacy). And I think this isn't exactly part of AA, but it should be done everywhere, that schools should support students after they get admitted. The idea is that AA candidates might not have had the circumstances to shine as brightly as non-AA peers, but they are just as qualified. They also face stereotype threat. There are a number of universities that try to address this problem. I know my alma mater has one for black students and one for Hispanic students that is doing a pretty good job, and then in the original post, I linked an article of a program at a public university in Texas."

I think a blanket/simplistic affirmative action policy that only looks at race as a broad category can hurt some Asian communities - I live in a city with a large population of recent Hmong immigrants, for example. Affirmative action in this case probably needs to be more holistic and take into account recency of immigration, of income and parent's educational status, of language spoken at home, etc on top of just the broad strokes ""race"" category.   The single biggest policy that I think is hurting people like you, and poor white students not affected by AA policies, is legacy admissions (or affirmative action for rich white people). I went to an Ivy League school and I knew kids who absolutely would not have gotten in, or should not have gotten in, except for who their parents were. On the one hand I get that it's a political/financial motivator (the school wants to keep big donors happy, so they keep having a pool of money for scholarships for everyone else), but that's the policy that's screwing you over, not Affirmative Action.

I believe they should be gotten rid of, but honestly I don't think it will happen anytime soon. Those top colleges want the money, and I don't know I'd they are willing to overturn it.

China is home to several dozen minority groups, and I would think that the Uighur don't have the same experience as the Han Chinese.

Race itself - the way we use it for college -  is a construct. People who are part hispanic, or part native american are lumped together in a category that might not fully reflect them. We make the assumption that people who are hispanic are disadvantaged, but there are those who aren't - those who are of partially other races, whose families are settled into society, who don't appear to be of that race, for example. I am all for taking into account the struggles of a hispanic family thats new to the US in college decisions, but I don't think that every hispanic faces the same struggle. When we assume that all minorities are disadvantaged like that, we perpetuate the myth that every member of that race is like that. The people benefiting from AA aren't the people its targeted to. Even if the goal is representation, I don't think thats improving. I think this is especially prevalent in those who claim to be Native American - having a grandmother who was Cherokee is entirely different to growing up on a reservation. I'm not sure if I explained my ideas coherently, but hopefully that makes sense.  As for the Asian thing, the other stereotype that bothers me is the notion that we are cheap by choice, and can afford college. I can't go to college without financial aid.

So black and hispanic students are en masse being forced into the humanities (at a rate much higher than white students)  The article you linked talks about UT Austin. The average sat score for a black student there is 1073 and for a white student is 1275. No amount of support in college is going to close that gap.

Ask them questions about their responses. Why does it matter that it's the internet? Why not care about people's feelings?

SRSDiscussion,31mwp1,gavinbrindstar,16,Tue Apr 7 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"Recently I saw a post on AMR which made fun of post wherein people took quotes from Tumblr and replaces ""men"" with ""Jews"" and ""women"" with ""Aryans"" and pointed out that the resulting quotes sounded very Nazi-like. Were the MRA's unfairly characterising mainstream feminism with these quotes? Yes absolutely. But that wasn't the response in AMR. Instead the commenters defended the quotes, claiming that it showed nothing. I'm sorry, but if someone says something about a demographic and that claim is something you could imagine Hitler levelling against the Jewish population, then that is not a nice thing to say and those who say it are bad people. I found it really weird that people who were usually really level-headed on topics like these were defending clearly wrong people just because of who else was criticising them. I don't know if MRA's genuinely advocate for genocide/caste systems like these Tumblr posts, but even if they did then pointing out the hypocrisy would be a valid argument, but surely not defending the posts?   I'll say the same things we said in AMR.   Turns out replacing the words in a sentence changes the meaning. If you replace the words ""eggs,"" ""flour,"" and ""butter"" with the words ""puppies,"" ""kittens,"" and ""cute children,"" a cake recipe looks a lot worse.   The original sentences deserved defending. There was nothing controversial there, it was basically 101-level feminist criticism."

I lurk on reddit, tumblr, twitter, etc. and there have been plenty of posts similar to the ones in that album that were not made satirically. That dismissive attitude is exactly what OP is talking about.  Just because the people posting extreme, violent, malicious comments happen to agree with us on social justice issues doesn't mean they get a free pass to say whatever terrible thing they want. Whether 4chan made it up originally or not, I've seen the ""kill all men"" comments made by what are clearly not satirical blogs on more than one occasion.

SRSDiscussion,31mwp1,Koeida,3,Tue Apr 7 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"Right but that misses the point. If you change all the significant words in a sentence then yes the meaning obviously changes, The point was that these horrible sentences were changed only in the demographic referred to. The negative traits ascribed/actions recommended were identical.   The same happens in the kitchen recipe example: you're only changing the subject of the sentence. Changing the subject of a sentence can easily transform the entire sentence, not just make something look racist.   ""Grind the pepper until left with a fine powder and sprinkle over your guests dinner."" If I replace pepper with bones, the resulting sentence is despicable, but that doesn't mean the one before was.   Changing the subject of a political statement works exactly the same way on this level: it doesn't serve as an indicator that a statement is wrong or bad. It only reveals rhetorical similarities, which of course can and should be analyzed and criticized. But it's not an argument, ever. The argument is your analysis and conclusion on what those rhetorical similarities are and effect.   Let's actually analyze some of the examples you give bellow: ""Let's hope for a jew free 1942."" There are two different type of statements which this could be derived from: ""Let's hope for an MRA free 2015"" and ""Let's hope for a white free 2015"". The first statement is characterized mainly by its difference, because MRA's are not a demographic, they're a movement that could simply dissipate. The second is different from the Hitlerified version based on demographics: it's the majority group, everyone ""understands"" that this is not literally the intent to ""kill all white men"". There's too many to actually take that statement seriously, the actual extreme interpretation would be a desire or intent to decimate white people, rather than annihilate white people. Result: there is a difference in the rhetoric here.   On to the next one: ""Kill yourself Jew, the world would benefit from it"". No matter with what I replace Jew with, the message stays the same: an individual of a group should kill themselves for being a part of that group. Even though the clear antisemitic component aggravates the issue, the rhetoric employed is exactly the same and whoever says something like ""kill yourself MRA, the world would benefit from it"" unironically needs to seriously reevaluate their worldview.   TL:DR; I neither need to defend nor vilify the authors of the initial statement to point out that replacing the subject with something else and thinking it speaks for itself is bullshit."

If there's one thing teenagers reallllllly don't understand until they get older, it's how fucking stupid they act. I don't mean that in a condescending or insulting way, as I can assure you that everyone who is not under the age of, let's say, 25, is over the age of 25. That means we've been there, in our adolescence, and we can all attest to the fact, through personal experience, that teenagers are idiots. That's the key - we sometimes dismiss you out of personal experience. That doesn't make it age-ism, it makes it shitty. It's not offensive, it's rude and disrespectful. And in all the ways it's inappropriate, describing it as 'age-ism' makes it laughable. If you ever need an example of what it feels like to victimize yourself, it's what you're doing. You will rarely get a clear experience of self-victimization, as people won't be able to call it when they see it, and if they do call it, it won't be from someone you trust.

Your claim that pointing this out is ""self victimization"" is also the result of ageist prejudice.  One shitty generalization is not, in itself, oppression, but it is a microagression, and thus is a part of oppression.  Unless you are arguing that teens are not oppressed, in which case I would have to assume you have never been a teen whose medical needs went against their parents' beliefs, or in any other situation where a teen's lack of legal autonomy became relevant.  Your experience of being a teen is not everyone's experience of being a teen.  Your experience of being a teen has made you an ageist person, and you universalize it, and it makes you really annoying to read as someone whose very different experience of being a teen led to them being an advocate of young people's rights and increased medical autonomy."

Some people get so caught up adding every single group to the oppression train that was wrought by the affluent sawcsm between the ages of what 21/25?-45/50? I agree that there is some sort of 3 dimensional spectrum of privilege and oppression in which all people fall, but there is a line between discussing theory and discussing people's actions in a practical manner.  One shouldn't have to answer to the social justice morality police for what was no worse than a poorly considered off-hand remark about teenagers. For a movement that analyzes the fuck out of words and their effects, some people in it have a strange detachment to the weight of giving every little remark an 'ism,' making every mistake an aggression, and everyone who says something off-hand an oppressor. It's absurd because most people do care about not causing harm or being a part of the problem. I'm not saying that means you should tip-toe around someone's feelings when they say something offensive, but if you call someone out, you should to be aware of context. You should accept their perspective, the one in which they make mistakes without being immoral, as a valid reality.   As technically accurate as calling it a micro aggression in a system of oppression may be, it moralizes the action. 100% of the time, 'ism' moralizes the infraction. Regardless of how positive or negative their reaction to that may be, the situation has become about morality. Because of the context different 'isms' have in our society, the morality is inescapable. Just because the ideal society responds to social justice theory without feeling their actions are being moralized, it doesn't mean people should have to adjust to your ideal reality. The endless moralizing is what makes social justice a joke, and I will always stand to rectify that.  And to be clear, I'm aware my experience of being a teen is not everyone's experience of being a teen. I definitely wasn't universalizing my entire experience. I will, however, universalize the parts of my experience I have found to be universal. And I can say with certainty, learning is an intrinsic part of growing up. Humans do the majority of their learning between the ages of 0 and 25. The primary system through which humans learn is through making mistakes. The ages of 11 to 15/20, are what is known as the ""formal operational stage"" in developmental psychology. True, not everyone in the world reaches or utilizes this stage of development, but as far as universal experiences go, it's only beaten out by things like birth or death.   This is the period in which abstract thought, systematic problem-solving, and metacognition emerge. Metacognition, the ability to think about thinking, is a critical development in completing our theory of mind, which in turn aids us in understanding other people. Like most things, developing the acuity of your metacognition and theory of mind requires practice - learning. Therefore, it can be said with certainty that teenagers, being in the process of this learning, make numerous mistakes. They also only recently developed the ability to learn in a systematic way, using hypotheticals to establish a methodological approach to problem-solving. If a teenager were to act upon conclusions drawn from an incomplete theory of mind, with an ability to problem-solve limited by inexperience, it is safe to say they would be acting without a complex understanding of their actions. In my own words, regardless of whether or not they achieve a satisfactory end, they would be acting like idiots. Given the shear volume of learning there is to do regarding human interaction and social justice, and the multitude of mistakes there are to make, it follows that anyone first being introduced to the subject, especially someone with limited social experiences (such as a teenager), is gonna fuck up. A lot.   My experience of teenagers being idiots, doing dumb shit, having crappy opinions, and being all around walking mistake factories is fucking universal. Someone being aware that teenagers are likely to do that is not age-ism. Your attempt to moralize my experience makes you really annoying to read as someone whose very different experience of being a teen led them to being as attentive and concerned about the human ties that bind as the experiences that divide."

Still ageism.  Still uncalled for.  And you talk like I'm the first person in the world to bring it up this way.   Just give this nice article a read, kay?  It isn't very long, and the distinct aftertaste of crow you'll get after you finish reading it isn't too terrible.   Yes. Is it ageism? Nooooooooooooo.   Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees.  It is.  And you just committed ageism too.  We can do this all daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.   I don't mean that in a condescending or insulting way, as I can assure you that everyone who is not under the age of, let's say, 25, is over the age of 25. That means we've been there, in our adolescence, and we can all attest to the fact that teenagers are idiots through personal experience. That's the key - we sometimes dismiss you out of personal experience.   That is an assessment you make on yourself.  It's condescending as fuck when you do it to other people.  Let them grow up and figure out that their own decisions were stupid in the context of their own life at that point.  It's not a judgement for you to make.  I guarantee there are teenagers out there that don't have your life experience, that would outright embarrass you (specifically you) with their maturity and command of social issues.

I'm not even a difficult person to out-class, believe it or not.  The problem is, however, you keep disregarding context in favor of some undefined individual. Are there realllllllly smart kids? Sure are. Are kids, by and large, relatively bad decision makers? Yes. Does one kid who happens to be a realllllllly good decision maker negate that generalization? No. Is the generalization accurate? Yes.  Is the OP's generalization accurate? I don't know. Does an example of a realllllllly smart teenager negate his generalization? No. Not at all. They shouldn't have made it, but focusing on some undefined individual in no way addresses the validity of the generalization. The 'bad' thing about the OP's generalization is that it may be a seriously misinformed assumption about the people who are making the majority of misinformed comments. It is based in a commonly held belief that teenagers, as a group, make a shit ton of mistakes when approaching complex subjects. That is not a poor belief to hold. In fact, it is backed up by a nearly universally shared experience called growing the fuck up and learning things. Mistakes are vital to both growing up and learning things. You do most of the learning we're talking about while you're a teenager. So....  I'm not going to say age-ism against youth isn't a problem in some cases. I imagine the difficulties emancipated youth, as one quick example, face providing for themselves against overwhelming odds. I imagine age-based discrimination is a problem there. What you're talking about is not that. It's not even related to that.  Hell, you wouldn't want us to treat teenagers like real people. You know, there's an age where you're not allowed to fuck up anymore. You get fired, you get kicked out, you become unemployable, you ruin your potential when you fuck up after a certain age. If adults treated the mistakes of teenagers like real mistakes, ya'll would be fucked.  Yea, there's gonna be some baggage on the teenager's end about, ""UGH, it's so unfair that you don't think of me as a real person,"" but it's a tricky fucking thing to balance. The truth is, teenagers aren't real people while also being REAL FUCKING PEOPLE. So this shit about, ""Oh, the OP's making a generalization about teenagers,"" is just so fucking inconsequential in the scope of how adults have to interact with teenagers that it is a joke.   You occupy a complex place in society with serious issues around how you're treated. A poor generalization based on the belief that teenagers make a shit ton of mistakes is not the age-ism you're looking for. It's just context, dude. It's like how white dudes shouldn't complain about reverse racism. It's just context!"

Similarly, most teenagers (especially young teenagers in the 14-16 year old range) do not have the same level of critical thinking skills as compared to their older counter-parts. Obviously, there are plenty of teenagers who are far more aware of social issues than your average adult, but I don't think it's ageist to generalize that most 15 year olds on Tumblr posting about very complex social issues might get some things wrong occasionally. There's nothing inherently wrong with that either, for what it's worth, as I'd much rather have young people caring enough about these issues to at least try and advocate for them than to ignore them or pretend they don't exist, but to claim that it's ageist to suggest they might be saying toxic things online is a bit much."

This is well-researched developmental neuroscience and psychology.  It's not STEM-y to say that teenagers are, in general, horrible decision makers, because the consequence for bad decisions aren't hard wired in. You have to touch a stove to know it's hot; in the same way, we don't allow teens to enter into legally binding contracts because still-developing brains may not fully understand the consequences, and can be taken advantage of. Understanding social issues does take empathy, but it's an empathy that many do not pick up until later stages of development."

Do you trust them not to make a list of people sympathetic to immigrants on the basis of the idea that they could be providing refugee for ""illegals"" once their fear tactics have stopped being effective enough to win the next election?   Because I don't. All western intelligence agencies have been cooperating to imprison people in Guantanamo on evidence that didn't suffice to imprison or extradite them officially. They're already using this information against us, unless you actually agree with them that those people don't belong to our society and that human rights are shit.   Mohammed Kurnaz is a German citizen that was imprisoned in Guantanamo for several years based entirely on the fact that he traveled to Afghanistan 2 times. His kidnapping was assisted by the BND and he remained in Guantanamo for several years after the CIA deemed him innocent because my government refused to take him back.  I don't care whether that could have been me under the current circumstances, I care that it actually happened to someone and am aware that the current circumstances can have drastically changed in 30 years, possibly making me a future target.

And with all the spying the FBI does, the only plots they ever seem to disrupt are those that they've created themselves: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/21/government-agents-directly-involved-us-terror-plots-report  Does the government even need bulk record collection in order to prevent terrorism?   And the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board ((could not identify one time when bulk collection under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act “made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation.”** Similarly, an in-depth analysis of 225 cases of people charged with terrorism found that “the contribution of NSA’s bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal.”   https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/section-215-patriot-act-expires-june-congress-ready  I'd say it's pretty clear that there's no need for spying anywhere near the scale the US and UK have been doing."

Furthermore, before about 1975, the United States was chiefly concerned with cracking down on home-grown political dissidence (anarchists at the turn of the century, socialists [of all stripes] in the Interwar period, partisan Communists during the McCarthy era, more radical elements of the Civil Rights Movement [e.g. Black Panther Party], precursors to well-organized feminist and LGBT organizations, and antiwar activists during all these periods and during the Vietnam era).

But that doesn't mean they should survive.  The very reason the American state has to surveil domestically and on a foreign basis, and the very reason the scary terrorists are ""coming to get us all"" is because it itself projects its power onto everyone else, and doesn't want its scheme to be threatened. Domestic and foreign surveillance target different groups and work slightly differently, but are two sides of the same coin.  But why must it project such power? Why does it get to do that? That is my basic question. And, since, it must project such power to exist, why must it exist?

I've never petitioned my government and this has definitely been an argument that changed my stance on my position on doing so. He isn't telling you to stop organizing people, he's telling you to petition your government no matter what."
SRSDiscussion,317bqq,fruitydurruti,18,Fri Apr 3 02:37:59 2015 UTC,"Organizing people and taking action is a great thing, but it's not so great if you fail to judge actions by their effectiveness.  The quote I posted comes from his discussion of the legislative fight over the status of gay armed service members in 1993.  Further down on the same page, he quotes a leader of HRC saying that out of the 700,000 people who marched in the LGBT rally in Washington while the legislation was under debate, ""only a few hundred bothered to lobby their members of Congress.""  If writing your Congressman is a more effective action than appearing in a demonstration, then people should know that.  Imagine taking a couple of zeros from one tally and move it to the other:  let's say thousands of people marched and tens of thousands wrote to their members of Congress.  According to Barney Frank, that would have made a bigger difference for gay members of the armed forces.  You might say it's harder to get people to write a letter than drive a few hundred miles for a party, but that might not be true if they understand that communicating with their elected representatives actually makes a difference.  Organization that rally people to action should get this message out to their members."
SRSDiscussion,317bqq,Nine_Line,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"nothing in that quote implies that letter writing is any more meaningful than holding a rally (not that that necessarily means much either, tbh). you don't think he politician would have turned it right around and said the opposite if thousands had written letters and ""only a few hundred"" turned up in the streets?"

SRSDiscussion,317bqq,barbadosslim,6,Fri Apr 3 21:36:07 2015 UTC,It depends on the action. If the purpose of a march is to generate political support for a specific piece of legislation writing in might be better. If the goal is to seize the means of production then writing in would be silly. I am guessing that OP is talking about marches that are trying to motivate reform instead of revolution.  If we are given two options to motivate political reform we should pick the most effective one.

So maybe you convince someone to stop hating gays.  Maybe you go all out and get someone to show a single iota of respect to a transgendered person.  So what?  Your entire existence is still anti-third worldist.  Your income goes to killing, your votes go to killers, and it's hard to see what incremental progess would even look like.

SRSDiscussion,317bqq,Topyka2,10,Sun Apr 5 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"""Frank's Rule"" seems to rely on a false dichotomy: that the two strategies of grassroots organizing are either 1) holding public demonstrations and rallies, and 2) writing to your elected representatives.    I'll put forward the argument that both of these strategies are dead-ends; or at least, they ask the wrong questions.  Both strategies assume the legitimacy of our current political institutions and assume that government policies respond to ideas, rather than changing power relations.  I'm not saying don't hold rallies or write/call your officials.  They both have positive benefits.  But if that's all you're doing, that there is a serious lack of understanding and reflection at hand.  I'm in favor of what could be called ""direct action""--directly getting what you and/or your community needs.  This could be in the form of disruption (blockading a police station, collective expropriation of a warehouse) or mutual aid (starting a local farm or health clinic).  This kind of stuff is much harder work, but I believe this is absolutely the necessary type of action that is needed to actually build popular power, and develop alternative/dual political and economic systems that are controlled by the people who our status quo systems marginalize and repress."
SRSDiscussion,317bqq,1egator,6,Fri Apr 3 03:50:40 2015 UTC,"mutual aid (starting a local farm or health clinic)... I believe this is absolutely the necessary type of action that is needed to actually build popular power, and develop alternative/dual political and economic systems that are controlled by the people who our status quo systems marginalize and repress.      This confuses me. Local farms and health clinics are part of ""the system"". They follow government regulations, integrate into pre-existing communities, and participate in the capitalist economy. Wouldn't that be ""changing the system from the inside"" again? I can't imagine how these would exist outside ""the system"" unless they exist as something very unusual like a radical local farm or a Robin Hood health clinic."

If people are prepared to move into a non-capitalist, non-statist world in which power is equalized, that's where it will go.

SRSDiscussion,317g8e,NowThatsAwkward,16,Thu Apr 2 16:25:07 2015 UTC,"So if you made it through all these words, thank you for your time. And what do you think? Could demolishing the myth of the capital-R-Rapist reduce resistance to consent education?   Perhaps, but from my experience as an undergrad, that isn't the biggest issue. We had a required online course on things like alcohol and sex, trying to prepare kids for college with safety tips and what not. This included saying that if someone is drunk, they can't give consent.  Now here is the thing. Many (most?) people don't think being drunk means you can't consent. If you can't walk properly, almost everyone would recognize that is too drunk. However, there is a large gap where people are very much drunk, but perfectly capable of engaging physically in sex. In fact, in college it is a pretty normal thing for people to get drunk and have sex.  This controversial (to many freshmen) idea comes with a very obvious question. What if both people are drunk? The answer was ""It's the guys responsibility to determine if the girl is too drunk no matter what.""  Pretty much every guy and almost every girl I talk to about it thought the whole thing was a joke, and this was the most common reason. It doesn't make sense, is blatantly sexist, and what about gay couples?   I understand the intent of policies like this is to protect women from being preyed on. However, when given such a ridiculous statement on ""how consent works"", everyone just threw out everything else said about the subject. ""These people are crazy, why believe anything they say?"" I don't believe this sort of policy is isolated to my undergraduate either.  From my experience, you need to make sure your consent policy is coherent before you try and teach it. Even if most of it is fine, people aren't going to abandon the morals and intuition they grew up easily, and one bad part is at all it takes."
SRSDiscussion,317g8e,A2GT,18,Sat Apr 4 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"We all know that it's important to teach people about consent       We've all seen the backlash to the consent campaigns, often known as the 'teach men not to rape' campaign    In my honest opinion, consent education efforts are doomed to fail until they cease to be gendered.      When consent education endorses the idea that a lot of people may be guilty or rape without even classifying it as such, but then is presented in such a way as to suggest that the ""a lot of people"" actually only includes men, its understandable why the efforts are met with resistance or downright outrage."
SRSDiscussion,317g8e,WorkshopVillage,-7,Thu Apr 2 20:00:56 2015 UTC,Well when men cease committing most of the violent/sexual crime maybe you'll have a point.
SRSDiscussion,317g8e,Intortoise,23,Thu Apr 2 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"I feel I have a point regardless, and I suppose I'll elaborate:      The set of women who commit nonviolent rape (i.e. rape that might not be classified as rape in a schema built around the ""Rapist bogeyman"" concept, as the OP put it) is NOT an empty set.  The material involved in consent education is not, in and of itself, gendered.  Consent education's core tenants should not change with the gender of the intended audience; thus, the cost of directing consent education at both genders simultaneously is practically zero.  Both men and women only to stand to gain from increased knowledge about what constitutes rape. Directing consent education at both genders will, in my opinion, greatly reduce the resistance the movement currently faces."
SRSDiscussion,317g8e,WorkshopVillage,3,Fri Apr 3 00:23:53 2015 UTC,Hey I'll agree that teaching everyone about consent is probably the way to go. Rape culture is toxic and affects everyone regardless of their place on the gender spectrum.

SRSDiscussion,317g8e,thesacredbear,2,Thu Apr 2 23:02:59 2015 UTC,I think that the issue is that our seems like it comes from an ivory tower. I went to a small intercity vocational college and the way that they do consent education is very male focused as they have 99% males. If taken at face value the program was grossly sexist however it came from a similar worldview from the students and think it was effective. The people who critisize these campaigns don't realize how sexist rapists are.
SRSDiscussion,317g8e,ampersamp,2,Thu Apr 2 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"Put simply, if you put someone you're trying to convince on the defensive, you've already lost. So how to not put them on the defensive?   People, perhaps wrongly, think that consent is a simply understood concept, and may then see any explanation as childish and patronising if not downright condemning. Reframe the conversation to be about something like ""communication"" or ""how to have good sex"", and you'll avoid that barrier. Appeal to how awkard early sexual encounters can be, and present explicit consent within the bounds of ""how to have a mature, healthy relationship"". While it's excellent practice to talk about how men and women feel like they should be behaving in sex, using gender neutral language will make men less defensive. Also, these are all things women should be told, regardless.  Men often have a right to be defensive about their sexuality (for example, pedophilia panic when associating with children) which is important to be aware of, especially at a young age when everyone is a little less sure of themselves. Speaking as a guy, you'll need to dismantle needing to get your dick wet as both social proof and personal self-fulfillment. If you're not having sex at this age (when everyone else seems like they are) you can easily feel pathetic. Letting people know gently that it takes the bigger, self-assured man to not let his actions be dictated by this.  Boil things down to simple practicalities. Ask specifically: ""do you want to fuck?"" and ""what are you ok with?"". Again, don't black and white this as if not doing this makes you a rapist, but go in from understanding that hookups can be awkward and the tension that comes with trying to be impressive leads to miscommunication. People could go along with situations they're uncomfortable with because of it, and everyone could feel terrible later. These simple questions help that from happening. (Also, take some time to convince that these questions really aren't out of place, or a turnoff, and they come only from narratives in the media, separate from reality.) Address what to do if your partner would rather you skip consent. Just refer to Louie CK on this bit - ""like I'm just going to rape you on the off chance you're into that shit?""  For drunk sex, be explicit that people can consent while drunk. If someone is so drunk they can't say yes, then they're quite literally, too drunk to consent. If some one says ""yes, fuck me"" etc. don't worry. There's a lot of misunderstanding in this area, so make sure to be explicit. If two people are too drunk to give consent to each other, they're incapable of having sex, which answers the most immediate reaction. It's also fine regardless of gender. Finally, always treat the concerns and complaints of who you're talking to as being of paramount importance. If people say you're being inconsistent, don't lay on the institutionalized power structure theory (ie get defensive) but acknowledge this as a legitimate barrier between who you are speaking to and healthy relationship communication. To do this, you'll need to put some effort into understanding their perspective."
SRSDiscussion,317g8e,shaedofblue,-1,Fri Apr 3 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"No.  A person can easily be too drunk to meaningfully consent while still capable of speaking and becoming aroused.  If a person's judgement is impaired, they are too drunk to meaningfully consent.  If they are too drunk for a contract they sign to be legal, they are too drunk for sexual consent to be legal.  If both parties are too drunk, and both actively participated, both parties are liable if the other presses charges, because the metric is not whether a drunk person could tell the person was impaired, but whether a reasonable person could tell.  Yes this conflicts with university drinking culture.  University drinking culture is toxic."

I thought this was about making consent clear, that's the most ambiguous thing ever!    I'm not trolling, these are just very clear roadblocks that will hinder understanding and lead people to see your views as extreme.

SRSDiscussion,317g8e,Koeida,0,Tue Apr 7 02:59:40 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna answer this starting off with an anecdote. I'm so sorry.  The most embarrassing memory I have from college surrounds the mandatory freshman workshop on rape awareness we had. A male friend of mine and I were making fun of that shit for weeks afterwards. We thought it was fucking stupid and condescending, and if you were to know us, you'd see what makes us experts on being stupid and condescending. This culminated in our RA (and if there were a god, this man deserves his blessings) setting up a meeting between the freshman rape awareness workshop board, and anyone in our dorm. He saw this dissatisfaction as an opportunity to hold a constructive conversation about the program. Well, my friend and I felt obligated to go, as he kinda set it up for us. Much to nobodies surprise we were the only ones there. We proceeded to espouse our juvenile suburban opinions to a group of people who had either been raped or are friends of rape victims (my stomach, my head, they're kinda spinning right now). I can't remember all of what we said, but it certainly wasn't good. We didn't terrorize the poor souls, though, I can say that much. But their patience, their soft-spoken nature, the firmness of their position without moralizing our own, without condescending to us... the beauty and class with which they sat across from us inspired me more than anything else to pick up a book on feminism.  I refer to this memory whenever I consider the question of how do we get people on board with _______ and against the harmful behavior of _______. To begin, I consider the critical players of this specific moment:   Myself, and my male friend, the ignorant asses My male RA, the terrified and embarrassed friend Female university coordinator, female workshop leader, male workshop leader, the firm, vulnerable, and patient voices of reason   And then, the context:   We had already experienced the laughably bad workshop Our opinions were straight outta high-school, and covered the spectrum from why people shouldn't attempt to shut down rape jokes to why rape isn't as big a deal as it actually is The majority of this university grew up within a very similar culture and range of conditions, and we were all loosely representative of this majority The workshop members were both seniors, and the employee was late twenties: they were all more or less adults The expectations of this meeting were unknown to all parties We had not met any of the people sitting across from us, nor were we likely to again Again, it was my friend and I, our RA, and them - no one else.   The conditions in the room:   Tense, but mutually aware.  We did wish to respect them, their opinions, and their time.  They wanted to have a fruitful conversation.  Our RA wanted to get us all on the same level (or more accurately, us on level with them), and expose any legitimate concerns with the way the workshop operated (we needed to be on the level to do that, though, and that wasn't happening) More and more, we were put on the defensive, relying on thought-terminating cliches to secure our opinions. They were strained to remain pleasant, but managed to maintain a cool demeanor. Vulnerability was key. They were vulnerable about the value they held in the workshop, and their connection to it. Their personal need for an end-game in which their experiences, and other experiences with rape do not go dismissed.   The immediate outcome:   Absolutely no immediate outcome. They were frustrated, we felt weird, and our RA was disappointed. That's it. Nothing changed.   I believe this is the single most frustrating aspect of social justice - nothing changes. Now, it's not that it never changes, but nothing changes immediately. Every confrontation leaves you feeling more pessimistic, more frustrated, more powerless, and more despondent.  You know a lot of people don't like arguments, I'm sure. But I would posit, from purely personal experience, that it's not arguing most of those people dislike. It's the emotional consequences of arguing. You never really win an argument. If it can be won, it isn't an argument you're walking away from. You'd be leaving a lively report, a frenetic collaboration, an explosive meeting of minds or, with an arbiter, it might just be a debate. What makes an argument an argument (and again, this is totally a personal view, I know) is that in an argument, one or both sides stubbornly resorts to a defense mechanism. This may be condescension, insults, aggression, self-victimization, or a thought-terminating cliche. It may be produced in response to the instability of their position, self-perceived or otherwise, their anxiety, their pain, or the defense mechanisms of their opponent. It may be conscious or unconscious. An argument is simply what happens when one or both sides cannot progress beyond their defense mechanisms.  In my scenario, we couldn't progress past our defense mechanisms. It was an argument, and it needed to be an argument. But they didn't need to argue. They rode us all the way out without hurting us, without condescending, without moralizing, without attacking. They rode us as far as we went, and no more. That was the last taste they left in our mouth, of our own fallibility. We failed - even if we didn't recognize it or accept it.  Maybe you expect a happy ending, but it doesn't come for a while. There were two separate mid/long-term results for us. I came across feminism on the internet a few months later and digested it voraciously. That happened because of that vulnerability I was forced into a room with. Even if I left it with little respect for their position, there was a part of me that respected them. I no longer responded with dismissal. Instead, I had a curiosity about how other people thought about the same subject. When the time was right, when I got bored and stumbled on the right internet page at the right time, I became a feminist. It was one instance of honest vulnerability, and this is the important part, that had conquered me, that gave me what I needed to change.  My friend is a different story. It stuck with him, too, but in the back of his head. It just didn't ever become a primary concern of his. I still think that experience opened him up, as well, but it played out differently. Every time I confronted him with moments of sexism or racism, he would deny it less and less. Eventually, he would just say... yeeeeeeeea, I thought as much. No contest. Just a few weeks ago he told me, ""You know, your voice is the one I hear in the back of my head when I'm thinking about whether or not something is racist or sexist."" I'm thinking, fuck yea, cause I was the one that was with him at a critical moment, and I'm the one followed up for years.    So, in order to improve consent education and anti-rape campaigns I have a suggestion, but not a solution.  Get good people who are vulnerable, well-spoken, and well-informed.  Gather the ones in need of education. Find a way to put them in a position where they have a vested interest in not making a complete ass of themselves, but are forced to share and defend their positions. Outside their comfort zones, but not so far outside they shut down. Put them through it with people they hold in positive regard, with their friends, with people that will probably be around for a while.  Moderate that experience very loosely. Don't let them distance themselves from the conflict. They lose by losing, by running out of 'good arguments,' and not by withdrawing.  Of course, there isn't always an opportunity for that. So I'm gonna reduce it to what I believe the core of any awareness campaign should be:  Make it your goal to confront everyone with one pure, unavoidable experience of a victim allowing others access to the vulnerability with which that person needs them to take this problem seriously. Make it fucking unforgettable. And in a separate campaign, encourage everyone to never, ever put down the fucking torch.  Edit: In response to the downvotes, I just wanted to clarify something that may have been misunderstood. I am purely commenting on what I believe an awareness campaign should do, and would not over extend this into an argument for how minority activists should carry out their goals as individuals.  And it would be uncouth of me to respond to the downvotes without expressing my gratitude for the gold. Thank you."

I don't know if you meant the other stuff how it comes across, but it comes across as... off the rails.    change attitudes about sex and be less entitled and teach how to be less entitled. This means starting with YOU. Make sex not nearly as big of a deal as we currently make it, be more free and willing to have it, even if it's not exactly what you want to do.   That sounds like you're saying to reduce rape, people, especially women, should be okay having sex when they don't want to. So by being okay with rape happening to us, we will reduce rape.   socially punish overly competitive behavior and reward cooperative behavior with friendship, sex, relationships and positive comments.   When you take a line straight out of Elliot Rodgers manifesto, you might want to rethink it. Sex is not something women ""give"" men as a reward for being good people. It is a partnered activity that people choose to have for a myriad of reasons, and choose not to have for a myriad of reasons. That's just basic bodily autonomy.  Is this the entitlement you refer to women needing to reduce, the entitlement to decide what happens to their body?  I'm sorry if you didn't mean these abhorrent things, but there are a lot of people on here who do believe those things, so I just want to be clear on what you mean from the start."

I just want to comment on this as well. Anasthera isn't wrong that sex is a physical need, but this is the completely wrong approach to it. No one has an obligation to have sex with other people. It is actually a little horrifying that someone could even suggest that people should have some social duty to have sex with enough other people.  The obvious answer, to me, is the legalization of prostitution. Make it a legitimate profession, then it can be both safe and voluntary. Then people who, for whatever reason, can't get sex normally have other means. At the same time, no one is being forced into sex.  Prostitution may not be a perfect answer, but it is 100x better then copying ideas from A Brave New World."

So by being okay with rape happening to us, we will reduce rape.   No. Rape is when someone forces you to have sex when you don't want to. Having sex when you don't want to under your own volition is voluntary, and not rape.   When you take a line straight out of Elliot Rodgers manifesto, you might want to rethink it. Sex is not something women ""give"" men as a reward for being good people. It is a partnered activity that people choose to have for a myriad of reasons, and choose not to have for a myriad of reasons. That's just basic bodily autonomy.   I don't know who that person is, but my point is that if you want to promote a certain kind of behavior and reduce another related behavior, you have to go out of your way to reward the behavior you want and punish the behavior you don't want. Sex is only one way, and to do it by itself is pretty silly as you point out. A much more common and appropriate way would be social bonding and friendship, which can (but does not have to) lead to sexual activity. And the sexual activity does not have to be super meaningful and be based on a pre-existing deep intimacy either, and to treat it that way is to buy in to and reinforce a bunch of culturally-enforced unhealthy fantasy B.S., just as much as men wanting nothing but supermodels for girlfriends and sex partners.   Is this the entitlement you refer to women needing to reduce, the entitlement to decide what happens to their body?   The entitlement is getting exactly what you want, and settling for nothing less, which in America is usually overblown and unreasonable due to the high standards we are exposed to everywhere. Entitlement is never compromising to cooperate with others who have different needs, and never sacrificing some of what you want to help out other people. That is the mentality that leads to rape, but it is absolutely affecting women too in different ways, leading to unreasonable expectations of behavior for men.  If you want to stop rape, you need to fix entitlement issues, and the best way to do that is to start by introspection and looking at what unreasonable entitlements YOU may have and begin actively compromising more often, and not just about sex either, but about everything. When it comes to sex, due to cultural influences as well as biology, men have a greater need for sex than women, so for now the compromise IN GENERAL should end up that men won't get as much sex as they will want and women will have sex more often than they want. If people and organizations are successful over the next few decades or so at reducing entitlement and changing our cultural attitude about sex overall (especially the taboos around children and their exploration/education), that sex compromise gap will shrink and people will be happier."

A group of mostly gay men really strongly opposed the change because they felt like ""queer"" was still offensive, and they very adamantly did not identify as queer.   Ultimately the name was changed to Queer Students Alliance as planned, because the people who actually showed up to the meetings and were involved in the organization tended to be people who identified as ""queer"" (and for a handful of other petty political things inherent to college student orgs).   But it was interesting to see the divide. I've always liked the term ""queer"" (especially as my gender identity has shifted to something more non-binary), and my partner has only identified strongly as ""queer"" (doesn't really ID as bi or pan, but feels lesbian doesn't fit - queer gives her more wiggle room)."
SRSDiscussion,316r69,MySilverWhining,3,Thu Apr 2 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is something you just have to keep in mind about reclaiming words.  If you think about queer theory and the work queer theorists do/positions they hold, it's basically the number one candidate for reclamation in the history of all reclaimed words, ever. If there was ever a word that made sense to reclaim, it's that one.  But, you have to remember that words are never reclaimed on behalf of all the people they used to be slurs against. It's not like the secret gay agenda for bringing about the downfall of western civilisation (which totally doesn't exist, by the way, wink wink nudge nudge conspiracy theorists) got together and unanimously voted that that word would be acceptable in the context of academic theory.  You're entitled to find words that spent a long period of their history being used to hurt you hurtful. Even as someone quite interested in queer theory, if you asked me, in a conversation, to stop saying it out loud it wouldn't phase me."
SRSDiscussion,316r69,coolyellow424,2,Thu Apr 2 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on current usage. As a straight guy, I feel like ""queer"" is pretty okay, because it's used in formal contexts where people tend to work towards shared terminology. People talk about ""queer issues,"" ""queer theory,"" the ""queer community,"" and so on, and in that register it feels more polite to adopt the terminology used by LGBT people. Sticking to different terminology feels like something an adversary would do to distance themselves from their opponents' arguments.  In casual speech, things are not as simple. Casual speech is more personal and more rife with sarcasm, aggression, and irony. Words like ""f---ot"" and ""n---er"" that are used in casual speech are not necessarily meant to be shared, because their meaning is understood differently depending on who is using them.  EDIT:  I just realized the usage of ""queer"" as a noun fits into the second category, so it is an example of a reclaimed word that has some usages that have been fully rehabilitated and some usages that are still double-edged."
SRSDiscussion,316r69,coolyellow424,4,Thu Apr 2 17:31:35 2015 UTC,"Speaking from experience as a gay man, I think the effect of reclaimed terms such as 'queer' depend on the context they are used in. If one of my gay friends addressed me as their 'fellow queer' or whatever, I'd be totally cool with that. But if a straight person called me a queer I wouldn't like it, even if it was not used as a pejorative. I might let it slide if it was an ally, on good faith? It might be an eyebrow-raising view, but I think all uses of reclaimed words should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Of course, I'm making it sound very clinical when in reality it isn't.  As for the original definition of the word 'queer', isn't that why it was used to describe GSRM people in the first place because we're abnormal? I think the point of reclaiming those words is that we can turn something negative into something positive, and show a bit of GSRM solidarity. That's just my view though, I can see where you're coming from."
SRSDiscussion,316r69,SinfulSinnerSinning,2,Thu Apr 2 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would ever offend me to the extent of provoking a direct 'hey, cut that out' response, because I know it's 'officially reclaimed' and you'd be being an asshole complaining about it - but I'd probably end up mentioning my thoughts as stated above.  I'm actually having a serious consideration now as to whether I'd find 'fag' more offensive than 'queer' if used deliberately offensively. Fag at least has no other connotations than 'gay', it's the sort of term that marks the user more than the target - if someone yells 'you're a fag' to me they might as well have said 'you're gay' - the criticism is expected to be 'internal'; you're being identified as a member of a group and that membership is meant to be insult enough, something you're ashamed of. If you're not ashamed of it, it has little effect. Saying 'you're queer' - I know it's just terminology but it's a bit like saying 'you're retarded' to someone who is genuinely mentally impaired; you're not just marking them as a member of a group, you're criticising their actual being, you're stating there is something truly wrong with them.  Digressing here!"
SRSDiscussion,316r69,Justice_Prince,4,Fri Apr 3 02:40:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess it depends on whether you still see the original meaning of queer through the reclaimed meaning. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer, just preference.  Regarding 'fag', I really dislike that word. Whenever someone gets called out for using it, the whole 'it's insulting because it's WRONG (I'm not gay)' defense gets pulled out. However, I disagree; I made my views clear in this SRD thread.   Implying or stating that someone is gay is seen as an insult because it is seen as undesirable to be gay. If it wasn't, then 'gay', 'faggot' etc would not be insults.   It's not that you're taking away their identity, it's that you're implying that they're something that is seen as undesirable by society.    In my opinion, 'fag' is a purely negative word because it suggests you are 'broken' or unwanted by society. At least (reclaimed) 'queer' can have some positive meaning."
SRSDiscussion,316r69,meowmixxed,3,Fri Apr 3 03:03:36 2015 UTC,"Also 'fag' has a much more sordid (and older) etymology than 'queer'. And it has a much longer staying power as a slur, I can only remember 'queer' being used as a pejorative a handful of times in the last few years."

I don't think that's all together fair.  As an outsider I tend to stay the hell away from using reclaimed words. I think it depends on specific communities and context that I am simply not informed about enough to be able to make a correct judgement.   However, I do think that language is variable, that words have only the power we give them (not as individuals, but as a society - words have real power, but that can be gained and lost over time), and that we should always take culture and location into account - especially when conversing on the internet.

If you find the word queer offensive it is because you have a large history and experience of that word being used in an offensive and attacking manner. Become cognizant of your feelings and expose yourself to the word in a non-offensive manner. Being around other people who use the word in a neutral manner is most effective. You might think that it being used in an overly positive manner is the best way to go but it is not the case because it is not genuine, and you'll pick up on that subconsciously.  Remember: it is not the word itself that is offensive, but the interpreted meaning behind that, and that is entirely a subjective experience."

I am Italian-American and my father's family faced a lot of isolation and disparagement because of it when they were growing up in New York, especially when my great-grandfather immigrated to the US. I don't find the term particularly hurtful to ME in general, but when Jersey Shore ""reclaimed"" it, it just became this horrible caricature of Italian Americans, and it drove me crazy.

I rarely get offended when someone calls be a slur, but that doesn't mean that the word they used ceased to be a slur (or generally offensive!). Rather I would contend that what is and isn't a slur depends on, for example, where the word is commonly used, awareness of the etymology, and to a limited degree what a speaker means to get across with it.  For example, take a slur that is no longer in use, ""Boche"", which was used to denote Germans during the first world war. Why was it a slur? Well, because it was used by people who disliked Germans, specifically allied soldiers, and the word continued to have that association even when it entered common language (which it has hopefully now left). The same type of explanations apply to other slurs. As nomadbishop points out, it has to do with a words association with ""marginalization or oppression of a particular group"".  There is an ongoing debate about the import of racist words in certain areas of the philosophy of language. Their interest is usually quite narrow (they want to account for why these words do not fit into something called truth-conditional semantics), but otherwise interesting. I would recommend Geoff Nunberg's draft-paper ""Slur's aren't special"". You might be able to find it online, but PM me otherwise."

While one could argue that any word that a certain demographic is offended by might be considered a slur, that definition has some problems.

To me it seems you're talking more about specializations rather than intelligence. For example, as you mentioned, a mechanic compared to a nuclear physicist. I think it's quite clear that the two different professions require a different level of intelligence. I don't need to graduate from Harvard to become a (at least average) mechanic, while I certainly do if want a carreer as a physicist.

SRSDiscussion,30uphz,Epicwarren,-4,Mon Mar 30 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"I have posted this a LOT, so now I have a comment prepped to go.    One of the issues I have is that Shulevitz seriously downplays the medical roots of trigger warnings, and seems to conflate ""safe space"" with a literal space for people who have been triggered to recuperate. These are two very different things, and her direct comparison is troubling insofar as it makes safe spaces seem childish and comical. Indeed, she says,   students resort to the quasi-medicalized terminology of trauma   as if the terminology of trauma and triggers did not arise out of medical issues, specifically language used by sufferers of PTSD, anxiety disorders, and the like.  The irony is that Shulevitz fair trips over herself to portray these college activists as ""eager to self-infantilize"", and that these are children who ""had burrowed so deep inside their cocoons, were so overcome by their own fragility"" that they are incapable of facing so-called Hard Truths. Yet she does this by infantilizing, downplaying, and disrespecting the work of college activists, and by totally overlooking the hard work and struggle that goes into creating and maintaining these safe spaces.  It's quotes like   Still, it’s disconcerting to see students clamor for a kind of intrusive supervision that would have outraged students a few generations ago. But those were hardier souls.   that make it really hard for me to take her seriously. All Shulevitz is doing is claiming that this generation are spoiled youths, using leftist terminology. She's not breaking any new ground here. Those hardier souls are still around; they're some of the people who help create these safe spaces. Safe spaces are not so much about ""the conviction that their schools should keep them from being “bombarded” by discomfiting or distressing viewpoints"", as she claims. It is about the ethics of speech, that not everything that can be said should be said.  Which is the precise point. I know many activists on my campus who are campaigning for safe spaces and the presence of trigger warnings. The vast majority of those leading these campaigns are survivors of trauma, who have PTSD triggers. None of them are saying that they need coddling; precisely the opposite. They are perhaps the people on campus who are most aware of the kind of brutality and cruelty the truth can bring with it, and the kind of ""hard truths"" that Shulevitz is enamored with are things that they have personally experienced. To portray campus activists as spoiled children clamoring for ignorant bliss is to do a disservice to those who spend their time and labour creating these spaces. The spaces are ""safe"", not ""cuddly"", for a reason. This is not about an unwillingness to face ""scary ideas"", this is about being allowed to explore and learn without having to face panic attacks."
SRSDiscussion,30uphz,minimuminim,19,Mon Mar 30 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"I guess the question then is which parts of the university experience should constitute a safe space and which parts should not. I agree that giving students a heads up before a discussion or lecture that's going to contain certain kinds of material (sexual assault, etc.) is a good idea. But I'd question if it's possible or desirable for the entire university to constitute a safe space, which I think is what the article is most heavily criticising. I'd be worried that disallowing speakers who'd express certain opinions or shutting down debates that might disagree with particular ideas would rather defeat the point of higher education. If a single viewpoint is presented as correct but no debate is allowed, how could students with other views come around to the idea? How would students who already agree learn to defend that viewpoint against people who do not?  I agree with the idea of safe spaces in general, just not with the concept of them encompassing the entire campus which is what I interpreted the article as criticising."
SRSDiscussion,30uphz,SapphireAndIce,7,Mon Mar 30 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"The classroom is not a safe space, nor was I ever advocating for it to be. Safe spaces are (or should be) the spaces outside the classroom, for various people to process what they learn afterwards. Is it useful for the entire campus to be a safe space? No. I actually spend some time and effort on my own campus saying precisely that.  It is the assumption that people who want safe spaces want ""cuddly"" spaces or want the entire campus to be a ""safe"" space, that leads to trite bullshit like ""brave space"". For example, the (closed) queer student group on my campus is a safe space. What does that entail? That means that we agree to be respectful of others' perspectives, to speak from our own experiences and not generalize, and to not attack other members of the group on a personal level. It does not mean that we do not engage with difficult topics. In fact it's pretty hard to be a queer discussion group and not talk about difficult topics.  Again: what definition of ""safe space"" is Shulevitz working off of? Here's the closest we get to a definition, in the first paragraph:   [she] considers it her duty to make Brown a safe place for rape victims, free from anything that might prompt memories of trauma.   So... she's not working off the definition of safe space (which is the definition pushed by student activists in my area) that I'm talking about. Okay.  That's the other problem with this article, and with a lot of these discussions around safe spaces: I tend to find that everyone talks a lot about whether or not we should have ""safe spaces"", but very little time talking about what a safe space would actually look like.  I mean, I'd characterize SRSDiscussion as a safe space from sorts: it's a place where you're safe to discuss issues of social justice without feeling constantly attacked for having non-mainstream views. (Ideally; I am very well aware that this is not always how it plays out). We present the views that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and so on both exist and are major issues as the correct ones, and we don't allow debate of these issues here. That's what Social Justice 101 is for. This means we can have conversations that aren't just ""Bigotry exists"" over and over again. That's the value of having a safe space - or if you don't like that term, use whatever name you'd like."

I guess this just highlights your point - it's impossible to discuss whether or not something is a good idea if people can't even agree on what it is.   I guess with SRSDiscussion it's as much about brutal pragmatism as safety. As you say, the place would get old very fast if every single thread had the obligatory ""But is sexism even an issue anymore?"" post, regular as clockwork. It is an interesting paradox though, that in order to have free speech (or in this case, interesting discussions) one must sometimes limit it"

The problem is that while these terms do originate in medicine, they have almost completely abandoned the full meanings and context behind them. For people with PTSD, trigger avoidance is actually undesirable after a point, and it can lead to a worsening of the condition rather than improvement.  True, not every instance of trigger warnings and safe spaces are like this, but it's something I see quite often and I find it troubling."
SRSDiscussion,30uphz,Othello,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"Okay so - here's the background on where my comment is coming from, which is to say, a framing of the need for trigger warnings in educational content in order for students with PTSD, who aren't at the stage where trigger avoidance is desirable, to know what's coming up so that they can make the informed decision to continue with that particular course of study or not. This is also coming after someone said, in a class, if not being triggered by a discussion about child death made her a bad person.   Your point is actually why I think it is important, in terms of deciding institutional policy, to keep the discussion on trigger warnings focused on the use of TWs as a tool. In some cases it should be fairly obvious from, say, the topics being discussed or the titles of readings what the subject matter is; an article titled ""A Discussion of Child Prostitution in Thailand"" pretty much tells you what it's going to be about. On the other hand, coming from a film background, it may well be worthwhile to have it noted that some content may contain potentially triggering material, if it is not going to be obvious from other information such as title, synopsis etc.  OP is correct in that ""some students may have been a huge misunderstanding of how triggers work - a magic word of discomfort, rather than a serious PTSD/anxiety flashback situation."" Yet Shulevitz is not exactly depicting this story with any lack of bias here. Her piece reeks of strawmanning. Is it ridiculous to censor the n-word in a discussion on racism? Yeah, I'd say so. I would go so far as to say the trend of saying ""s-slur"" or ""b-slur"" or what have you on /r/ShitRedditSays is also pretty absurd, given the subject matter at hand. But Shulevitz is not interested in talking about censorship or free speech; the quotes I pulled, and the overall theme of her piece, is much more about marvelling at these ""overprogrammed children"".  Due to my areas of study, I do work with a lot of sensitive and objectionable content. That's kind of what I signed up for, because I study queerness, colonialism, racism and sexism. I'm going to encounter examples of very disturbing behaviour. I would argue that having a trigger warning for otherwise innocuous-seeming content allows students with triggers to grapple with the content. Why would a person with PTSD ask for warnings on potential triggers if they were just going to avoid the topic right from the outset? Nor have I found the actual implementation of trigger warnings in the classroom particularly obstructing: all that happens is the professor sends out an email, or makes an announcement in class beforehand along the lines of ""hey, next week we're covering readings on child abuse, so if you would prefer to skip the class come talk to me or email me beforehand.""  So, again, I do my best to hew closely to the arguments put forth by the student advocates, in my area, who want there to be trigger warnings where appropriate on various forms of material. It's probably worth mentioning at this juncture that they are also the same people who get quite mad when people use the language of trigger warnings to try and stop people using the n-word in discussions of racism. It's quite possible to advocate both the presence of trigger warnings and safe spaces without being a caricature of the sort Shulevitz portrays; she's not subtly ridiculing the idea, it's about as blatant as you can get."
SRSDiscussion,30uphz,minimuminim,8,Mon Mar 30 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"Well as I mentioned, this stuff isn't bad in all situations. My perspective is this:  Trigger Warnings et al. are alright on the whole, because it gives people suffering from PTSD and related illnesses a degree of control over their health that they might need.  However, I personally have seen these otherwise alright things being exploited way too often and in ways that I feel is potentially dangerous. If I could give an analogy, it's very similar to the way that people often self-diagnose themselves as OCD. Some people say it jokingly, but other people will be very serious about it without having a formal diagnosis, which I feel is dangerous to that person themselves (if they really have this issue they should be receiving appropriate care) and is also harmful to people who actually have OCD. The same applies here, I see far too many people who have become so enamored with the idea of trigger warnings and the like that they just sort of glom onto them in ways that are potentially harmful both to themselves and to people who actually need these things from a medical standpoint.  I've seen communities turn insular and hostile to the outside, I've seen these tools used by self-diagnosed hangers on almost as a hobby, I've seen people who legitimately need these tools face ridicule and stigma brought on by the abuse of said tools, and I've seen people with PTSD drive themselves deeper into their illness by refusing to leave the safe bubble these tools provide. I obviously can only speak to my own experiences here as I have not done a scientific study, but I have seen far more misuse of these tools than actual appropriate usage, and it has had me very seriously concerned for some time. While the article linked does lean a bit far into the territory of ridicule, much of the discussion the author brought up is fairly important, in my opinion.  To me, the bottom line is that anyone who is really feeling a medical need to make use of these tools needs to be under the care of a doctor, and everyone else needs to really consider the effects their misuse may be having on people who are truly relying on these tools."

Because let's face it, whether or not we allow trigger warnings in the classroom isn't actually going to cause students to skive or to skip work; as a student, we do that already, excuse or no. And I think you do have to trust that students know the consequences of choosing to do the work or not, because at the end of the day... well, you give'em a syllabus and a grading scheme, they know what the assignments are worth, you can't actually force them into good behaviour.

I ask simply because most folks who call for trigger warnings are neither, as individuals undergoing professional care for PTSD aren't encouraged to avoid their triggers eternally, but instead learn to deal with them.    Triggers also tend to be fairly specific; any mention of war isn't necessarily going to trigger a vet with PTSD, for example, but a revving engine might.    The problem being addressed is that there is, in fact, a segment of society that's co-opted the terminology and started to use it as a means of thought-policing."

Seriously, every quote was tailor-made for that piece.  The implementation of safe spaces and TWs varies enormously from campus to campus. Earlier in this thread we've already established that the actual definition of what a safe space is is subject to tremendous variation. So what I'm telling everyone here, now, is based off my direct experience actually working for, arguing with, and negotiating for changes in my school.   The thing is, we hear about these movements and campaigns; do we ever see their results? Did that college in the UK actually ban clapping in favour of jazz hands? Because though students might object to the use of racial slurs in discussions of racism, it hasn't actually stopped any professors doing so.  I am far more concerned with the way in which the spectre of    people are calling for safe spaces in the day-to-day classroom, or trigger warnings on the syllabus for Huckleberry Finn or whatever   gets used to shut down reasonable requests for TWs. I would far, far prefer that college administrators set up effective and viable pathways for people dealing with PTSD to receive the support and attention they need, instead of yet again offloading all responsibility onto students and faculty.

Simply exaggerating your own claim is not.  More importantly, you seem to be making a generalization on behalf of the author.  You are replacing her definition of safe spaces with your own and becoming upset with a misrepresentation which isn't actually taking place.    The author's message is not: ""Private groups designed to discuss issues on campus are blight to learning.""

She even tells you what it is - the idea that    schools should keep [one] from being “bombarded” by discomfiting or distressing viewpoints.

With regards to    a great deal of people need to talk about that for people to understand what a Safe Space really is.    you are assuming that there is a single definition of what a safe space (no caps) is. There isn't one; even on my own campus, a safe space can describe many different configurations. I've been in, and helped maintain, several spaces. Each of them was different since they were set up to do different things, but if there was any sort of commonality it was this: people were encouraged to talk about the issue(s) that the group was set up to tackle, and they had some assurance of support for voicing their ideas.  Sarkeesian is not ""sequestering"" herself in safe spaces. There are certain places, especially within feminist or academic thought, where the ""criticisms"" raised by certain groups will not be regarded very highly, simply because they completely fail to understand her premise and the body of feminist/critical theory scholarship that her work draws on. In fact, Tropes v.s. Women in Videogames is an incredibly basic series that is operating at introductory levels, as in, it applies simple feminist media/critical theory concepts of the sort that would fit right into a college freshman's first-semester class. Her points are completely uncontroversial as far as media criticism is concerned. I understand how from the outside it appears dismissive, but really it's more that her (enormous and disproportionately hateful) body of critics are drawing spurious arguments that have been dismissed since about the 70s."

As Reddit became mainstream and the userbase within that age group expanded, it began to more closely reflect the politics of the population as a whole.   2) The Great Recession tilted older Millennials to the left. The current college-aged population is coming of age in better economic times and probably feels less betrayed by the establishment, so they're (relatively) more conservative."

I think the biggest barrier to women entering supposedly 'open' leagues is the emphasis put on masculinity in these environments, and how consciously and subconsciously women are bullied, tormented and plain left out in these male-dominated competitive environments. Having a women's league creates an environment where women can feel welcome, where they are not left out of the conversation or ignored in team formations due to their gender (or reduced to their physical appearance). I truly believe it is only by fostering a more welcoming, but still competitive scene will we create the kinds of structures and environments where women can fulfill their potential and get better representation.  Then again, there are women out there like Scarlett who prove that no matter how male dominated a scene appears to be, pure skill can still get you to the top. I believe this wouldn't be the case for team based games in which biases during selection would rule out most women from getting into a top team."

It's an argument that only considers the ""LG"" part of the acronym...which is the part that many people - and more importantly, 99% of the 'mainstream' media - seem to think is the only part of it, which is fucked up.  It has nothing at all to do with the ""BTQ"" part, and it should.    But that would hurt their (the people who are dedicated to fighting for this) chances of success.

SRSDiscussion,30meuk,Lolor-arros,12,Sat Mar 28 19:36:24 2015 UTC,"As a bisexual myself, I get where you're coming from. For a while, I even believed that sexuality was a choice, and couldn't understand why anyone would 'choose' to be fully straight or fully gay!    However, I think the 'sexuality isn't a choice' -mantra is more an argument against what certain people believe;    I don't know where you come from, but in many parts of the world, people genuinely believe that the only reason anyone would be homosexual is if they have turned their back on God or society. That's literally the axiom of their thought; every 'bad thing' (by the ideals of that society) is a temptation that must be fought.    So, when queer people say 'it's not a choice', what they really mean is 'you don't chose to be straight, he didn't chose to be gay, and I didn't chose to be bisexual' It's about the lack of choice in thought, not lack of choice in action.

SRSDiscussion,30meuk,draw_it_now,5,Sat Mar 28 20:04:39 2015 UTC,"This has actually been a really interesting historical shift back and forth. If I'm remembering the turning points correctly, the ""not a choice"" rhetoric largely came out of the AIDS crisis. When ""being gay"" seemed like it could kill you, it was important for the queer community to push back that ""not having gay sex"" was not a valid solution. Thus, one's sexual orientation being not a choice became the dominant frame.   Prior to that, the rhetoric was the opposite precisely to remove the association of being ""afflicted"" with homosexuality, so that it would stop being seen and treated as a mental illness. I don't know a ton of pre-AIDS LGBT history (besides Stonewall), but I do know untangling the association between queerness and mental illness was a pretty significant early movement.   You point out what others absolutely have, that the ""born this way"" rhetoric doesn't really work anymore precisely because it shouldn't matter whether it was a choice or something innate. I remember having a conversation with friends better-read in (US) Constitutional Law than I am, in terms of having sexual/gender identity designated protected classes for the purposes of employment discrimination, but I think it doesn't matter legally (given that religion is also protected and is obviously not innate).   (As an aside, I've noticed there's a certain degree of ""not knowing our history"" with respect to language and rhetoric in current queer rights movements, at least online.

I was born with blue eyes which strictly speaking could be considered a physical defect because as a result I'm more prone to occular cancer and more sensitive to light.

A straw-man is a misrepresentation of an opponent's argument which is easier to refute than the original.  The ""straw-man fallacy"" occurs when an individual substitutes the straw-man for his opponents position and then refutes the substitution.    As such, issues at large cannot really be straw-men.   Similarly,      pointing out that hetero and/or cis people didn't choose to be statistically normative seems like one of the more effective ways of winning over homo-/transphobes--but are we validating their false beliefs by focusing our energy there, essentially fighting the strawman they threw in our path?   If one tries to advance the argument that homosexuality is a perfectly acceptable form of expression, regardless of whether its a ""lifestyle choice"" then arguments focusing on whether homosexuality is a choice are not straw-men, but  red-herrings.

There's a whole hell of a lot of people out there that I wouldn't place my faith in and I couldn't give less of a shit about whether they're neurotypical. Also, by placing all people with mental illnesses under the same umbrella, you're telling me that Joe, who has a regular psychologist and psychiatrist and has responsibly managed his illness for 15 years, is equivalent to John, who is not actively managing and is a danger to himself and others.  I think it's fair to regularly evaluate job fitness, especially with jobs that carry a high burden and responsibility towards the public. I do not think an accurate and safe way of evaluating job fitness is to throw a blanket statement such ""no person with diagnosed mental illnesses should be permitted to be a pilot/law enforcement"" (please let me know if that's an inaccurate summary of your argument, and I will adjust it!). I do think regular psychiatric evaluation, done not as checking a box once yearly but as an active and accepted part of the job, will mitigate the actual risk factors involved.   In short: people will manage to avoid being diagnosed if they see a medical doctor once a year who evaluates their mental state and they know they'll lose their job over the diagnosis no matter how they proceed with that information. People will struggle to avoid being grounded if they talk to someone once a month (or more often) and are required to actively manage their mental heath regardless of whether they have a formal diagnosis.

There are others who think that way in real life. That's why I have to post this from a throwaway.  Ultimately, though, it makes no sense. Around 10% of the US population is treated for mental illness (and let's not even discuss the people who refuse to seek treatment). 25 million alone are prescribed fluoxetine.   There are many, many people (believe me, I know quite a few personally) in medical school who have issues with mental illness and will soon be in charge of the lives of our children, parents, and us. I see no evidence, statistical or anecdotal, to suggest that they will be lesser physicians in any way.

The Netherlands already has had a nice campaign about this http://collegasmetkarakter.nl/ feel free to google translate.  I think the best way to facilitate people with mental illness/reduce possible risk (if there's any) is by giving equal opportunities and making sure the workplace is a safe and healthy environment both physically as socially.   It can happen to everybody, and regulations will only discriminate those who already have this stamp on their forehead, and will make it a bigger taboo for those that will develop a mental illness."

I guess a question to you is, are you as worried about tired pilots?  Drunk pilots?  Poorly trained pilots?  Lazy pilots?  Overconfident pilots?    Are you as worried about them as your ""finicky"" bogeymen?  Because I'd wager the above list is far more likely to kill you.  You actually do not want an employer to:  ""do everything they can do that would keep people safe"" because that would result in you walking.  You want reasonable safety measures.  TL;DR you're far more likely to kill yourself than to be killed by someone with mental illness.  Worry about your own head."

SRSDiscussion,30iv3r,restmile,3,Fri Mar 27 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"We already have measures that make sure pilots are mentally well enough to fly.  From an article I found while Googling for information about ""the co-pilot case"":   “We take a preventive, layered approach to aviation security,” he said. “Airline pilots are psychologically tested as part of their recruitment process. “Pilots must also undergo at least annual medical, including mental health checks under Civil Aviation Safety Authority licence requirements.”   http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/what-we-know-about-a320-co-pilot-andreas-lubitz/story-fnizu68q-1227280471225"
SRSDiscussion,30iv3r,itsacoup,15,Fri Mar 27 21:05:12 2015 UTC,"As a pilot, let me elucidate on this more. To give an example I'm familiar with, the mental health requirements by the FAA are 1. no formal diagnosis of ""psychosis, bipolar disorder, or severe personality disorders"", 2. less than 6 consecutive months of prescribed anti-anxiety/antidepressant over the course of the pilot's life, and 3. a yearly medical evaluation (for commercial pilots--less often for other kinds of pilots), during which a doctor--medical, not one with specific psychiatric training--evaluates the pilot through casual conversation.  What this comes down to is, professional pilots will either 1. avoid getting treatment or 2. sneak medication by either purchasing illegally or trying to go to doctors that will not pass the information on in their official files. Again, this is for the US and I can't speak for other countries, but air transport regulation tends to be decently consistent across the world because it's fairly intrinsically international.  This is not an environment that encourages pilots to take care of themselves, mentally. This is not an environment that will prevent tragedies as the one in question. My strong, personal belief is that regular (and more than once yearly!) true psychiatric evaluation should be a part of at least first class medicals (required for airline pilots) and that there should be no blanket restriction on mental health diagnoses. Behavior-based requirements, plus regular psychiatric evaluations with clear pass/fail requirements, will prevent unfit persons from passing more regularly and accurately than what's in place."
SRSDiscussion,30iv3r,oskomena,3,Fri Mar 27 21:50:31 2015 UTC,"That just sounds ridiculous. Plenty (if not the vast majority) of people who have been medicated with antidepressants are perfectly capable of understanding you shouldn't crash a plane on purpose. Plus I get the impression you can't do a lot with the training besides being a pilot, so it's not like someone who might urgently seek help would see a lot of alternative career paths. Ugh, this sucks."
SRSDiscussion,30iv3r,itsacoup,4,Fri Mar 27 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly, to both points. And for the second, not only is it pretty damn limiting, but also generally expensive as all hell. You pay for your schooling and your flight hours. Becoming a private pilot--which only legally requires 40 flying hours, by the way, nothing near the 300 required for commercial, and I don't know air transport off the top of my head but it's gotta be more--costs around an average of $8k. Conservatively. Do you wanna lose your job over something you could control but aren't allowed to even acknowledge if you're well north of $100k in debt?  And of course, the cherry on this shit cake is authorities effectively saying ""all people with mental illness are tainted."" Lovely.

Vanilla depression or anxiety that merit treatment of any type are listed under the same umbrella of 'mental health' as someone who is not functional, cannot care for their basic needs, is suicidal or homicidal, etc.   For employers, you cannot evaluate an employee based on a label that isn't even used consistantly in the mental health field. Preformance reviews, personal observations, how well does the employee interact with others, those will tell you more. At the end of the day, you cannot prevent all the terrible things in this world. You can spend hours talking about it, millions of dollars studying it, and crazy people will still be crazy. Some people choose to do evil, and you cannot stop it all.

Someone who has been diagnosed, or just someone who seems a bit off? If they avoid seeking mental health services altogether, does that mean they're sane?  Given the unrealistic expectations you seem to have on the matter, I can guarantee you'd be surprised by how many people you know personally that have had a history of mental illness. We don't carry signs or look weird or have crazy googly eyes.  Yeah, of course I wouldn't want someone in the middle of a psychotic break, with untreated panic disorder or in a manic episode piloting a plane. As mentioned elsewhere, you already have misguided policies for mental health among pilots that actively prevent people from seeking help when they need it based on flimsy premises. So a pilot could never have been medicated with antidepressants for more than six months through their entire lives. I can only speak from personal experience, some knowledge of mental health, and from the people that I know, but nothing about having had depression makes someone incapable of understanding how horrible it is to involve dozens of other people in your own suicide. I'd hazard a guess that having had depression and not treating it (and in your eyes, being mentally capable) would mean you're more irresponsible.  The pilot was incredibly callous. He also had depression and was suicidal. That's on him. Leave the rest of those diagnosed with depression (or the 'mentally ill'/'finicky crazy people') out of it. And go educate yourself a little.

The current mental health care institution is broken, and it will take a lot of money and changes in attitude and behavior of mental health professionals, but it's possible.

Bureaucracy and process are excellent tools for overcoming the implicit biases that we all carry around with us on a day-to-day basis, and work better than just resolving to be fair. This could include anonymizing applicants or creating scoring rubrics to use throughout the hiring process. Essentially, turn hiring into a data-driven process that focuses on aptitudes and omits information about ethnicity, gender, age, etc. Document everything, and hopefully you can crystallize a process that can be passed on to the person who comes after you.  You can also take active steps towards more creating diverse applicant pools. For eaxmple, advertise positions in places where women and people of color will see them, like online communities for women programmers. Make it clear in job postings that you welcome applicants from these groups.  Depending on the nature of your position, you might be serving as the ""HR"" of your compnay. If that's the case, make it clear to new hires that you're someone they can come to with issues of harassment or discrimination. Take it upon yourself to make that a part of your position.  Finally, you should try to let management know about your initiative. They probably won't mind someone taking the time to ensure fair hiring practices, and moreover might be willing to provide resources or support (training, letting you review this process with others who sit in on the hiring process to make sure they are informed, etc)."

If you're able to, try introducing flexitime, job sharing and other methods that allow people with kids/dependants and other commitments to take the job. How will you manage the need for long hours to finish software to a deadline? Can you organise time better to avoid a last minute crunch?  In my field there's a lot of talk about how the long hours make the career path unattractive to women. Some say it's not an issue, but either way it's not ethical to exploit staff to the detriment of the rest of their lives. Everyone has relationships and responsibilities. Support them to have a healthy work-life balance. There are people in my office who work several hours unpaid overtime every day because they're scared of being replaced if they don't. Don't be the boss who creates this atmosphere.  Another issue I have heard of with regards to programming is that people can be overly harsh critiquing other's code, and biases come out and this makes for an awful work environment. A friend of mine often rages that male programmers don't think she can code because she's a woman. A socially just workplace has space for every type of productive employee.  Lastly, make sure you have a thoroughly researched complaints procedure for recruiting (and maybe externally vetted). Last thing you want is a potential hire accusing the company of discrimination and then it blowing up because the complaint is handled badly. Whether well-founded or not, a badly handled complaint can ruin internal moral, create awful publicity, run up huge legal bills etc. etc."

Lol   I see this attitude all the time in workers, this narcissistic ideal that I just have to do the minimum to get by and get my paycheck is a misperception and is based upon old ideals that no longer work in todays economy.   Employers that expect employees that don't have ownership of or say in the company to do anything more than the required minimum are in fact the narcissists. Also what the hell are you vomiting about ""todays economy""? Doing the bare minimum still works perfectly fine and the evidence is all around you.

These units only have a handful of qualities that differentiate them from each other. In my position, these qualities are income, rental history, credit score, and others that would make a good tenant.   In your situation, I would assume that you're looking for a specific skillset, as well as certain attitudes and behaviors that would allow the applicant to integrate well into your working environment.

SRSDiscussion,307gxb,thespectreofcapital,6,Thu Mar 26 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is the norm on College campuses, but on my campus survivors could report (1) to the College, (2) to the Police, or (3) to both at the same time (the police come to the dean's office so the student only needs to report once). Or, of course, (4) not to report.  I generally saw this system as positive, because it gave a decent amount of control to survivors--if a survivor, say, wanted to make sure their rapist wasn't in any of their classes, but didn't want their rapist to go to prison (for whatever reason), they could report to the school but not to police. If they later wanted to report to police, I believe they could. Alternately, a student may wish to report to the police but not the school because once the school is 'on the case,' the survivor cannot stop the process (unlike, in some cases, a police investigation).   The problem, I think, is when the college judicial board starts being seen as a police force. That's not (again, at least on my campus) the intent. Rather, the judicial board actually has a fairly narrow purpose--it makes it fairly easy for a survivor to (1) get a no-contact order (applies only on campus, obviously), (2) ensure they don't enroll in any of their rapist's classes in the future, (3) ensure they don't end up living in the same dorm as their rapist, (4) probably some other things along those lines. All these things are intended to make the survivor's college experience better, or at least liveable. Justice, as it were, isn't really the point. Investigation is necessary to determine what action to take (e.x. overwhelming evidence = expulsion from campus, little evidence = just a no-contact order). The school is concerned about the campus environment and the survivor, but isn't necessarily concerned with rape as crime.   A valid critique of the system, I think, would be that the judicial board does (I believe) its investigation separate from the police, which I think is why the process looks so arcane from the outside."
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,Priorwater,5,Wed Mar 25 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"I completely agree regarding a college's role in limiting contact between the parties involved in a sexual assault case. These measures have a pretty limited impact compared to long term suspension or expulsion of the accused party.  The main issue is whether colleges should be investigating for the purpose of punishment, rather than the protection of a survivor. My opinion is that this aspect of the investigation should be left up to the criminal justice system, which has the resources and expertise to ensure that due process is respected."
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,obstinate_,5,Wed Mar 25 23:52:13 2015 UTC,"It's not an either-or proposition. I certainly agree that the justice system should investigate campus assaults, especially when the victim wants it to. But that does not mean the school might not also have a legitimate interest in the truth. If the victim wants the school involved, why should it not be?  Now, if the school is pressuring the victim not to go to the police, that is some bullshit of the highest order and needs to be stopped immediately."
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,koronicus,19,Thu Mar 26 06:08:20 2015 UTC,"Just to provide some additional context, I've included the relevant section from the full report.    In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming “rape culture” for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out  the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small  percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime.    While that may seem an obvious point, it has tended to get lost in recent debates. This has led to an inclination to focus on particular segments of the student population (e.g., athletes), particular aspects of campus culture (e.g., the Greek system), or traits that are common in many millions of law-abiding Americans (e.g., “masculinity”), rather than on the subpopulation at fault: those who choose to commit rape. This trend has the paradoxical  effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions.    By the time they reach college, most students have been exposed to 18 years of prevention messages, in one form or another. Thanks to repeated messages from parents, religious  leaders, teachers, coaches, the media and, yes, the culture at large, the overwhelming majority of these young adults have learned right from wrong, and enter college knowing  that rape falls squarely in the latter category.    Research supports the view that to focus solely on certain social groups or “types” of students in the effort to end campus sexual violence is a mistake. Dr. David Lisak estimates that three percent of college men are responsible for more than 90% of rapes. Other studies suggest that between 3-7% of college men have committed an act of sexual violence or would consider doing so. It is this relatively small percentage of the population, which  has proven itself immune to years of prevention messages, that we must address in other ways. (Unfortunately, we are not aware of reliable research on female college perpetrators.)  Consider, as well, the findings of another study by Dr. Lisak and colleagues, which surveyed 1,882 male college students and determined that 120 of them were rapists.  Of those determined to be rapists, the majority — 63% — were repeat offenders who admitted to committing multiple sexual assaults. Overall, they found that each offender committed an average of 5.8 sexual assaults. Again, this research supports the fact that more than 90% of college-age males do not, and are unlikely to ever, rape. In fact, we have found that they’re ready and eager to be engaged on these issues.  It’s the other guys (and, sometimes, women) who are the problem.    The point that they seem to be making is that it is a small minority of around 3% who are committing more than 90% of rapes. Since this group seems to be immune to efforts to discourage this behaviour, is it really effective to target the entire male population with prevention campaigns?"
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,koronicus,4,Wed Mar 25 05:29:50 2015 UTC,"I find it incredibly shortsighted to disregard cultural factors when those are so influential in the socialization process. Culture shapes behavior, and that core group of rapists is no exception (they had to become rapists at some point). Yeah, there are probably always going to be people who rape anyway, so individual solutions are absolutely necessary, but talking like they're independent of culture is just bizarre."
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,koronicus,5,Wed Mar 25 05:52:38 2015 UTC,"Rape culture doesn't exist by its own virtue creating rapists out of thin air or even shaping them from innocent people; rapists create rape culture by finding affirmation wherever they can and using it to cultivate their identities, justify their behavior, and send enabling messages to those who aspire, consciously or not, to be like them.   Sure, but their attempts at minimizing or finding support for their own behavior don't take place in a cultural vacuum.   Rape culture doesn't create rapists, it shapes and enables them.   I don't think these are mutually exclusive options. The attitudes that encourage or enable people to engage in nonconsensual activities under a screen of ""it's not really rape"" create circumstances that lead to rape, which I would call rape culture creating rapists. Yes, many of those attitudes are propagated by rapists themselves, but they have to be filtered through other people (culture) in order to be successful."
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,koronicus,3,Wed Mar 25 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"I get the impression you're used to this conversation going a certain direction because I feel like you're talking past me a bit. I don't know what singling out a single institution has to do with anything. The context of this thread is one kind of institution, so that's what I've focused on. Naturally rape culture is much larger, and yeah, it needs to be addressed on many different fronts.  I fundamentally disagree that one institution can't affect rape culture, especially one whose primary purpose is education of all things. Yeah, universities can't singlehandedly end it, especially using only the single tool of sexual assault tribunals, but who seriously expects them to? Certainly not me.  Psychology, family, and so on are shaped by cultural factors. Yes, individual choice exists, and people can choose to commit heinous acts regardless of the social context, but the consequences (legal, social, or financial) of an action affect how many people choose to do it. Culture isn't the sole relevant variable, but it's still a part.  I've never said universities are to blame for rape culture. Rape culture can't be attributed to any single institution. The actions an institution takes can facilitate or challenge it, to be sure, but there are many different causes throughout different levels of society. Universities are in a particularly powerful position to challenge it, however, and we're only even having this conversation because many of them have recognized that they do have a problem and some means to address it."
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,koronicus,3,Wed Mar 25 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean here, could you clarify? I sense you're implying there's some very significant idea that I'm missing.   Well, for example, you say things like   Again, you're right, but this is still only a half-truth.   and then go on to say things I agree with and don't believe I contradicted, and it's a bit confusing. Partially explained by   This is what the original RAINN release was addressing   as I was interpreting you as responding to something I'd said, not RAINN.   ""single institution""    And here, I think we may have been operating under different interpretations of ""institution,"" which may be on me for not being clear enough that I had in mind the ""aggregate social structure"" sense there, as in ""universities collectively.""   Most rapists aren't fraternity brothers   This is also confusing because to the best of my knowledge, I've never insinuated such a thing. I agree that assuming frat members are the perpetrators of a majority of campus rapes would be unjustified and overly hasty. It's conceivably true, but I'm not inclined to assume it in the absence of evidence.   But focusing on cultural influences when determining practical policy and public discussion designed to protect the safety of potential victims and generate awareness among the public can compromise the potential effectiveness of these policies and debates.   If RAINN had said ""I don't think we should be talking about these important things in this particular context,"" I'd have been less bothered by the statement. I think it's foolish to try to exclude cultural influences from a discussion about policy since they have a mutually causal relationship (if that makes sense? they both shape each other).  Trying to limit a discussion of rape culture on campus to frats would be ridiculous. Culture is a big subject, and systemic problems take a lot of work to tease out. Confusing one part of rape culture for the whole, or assuming that fixing one big problem would fix the whole thing, would be problematic.  I'm curious, though: do you believe that any discussion of cultural influences in the context of ""practical policy and public discussion designed to protect the safety of potential victims"" is likely to ""compromise the potential effectiveness of these policies and debates"" or only poorly formed attempts to do so? If the latter, what would a properly formed attempt look like in your eyes?"

Just because universities are not criminal courts and are not legally obliged to offer these protections does not mean that they shouldn't be. As RAINN points out:   While we respect the seriousness with which many schools treat such internal processes, and the good intentions and good faith of many who devote their time to participating in such processes, the simple fact is that these internal boards were designed to adjudicate charges like plagiarism, not violent felonies. The crime of rape just does not fit the capabilities of such boards. They often offer the worst of both worlds: they lack protections for the accused while often tormenting victims.   We urge the federal government to explore ways to ensure that college and universities treat allegations of sexual assault as they would murder and other violent felonies. The fact that the criminal justice process is difficult and imperfect, while true, is not sufficient justification for bypassing it in favor of an internal system that will never be up to the challenge."

Criminal rules are designed to be particularly strict because of the seriousness of a conviction. University penalties don't go beyond expulsion, so they're not equivalent.  ""Beyond a reasonable doubt"" is specifically designed to be a particularly difficult hurdle to overcome. It's not appropriate outside a criminal context, which is why, for example, civil law doesn't adhere to it. (OJ Simpson, anyone?) It's weighted in the accused's defense, and I don't see any reason why a university should weight anything beyond the raw evidence they have."

There is an inherent bias in the university conducting and adjudicating the investigation, since the result can affect their reputation and public image. If a case has not publicized, there will be pressure to minimize publicity in order to preserve the university's public image. On the other hand, if the case has received wide public scrutiny, there will be pressure to punish the accused, in order to reassure future students and parents that rape is taken seriously.  In addition, how can we expect a university committee, which generally deals with academic matters of plagiarism or cheating, to effectively provide all of the judicial checks and balances of a real court of law? What about questions of admissibility of evidence or testimony? The right to counsel? I'm not a lawyer, but I have read articles by lawyers on the subject, and it creates a whole lot of problems that do not have simple solutions.   The fact that we have centuries of jurisprudence on these topics in the criminal justice system, and have access to all of the expertise and knowledge of law enforcement and legal experts, makes a compelling case for dealing with these matters through the criminal justice system."

There's never going to be a guarantee that they're going to handle the situation properly, so I guess it's a question of what elements are necessary and to what degree they're present in each case.   how can we expect a university committee, which generally deals with academic matters of plagiarism or cheating, to effectively provide all of the judicial checks and balances of a real court of law? What about questions of admissibility of evidence or testimony? The right to counsel?   We shouldn't expect them to. Different standards apply for different legal contexts, and since no criminal penalties are possible as a result of a university investigation, there's no reason to treat them like criminal cases.   The fact that we have centuries of jurisprudence on these topics in the criminal justice system, and have access to all of the expertise and knowledge of law enforcement and legal experts, makes a compelling case for dealing with these matters through the criminal justice system.   And the fact that the modern criminal justice system fails miserably in handling cases of rape and sexual assault suggests that relying on it without substantial revisions would be foolish."

Except these cases aren't even being treated as legal cases. Even in a civil case, you can have an attorney present, there are rules for discovery of evidence, and a clear appeal process. The system ensures that there will be due process, unlike in a university tribunal.   We shouldn't expect them to. Different standards apply for different legal contexts, and since no criminal penalties are possible as a result of a university investigation, there's no reason to treat them like criminal cases.   Let's say someone is unjustly expelled by such a tribunal. They now have on their record that they were expelled for sexual misconduct. What university would accept their transfer? This means that they have potentially lost up to four years of their degree, which in just tuition alone could easily approach $200,000.  If they are unable to complete their degree due to this situation, they are looking at a lifetime loss of earning potential that could easily enter seven figures. Sure, their liberty may not be on the line, but they are still looking at a massive financial loss. In my opinion, the severity of the potential consequences necessitates that a higher standard of due process be followed."
SRSDiscussion,307gxb,koronicus,2,Wed Mar 25 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"The system ensures that there will be due process, unlike in a university tribunal.   That is one benefit of having a core national standard for trials (even though states/localities may differ), which doesn't exist in universities. Another is that courts have more power than universities to gather evidence. Systematicity and evidence-gathering power are both arguments in favor of having courts handle things, but again, the legal system has shown a really awful track record at handling rape cases, so something's got to give somewhere.   Let's say someone is unjustly expelled by such a tribunal.   Wrongful verdicts aren't unique to universities. Of course someone unjustly expelled has been wronged, and in some cases, the harm will be egregious.  Inaction can also lead to wrongs, with a rapist continuing to victimize while the legal system does nothing. There is no situation in which wrongful harm can be completely avoided, so it's a question of striking a proper balance more than anything else.  For perspective, civil cases can lead to multi-million dollar losses as a result of a ""yes, this seems slightly more likely than not"" standard of evidence.   What university would accept their transfer?   By this, your implication is that no university would. I don't think this would be a realistic interpretation, though I do grant that it may give some (many? perhaps even most?) pause, and I wouldn't at all be surprised to see a university try to impose additional behavioral restrictions onto such a person.   In my opinion, the severity of the potential consequences necessitates that a higher standard of due process be followed.   I agree with you that these situations are fraught. Their consequences either way can be dire, so the process does need to be taken seriously. I don't agree that ""take these cases seriously"" necessitates the emulation of a criminal court or refusing to act independently of criminal courts."

I'm pretty sure kicking a rapist off campus isn't going to stop them from raping other people...  I suppose at the end of the day, my view of this is that universities should stick to doing what they do best: teaching, and engaging in a supporting role for survivors when necessary.

The punishment here is just being expelled from school, not a prison sentence, so that could be an acceptable tradeoff when the benefits include protecting rape victims and reducing the overall incidence of rape. But it is a tradeoff, expelling innocent people is clearly a negative outcome.  Is that what you're saying here? That the tradeoff is worth it?"

SRSDiscussion,307gxb,WorkshopVillage,4,Thu Mar 26 01:09:02 2015 UTC,"Colleges are creating a new court system and people are proposing a standard of evidence for a particular type of case lower than that which has been used for many years. I don't see why it's surprising that this attracts more debate than long-standing legal precedent.  Criminal cases use a higher standard than civil cases because the punishment is more severe, and because the punishment in a civil case can actually be useful to the victim. When you throw a murderer in jail, the victim doesn't come back to life, but if a fraudster gives back your money, you could be made perfectly whole again. Since the downside of the punishment is a civil case is less bad, and the upside better, the tradeoff changes and it makes sense to have a different standard of evidence.  I was asking if /u/koronicus thinks that the costs and benefits of expelling rapists are different enough from those of throwing them in jail to warrant a lower standard of evidence.  Now that I've spelled it out, I'm partially convinced that they are different enough. Certainly the downside of expelling a student is not as bad as locking them up, and keeping their rapist away from them provides at least some benefit to the victim.  On the other hand, can't that benefit be obtained with just a regular restraining order, which already has a much lower standard of evidence? We already have a legal system than can provide that, don't we?  I dunno, designing a legal system is hard.  Edit: also, you already can sue a rapist in civil court for emotional distress, assault, etc., and that has its correspondingly lower standard of evidence. Why don't colleges just direct victims there (with appropriate resources and support of course) instead of constructing a separate court system?  Edit #2: actually, I have no more qualms about the standard of evidence issue. A college tribunal deciding a rape case is basically a civil case, not a criminal one. I maintain that having a separate court system is still unnecessary and possibly counterproductive, but not because they use a lower standard of evidence than a criminal trial."

I'm nowhere near educated enough on the subject, but I do wonder how practical and effective it would be to rely on civil courts to adjudicate these matters. I suspect there'd still be some kind of chilling effect, where victims wouldn't want to jump through the legal hoops and thus decline to report their assaults, but that's a question of degree. There's also a question of speed (how long does a tribunal take versus a civil trial?).

SRSDiscussion,30604m,NowThatsAwkward,12,Tue Mar 24 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"[I suffer from mental illness (depression, anxiety, & ADHD), but my mental problems are not immediately apparent & I'm otherwise nearly as privileged as can be, so the following necessarily reflects all of that]  When it comes to ableism and such I think a lot of people want to draw a parallel between words like ""crazy"" and ""insane"" on one hand and ""retarded"" and other terms for intellectual disability on the other. However, as you've pointed out, ""crazy"" (and I'd add ""insane"", ""bonkers"", ""mad"" and such to the list) are often used in a positive manner, while ""retarded"" rarely, if ever, is. A much more apt parallel to ""retarded"" would be something like ""psychotic""- when someone calls someone else psychotic, it's almost never a compliment*.  Further along the ""psychotic"" thread, notice, too, that when someone really means to call someone mentally ill as an insult or to otherwise put someone down or tarnish their reputation, that they don't use the word ""crazy""; they pull out the medical or pseudo-medical jargon**.  That's a long way of saying that I'm not sure there's much to reclaim in the word ""crazy"". I call myself crazy and if it's a situation where I feel comfortable mentioning my mental illnesses I don't hesitate to clarify that I'm, like, literally crazy.  Also, since crazy is succinct, to-the-point, sidesteps having to list of a string of scary-sounding diagnoses, and has much milder/playful connotations than a lot of the stigmatized medical jargon, I think that using it more openly has the potential to reduce stigma, or, at the very least, not worsen it.  *it's also almost never used correctly; psychosis is losing contact with reality, while people often use it when they mean psychopathic  ** and probably use the jargon incorrectly"
SRSDiscussion,30604m,tlacomixle,8,Tue Mar 24 22:44:31 2015 UTC,"""retarded"" rarely, if ever, is   It made a very mainstream appearance but thankfully didn't managed to escape whatever obscure music subculture usage it has.   when someone really means to call someone mentally ill as an insult or to otherwise put someone down or tarnish their reputation, that they don't use the word ""crazy""   ""Crazy"" doesn't feel harsh enough to be used as a really demeaning insult, but I think its relative mildness means it can be used to subtly discredit somebody in a more restrained atmosphere, for example, in the workplace.  ""I know Fred said he could do that, but can you really trust him?  The guy is a little crazy.  No, seriously, he sees a shrink.""  Whatever Fred's mental health issue is, calling him ""crazy"" inflates it into a general lack of credibility."
SRSDiscussion,30604m,MySilverWhining,7,Tue Mar 24 23:26:03 2015 UTC,"I think the example you gave is more about the stigma of mental illness than the word ""crazy"", and addressing the stigma and increasing awareness would be more useful. It's easy to get overly hung up on words when the broader culture is what's relevant. Crazy's problem in this case is just that it's being used to identify someone as part of a stigmatized group; saying ""the guy is mentally ill"" or ""the guy has a mental illness"" would accomplish the same thing. It's not being used like n***** and c*** often are, where the using the word itself is stating things about that group. I think when considering whether a label is problematic it's important to consider why it is problematic to use some labels."

SRSDiscussion,30604m,snerrymunster,10,Wed Mar 25 22:46:06 2015 UTC,"The way I see ""crazy"" going is that people don't have a problem with using the word, as long as it isn't applied to mental illness.  It's hard to sum up what it means, but it seems to be used to describe someone who acts without regard to something that most people would take into account.    It can be used to criticize someone's judgment:  ""That dude is crazy!  He's selling pills across the street from the police station!""  Or used in admiration of someone's courage:  ""That dude is crazy!  He's publishing an article accusing the regime of kidnapping journalists!""  Or a combination of both:  ""That dude is crazy!  He has two broken ribs and wants to go back in the game!""  And of course it's often used to describe the large or small irrationalities that afflict us in romance:    ""I know this is a little crazy, but can you please close the blinds when I come over?  I can't help feeling inadequate seeing your ex on the Calvin Klein billboard across from your apartment.""  ""That person snapping pictures from the other side of the restaurant?  That's just my crazy ex.  Congrats, you're going to be on Instagram under half a dozen insulting hashtags.""  Personally, the only time I slip and use ""crazy"" to refer to mental illness is when I'm talking about myself, and I try not to do that.  I've never thought about reclaiming it the way queer has been reclaimed, because I know some people take it harder than I do.  Besides, like you said, it's hard to ""reclaim"" a word whose pejorativeness depends entirely on context, and which is just as often positive as negative."
SRSDiscussion,30604m,MySilverWhining,7,Tue Mar 24 23:07:02 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, the ""positive"" uses of ""crazy"" are essentially equivalent to ""positive stereotypes""—which, of course, aren't all that positive.  For example, ""that party was crazy"" implicitly forms a link between a wild party and an ableist perception of mentally ill people as being wild, loud, and out of control.  As you said, it's generally used to mean atypical in some sort of way. But even if the connotation is positive, it still is based off ableist ways of viewing mental illness.  An analogy might be, for example, calling someone who's good with money a Jew. It's a ""positive stereotype"", but it has roots in the antisemitic view of Jews as money-controlling conspirators.  In addition, these uses make me personally uncomfortable as a person with OCD and misophonia.  I'm not against reclaimation, but I don't think this is the way to go about it."

SRSDiscussion,2zyw6r,95RJ,5,Mon Mar 23 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"On one hand, the now-vetoed decision to ban the American flag had the feel of student government run amok, as budding iconoclasts tried to make a statement about the moral complexities they're learning in History 101. Flags are ""flown in instances of colonialism and imperialism"" and they ""serve as symbols of patriotism or weapons for nationalism,"" the statement explaining the original ban noted.   Haha yeah classic college.    On a more serious note:  (1) Banning a symbol like the American flag can only serve to give the symbol more power. At the same time, though, I understand the impulse to do ""something"" about/with the flag, because symbols such as the flag do have great power. While it's true that a sheet of cloth doesn't 'advocate violence,' it has, historically and in the present, been imbued with the values of groups that do advocate violence, so one must be at least wary of the flag.   (2) I think the idea of banning/denying/destroying a symbol as large as the American flag is misguided. Regardless of whether one prefers activism within the system or total systems change, the American flag must be divested of its imperialist values first and foremost. Once the symbol has been weakened, then, I think, it could be either reinvigorated with new values or destroyed outright. But not before.   If UC Irvine activists are seriously interested in disrupting the American Flag's values, maybe there are other options:  1.) Hang another flag along side the American flag, say a Native American flag, maybe for the Luiseño and Cupeño peoples of the Pala Indian Reservation fairly close to Irvine (different counties, though: Irvine is in Orange County, whereas Pala is in northern San Diego county), although I'm having trouble finding symbology for the tribe, so the idea might not actually hold water. Here's an image, at least. Or a rainbow flag.   2.) Post, or start a discussion about, images of Americans sporting flags but enacting more positive values.   3.) Others?  Unrelated, but interesting, I found this image from 1970 of a ""pro-American rally"", made as a sort of counter-protest to show support for the war in Vietnam.

On the subject of the flag in general: I've been at a lot of rallies where the flag was burned.  It was fun and I generally support anti-nationalism and anti-imperialism; but I will concede that it can be an alienating action.    Ultimately, though, I think flag-wavers need to understand just how hateful people can find the US flag, in the context of the massive amounts of tyranny, bloodshed, violence, and poverty that US-lead imperial policies have created across the Third World.  I don't think this stuff can be brushed aside easily, particularly if you come from a country that has been adversely affected by the US (and there are many in this category).

Or are they like the white progressive mainline Protestants who are only interested in the liberal parts of feminism and compartmentalize their faith to avoid having to deal with the fact that capitalism and Christianity are incompatible?  I associate those kinds of economic justice efforts with evangelical Protestant and predominantly poor, Latin@ Catholic groups. And, largely because of white supremacy within the mainstream gay rights and liberal feminist movements, these groups tend to not be as friendly to queer identities or as egalitarian toward women (although there is more variety on the women front).

I don't think less of the Neon Tree's singer for identifying as Mormon, I don't think less of OP for identifying with Islam, I don't think less of you for identifying as Christian. The fault lies with the bigots within those organizations.  I believe the Mormon church is a scheme designed to control and extort money from it's members and it's also an institution that perpetuates white supremacy, cis/het-normativity, sexism, and other forms of hate and bigotry, negatives that far outweigh any granted happiness to individual members. But that's not Tyler Glenn's fault. Your specific christian church probably does not fall under the above description.  OP stated above that they are indeed having ""cognitive dissonance"" between their specific sexual and specific religious identities.  That cognitive dissonance does not exist inherently by being a religious LGBT person. That cognitive dissonance can occur in a straight, cisgender, white male raised in a Mormon household. I'm offering advice based on my personal experience.  I know exactly what you're trying to say and I'm not trying to make blanket statements here. Discussing and criticizing religious identity is going to hurt a lot of feelings unintentionally but I promise you I personally understand the nuance.

I'm Hindu (and also an atheist), and Hinduism has had many upheavals and reformist movements just in the last few centuries, particularly from people born into ""lower-caste"" positions.

Technically Leviticus condemns two men having sex in a woman's bed (which is interpreted as meaning that one enacts the role of woman, but could just as easily be interpreted as a violation of a private gendered space).  Your quote of Paul saying that God will turn straight people gay for idolatry is the only actual mention of homosexuality in the NT.  Not explicitly a condemnation.  An acknowledgement that it would subjectively be a bad thing to happen for most straight men.  So would being turned into a woman, but that doesn't mean being a woman is immoral."

We do those people a disservice when we automatically assume that they must choose between their beliefs and their queerness, as if the two are always mutually incompatible.  This is especially true when we come to the topic of Islam. Christianity and Judaism rarely receive the same type scrutiny in these spaces. If all you know about Islam and homosexuality is that ""the Qu'ran condemns it"", I suggest you do a little more digging into the ways in which queer Muslims all over the world have navigated this problem before assuming the two cannot co-exist.  For us to offhandedly dismiss the efforts of queer Muslims as ""incompatible with Islam/queerness"" is unacceptable in a space that is meant to encourage thought, discussion, and exploration. It erases the existence of queer people who are faithful. This is true whether you are Muslim or not. This is true whether you are queer or not.

Homosexuality is explicitly labelled as a sin in the Quran, and is punishable by a multitude of hadith. Pretending that it is A-OK to be a gay muslim  is a mockery of the beliefs of 99.9% of muslims around the world.  If you're tired of having to constantly defend your faith, stop dressing up...

But whenever I see there's a groups of guys doing dawah on the high street, it's always the white revert who is dressed up like an extra in Lawrence of Arabia.  As for monolithic religions... Yes, and no. Compare Christian teachings against homosexuality. It's vaguely but not specifically bad in the old testament, there are going to be objections to translation, then there's Jesus' teachings of ignoring some of the old laws anyway, plus he never mentioned homosexuality (which you think he would do, if it was a terrible sin?), fair enough Paul has a bit against it, but he wasn't the son of god was he? ... There's enough wiggle room for a modern Christian to reasonably interpret the bible as being not entirely contrary to the idea of same-sex attraction.  Whereas the quran explicitly states that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of homosexuality, and the prophet clearly commanded several times that homosexual acts are a punishable offence. I find it hard to see any possible alternative interpretations... Indeed the only disagreement in scholarly Islamic circles is the degree of punishment."

Your convert in the second paragraph would be rather idiosyncratic because conversion to Judaism is relatively rare and someone who wears a kippah but doesn't keep kosher is extremely unusual, at least in my interpretation.   There's a lot more about faith than following rules literally. I say this as a current atheist who still sometimes goes to synagogue and has found it to be tremendously fulfilling.

It's not always with regard to rapists. Sometimes it's people who use/are addicted to drugs, sometimes it is cops. There's a particularly horrible photoset of some riot cops on fire that's been circulating recently. The phrases ""shoot rapists not heroin"" and ""kill your local drug dealer"" also seem to be semi-popular, at least among some folks.  What I'm saying is that, no shit, it's bad to rape someone. No shit, police are basically inherently complicit in horrific violence and oppression. No shit, addiction is a horrible thing to endure, for the folks who use the drugs and for those around them. But it seems like with this sort of ""edgy"" rhetoric, people aren't taking care to separate the people from the behavior/ideas.   And it seems to create an irredeemable individual (who loses humanity and therefore the right to not be tortured/killed) instead of recognizing the behaviors/ideas as a set of something larger and much more complicated that needs to be fixed over a very long term.  Vengeance isn't justice. Justice isn't simple, and it doesn't make a good slogan or a good patch, and it can be slow and grueling and incredibly messy.

I think it's great for marginalized group to have a place where they can vent frustration about aggressors.  It's just important to remember that venting frustration and achieving equality are not the same thing.

""Justice"" is a Rorschach test in online activist communities. The left has never really had a concise strategy, it is more of a hobbled together group of coalitions with shared priorities, hoping to make progress through solidarity. We agree on the problems, not the solutions. Unfortunately, with issues so complex and nuanced, with no agreement on the solution,  the most fervent and radical have a platform to simplify the issue, and be rewarded for it. This can lead to dogmatic and anti-intellectual in-group, out-group thinking where debate is not only deemed futile, but offensive to the cause. With us or against us.  These debates have to happen though, because the more information we have, the better the message will be, and the more likely we build coalitions, to make that progress. Oftentimes it gets ugly (take the recent post in trigger warnings for example, in which I argued against mandidated trigger warnings as an infringement of free expression - to me, this was the more progressive stance but obviously, many disagreed.)  Violence is not the solution. Violence does not build coaltions, it destroys them. Some clearly disagree here, but they are wrong.

You don't have to go far to find hundreds of instances where a violent uprising for justice backfired into something far worse than the status quo (such as autocracy, which always seems to find a way into that void.)

SRSDiscussion,2zrx5p,SapphireAndIce,11,Sun Mar 22 00:20:18 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue is that people are often drawn to social justice by either a positive or negative bent - they either want to focus on helping those who need it or they want to focus on harming or hating those they find deserving. The negative side is, for many people, both easier and more fun. Helping people is hard - you have to think carefully about how to do so and then put the active effort into doing it. Yelling abuse and insults, on the other hand, is very easy and satisfying and doesn't take a whole lot of forethought.  That's not to say everyone should be all nicey nice all the time, that's unrealistic. But there are some people who earnestly seem like they're just in it for the enthusiastic hating and find the helping and caring for others bit kind of a drag. The format of reddit contributes to this, as it's easier for a short, simple and strongly worded rallying cry to garner a lot of upvotes and reinforce less nuanced views.   Maybe it's naive of me, but I guess I just wish I saw more people talking enthusiastically about how to help people or relieve suffering and less people happily gathering for the Two Minutes Hate"

Bring those ideas and principles and language online, where a lot of people engaging don't have any background other than the community they find online, and you get such a wide spectrum of responses - you get thoughtful discussion spaces and you get people who are new trying to figure out their ideas and language and you get people who like to be loud and provocative and you get trolls. You certainly don't get coherence.   The other thing the internet gives is distance. in that screengrab of that news article and the tumblr reblog comments, there's no context. Without any kind of context, there's not a real person in that story, there's an abstract ""rapist."" I don't think the people who reblogged that or posted it on SRSFunny registered they were mocking a person who had been murdered - they were mocking a vague personification of rape culture.   So there's no coherent philosophy behind ""internet social justice"" because there's no one coherent ""internet social justice"" movement. As long as the most provocative or least experienced voices aren't people's only exposure to social justice (and often I fear that's exactly what happens), I'm not sure there does actually need to be an overarching organizing philosophy beyond the basic tenants of social justice itself."

On the other hand, the Union soldiers, including ex-slaves incorporated into the army, were members of the working class used as pawns by the state to further their geopolitical interests, as with just about every war in modern times.   Who is the oppressor here, then? The North, or the South? Should the Union soldiers fight both, then? But how could they have won the war? It would only have brought more destruction upon themselves.

I'm also sympathetic to some people who go beyond that, but I still think they're doing wrong. It's like those parents you occasionally see on TV demanding incredibly harsh treatment of people who accidentally killed their children.  To apply that to your civil war example, it would be justified for a potential northern soldier to resist conscription violently to the extent that was actually necessary to evade conscription (and then run away to Canada or something, I'm not clear on the specific dynamics)  It would not have been justified for the Union Soldiers to organize to overthrow the U.S government and establish a more just order while they were engaged in fighting the South.  I also think as outsiders we should give a substantial benefit of the doubt to people actually fighting about whether what they're doing is justified, but I do think that's a better standard to go by than just supporting violence by the oppressed against oppressors."

Non-violence is a piece of theatre. You need an audience. What can you do when you have no audience? People have the right to resist annihilation.   And in those cases, of course, violence is very much merited. Not simply for those who are hungry, but for anyone whose survival and well-being depends on it.  I think that the issue falls apart when -- at least in the kinds of online communities that OP mentions -- people divide into two distinct camps. Violence becomes an all-or-nothing matter; some folks are entirely pacifistic, others feel violence is justified in many situations. Neither of those groups seems to take a very nuanced approach to understanding violence, or to be honest, the complexities of the perpetrators and their transgressions.   Of course this does not apply to everyone, but it seems that understanding of passivity, forceful self-advocacy, and vengeance are rarely untangled and understood as such."

The Black Panthers (armed revolutionary communists) came after the Civil Rights Movement (respectable non-violent liberals).  Even the Civil Rights Movement itself was underpinned by increasingly violent riots in all the major cities. The last phase of the Indian Independence Movement during the '40s was consistently of a violent, revolutionary character; a clear escalation to the largely non-violent protests in the '20s and '30s.  There was a major insurrection in 1942, a formal military struggle from '43-'44 headed by the nationalist Indian National Army, and a naval mutiny by nationalists in '46.  All of these involved violent riots where colonial officials were murdered and government buildings were looted and torched. Some African countries successfully used non-violence to secure political independence; but after major massacres of peaceful nationalists in South Africa, Guinea-Bissau, and Angola, armed guerrilla struggles against the colonial system was launched across most countries in Southern Africa. Nepal's theocracy passed sweeping democratic reforms in the early '90s after peaceful movements through the '80s; but after it was clear that political reforms did very little to address the power of the country's oligarchs and monarchs, a guerrilla war was launched by communists which lasted from 1996 to 2006, after which the monarchy was fully overthrown and actual democratic institutions were created."

I don't know if I'd say ""most"".  The violent revolutions which come to mind are Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola and Namibia.  Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho did not have the same kind of guerrilla or civil war, and arguably are better off for that.  If you travel to Botsawana and then Mozambique the difference is stark.  Violent revolutions tend to install dictators and to become about pre-colonial ethnic conflicts once in power.  Most people in the West tend to think Zimbabwe is messed up, but until you see the legless children on the side of the road in Mozambique, the bullet-riddled communist monuments, the way there are no more lights at night as you cross the border... it's a whole other level.

And also, let's not forget that there was an insurgency in South Africa, and that way they were using Angola and Nambia as staging grounds was a key reason why South Africa was so heavily involved in invading and intervening in its northern neighbors.    I think its also important to take int account the disparity between Portuguese and British colonies.  The Portuguese colonial government was far, far more ruthless and extractive than the British; they had no intention of letting go of their colonial possessions and the only reason they did was because a left-wing military coup in Portugal toppled the fascist government in 1974 due to widespread discontent over the colonial war."

What does that mean exactly?  As I said in the main post, I recognize the value of violent revolution. MLK and Gandhi's actions, too, though peaceful, succeeded in the context of a constant threat of violence. But obviously we can't just blindly mob officers, or burn rapists. That will accomplish nothing. A revolution is not merely violence, violence is only a tool of revolution. We need to use that tool wisely, we need to identify when it is misapplied, and when we misapply it that needs to be criticized! All of this depends on a reliable theory.

But yes, I agree that liberalism can only ever be incoherent as a theoretical framework.    Unprincipled peace is violence? What does that mean exactly?   It means that this peace is in itself violence, because this 'peace' is only understood in liberal terms.    MLK and Gandhi's actions, too, though peaceful, succeeded in the context of a constant threat of violence.   The worshiping of MLK and Gandhi lacks nuance. These were not the only men active in their respective struggles (many others fighting the same fight were violent so that MLK & Gandhi didn't have to be), and neither were they so quick to dismiss violence as people typically seem to believe.

More specifically, the pragmatic fact that leftist violence hasn't tended to do shit in a macro sense. While I equally would not condemn violence on a micro scale, particularly historically as it concerns the liberation of colonized peoples, I don't think it's as simple a question as saying carte blanche that oppressed people have a right to use violence. Although I strongly believe that many/most condemnations of violence are rooted in a reactionary discomfort with threats to the status quo, it doesn't seem unreasonable to start from an axiom that violence in a vacuum is a net bad thing.  So while I would urge the liberals to understand where violence comes form and to recognize the structural violence occurring around them that often goes unnoticed, there seems to be a big difference to me between recognizing the sources of violence and recognizing it as a ""right"" of the oppressed. That is to say, violence may be understandable, but when it achieves nothing and only spurs an equal and opposite reaction against the oppressed, that's a problem, politically, ethically, etc.  Now you're a Maoist, so I understand that your'e likely to disagree about the possibility of revolution, but this is my point: it's possible to be against violence from a position of pragmatism--i.e. a question of the possibility of revolution--rather than some ""enlightened"" liberal position.

That's fine, and that's maybe a debate worth having, but for anyone who doesn't believe in the ultimate success of this sort of violence, the fact that it has negative outcomes generates more nuance than you seem willing to admit. Again, there's a huge gulf between condemning all violence from a position of ""peace"" and imagining it as a right.

Again, I'm not trying to suggest the naive liberal position that consequences are the only thing worth evaluating as that leads to an incredibly risk averse mindset in which suffering under oppression is preferable to taking any action. To put it more distinctly, I think that if we are going to frame things in terms of rights rhetoric, it only makes sense to say that the motivation towards violence is a right--i.e. there is no specific obligation to endure ""pacifism"" which is what the moral superstructure of liberalism would demand."

They laughed, I laughed, and as soon as the door shut, I said to my wife, ""What the FUCK did I just say?!? And why did we all laugh at it?!?! What the hell is wrong with me???""  It's those kinds of things that I see in myself sometimes, and I know that they're in other people too. That's why I'm so vocally against racism. I don't want my son to grow up knowing that his father was a neo-nazi in high school. I don't want my son to grow up thinking that his father has any prejudices whatsoever.   Because I'm constantly fighting this battle inside myself against the prejudices that I was taught growing up.  I don't want to teach him what I was taught growing up. I want to teach him the opposite."

Of course instituationalized discrimination is worse than individualized racism, but that doesn't in any way take away from the fact that both are incredibly wrong. MOre than that, it's pretty damn hard to judge just how far-reaching the consequences of either are, especially when we're dealing with social constructs.  By and large, being and white and/or male will, in theory, provides you certain privileges/freedoms that others don't have. But that doesn't mean that their class devalues whatever discrimination they face either.  Mr. White is the foreman at the local construction contractor and discriminates against asian people because he doesn't think they work as hard as white people. That's bigotry.  Mrs. Woman leads the HR department of the regional government office and discriminates against men because she doesn't think they can multi-task as well as women. That's bigotry.  The point I'm trying to make is that it doesn't matter how much power one class may/may not wield over another, because reality is that in the 21st century people from all different races, religions, classes, etc hold power in some form or another, and the fact that some of them abuse that power to discriminate is wrong.

SRSDiscussion,2zpilk,taco_roco,-6,Fri Mar 20 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"The problem with your example is that the thing that actually hurts minorities is not one person doing this, it's everyone doing this. One person at one job being a jerk is pretty meaningless. A women discriminating against men doesn't hurt men. It might hurt you, as a man, a little, but it doesn't hurt men in general.   Even you personally can just get another job somewhere else where that particular person is not in charge of hiring decisions. Minorities can't do that because there is no particular person who is harming them; it is the entire society that collectively discriminates against them and the individuals that perpetuate it might not even realize they're doing anything discriminatory.  This is not to say it's okay to discriminate against anyone, only that it's certainly not true to say ""discrimination affects everyone"" or ""everyone should be treated equally in how we deal with it"" because it really doesn't affect majority groups in the same way it affects minority groups."
SRSDiscussion,2zpilk,BlackHumor,13,Fri Mar 20 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"I'll say I absolutely agree with you that minorities, women, etc. do face greater discrimination as a whole, this is simple fact. But letting that take away from discrimination that the 'majority' faces is only going to make discrimination worse down the line.  Mrs. Woman doesn't just stop at one man. She will continue to discriminate, and Man A, B and C will face the same problems. If she fires 1 man because of his gender, then's she going to do it to others. And if there isn't a Ms. Lady and Dr. Femme doing the same thing I'd be surprised. That's multiple men affected by multiple people. Take this issue to any other instance and you'll some shitty person with a pattern of doing shitty things. And you'll find plenty of people like that, regardless of race/gender/sex, etc.   Even you personally can just get another job somewhere else...   This whole paragraph is one big assumption. You take an individual and isolate their discrimination as if it would never happen again, to anyone else... but then 180 and say that because someone is a minority they will be affected by it everywhere they go? They are not perma-victims. Mr White's racism is his burden to bear alone, please don't project that onto everyone who shares a trait with him.  You and I are both a part of society, and there are many like us who don't judge people based on their skin colour - who wouldn't abuse their power to fit their agenda. On the other side of that, there are those like Mr. White and Mrs. Woman who do, and they're part of society too.  I'm not implying that the majority's discrimination is equal to the minority's; I am saying that we need to place greater emphasis on the fact that it still exists for all types of people in some degree, and they're aren't isolated issues. It very much exists, and isn't something that any one group owns.  And saying that a man losing his job because of a sexist woman is his own problem and only affects him, flies in the face of that and is not what equality is about."

Back to my example from before: it's easy to imagine American communists who hate capitalism and capitalists. They definitely do exist; I've met people like that before, and it's possible you have too. But in America, they really have no impact. Unless you're extraordinarily unlucky you won't notice they exist unless you deliberately search for them.  Compare this to communism in the Soviet Union and there's a big difference. There it was sort of taken for granted that capitalism sucked and admitting you were a capitalist there was tantamount to admitting you were a communist here. Communism as a societal force did things that no number of individual communists could have ever done.  Racism is also like that. Societal racism is not a single person being mean or discriminatory, or even such a group of people. Societal racism has taken on an entirely different character. Discrimination against black people is not merely more common than discrimination against white people, it's an entirely different thing with entirely different effects."

SRSDiscussion,2zpilk,airs_eight_white,11,Fri Mar 20 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"I think the methods of this study are just ill-suited to its goals. In trying to achieve a quantified (and therefore somehow more objective or valuable) result, they lost any feel for nuance or context. SRS being a big example of that. As you said, SRS is a network and SRSprime is set up with to do a very particular thing, which SRSters themselves can't even agree on most of the time. Compounding that, there is no information on the degree to which the human annotators were familiar with Reddit or the communities they were evaluating--this makes a big difference! Instead of eliminating bias, as I think crowdsourcing annotation was meant to do, it completely erases larger scale context.  The definitions for toxicity and support are a bit off. Toxicity based on ad hominem? Making people feel uncomfortable by itself is NOT toxicity. Again, context. The idea that support is the opposite of toxicity seems odd. Especially since the ways in which people give support can be SO much more complicated than just ""good post friend!"" Things like seeing a misogynistic comment that I already encountered in the wild that day make it to SRS and be called out here is supportive. SRS's ""toxicity"" can be supportive because it validates marginalized groups and lets them know they aren't alone here.  Lastly, SRS should always be introspective. It's how we grow. It would be ridiculous to assume there is no room for improvement here. And while I think the study is interesting (hey, I've already spent a good deal of time reading and thinking about it) I don't find it compelling. But I'm also a social science nerd who believes deeply in the power of qualitative data so I'm a little skeptical of the efficacy of trying to quantify cultural knowledge this way."

SRSDiscussion,2zruv9,shakha,11,Sat Mar 21 03:24:59 2015 UTC,"Privilege isn't something one can have individual control over. It's more useful to think of privilege as a conditional status, granted through the ability for one person to conform to their various social roles. So, it's not helpful to speak of ""giving up"" privilege. It falsely assumes that individual actions can have enough of an impact to completely negate a social structure, which is itself misleading and unhelpful.  One's personal identity may not always match up with how you are read by others. Privilege is conferred on the condition that other people read you in certain ways. This seems to be something that you've also run into: the moment when an individual outs themselves, a certain amount of safety is lost. So, clearly we can see that privilege is fluid and not set in stone, and depends in some significant way on how others view us.  So what would a total ""refutation"" of privilege look like? Well, firstly, one would have to make permanently visible your identity, somehow. Whether this is in the form of public knowledge of your habits, or marking your body (via clothing, body movements etc.) or through language, it must communicate your identity to others. Secondly, these messages have to be understandable by the people around you. That is, if people previously assumed that you were part of a privileged class, you would have to display your identity in such a way that people would grok what identity you have. Thirdly, both this display and this reading must be permanent, continuous, and flexible: that is, it must be capable of being understood in many different cultures, as you move in and out of different groups, and that this communication cannot stop happening (lest you be mistaken as having an identity that you don't).  This is impractical in a lot of ways and impossible in others. For one, we don't always stay in the same groups, or the same (sub)cultures. Just as a direct result of the fact that we live and travel in different social groups, we engage with lots of different cultures all the time, and so you'd have to adapt your outward signs of identity every time (consciously or otherwise). For another, sometimes it's just not practical. As we've said, assuming certain identities, or simply not correcting certain assumptions, can be safe. It can be a way of protecting yourself from potential harm. That's the practical reason of why I don't think it's a good idea to say that there's any kind of moral imperative to coming out, or ""refusing"" privilege, or what-have-you. It ignores the circumstances that make this kind of refusal safe enough to be feasible.  (last edit I swear) I also want to bring up what the purpose of refuting privilege is. No, actually: I want to bring up what the purpose of being able to say that you are refuting/have refuted privilege is. What purpose does it serve for one person, in one place, to be able to say, ""No, I don't have this privilege any more, I made a conscious decision to get rid of it""? At that point, is it still about getting rid of the structure of privilege - or is it more about how that person's status in activist circles?"
SRSDiscussion,2zruv9,minimuminim,2,Sat Mar 21 03:28:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this, but surely there can be cases where it's possible to do something which relinquishes some amount of privilege, even if it is only in a very small, very localised way.  For example, some gay people (like myself) can benefit from being able to pass as straight in certain cases. It seems as though there could be cases where deliberately outing myself would strip me of this (very small, very localised) form of privilege."
SRSDiscussion,2zruv9,MrMercurial,2,Sat Mar 21 11:27:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's something I've addressed. Nevertheless, coming out is not the same thing as refusing privilege. As I've said in the initial parts of my post, saying that you can refuse privilege falsely claims that your individual actions have anything to do with the conferral of privilege. What is happening is that your outward communication of an identity (in this case, gay), is being interpreted in such a way by the people around you that they will not treat you as straight. And, therefore, you lose some of the protection afforded by that assumption. But, unless you wear a t-shirt that says ""I'M GAY"" on it all the damn time, when you go interact with people that you don't actually know, boom! Back comes the conferral of straight privilege, provided you can pass. And remember that coming out is not a one-time event. It is a continuous, daily, wearying performance of your identity; trust me, since I 'came out' to my family eight times before deciding to give up.  So I ask again: what is the point of wanting to be able to say you have refused your privilege?"
SRSDiscussion,2zruv9,minimuminim,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"I seems to me that the coming out example demonstrates that individual actions can affect the conferral of privilege in a pretty obvious way - you're going to benefit from being treated as straight, you take an action (coming out) and that leads to you losing that privilege, albeit temporarily."

SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,Hellkyte,30,Wed Mar 18 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"I think trigger warnings should be used in places where there is no reasonable expectation that the triggering content will be encountered.  For example, on an askreddit thread ""what is your worst sexual encounter?"" you don't need a trigger warning to expect potentially triggering content in that thread. In a thread called ""what is your favourite cheap recipe?"", a trigger warning for a rape story is appropriate.  For the most part this is fairly easy.  As for media? Well, I don't think things like Game of Thrones/ASoIF need an explicit trigger warning, provided they are accurately advertised. The product description can be written in such a way that someone sensitive to triggers will realise there might be triggering content in the book and either avoid it, or look up exactly what that content entails. Also notice that in TV and film age restricted content sometimes has a brief description of why it was categorised as such. These TV, film and games already do have a non-invasive trigger warnings. They could be better probably (I don't get triggered so I can't testify to the usefulness of this) but the point is that as a non-triggered person I don't have the surprises ruined for me if that's a concern. I don't need to read it.  Conceivably triggers could be very personal. This is often the basis for those triggering jokes made by assholes, but these people conveniently ignore that nobody ever complains about obscure things that trigger them. Everything that could need a trigger warning typically falls under a very small selection of content, which almost everyone is aware of because it's the exact same content that makes something ""edgy"". If someone you know is triggered by something unusual be nice and make allowances for them, but anyone saying that we should write trigger warnings for traditionally non-triggering content is made entirely of straw.  At the end of the day, I think this is all just common sense. If there is a reasonable but incorrect expectation that your product will contain no triggering content, then write a trigger warning which can either be explicitly stated or strongly implied from the product description. Err on the side of caution, and if you get it wrong apologise and learn instead of doubling down."

If someone wants to take the time to place it under their own volition that's fine, but requiring it on a societal level is downright silly and IMO a waste of resources.

In fact I said the opposite - if a product description contains an accurate portrayal of the content, and explicit trigger warning is not required.

I am just pointing out that we can do a lot better for almost zero effort.  This isn't some difficult subjective issue. For the most part, triggering content is violence, abuse, sexual assault, sexual content, and depictions of extreme bigotry. I might have missed a couple of things, but that's a fairly comprehensive list. Of course there are exceptions, but nobody asks for trigger warnings in those cases. Nobody is asking for perfection here. Mistakes will happen and things will get missed, but a small effort to ensure people who need trigger warnings can know in advance what to expect can go a long way."

However you are completely wrong to say that the rating system for games and movies has ""no effect"" on anyone who doesn't want or need it. It absolutely does have an effect, and a very large one to be truthful, because the guidelines for ratings are subjective and political.

Example: nobody in authority positions call black people ""black people"". Usually they are referred to african-americans, People of Color, or other things. This is only relevant to the United States. You call a UK black man a ""person of color"", they gonna look at you funny and probably think you're making fun of them. You might actually offend them, because you are using a cultural-specific term where it doesn't apply, and that shows a lack of insight in to another culture. Happens all the time.  I could go on about that, but I don't have time, so look up gestalt psychology and social perception theories for more.  For the most part, triggering content is violence, abuse, sexual assault, sexual content, and depictions of extreme bigotry.  That is absolutely subjective, and that is my point. If we are talking specifically about people with PTSD, what they are triggered by is often completely innocuous and randomly associated with the trauma they experienced. People can be triggered by so many esoteric things, and most of the time that is in fact the case.  If we're talking about other people outside of that realm, then honestly they just need to manage their own shit. I have a problem with blood, and discussions about drugs and their effects on the brain and needles (you can see how they are related). It does have a physical presence, but I deal with it just fine on my own. Any trigger warning about things like that would just be insulting to my intelligence, and I think that's a much more legitimate thing to be offended about than anything you have listed.  You need to really have some introspection time and detach from your context, because it is quite clear your subjective experiences have an overwhelming influence on your thoughts and behavior. The entire point of being more culturally sensitive is to reduce the influence personal experiences and feelings affect your attitudes and behaviors, so you are more open to new ideas and more receptive to differences, and the things you are suggesting are contrary to that because it can only taught properly as a general principle and executed on an individual level. Otherwise people just engage in the same old tribalistic and group-think garbage that continues to cause massive problems on a global scale, just about different subjects."

Make it in 6 point font next to all that copyright information no one reads. Those that really care can take the time and effort to look and everyone else doesn't even notice it.  Help those who need it while making it as non political as possible. As long as everyone chills the fuck out, everything will be fine.

SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,Clumpy,36,Sat Mar 21 05:46:07 2015 UTC,"Eh -- I get in trouble for this around these parts, but I don't think there is a larger social benefit to imposing trigger warnings insofar as adults are concerned. In fact, they could lead to a much more disastrous consequence as a speech chilling method. They are fine for self-help forums and support groups (where they originated) but not standardized. I could see a situation in which everything becomes sanitized as a reaction. A lot of studios, for example, avoid funding films with an expected R rating because they almost always make less money at the box office. Unfortunately, that is the system we have, and it incentivizes bad artistic choices.   I have no problem with an online database that has crowdsourced trigger warning information (it probably exists, somewhere.) I for one would google movies before seeing them to find out whether or not there would be a vomit scene, which is my particular trigger-like situation. I totally understand where some people are coming from, but nothing is failproof and there may be some level of individual initiative in addressing their triggering issues, rather than expect them to be catered to by a broader society."

This is not true, children can present PTSD symptoms though they may be less severe/get worse over time, and if I were to take your statement at face value, it only legitimizes my point further: they should take the proper steps as defined by their psychologist. And research had been done that shows premptive avoidance could strengthen the hold PTSD has on its victim and could even work to define the surviver perpetually by the terms of their trauma which can be detrimental to the healing process. We can wax on whether or not we agree wth these studies but it's pretty clear that there has not been anything close to a consensus here. And certainly not one that could potentially impede free expression.

There was a lot wrong with your statement, especially the part where you say ""I don't think there is a larger social benefit to imposing trigger warnings insofar as adults are concerned"". Apparently you don't think there's a use for trigger warnings as far as children are concerned either, so what are you really saying here? The only conclusion I could draw was that you were conflating trigger warnings with content ratings / advisories, which are in widespread use and aimed at children. If you weren't, would you mind explaining what you meant?  People who are ""tak(ing) the proper steps as defined by their psychologist"" don't magically get better. (see what I did there? Poisoned the well similarly to when you talked about ""waxing on""). There are people all around you who are having to manage their daily content consumption so that they can function in the world. If they succeed, they do fine. If they don't, they have a bad day / week / worse. I personally don't find it a huge imposition to help them out in doing this, and I don't mind reading and mostly ignoring the words ""trigger warning"". I certainly wouldn't equate the people who benefit from them with children.  One last thing: Nowhere did I say there were no children with symptoms of PTSD. There are millions of children who are going through or have gone through trauma that they're failing to process. However, these children are for the most part unaware that they're even at risk, much less having agency and control over what they're exposed to, and the statistical distribution of full PTSD sufferers is still necessarily going to peak in the adult population."

There was a lot wrong with your statement   None of which had to do with your snarky response to my personal experience aside from the assumption that I am making it up, which illustrates your narrative that I lack empathy for those who want trigger warnings. You can say that isn't how you intended it -- in which case I'd ask -- why even bother? We can have a sidebar argument on this so I don't want to detract from my point. Here.  Thank you for clarifying what you meant by PTSD suffering in adults vs children. That is not a centerpiece of my argument, I just thought we had different information (we did not.)   The only conclusion I could draw was that you were conflating trigger warnings with content ratings / advisories, which are in widespread use and aimed at children. If you weren't, would you mind explaining what you meant?   I am saying, mandating the use of trigger warnings from the context of broader potential speech chilling effects and censorship, yes -- they will have a similar effect, however more broad in scope. I see this as a dangerous position especially considering the inconclusive research that trigger warnings are beneficial to the individual. we have anecdotes. Psychology seems mixed at best, with the recent studies linked in my previous post actually arguing potentially dangerous compartementalizing effects. I'm sure more research will be done. Until then, we are talking about a bigger problem than a simple imposition.    People who are ""tak(ing) the proper steps as defined by their psychologist"" don't magically get better.    Yes.

SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,PlushgunMusic,16,Thu Mar 19 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think he makes a good point about not being able to run away from those things in adulthood.  It was pointed out to me that I have a ""trigger,"" which is when I know someone is going to blithely behave in a socially awkward or unacceptable way and I have to watch.  I can't handle shows like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia where the characters' antisocial behavior is milked for humor.  For example, there's one episode of that show where a guy decides to join a pro-life movement so he can pick up on women who are, by his calculus, likely to be easy to sleep with.  When I see a situation where I know a character is going to do something awkward or just wrong, my body starts moving and contorting.  I have to leave the room.  These experiences leave me with an hours-long hangover where my social anxiety is in sickening overdrive.  Books can be worse because an impending social error can take so long to actually play out.  When I was a kid, there were a lot of books I didn't finish because a situation developed where a character was going to do something socially wrong.  I always intended to finish those books, but I'd feel sick every time I thought about picking them up, so eventually I'd get rid of them and feel horrible about myself for being so sensitive.  Once I really wanted to see how a book ended so I forced myself to read it, and without realizing it I plucked a little bald spot on my head.  My mother freaked out and took me to the doctor.  It was an adventure where the main character had been separated from his wife for years (having adventures stranded on an island, I think) and meanwhile his wife had taken up with another man.  Through all his struggles to get home he was thinking about the things he was going to say to his wife when he saw her.  A normal person would think it was sad, but all I could think of was how terrifyingly awkward it was going to be when he said all of those things that were inappropriate for the situation.  Apparently I dealt with that by literally pulling my hair out.  If something like that can be a trigger for me, then anything can be a trigger for someone.  Trigger warnings only make sense when we're labeling a few special cases.  If we try to go beyond that, we'll end up realizing that almost anything about life can be a trigger.  Not just adult life, but life in general.  I don't want there to be signs up everything saying, ""WARNING:  LIFE IS HAPPENING AND YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT.""  That's just depressing.  Fine, I can't handle it sometimes, but I'd rather be alive than not."

I have managed to own this DVD for 10 years, and I watch it regularly. Today was the first time I've ever read that bit of the box.

Trigger warnings aren't just about keeping you from seeing things that might make you feel disturbed or anxious generally... they are for people who suffer from PTSD and other serious mental health issues!  My friend recently went to see the movie Chappie.  As per usual, she scoured the internet for potential triggering content.  Finding nothing mentioned, she went to see the movie, which is essentially a two hour story about child abuse.  She was triggered so badly she dissociated for half an hour in the middle of the movie.  Can you imagine having that reaction because people can't be bothered to put a two second warning on a fucking movie??   What do we need to be warned about? We each have our little triggers.   Agh!  I hate, hate, hate seeing needles go into skin, but seeing needles going into skin doesn't make me revert to behavior (be it dissociation, violence, extreme defensiveness, etc) that I needed to cope with the trauma of having needles stuck into me in the past.  Being upset/mad/sad/anxious =/= being triggered, jfc.   I wonder, Are fictions safe places? And then I ask myself, Should they be safe places?    People that need trigger warnings aren't asking for safe places.  They are asking for warnings that might save them actual physical and/or mental damage.  We don't tell people with severe nut allergies ""oh, the point of grocery stores isn't to be a safe place"" we put fucking labels on things when they have nuts in them!   if I was going to read fiction, sometimes I would only know what my comfort zone was by leaving it   LEAVING YOUR COMFORT ZONE =/= RELIVING TRAUMA   (FIRST LINE) There are things that upset us. That's not quite what we're talking about here, though.   (FROM LAST PARAGRAPH) There are things in this book, as in life, that might upset you.    Interesting contradiction, Mr. Gaiman.

It's alluded to elsewhere in this thread, but for at least everyone I know, it's hard to get ""triggered"" by blocks of text on the internet. That's not to say that discussions of sexual violence, etc., can't be uncomfortable and even anxiety inducing, but they don't always rise to the level of an anxiety so overwhelming that is associated with PTSD. Rather, most people with PTSD are triggered by random associations, which tend to be sensory rather than intellectual--i.e. they're not ""triggered"" by grasping abstract concepts such as ""violence against women.""  An Iraq vet is a pretty stereotypical example here: they hear a crash of a cart at a Home Depot and immediately feel like they're in a combat zone. Yet the same person might be perfectly capable of giving a lecture at a university about combat and violence, etc. Another example is a friend who is triggered by the smell of fresh cut grass. This isn't the sort of thing you can adequately anticipate or what you would expect people to reasonably accommodate.  The implication being, people with self-PTSD diagnoses are likely to let you know about it and bring it up in situations where they're unlikely to be ""triggered.""

Since they can't possibly know/understand the psychological underpinnings of every reaction any individual will have, they have to either only put trigger warnings on those things which are very generally triggering - in which case it sounds like Chippie would not have been labeled with a child abuse trigger, since it sounds like your friend's reaction is fairly specific to her - or they have to put trigger warnings on anything that could possibly be triggering - in which case people who get triggered either have to just avoid 90% of all media, or ignore the warnings and just hope that any given warning is just because of some small detail that could possibly trigger a very small subset of people that they don't belong to.  In short, you have to set the threshold for what you label as triggering somewhere, so any decrease in false negatives (triggering material not labeled as such) is necessarily accompanied by an increase in false positives (non-triggering material labeled with trigger warnings), and the more false positives you have, the less useful the true positives (triggering material labeled as such) become."

I don't want to belittle your friends experience or suggest she is necessarily to blame for her negative reaction to the film, but I can't help but take your story with a grain of salt when you claim your friend ""scoured the internet for potential triggering content"" but failed to find any despite the entire movie apparently being a violent coming of age story.    I typed ""Chappie Review Abuse"" into Google and found this in under 5 minutes    Although he can learn quickly, he maintains the emotions of a child, and so it’s delightful to see him play around and heartbreaking to watch him suffer abuse.

My concern, though, is this: If I'm a person who, unlike your friend, can't handle intensely triggering content related to child abuse even when I'm ready for it, so I just can't watch things labeled with ""tw: child abuse"" at all, and we set a threshold low enough that the content in Chappie earns it a ""tw: child abuse"" for the sake of people like your friend, how much content that has relatively mild scenes that could be interpreted as child abuse do I now have to avoid completely, even though they are well within what I can handle?  Now, I've gotta say that I feel a little bit uncomfortable even making that argument because I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know how much of the triggering content is pretty straightforward/blatant vs how much is primarily your friend's personal interpretation, but that's my worry - that if we label things according to the most sensitive amongst us, we make those labels less useful to those who are less sensitive but still very much in need of trigger warnings."

SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,LeRedditeurDe,9,Wed Mar 18 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, okay, yeah, that's a bit of a complicated one.  I can definitely see how that would be triggering, but I'm fairly interested in the ethical issues surrounding treatment of AI personalities, so I may be a bit biased there, because I can also definitely see why many people wouldn't necessarily make the connection that it would need a child abuse trigger warning.  I guess, if it were up to me, something like that would have a ""tw: child abuse"" but, at the same time, I couldn't really fault someone for thinking it didn't need one."
SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,LadyRavenEye,12,Wed Mar 18 19:52:21 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with the others who say this attitude completely invalidates the idea of trigger warnings.  If I can't predict what will be triggering for other people and what will, how can I provide a trigger warning beyond a plot summary?  It's easy to understand battlefield PTSD being triggered by fireworks because we can all relate to being startled by sudden loud noises.  That's easy for me to understand because I can project from my own experience.  Other cases are essentially impossible to predict because projecting from our own experience doesn't work.  The case of Chappie and your friend proves that even a comprehensive surface summary of a work is insufficient; effective trigger warnings have to extend beyond concrete similarities to artistic metaphor.  People see different things in art depending on their cultural and intellectual background.  Hell, I've heard the song Bright Red a hundred times and I just recently made a connection to a dim memory of a short story I read in college, and I thought, ""This song is about rape,"" and I wondered about that until eventually I reread the story and realized the connection was just a figment of my imagination, but by now the idea that the song is about rape is embedded in my head, but I feel foolish because I can't justify that idea any longer, so should I put a trigger warning on it or not?"

SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,jennyroo,10,Wed Mar 18 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"yeah alright but still how do you want to find all the possible triggers in any form of media, there might be hundreds of them and even finding them all could take lots of people lots of time, and even if they found them all the list would be huge and totally unpractical, furthermore it would make lots of people avoid watching or reading something they might enjoy or have no problem at all with because even if there is the slightest possibility that one scene might be triggering then it would be included in the list. This would practically make it impossible for people who have PTSD to conscume any media at all."
SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,jennyroo,-20,Wed Mar 18 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"No one is saying every single thing that could possibly trigger someone should be included, just the ones that are common.  To use my friend, she is able to consume media with child abuse in it--if she knows beforehand that might be an issue.  That's the way she can do it.  But you know, maybe she couldn't, and there's nothing wrong with that?  I don't like that the show Agent Carter has no worthwhile characters of color, so I haven't watched it.  How is that different than choosing not to watch something because it has potentially triggering content to you? (hint: it isn't)  edit:  I have another friend who is still in recovery from an obscenely abusive relationship.  Just mentioning her ex in certain contexts can trigger her to the point of panic attacks.  So, as her friends, we know this, and take it into consideration.  She's not asking for his name to come with a trigger warning on every piece of media she comes into contact with, but since we know about it, we are able to be considerate of her trauma."
SRSDiscussion,2zh0xd,greenduch,7,Wed Mar 18 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"Having issues myself with being easily triggered, I'd like to mention something I had read. A while back, a friend directed me to Andrew Sullivan's website, The Dish. More often than not it was a index of horrible trash. Remember, we're talking about the guy who argued with Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether we should at least ""entertain in a non-racist way"" The Bell Curve. So I say this as a disclaimer, to note that I do not necessarily agree with him in general, nor do I always trust his sources. This is a pre-emptive defense to prevent myself from being interpreted as an advocate for his opinions, as well as a request to take what I read with a grain of salt.    Anyways, the articles that my friend had directed me to, thinking it might be important to me, were on triggers. They featured a number of mental health professionals talking about how they think trigger warnings are unhealthy. The thesis of the anti-trigger warning position in both articles amounts to ""trigger warnings are unhealthy because they reinforce PTSD"". They explain that avoidance strengthens the debilitation that comes with PTSD, while being triggered frequently will desensitize victims. I haven't got around to reading enough about it, and so I do not have the solid grounds on which to dispute it. I found their position very troubling, because I tend to trust [some] mental health professionals, but I wouldn't know any better if they were talking out of their asses. Andrew Sullivan would probably be cherry-picking his sources for articles that agree with his presumably anti-trigger warning stance, and I have no information on the general political leanings or reputation of those two publications.   As of late it has been really on my mind, because I've been having panic attacks and disassociating frequently due to exposure to triggering stimuli. I'm just not sure what to make of it, and I hope that by bringing it up here maybe someone can shoot them down, or, alternatively, extract something useful from it."

Here is a typical sight in Dublin on St. Patrick's day.  With that said, there are certainly some things we would rather Americans not do.  ""Patty"" is a major grievance (the correct spelling is Paddy).  Leprechauns are also a little twee for our taste (though we still shovel them by the barrel full into tourists' faces).

All in all, its too bad that Irish people who still have deep roots have to deal with stereotypes and the commodification of their culture.  This is a pretty good essay on ""the real Irish-American story"" that goes over the colonization of Ireland and the brutal British policies toward them, that could be a good thing to pass around to fight against the superficial appropriation of Irish symbols by Americans.   Also, discovery and engagement around certain European identities, especially in an anti-colonial/anti-capitalist context, can be a method of deconstructing ""Whiteness"".

That said, most of what makes cultural appropriation wrong is that it (usually) intersects with oppression, racism, privilege, discrimination. etc. A popular example is Selena Gomez wearing the bindi. That's cultural appropriation too, but what makes it unfair is that when she wears it, it's cool and fashionable. If an Indian person wears traditionally Indian attire, they are suddenly a ""FOB,"" a ""terrorist,"" a ""failure to assimilate,"" or (TW: Racism) a ""dothead,"" a ""paki,"" etc.  What makes cultural appropriation shitty is that by partaking in it, you are going out of your way to take advantage of the societal privileges afforded you.

SRSDiscussion,2zd663,rmc,5,Thu Apr 16 20:25:57 2015 UTC,"In my understanding, the explanation comes down to privilege. Irish-American bodies, customs, and communities have been comprehensively assimilated into American whiteness, and afforded equal standing within it. Today, they enjoy the respective privileges conferred through American whiteness and suffer little if at all from historical exploitation or othering in this country. Stereotyping and appropriation take on a different role - the tradition of a St. Patrick's Day parade now serves to reinforce the acceptance of Irish culture into American society.   So I agree that confronting the issue is probably not worth the time or effort when a significant number of Americans can't even be drawn into the conversation on more violent forms of cultural appropriation, such as the use of American Indian names and symbols.  At the same time though, I'm compelled to feel that appropriation is problematic in principle, which would mean in many cases it's problematic regardless of context. Though Irish stereotypes and appropriations  are not necessarily dehumanizing or violent towards the Irish, the practice serves to normalize the use of racial, ethnic, or cultural appropriation in general. How many times have we heard the effects of slavery in this country denigrated through their comparison to 'Irish slavery'? How many times have people pointed to the success of the Irish-American political machine at transforming certain urban immigrants into 'functioning members of society'? And how many times has the continued and unabashed appropriation of Irish culture been used as an example as to why people of color should just 'lighten up'?"

There are a couple of things I think are worth mentioning:  Historically, anti-Irish racism was definitely a thing in the US and elsewhere, and I think it hasn't gone away completely from what I can see. I'm not really okay with being stereotyped as a drunken violent poet, or as some other patronisingly cartoonish caricature (and this is made more problematic by the fact that plenty of Irish people embrace and play up to these kinds of stereotypes when it comes to St. Patrick's day.  It's also worth remembering that anti-Irish racism is still a thing in the UK, as the recent controversy with Jeremy Clarkson illustrates (he is a very popular British presenter, who punched his Irish producer while calling him a ""lazy Irish c*nt). Ireland is a former colony, after all, with all that that entails, and there are still all sorts of sectarian tensions in some parts of Northern Ireland (though thankfully this is nowhere near as bad as it was several decades ago).  I think the reluctance of people to acknowledge these kinds of things is probably due to the fact that Irish-Americans (a) benefit from white privilege unlike most other oppressed groups and (b) a range of historical factors (the fact that Irish-Americans have lived in the US for centuries rather than being relatively new arrivals, the fact that they can be used to bash other, much more despised minorities etc.) means that today whatever oppression Irish-Americans might suffer pales in significance to that inflicted upon a great many other groups.   So, I guess what I'm saying is that I do think there is anti-Irish racism and oppression, just that nowadays it is relatively small and relatively insignificant compared to many other forms which tend to be much more harmful."

Can you imagine if there was an annual festival based on African-American culture which also traditionally involved heavy drinking and parading in the streets? Imagine how such an event would be covered in the media. Imagine how it would be policed. Imagine the moralist backlash.  Stereotyping of a national or ethnic group is always inherently a bit shitty, but when the drunk-Irish-person stereotype is a jolly fella having a sing-song and the drunk-black-person stereotype is a violent hoodlum, I don't think there's any comparing them."

Different parts of the country and different classes lead to black people experiencing things and expressing themselves in different ways.  But here's the rub. It all derives from race. Or rather, the belief in race. It is a bit of a weapon, but it's undeniably history in America where black culture is essentially defined as reactionary to said racism."

SRSDiscussion,2zbsjs,BrothersInArms1,2,Sat Mar 21 05:48:00 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see some of your thoughts partially because I've had a hard time articulating similar conclusions. It is nice to see wonderful tumblr posts, in great volume, celebrating black bodies. But, in my admittedly anecdotal experience, it seems that some of the more frequently shared photos tend to be intensely curvy. Not just that, but they definitely have a skew towards the skinny-ish and conventionally cis/hetero attractive model.The only over weight women included were ones with the aforementioned curves. Absent were women without curves, or older women. There were few plain dressed, thin-lipped, short sighted or high-cheekbone-less women. Although the general sense is that the trends in reblogging and likes are largely black-authored, it still feels like it essentializes black women's bodies. It appears to reclaim hypersexualized black bodies while reinforcing an exclusive aesthetic norm.   As said before, I think it's important that we continue to cheer that black women are beautiful, in opposition to overwhelming societal standard bullshit like hypersexualization and claims of inferiority. It is just unfortunate that there seems to be omission of the greater variety of women's bodies, especially those of larger women and those without ""stunning looks""."

Of course his character is a smart mechanic / engineer / brainiac type. And on the one hand it's cool that this minority actor plays a mostly useful character in this show. But on the one hand he's still restricted to playing a stereotypical role for anyone vaguely Asian whether it's positive or not.  Not to mention that any ""Asian stereotype"" is problematic anyway because the same ""Asian"" character could be played by anyone from like 50 different countries.  Positive stereotypes absolutely are damaging. They can hurt anyone that doesn't fit that stereotype (black boys that dont like basketball, Japanese kids who don't study, etc) and can also create a caricature of what someone is supposed to be like simply based on race.

And compared to where, exactly? My understanding is that most of the countries we'd consider more liberal are also very, very homogeneous (I'm thinking Scandinavia...where people don't, on the whole, seem so progressive when it comes to dark-skinned immigrants). I'm not an expert on this, nor a great defender of America. But my workplace is surprisingly diverse, esp. considering where I live in the US, and my students are very diverse (1/3 white, 1/3 international students from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, etc., and 1/3 black and latino). They all get along great (OK the language barrier hurts the less outgoing international students, but many are outgoing). These examples may seem silly. I'm just saying that America isn't all bad. Our institutional racism (and bigotry, etc.) is bad, but honestly seems better than a lot of places, to me. These issues stay in the headlines, if change comes too slowly. I grew up in the rural south, moved to a black neighborhood in a big city for grad school, and I loved it. Moreover, the folks in that neighborhood were super friendly to me. These are all anecdotes from a white guy raised middle class, and I'll say once again that US has tons of huge problems and a horrific legacy of racism...but there are a shit load of not ""deeply conservative"" Americans that you're just glossing over, is my only point. Also, I think America can be the things we want it to be, and I don't see that in lots of other places (but then again, how would I know?)."
SRSDiscussion,2z9w43,BonSequitur,2,Mon Mar 16 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"Well, of course those are good points. The thing is, I live in one of those areas. It's as conservative as it gets, here. It might be semantic or otherwise an ignorant point to make, but the thing is...here I am in the middle of the part of America that gives America its worst and most pervasive stereotypes, but I'm not like that. My friends aren't like that. And we were touring with hc bands and we got harassed by the redneck kids and all that.   Maybe it's not the exact purview of social justice, but it's like people don't even know that there are leftists all over the south, too. I've always been a student or taught in schools, and I'm around them all the time. The people who work at the super rural community college where I teach remedial labs are pretty cool, as are kids I met at shows, even in the most rural areas.   Although I have reason to, I don't hate those super conservative people here, either. Some are my family. What I'm saying, and not well at all, is that I'm from a real shitty place in America and it doesn't make me feel like pissing on America. I'm no nationalist, but I'm also not going to turn my back on where I'm from. I'm part of it and it's part of me, and all that.   In this very conservative area some people are exceedingly kind. There is a large population of south Asian and mid eastern people here, because of our college. I won't lie; I had a white student I really like call an international student a ""rag head"" to me in my office. She thought the guy was creeping on her but he actually had a disability (which I couldn't explain per the law). That was depressing. But mostly they're all friends, the most redneck kids and the international students will usually hit it off soon enough. Not always, but it does happen.  There's a genuine decency that's pervasive in the people here. They're not all mean spirited and small minded. A lot of them are, but that doesn't mean we all are. Sorry to go on and on."

The best I can say is that Redditeurs pay lip service to some liberal causes.  If you asked, I would guess quite a few (but probably not most?) of Redditeurs would say they want gay marriage to be legal. That's, like, the barest minimum of human decency. It doesn't cost them anything to say that. Talk is cheap.  But once you get more concrete... Gay people being visible and part of society is not approved of at all on Reddit. Men holding hands or kissing is gross. Pride parades are big, shameful displays. OPs are f*ggots. When the site admins announced they would support the fight for marriage equality in Utah and elsewhere, the announcement thread was bursting with people saying Reddit should be politically ""neutral"" and had no business getting involved in liberal campaigning. (Net neutrality, because it benefits Reddit's self-absorbed user base, is a worthy cause, of course.)  In subs like /r/atheism, gay people are a punchline when Redditeurs want to stick it to religious people. Check out any thread (I've done effort posts on those) featuring some asshole fire-and-brimstone preacher condemning gay people, literally (heh) every single comment will be along the lines of, ""This guy will be caught in an airport bathroom stall in 3, 2, 1..."" Gay people are an argument for legalising paedophilia.  Saying you are ""for"" gay marriage is utterly meaningless if your actions and words contribute to a homophobic culture at the same time. Not to mention that there are a lot of other things cishets take for granted that GSRM folks don't have, it goes way beyond marriage. But that would involve work, introspection, and a critical, progressive outlook.  Similarly: The federal government busting some white college dude for weed is fascist bullshit, but black people being murdered by police must have done something to deserve it.

Also here's the quote I was talking about--another redditor chipped it in since I was basically trying to say what he said :p  From this essay / article by Oscar Wilde   The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism – are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.  They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.  But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life – educated men who live in the East End – coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like. They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises. They are perfectly right. Charity creates a multitude of sins.  There is also this to be said. It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair."

There's your patriarchy. I believe a woman could sell just as many widgets with 'womanly' qualities if people didn't presuppose that selling shit was a masculine quality.   I get that fee market conservatives are overwhelmingly sexist. I don't get why they're necessarily sexist. What if I thought that women should take leadership roles instead of men, that the values of women were superior to men? That's an actual radical feminist view.

If the the college decided to put that harasser on probation, possibly leading up to an outright ban from the university if they continued their actions despite this, would it be morally acceptable for a group like FIRE to step in and protect that harasser from seeing discipline for their speech? Because if they did and the harasser was free to stay at the college without facing consequences, it would have the knock-on effect of silencing that woman because an outside group has implied that her concerns are basically invalid if they possibly threaten the ideal of free speech in any way.  I'd really like to know if FIRE is a group that would reject this series of events. If so, great!

SRSDiscussion,2z9z7s,___Rhand___,8,Tue Mar 17 05:44:17 2015 UTC,"Already posted this to you, but I'll post it again for prosperity's sake. This is from FIRE's student guide:   In the landmark case of Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (1999), the Supreme Court defined student-on-student hostile environment harassment as conduct ""so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim""s access to an educational opportunity or benefit."" By definition, this includes only extreme and usually repetitive behavior—behavior so serious that it would prevent a reasonable student from receiving his or her education. For example, in Davis, the conduct found by the Court to be actionable harassment was a months-long pattern of conduct including repeated attempts to touch the victim""s breasts and genitals and repeated sexually explicit comments directed at and about the victim.   ...   Put simply, to be legally punishable as harassment, students must be far more than simply rude or offensive. Rather, they must be actively engaged in a specific type of discrimination, as defined by law. Under this doctrine, there is a pattern of behavior that may involve speech so strikingly awful and persistent, and so focused on a person""s status as a member of a protected class, that the law must treat it not simply as speech, but as discriminatory behavior that constitutes a civil rights violation. Precisely because the Supreme Court cases describe only very extreme forms of speech as ""harassment,"" we believe that it makes good sense to think of speech-as-harassment in terms of time, place, and manner restrictions that the Constitution permits: If the speech is repeated, is uttered at inappropriate times and places, and is so uncivilized and pervasive so as to make the victim unable to attend to his or her studies and other activities, then it risks being prohibited and punished. In other words, protected speech cannot become unprotected harassment merely because of its message; rather, to qualify as harassment, one must consider how, when, and where the message was communicated.   That answers your question, yes?"
SRSDiscussion,2z9z7s,shaedofblue,2,Tue Mar 17 05:49:42 2015 UTC,As far as I'm aware they aren't opposed to chronic harrassers  being punished.

FIRE and other civil liberties groups like the ACLU would only have a problem if what was considered harassment was so broad that normal interaction could be punished.
SRSDiscussion,2z9z7s,Dan-Morris,3,Thu Mar 19 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, because deeming free speech as harmful is a very slippery slope. Before anyone invokes the eponymous fallacy, there has been precedents. In the 1960's, people who supported Communism faced criminal charges because their speech was deemed ""harmful"" to the fabric of society. By the same standard, anything that goes against the state of affairs can be deemed harmful. You know what else goes against the current paradigm? Social justice.    The ACLU defends hate groups like the KKK. In one of their self-proclaimed greatest successes, they protected the right of Nazis to parade down a Jewish community of Holocaust survivors. This right here is a direct answer to your question. If the ACLU didn't hold up the same standards for all free speech violations, then there would be no precedent for holding up free speech in all cases.    This ACLU article goes into greater depth about why they do it.. The first point is a key part of the argument too.

Most importantly, and this is the point I was trying to make in my original piece, even supposing that you're right and FIRE is wrong, that doesn't make them concern trolls.

I've worked with FIRE on changing my school's speech codes, and lobbied with them in Massachusetts for a certain law regarding college students and legal representation. I've also attended two of their seminars, and had a great talk with their current President.   First, let me say that FIRE will stand for any group of any variant if their rights to free speech are harmed, or even bad policies are in place. For example, at my own school, a rule dictated that I couldn't annoy anyone. It didn't really clarify what that meant, the handbook simply just said it was against school policy to annoy someone. It's great to have anti-harassment policies, but not so great to have them be so vague they can be used to silence free speech.   They have a few books you can order on their website, which I recommend reading (and I highly recommend Unlearning Liberty written by their current President).    what I can tell they don't seem to offer much support to marginalized victims.   They absolutely will help, if such a group is facing free speech issues. It doesn't matter what the group stands for, so long as their school is going against the First Amendment.

At the same time I don't think it is a simple issue:  if public funding is the only criterion where there's a free speech violation, that would sanction some Christian universities with very strict conduct codes."
SRSDiscussion,2z9z7s,Intortoise,2,Tue Mar 17 06:35:41 2015 UTC,"FIRE's student guide actually addresses the very thing you're talking about in regards to funding:   Individual State Laws Affecting Private Institutions  In America, legal rights can vary dramatically from state to state. The United States Constitution, however, limits the extent to which any state may regulate private universities, because the Bill of Rights (which applies both to the states and to the federal government) protects private institutions from excessive government interference. In particular, the First Amendment protects the academic freedom of colleges and universities at least as much as (and frequently more than) it protects that of the individuals at those institutions.  Fortunately, decent societies have historically found ways to protect individuals from indecent behavior. Many states follow doctrines from the common law, which evolved as the foundation of most of our states"" legal systems. For example, some states have formulated common-law rules for associations—which include private universities—that prohibit ""arbitrary and capricious"" decision making and that require organizations, at an absolute minimum, to follow their own rules and to deal in good faith with their members. These standards can provide a profoundly valuable defense of liberty in the politically supercharged environment of the modern campus, where discipline without notice or hearing is all too common. (For more information about how to combat the lack of due process on university campuses, see also FIRE""s Guide to Due Process and Fair Procedure on Campus, available at www.thefire.org.)  In most states, court decisions have established that school policies, student handbooks, and other documents represent a contract between the college or university and the student. In other words, universities must deliver the rights they promise. Most campuses explicitly promise a high level of free speech and academic freedom, and some (including some of the most repressive in actual practice) do so in ringing language that would lead one to believe that they will protect their students"" rights well beyond even constitutional requirements.  Since universities have the power to rewrite these contracts unilaterally, courts, to help achieve fairness, typically will interpret the rules in a student handbook or in other policies with an eye toward what meaning the school should reasonably expect students or parents to see in them. As a consequence, the university""s interpretation of its handbook is less important than the reasonable expectations of the student.  Importantly, some states have statutes (or state constitutional provisions) that provide students at private schools with some measure of free speech rights. For example, California""s so-called ""Leonard Law"" (more technically, Section 94367 of California""s Education Code) states that ""no private postsecondary educational institution shall make or enforce any rule subjecting any student to disciplinary sanctions solely on the basis of conduct that is speech or other communication that ... is protected from governmental restriction by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 2 of Article 1 of the California Constitution.""  In other words, students at California""s private, secular colleges and universities (the Leonard Law does not to apply to students at religious colleges) enjoy the same level of free speech rights as students at California""s public colleges. Other states, while not protecting students"" rights to the same extent that California does, have ruled that private universities may not make blanket rules restricting speech. In the case of State of New Jersey v. Schmid (1980), the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that a state constitutional guarantee—that ""every person may freely speak ... on all subjects""—prevents Princeton University (even though a private school) from enforcing a comprehensive rule that required all persons unconnected with the university to obtain permission before distributing political literature on campus. This ruling, however, certainly did not grant students at private colleges the same rights as those at public universities.  While the Leonard Law and Schmid are important to the discussion of free speech at private campuses, students should not conclude that similar statutes or cases exist in the majority of states. In fact, far more states have rejected claims of rights to freedom of expression on privately owned property than have accepted such claims. (For a comprehensive overview of the law regarding freedom of expression at private institutions, see former FIRE Justice Robert H. Jackson Legal Fellow Kelly Sarabyn""s legal scholarship on the subject: ""Free Speech at Private Universities,"" Journal of Law & Education, Vol. 39, p. 145 [April 2010].)  Beyond rights that are protected explicitly by contract or by statute, however, state law provides common-law rules against misrepresentation. Simply put, there is a long tradition of laws against fraud and deceit. Very often, a university""s recruiting materials, brochures, and even its ""admitted student"" orientations—which are designed to entice a student to attend that institution rather than another—will loudly advertise the institution""s commitment to ""diversity,"" ""academic freedom,"" ""inclusion,"" and ""tolerance."" Students will be assured that they will be ""welcomed"" or find a ""home"" on campus, regardless of their background, religion, or political viewpoint. Promises such as these will often lead students to turn down opportunities (and even scholarships) at other schools and to enroll in the private secular university. If these promises of ""tolerance"" or of an equal place in the community later turn out to be demonstrably false, a university could find itself in some legal jeopardy. The law prohibits deceptive promises that cause the deceived person to sign a contract, and such prohibitions against false advertising can be used in a quite credible effort to force a change in an administration""s behavior. As noted, our colleges and universities should honor their promises.  There is a final source of possible legal protection for a student at a private university, although it involves a particularly difficult legal and political question: When does the extent of the government""s involvement in the financing and governance of a self-proclaimed ""private"" college make it ""public""? If that involvement goes beyond a certain point, it is possible that the institution will be found, for legal purposes, to be ""public,"" and in that case all constitutional protections will apply. This happened, for example, at the University of Pittsburgh and at Temple University, both in Pennsylvania. State laws there require that, in return for significant public funding, a certain number of state officials must serve on the universities"" boards. That fact led these formerly ""private"" campuses to be treated, legally, as ""public."" Nonetheless, this is a very rare occurrence, and the odds of any private school being deemed legally public are very slim. Unless a school is officially public, one should always assume that the First Amendment does not directly apply.  There are many students, faculty members, and even lawyers who believe, wholly erroneously, that if a college receives any federal or state funding it is therefore ""public."" In fact, accepting governmental funds usually makes the university subject only to the conditions—sometimes broad, sometimes narrow—explicitly attached to those specific programs to which the public funds are directed. (The most prominent conditions attached to all federal funding are nondiscrimination on the basis of race and sex.) Furthermore, the ""strings"" attached to virtually all federal grants are not always helpful to the cause of liberty.  As a legal matter, there is no specific level of federal funding that obligates a private college or institution to honor the First Amendment. Many factors, such as university governance, the appointment of trustees, and specific acts of legislation, need to be weighed in determining the status of any given institution. That should not stop students, however, from learning as much as they can about the funding and governance of their institution. There are moral and political questions that arise from such knowledge, beyond the legal issues. Do the taxpayers truly want to subsidize assaults on basic free speech and First Amendment freedoms? Do donors want to pay for an attack on a right that most Americans hold so dear? Information about funding and governance is vital and useful. For example, students may find that a major charitable foundation or corporation contributes a substantial amount of funds to their college, and they may inform that foundation or corporation about how the university selectively abuses the rights and consciences of its students. Colleges are extremely sensitive to contributors learning about official injustice at the institutions that those donors support. This is another example of our most general principle: Colleges and universities must be accountable for their actions.   http://www.thefire.org/fire-guides/fires-guide-to-free-speech-on-campus-3/read-online/"

SRSDiscussion,2z9z7s,Intortoise,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:58:38 2015 UTC,"FIRE writes of such schools:  ""When a private university expresses its own values by stating both clearly and consistently that it holds a certain set of values above a commitment to freedom of speech, FIRE does not rate [ that university [with their speech code ratings guide].""  In most states private universities can still more or less do as they wish, due to that clause about no necessary amount of public funding holding the college accountable to the First Amendment. From a previous FIRE case:   SCENARIO: You wish to start up a student group that discusses conservative philosophy, and you apply for funding from student fees, just like dozens of other groups at your public university. The student government, which recognizes student groups, refuses to recognize your group because, it argues, there is already one other recognized conservative group on campus, namely, the College Republicans. On the other hand, the student government has formally recognized dozens of other closely related student groups. Can it deny funding to your group?  This scenario happened at the University of Miami (UM). A group of women attempted to form a conservative organization, Advocates for Conservative Thought (ACT). Its purpose was ""the exposition and promotion of conservative principles and ideas."" ACT was repeatedly denied funding by UM, because, the student government claimed, its intended purpose would ""overlap"" with the College Republicans and with one group that promoted nonpartisan political debate. FIRE wrote a letter to UM""s president, pointing out that the school could not deny funding to one group because of its viewpoint while allowing dozens of other groups on the other side of the spectrum their individual recognition.  Such discrimination against a group based purely on the proposed purpose and ideology of the group is in direct violation of the Supreme Court""s prohibitions against content-based and viewpoint discrimination. It also violates the same free association rights that applied in the scenario relating to freedom of religious association (see Scenario 11, above).  The Supreme Court has also established that each such freely organized group has the right to equal student funding at public universities, and may not be discriminated against on the basis of the content of the group""s ideology. In University of Wisconsin v. Southworth (2000), the Court held that a public university must distribute funds equally to each recognized group on campus without any consideration of the organization""s viewpoint. Under Southworth, if the university does not comply with this limitation, it may not charge mandatory student fees to support extracurricular activities.  No matter what your group""s ideology, the purpose and content of your organization may not be grounds for denying your group official recognition as a student group. Furthermore, there is a strong constitutional right of voluntary association that allows individuals to form groups with a purpose and content of their choosing. Your group may be denied recognition on other legitimate grounds (such as insufficient membership), but the purpose and belief system of your group should never be the factor that prevents your group from gaining recognition and equal access to the school""s resources.  UM is a private university, and not bound by Southworth, but FIRE raised the issue of whether it was willing to deny its students the fundamental rights and legal equalities granted by any public college. In response to FIRE""s letter and press release, the university president convened an urgent meeting. Immediately after the meeting, ACT was informed that it would receive official recognition regardless of its content or purpose. UM President Donna Shalala wrote to FIRE to thank it for bringing this vital matter to her attention. The moral? Constitutional principles are so often not merely legal principles, but moral principles, as well. Colleges and universities ignore them to their shame and peril.    As for why California made that specific exemption in regards to religious school's, I can't comment."

Glancing at the list of colleges, it doesn't look like you've pursued anything at a religious college either. This seems weird to me: your stance is that if the school does not claim to honor freedom of speech you won't pursue a freedom of speech issue there and the school is off the hook? By this logic wouldn't the best course of action for all universities just be to have the students sign a free speech waiver? It seems like by doing this, you're actually defining free speech down into a contractual issue."

Suing a private school, like UM in the instance stated above, would result in failure due to their protections under the law. If such lawsuits were successful, schools like BYU (which adheres to the strict honor codes of the Mormon faith) couldn't operate as they do (where you can be penalized for drinking, smoking, and having sex off campus property). Now, that's not to say nothing can be done. Like in the UM example, public pressure can still do wonders for getting a school to change their mind and reverse problematic policies. However, legally, there isn't much leeway.   Public universities, of course, are completely bound by First Amendment rulings, as these institutions function off of public funds (and voluntary private donations). Legally, they are bound to give students the right to free speech  Edit:    By this logic wouldn't the best course of action for all universities just be to have the students sign a free speech waiver?   You actually do this for private universities. Like with BYU, you sign that honor code before attendance. Which is why FIRE doesn't have much of a problem here: you're signing and choosing to go somewhere that doesn't have to honor your rights. The issue here is when a private university claims to adhere to freedom of speech, but actually doesn't, which can go against contracts with students."
SRSDiscussion,2z9z7s,Dan-Morris,2,Tue Mar 17 07:52:36 2015 UTC,"Right, but constitutionally guaranteed rights are not in themselves contracts and you can't legally agree to a contract that abrogates your civil rights. In the BYU example, you don't have a specifically protected right to drink (well, we repealed prohibtion, but...), smoke, or have sex. But BYU's status as a private institution is not a blanket license to do whatever it wants: for example, it can't violate nondiscrimination law. I think we agree here.   The issue I have is with your organization's decision to define 1.) political issues as free speech issues and 2.) free speech at private institutions as matters of contract. This is because I see free speech as corresponding to a broader category of public interest. For example, let's say that BYU wants to prevent an LGBT group from forming on campus. It may not be possible to view this as a government intervention. But it is a restriction of public speech. There are other legal avenues by which the restriction may be contested. So why emphasize the free speech angle exclusively ?    The problem is if you apply these kinds of government non-intervention standards as a main form of political pressure on universities, you won't actually encourage political pluralism. You'll encourage universities to privitize their public obligations. Which is what's already going on."

The issue I have is with your organization's decision to define 1.) political issues as free speech issues and 2.) free speech at private institutions as matters of contract   This is how it legally is defined, on both accounts. For the second point, you really are signing away your ability to speak on some issues and face consequence, in the same vain that when I take a job, I can call my boss an idiot, but most likely I'll be fired for doing so. There is nothing in federal law that states a private college must adhere to the same guidelines as public institutions. States likes (like California) may have these things, of course. But if the state doesn't, there's little to be done: you signed a contract with a group that is not held to to the same legal standards as other places.   Now, if you want to change the law as your advocating, the only way to do it would be to get SCOTUS to make some sort of ruling, or to change the Constitution.   I would agree with your LGBT example, though. That's certainly a restriction, and one that needs change, but from internal sources, and not external."

Such a sentiment suggests a failure to recognize how valuable individual rights are to everyone.     We would not claim (I think?) a fair trial benefits criminals more than the innocent because we acknowledge the value of a trial as it applies to all citizens.

The India's Daughter film is more grey, though - while it may have issues with presenting radical misogynist views as more commonplace than they actually are, the fact that some Indian people hold these views is still a problem. Additionally, Indian opinions on the film are mixed enough that as a Western person I don't think we should condemn the whole thing."

I've heard rumors that some parts of the film were cut, otherwise it would have been more accurate and reasonable.   That said, I think we have to remember that we live in a world where Orientalism dominates the discourse on Asia, and through it, Westerners have savaged India and Indians over the past few decades with everything from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" to ""The Big Bang Theory"" to ""Slumdog Millionaire."" A lot of people see the BBC film as yet another bullet in the Orientalist chamber, and rightfully so when it calls Indian society ""diseased."""

SRSDiscussion,2z5ib9,universaladaptoid,11,Mon Mar 16 00:54:13 2015 UTC,"Well, the German professor's actions are ridiculous and blatantly racist. While India has a systemic issue with rape, there is no reason not to hire an individual Indian man based on those things. Moreover, a lot of (most?) Western countries have a systemic issue with law enforcement in rape/sexual assault, too. If the academic community wants to have a positive impact on the issue, why not create grants and scholarships for Indian women?  As for India's Daughter, I haven't seen it although I've read about it. I can't say I got the impression that the filmmaker intended to describe India as an isolated case? To wit, Leslee Uldwin said that what kept her going was her daughter back in the UK, who said Uldwin needed to finish the film to make the world better for girls like her. Moreover, Uldwin praised Indians for standing up for its women – it's certainly my perception that India has taken the lead on addressing its rape culture, and is an example we should all follow.  Of course hundreds of millions of Indians aren't rapists or approve of rape, but rape culture (in India and elsewhere) isn't about people explicitly condoning rape. But I can totally see how European audiences would totally miss that nuance, unfortunately. As the German professor and media coverage clearly demonstrate. Which is rather rich, considering they have the same issue domestically."
SRSDiscussion,2z5ib9,universaladaptoid,4,Sun Mar 15 21:48:04 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that Udwin never actually mentions rape culture, implicitly or explicitly.

And if she did (and I did not notice that she did when I saw her film), as you mentioned, she didn't do a good enough job of it, hence the Leipzig case.  It's absolutely an issue that needs to be discussed: political indolence, legal corruption, victim blaming, rape culture, etc, and it saddens me that the BBC spins it into an unjustified attack on Indian ""society."""

There are two separate issues to consider here - The professor was definitely being racist. What's curious is the fact that she actually chose to type an email out, and have a written record of her biases. The reaction from many Indians regarding the documentary has been silly - There seems to be a reasonably large section of the population that believes that the documentary is part of an international conspiracy against India, and this is obviously an extremely stupid viewpoint.  I think the documentary was very well made, and did a good job of reporting things objectively. India is a large country, with and there are many people with different ideals and thoughts, and it's definitely nonuniform. But, women definitely do not have it easy in many places - A Red-Pill esque mentality is quite common, and several of my friends have been harassed in different ways. For example, my ex was one of the very few female mechanical engineering students at our university, and there were many occasions where she was bullied and verbally harassed. There was even a situation where someone made a bad comment to me. And of course, this finally resulted in her pursuing a non-STEM career later. Another friend was out shopping when someone on a motorcycle slapped her ass and drove away.  But of course, there are several other people in India who subscribe to older notions of chivalry and try and 'protect' women etc, and this is problematic in it's own way, as it's inherently contributing to a culture of inequality. Also, there are a lot of 'Red-Pill' women as well, and all of these contribute to problems such as victim-blaming etc.  The BBC documentary is one of many investigative reporting pieces, and it's not fair to expect all this nuance in a fairly short timespan, for the objective behind the documentary was to primarily address the 2012 rape, and use that as a launching pad to initiate discussions, and it obviously has achieved that. I'm not sure why you should be ashamed to call yourself a feminist. What a certain set of organizations and associations do are not representative of what your thoughts are, and that's far more important."

Literally since the Portuguese landed here, I don't think the West has had anything good to say about India.

And I honestly don't understand how Udwin's documentary makes assumptions about Indian society as a whole - It was an investigative report like any other that focused on a specific event and underlying causes that caused the event.

Isn't it then unfair to just categorise the huge country that India is into just one type of society and culture? We know that India is home to many, many different cultures. Hell, India has 16 official languages (if I'm not mistaken).   In that way, I thought it would be important to show that there is a large part of the population who are vehemently against this type of behaviour.  Sure, it's rampant, but I live in the UK and I have gotten my butt slapped in public. My friend studying finance fields sexist comments almost everyday.   It is wrong to just say, Oh poor India, they so backward, everyone is a rapist. I think the documentary, whilst it had its good sides and I appreciated the honesty of the interviewees, was hugely biased insofar as having hardly any rape opponents talking. It was mainly a bunch of people talking about how it's normal and they'd burn their own daughters.   The only ones speaking out against rape culture were the two activists (who were in the documentary for barely a minute), the parents and the authors of the rape report. Unsurprising that they should be against rape. It made it seem like everyone else in India is a fool.   And it also seems unfair that Udwin didn't touch upon the fact that these crimes occur elsewhere in the world too, in a hugely prevalent fashion. Out of my friends, at least 5 have been raped in the past, that I know of. All of us are educated, middle-class students. It's not an isolated problem, and the issue is that Udwin really did make it seem like that."

Also, Sexual harassment happens everywhere around the world, and is not acceptable, regardless of the place. But, the documentary's subject is pretty much a specific incident of rape, and I don't think it ever made the claim of saying that it was a particularly 'normal' incident in India.    Rapes happen everywhere, but saying that Sexual harassment and rapes happen in India is not the same as saying that they do not happen elsewhere. Also, the documentary didn't treat the comments from the lawyer and the convicts as a prevalent attitude, and in the context of the documentary, that fact was somewhat obvious, and not unlike other investigative documentaries. For example, consider this - There have been several documentaries about the Klan and anti-white sentiments in White supremacist organizations. Those documentaries usually focus on the racist attitudes of the organization's members, and primarily showcase awful comments made by them, but that obviously does not mean that the makers of those documentaries wish to stereotype all white people as racists and racial supremacists.  Of course, someone ought to make a documentary about rapes and crimes happening elsewhere in the world, but it's unfair to expect a filmmaker to have retroactively made a different film when the subject of the film was a specific incident, and the narrative revolves around that."

Some people literally do believe all pornography is bad because they think anything outside of marital missionary position is bad.

Sometimes shitty people aren't on the wrong side of an issue, and even though it feels kind of gross to stand up for a shitty person like Robin Thicke, we have to do it. I think the best way to do it is speak up about it when these situations come about, just like you've done here. Explain it to your progressive friends just like you did in your post: ""We all hate Robin Thicke, but the jury in this case is objectively wrong.""

No matter how much I would love to show Robin a shin-kick to the groin, his song was in no way plagiarism. Applying the logic from the trial would render 80% of punk as plagiarism, despite the merits of at least 50% of that material (hehe, burrrn).  In terms of the outcome it is a mixed reaction from me, not because I doubt he's innocent in the slightest. I've always tried to Pollyanna situations like this - and in this case the silver lining is that at least it was a shithead who suffered a miscarriage of justice. And therein lies the worry, as it suggests that I'm prioritising the specifics over the precedent. If the reverse had happened, and I'd lamented the lack of financial and reputation damage to Thicke, I would have placed a petty victory over a freedom of creative process. I think you raise a valid point about the danger of factionalism in progressive politics and how it can allow us to ignore a different evil.  At the same time, I'm a supporter of copyleft and the Creative Commons style of licence, so this ruling is also another example that stems to prove the point for less restrictive laws against creativity.

There was also an attempt to frame it as a white person stealing from a person of colour – but it was written by both Robin Thicke and Pharell Williams. There is a tendency to erase POC's contributions in mainstream culture, and it seems like it was applied here uncritically simply because it served a wider political message. And I find that tendency dangerous, because structural problems like racism rarely exist in neat narratives. Also, the issue of intellectual property is entirely separate from whether Thicke writes shitty songs or whether he is sexist/racist.

With that said, much left wing agitation has rested, at least theoretically, on the notion that immoral institutions could be overburdened intentionally as a means of breaking them down. As this pertains to the justice system, highlighting absurdities and gumming up the works can be understood as progressive activism.  As per the music industry, you're right. I hold the reactionary view that commercial progress on that front is irrevocably damaging the value of music as an art form. I don't believe these two positions are mutually exclusive, even if from a certain perspective they appear to be.  [Edit]: Also, as I think of it, why has this case equated the expression of people in the music industry with the expression of musicians? I mean, if these guys felt strongly enough about making that statement, they could have released it as a free download on Bandcamp. It is the act of monetizing the track that generates these legal concerns, and that act has become less and less feasible as a career (thanks in absolutely no part to this case). I'm fully prepared to examine the negative effects that reconsidering the industry entirely might have on musical expression, but I certainly won't assume the worst out of hand. Musicians are a human cultural universal. They played and explored the craft long before they could sell recordings. If you insist they will no longer continue to do so, thanks to copyright law getting out of hand, you have to explain how."

I think it's important to call people out on this, so they realise the situation some people are in. But the fact that some people can't become vegetarian for the moment doesn't mean the vast majority of people in industrilaised nations cant be. I've always been a little surprised to see how few animal rights supporters there are in the social justice movement. There's definitely a higher proportion than you'd see in the general populace but for such an important issue there still seems to be far too few that support it."

The problem with the US is that in some areas, the only places within walking/affordable travel distance of them, that are also cheap are fast food/cheap convienience stores that don't offer much in the way of varied vegetarian diet.   India is a developing nation that was mostly eating rices, pulses and vegetables. Most of its people have only started to eat meat in large amounts recently as it has become more affluent. That and its culture is very meat free, being the birth place of Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism that all, to some extent, preach kindness to animals.

It is also a class issue in those parts of the developing world which are traditionally pastoralist - where wealth was traditionally measured in livestock ownership rather than money.  Eating meat, or eating certain kinds of meat, is an aspirational act or one of conspicuous consumption.  The alternative to eating meat in much of Africa is a diet mostly of subsistence carbohydrate (maize, millet, cassava, rice) which is not a balanced vegetarian diet and a source of much malnutrition.  Seen from this point of view, the desire to consume a lot of meat is like the desire to have a car and washing machine - essential to the aspirational self image of hundreds of millions of people, part of the life they are trying to build for themselves and their families.  I'm personally vegetarian, but I also understand how many in the developing world can see animal rights concerns as very secondary to the human rights and economic problems they have to face every day."

Advocating for any kind of progressive agenda is a sign of privelege of some sort. People having difficulty meeting their needs for survival tend not to be activists of any cause for obvious reasons. For causes in general, communities most affected tend to be on the front lines. LGBT rights advocacy is led by LGBT communities, women's rights advocacy is led by women, etc. Any allies in a fight will by definition be priveleged as they are not members of the group in question. So, of course animal rights activists are going to skew more priveleged than most advocacy groups because the ""community"" in question is incapable of participating. I would be willing to bet that if you looked at child's rights advocates or advocates for the rights of the severely mentally challenged, you would see a similar level of privelege. That has no bearing on the validity of their advocacy.

Why should the culture of humans be considered more highly than the basic right of livestock animals—which have been scientifically proven to experience pain, suffering, sadness, compassion, attachment to friends and family, and a preference to live—not to be enslaved, abused, and murdered?"

Sorry, just something that bothered me a bit.  But to the topic. This really is a hard issue, especially lacking perspective as I necessarily do, having white privilege, a reasonable amount of wealth privilege, and living in the USA. But it's important. I think there's a really strong case to be made that the immense physical and emotional suffering of any sentient creature pretty greatly outweighs human attachment to tradition and culture (which is valuable nonetheless).  Something that we have to be careful of, however, is that we don't let our duty to protect and defend non-human animals (which, of course, can't really protect themselves) sour into paternalism or colonialism a la Sam Harris's reasonable worries about Islamic violence turning into racist calls for airport profiling. It's a thin line. I think it needs to not be ""You guys are evil for eating animals.""

Or how vegan diets just aren't as accessible/viable for poor people, in the same way healthy foods aren't. But those are all systemic issues, and not accusations against poor people by vegans, at least not that I've seen. Neither from big organizations, nor individuals. So in my opinion the problem isn't veganism, it's the system that is making it difficult to follow it.  Couldn't think of a good transition to the next paragraph. So anyway.  The rare few times when speciesism pops up for discussion in social justice circles, there's this kneejerk ""CLASSIST THOUGH!"" response. Well, either that, or the trite ""I just couldn't stop eating meat, so sorry!"" While the latter is just a worthless excuse for narrow-mindedness, the former is plain derailing. It's very much like if you brought up how white women in academia dominate feminism every time someone talks about it. Yes it's a problem, no it doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about the good feminism can do. The argument, while it does have value, is mostly using poor people, as you very well put it, as a human shield to defend unethical and bigoted speciesist behavior, and that. is. shit.

Here's a map of the United States and various food desert regions: http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/usda-defines-food-deserts  These relate to the high likelihood that these people don't even have access to enough food (by time/monetary cost/availability) to even attempt a healthy diet in the first place.  This isn't to ignore the fact that there are vegans and vegetarians who cannot afford to live their worldview, but the way your questions are phrased gives me the feeling that you're focusing on the availability of vegan and vegetarian diets over the availability of healthy lifestyles.  Also within vegetarian and vegan circles, which coincide heavily with health food communities which ignore the significant problems with their diets and the problems those diets cause all over the world.  TL;DR: There is no ethical consumption under late capitalism"
SRSDiscussion,2yu1w6,Pterodactylism,11,Fri Mar 13 02:17:56 2015 UTC,"I would say there's a fair argument to be made that a meat free diet is a more ethical diet than most, even when only taking humans into account.  Unethical labour is found both in factory farms and with fields filled with chain gangs. Eating meat requires far more crops than just eating crops directly, therefore unethical labour required only increases with meat production.  Larger amounts of crops required, drives up prices of staple crops in developing countries, meaning less food available for the population, or at least less disposable income.  I understand that some vegetarian foods like quinuoa and lentils have food miles and drive up local prices also, but to a much lesser extent than all the crops required for meat production.  The environment is more affected by the gasses produced by intensive farming, than it could be by any increased food miles attributable to a meat free diet.  And as I say that's not even touching the animal cruelty involved in intensive farming."

It's not as if I was arguing that the meat industry should exist, I am a vegetarian. I'm arguing the their focus is incredibly off base when there are problems with more accessible solutions that more directly relate to human suffering now. American alone imports and produces upwards of 5x the amounts of necessary food to feed the nation, which means there's quite literally no reason to A) not cut back on this, and B) make healthy food available.  You're talking about long term issues and things that need solutions that will likely take a long time to implement. I feel these things are quite different from what I was talking about."

[...] I'm arguing the their focus is incredibly off base when there are problems with more accessible solutions that more directly relate to human suffering now.   I believe this is a good example of the fallacy of relative privation. That some people act to eliminate food deserts and global hunger does not preclude other people, or even those same people, from acting to reduce or end the suffering of non-human animals. Advocating for plant-based diets and advocating for the rights and health of impoverished people are not mutually exclusive tasks.  If I were to tell people who campaign against street harassment toward women that their focus is ""incredibly off base"" because the issue of police violence against black men causes more human suffering or more death, I would be wrong.  A lot of people, at least in my experience hearing the phrase on Tumblr, mistake ""there is no ethical consumption under late capitalism"" to mean ""all consumption under late capitalism is equally unethical""; and then they use that mistake as an excuse either to derail important discussions about animal cruelty and workers' rights violations, or to excuse their preference for complete ignorance, or both.

I agree with your point about changing an industry being easier than eliminating one, but you're talking about drasticly changing the entire food industry over eleiminating just the meat industry. i think both are tasks which will be more or less, equally difficult to accomplish.  Also I'm not sure how vegetarianism is more of a long term issue? I'm not sure how consumers would go about tackling extravagent waste of food in the US, or bringing healthier diets to the US, but I dont see how focusing on vegetarianism hinders this, in fact I can see many ways in which it is mutually 'inclusive'.  I can't imagine a situation where healthy eating is possible for the vast majority of the population, but meat free diets aren't. With the food waste issue, I think I made a case for vegetarianism being a good way to eliminate food waste and I'm pretty sure it would be a good way to help with healthier diets.  Surely meat can be eliminated by consumers, with the ability to, boycotting it. As consumer preferences change so do the suppliers objectives, I cant see how you would do that with healthy eating, that change comes from the indutry, through lobbying or other means, but I can't see how vegetarianism will take a longer time to implement and isn't as accessible, as you said.  I can't really see how focusing on a meat free diet is off base when it comes to priorities and I'm not even sure we should always focus on humans, especially with the sheer magnitude of animals being harmed."
SRSDiscussion,2yu1w6,Hamstak,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"The massive food waste can more easily be funneled into feeding people through policy making than coming up with a plan for what to do with the millions of stock animals that won't really have anything to do if the meat industry were to simply disappear.  And the distribution of ""wasted"" food would enable people to live vegetarian lifestyles a lot more easily as a consequence of making healthy lifestyles more available.  Food waste is largely things like market vegetables and fruits being thrown out for not looking good, perishables near their expiration date being thrown out, and such. You're focusing more on resource consumption, which honestly isn't a huge issue in the long run with agricultural innovations like aquaponics and hydroponics.  People are already dumpster diving in mass to find non-perished food that's been thrown out from just super markets and making it available to people who need it. I highly doubt that a mass exodus from meat would be involved in any small time frame, since that isn't already happening.  To me, focusing on meat-free diets and their availability takes second to focusing on teaching people about healthy nutritional bases and making the necessities for that available.  This of course doesn't mean I don't think people shouldn't focus on the issues that they want, because multi-issue group interactions are incredibly important for social change."

For starters I find this to be a completely oppressive belief in the first place, and think that every argument that could be used to justify it (intellectual/emotional or physical ability; civility; difference; utility) is indistinguishable from the arguments used to justify ableism, colonialism, etc, right down to the pseudo-scientific beliefs invariably used to justify their ""natural"" state as inherently less valuable (""to the dominant group"" is the part that's left unsaid).  Respecting individual beings (including non-human animals) as subjects with their own wants and needs makes it pretty difficult to argue that humans as a group should come first. First off, there are way more non-humans involved in the food system than humans, with several hundred animals being used to support a single human each year. Even if we were to accept some devaluation of non-human's ""moral value"" if it's even 1% of that of humans the cumulative welfare of non-humans would still be more important. And once we take into account the nature of the exploitation--mutilation, prolonged abusive exploitation, and death--it becomes even more difficult to argue that humans are the primary concern of the global food system."

I'm with /u/mutatersalad - if using the psychiatric term 'pedophile' then we should also use its definition from the DSM, which refers to an attraction to children under 13, pre-adolescence.  A lot of people on this sub seem to use 'child' to mean 'not an adult', instead of 'under 12', which is odd to me: teens are clearly adolescents, not children (or infants, or adults) in the view of my cultural background.  I also don't know how this can be discussed in good faith against the background of Western moral panic about age differences in relationships.

Neither prepubescant children or teenagers should be having sex with adults.  And calling attraction to teenagers ephebophilia seems like a justification for many people. And we're concerned about the teenagers many adults are preying on.   It seems like many people care too much about puberty, fertility, and the bodies of children and adults. When the whole reason that pedophilia is a problem is because of children having the minds of children, not the bodies. People consent with their minds, not their bodies.

It is also very pompous to believe that all human are the same or that someone under 16 or 18 isn't ""smart enough"" to know what they are doing.

The way we interact with people on an anonymous forum is that we tend to assume the person on the other end of the conversation is an adult. They may be twelve, but we never treat them as such. I think this is the safest assumption when talking about sexual attraction to children, because paedophiles will hide among the anonymous teenagers to gain legitimacy. If a paedophile accusation is levelled at a 13 year old, that kid can just shrug off the comment as not directed at them, but the public message that paedophilia and the sexualization of minors will not be tolerated under any circumstances remains.  Age of consent at first glance seems arbitrary, and in some ways it is. However, sometimes you need to use common sense and draw a line in the sand. The age of consent is 16-18 in a lot of places because you can be reasonably sure that the person is emotionally mature enough to be able to give informed consent. There may well be some people who can at 15, but tough shit. We have no way of testing it, so it's better to assume otherwise.   There is also the fact that age of consent often coincides with the age at which people can legally leave school. I don't think this is a coincidence - the power imbalance between a schoolchild and an adult is quite massive.  At the end of the day you have to draw the line somewhere, and I think 18 is about right. However, I think it also takes common sense, an awareness of any power imbalance, and a willingness to not abuse people. Just because 18 is the age of consent, it doesn't mean a 45 year old is free of moral responsibility in having sex with that person even if it is legal."

But then, they usually don't actually make it very accessible, they just think one ramp is all of it.   Ooh, the people who offer constant unsolicited advice for how to treat/cure your condition!

SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,7Architects,45,Tue Mar 10 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to come at this from a more personal direction. I was born somewhere between 23-26 weeks gestational age, which was the utmost limit of viability at the time, and is not far off from the current limit of viability even with today's medical advancements. I weighed 1.5 lbs. Due to ridiculously poor medical care and other factors, my mother only knew that she was pregnant for three weeks before I was born and thus never had the option to abort. It was predicted that I would develop fatal hydrocephalus, or that if I survived I would be in a vegetative state.  Instead, I have cerebral palsy. My case is mild in that I don't have an intellectual disability, I overcame my speech impediment as a child, and I can walk independently. There are shockingly few studies on the prognosis for adults with CP, but I don't expect that my lifespan will be affected by it; however, I am likely to develop osteoarthritis by the time I'm 30, and at 25 I already feel the effect on the joints in the lower half of my body. Yet, knowing that things turned out extremely well for me considering the circumstances, I would not fault my mother if she had aborted me, had she been able. The odds wer absolutely against me. Down's Syndrome is, of course, a different disorder and, like me, some people with DS manage to lead relatively average lives; but their lifespans are significantly shorter, and  even in then they face a much higher risk of several painful and dangerous medical conditions that would reduce a person's quality of life.  I strongly dislike the phrase ""differently-abled."" There is nothing which cerebral palsy allows me to do that an able-bodied person cannot. There are a lot things that I cannot and will never be able to do because of it, and many other things that are more difficult and physically painful for me than they would otherwise be. I am literally less able. In a small measure, my potential as a human being has been diminished. My dignity as a human being has not. It remains equal to anyone else's and would regardless of the severity of my disability. Unless there were an absolute cure, nothing can remove the limitations that cerebral palsy has put on me, and medical treatment has expanded those boundaries about as far as they can go. Although there are doubtlessly plenty of ways that society might better accommodate me, no amount of accommodation will alter the fact that I am disabled. If I lived alone in a culture-free void, basic locomotion would still be painful and taxing for me. So understand that I am not parroting back some brainwashed prejudice. To present my physical capabilities as different but equal to an able-bodied person's is to deny a fundamental tenet of my actual experience. There may well be people out there with disabilities who feel that they gain something equal or better than what the unimpaired would, but that definitely does not apply universally.  What can change is the degree to which society acknowledges disabled people's inherent and equal dignity as a human beings. Aborting a fetus that has Down's Syndrome in favor of one that possesses more physical and intellectual potential does not and cannot reduce the dignity of living people who have DS. Nor do I think it would reflect an attempt to negate those people's dignity. It's simply a parent's natural desire for their child to have the best life possible."

It seems to me like they're turning it into a slippery slope issue. Anyway, that is the argument that I was countering to say that it is not immoral to abort in that scenario, so I don't know what other reason someone would think it's unjustifiable or how they would arrive at that conclusion.

SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,FeministNewbie,22,Wed Mar 11 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need to require individuals to justify abortions, but we should ask why 92% of pregnancies where Down syndrome is detected are terminated. It's not an individual-choice question but a societal ethical question with respect to how we treat people with disabilities.   Edit: Because I think my words keep getting twisted or my meaning is unclear. No, a fetus is not a person with disabilities because a fetus/embryo is not a person. People have the right to end any pregnancy if they feel it is the right choice for them, including because they don't think they can care for a child with a prenatally-detectable disability. HOWEVER I think, from what I've heard from both disability rights activists and expectant parents, the default assumption is that parents will terminate a pregnancy, and the kinds of resources and community support that organizations like the National Down Syndrome Congress and the National Down Syndrome Society are attempting provide aren't made available to parents. I support parents' choices, but it's not a choice if only one option is ever presented."

I have friends whose child have severe autism: it's a full-time job even with some daycare help."
SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,FeministNewbie,3,Wed Mar 11 16:40:18 2015 UTC,"As I said in another reply, I think the problem is that often expectant parents don't get the full set of information about the community resources and early intervention programs available to them.   Down syndrome is such a variable disability - there are people who can be successful and independent, people who will need life-long support, people who will die very young from congenital heart defects and people who live pretty full long lives. It's impossibly difficult to ask parents to make that choice when their potential child is just a fetus and the diagnosis is just a third line on a karyotype, but the worst possible outcome isn't the only outcome that parents should be presented."

I honestly doubt it."

But from what I've read (especially from disability advocacy groups) parents are much more likely to be pushed or encouraged to abort without being given a full picture of information. That might not be true, but I tend to trust advocacy groups and the experiences of members of a particular community."
SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,FaceofMoe,11,Wed Mar 11 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that's true? I don't.   I don't have children, nor do I want any. But I suspect people that do want children and actively try for them, want a child that is healthy, happy, intelligent, physically gifted, attractive, etc. Essentially, I assume that everyone wants a child with the most advantages and the least disadvantages possible.   Of course I believe that parents of disabled children love their children. But I would be genuinely surprised if parents of disabled children wouldn't have preferred a child with no disabilities.   Not totally equivalent, but I have a few medical issues (fairly serious food allergy, asthma) and I'm sure that given the option, my parents would have preferred a healthier child."

It may be that I feel this way because my disability is mild compared to others', but if I found a magic lamp and got three wishes, ridding myself of cerebral palsy wouldn't be one of them. Not that I love it or really identify with it, but I don't have any experience with what life would be like without it. I don't think about it except when it's causing me pain. I'm adjusted to it, i guess.  In contrast, I would totally get rid of my mental illnesses because I can tell how much they've hindered me--except not the OCD. That one feels like it's a part of who I am. It also showed up a lot sooner than the others, though, and it was manageable before the rest of the bunch took hold. So I essentially have three different perspectives on the subject.  Because I wouldn't want to put anyone else through what I've suffered, I've chosen not to have children. I am a would-be mother who would rather not have children than risk perpetuating the cycle of mental illness and violence [obligatory disclaimer: not all mentally ill people are violent] that has plagued my family over the generations.

Mental illnesses fall into the class of psychiatric disabilities, though these are usually overlooked in these types of discussions. I don't mean to attribute malice to that. Psychiatric disabilities aren't visually apparent and are harder to adjust for (e.g. there's no wheelchair and ramps). Mental disabilities with physical components (e.g. Down's Syndrome) seem to be discussed more than purely mental disabilities."

Abortion is a complicated one, and I think the best answer is to trust the mother's judgement, while ensuring that as a society we have support mechanisms in place for the child.  As for prevention methods (not drinking etc), I agree with them. I don't think the abledness of a person is linked to their dignity or worth as a person. That doesn't mean that being disabled doesn't make a person's life more difficult, however. Unlike other examples given in this thread (being a woman, for example) these difficulties are not entirely due to our social construct. Socially, it is our responsibility to make sure that our culture doesn't misinterpret this as meaning that disabled people are lesser than able bodied people."

SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,sibeliushelp,6,Thu Mar 12 00:12:20 2015 UTC,"No, and that's not what I meant. The culture we live in and the way we treat actual people with disabilities affects the decision-making process when parents find out their fetus has trisomy 21, or any other potential problem detectable via amniocentesis. That's why I'm saying that this is a broader society problem and not an individual decision problem."
SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,tilia-cordata,8,Thu Mar 12 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"I see. Do you really think that it's society's treatment of the disabled that influences this decision, rather than the burden of constant life-long care for a person who will never be capable of looking after themselves? In the case of DS for example. Or maybe they don't want to bring someone into the world to watch them suffer and die at a young age."
SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,sibeliushelp,2,Thu Mar 12 00:42:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's complicated but the lack of support and resources for people with disabilities is absolutely a component that influences parents decision making. I linked to some resources from two major Down syndrome advocacy organizations - take a look at some of the things they are fighting for. Also:   constant life-long care for a person who will never be capable of looking after themselves?   With sufficient early intervention and primary/secondary education, a quickly growing number of adults with Down syndrome are able to live independently.  Do I think the majority of parents would still decide to terminate even with given a really comprehensive set of information and vastly improved resources for people with disabilities? Yeah, probably. But I think the percentage would be smaller than 92%."
SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,astrobuckeye,7,Thu Mar 12 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"An even larger number won't. At best you're looking at an IQ of 50-70, at worst 20-35 (no intervention is going to make you independent at that point). Most will also have hearing and vision problems, a 40% risk of heard disease, thyroid problems, breathing issues, seizures ...  Of course, information and improved facilities for disabled people are a good thing, and of course once these people are born we must do our best to help them live with as much dignity and as little suffering as possible, but clearly it would be better if people didn't have to live  with Down Syndrome at all, and I don't see how one can argue against this from a pro-choice perspective."
SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,tilia-cordata,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:43:08 2015 UTC,I think the percentage you quote is deceptive and not representative of how the population reacts to the diagnosis of Downs.

SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,praxulus,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:55:26 2015 UTC,"Most recent statistic I could find is that 72% of pregnancies are screened for Down syndrome (from 2010-2011) - this will only grow as non-invasive testing becomes more accurate and available. It was surprisingly difficult to find any sources on the rate of prenatal testing, but it has become much more popular.    There are also a wide range of things tested for in prenatal tests. I would probably terminate a pregnancy where the fetus had anencephaly, where the baby is almost always stillborn or dies shortly after birth. On the other hand, while I wouldn't terminate if Down syndrome was detected, I would want to know in advance to get in touch with community support and early intervention programs."

That involves white first-world feminists telling women of color what's good for them, which is abhorrent and quite literally racist (and wrong, as, sad to say, the women are making what they feel is a rational choice in their circumstance). Also, in the United Kingdom, I've read of issues with health providers denying abortions to women of color (and only women of color) on such grounds.  Feminism is about fighting for the agency of women.

It is also a process of erasure, because it operates on the assumption that no people indigenous to a region or culture are working in opposition to traditions or ideas that are harmful. And, as pointed out in another thread, it undoes the work of indigenous feminists by making them look like colonial collaborators. Sometimes the process of coercive, white/EuroAmerican intervention actually galvanizes practicers of whatever act or tradition that people find objectionable.

In the best case, the mother dies an earlier death due to chronic stress. In the worst case, the child suffers abuse at the hands of the guardians, which is a massive problem with all unwanted pregnancies, but even worse in cases of Down syndrome and low-functioning autism.  There is nothing honorable about forcing a woman to have an unwanted child. It may us feel better about ourselves, but at the cost of introducing more suffering into the world.

I guess what surprises me about this issue is how many progressive people seem to think there is a difference between allowing a fetus with a disability to develop, and inducing a disability in a fetus. I wonder if these people really think the fetus is merely a potential person? It seems like they want to give at least some amount of consideration to the rights or duties we have to the fetus."

Both have a right to life, but that right to life is generally trumped by the right to bodily autonomy. Yet in your acne case, you aren't interfering with the right to life, but the right to bodily integrity of a future human. Considering we're interfering with the rights of a future person, I believe we should only make a yes or no decision. Either you grant right to life or you don't. If you do, you can't harm bodily integrity or any other future rights.   To undermine the theory that the decision to keep a child grants that child rights, imagine a situation where someone attacks a pregnant woman, killing the unborn child. That's not just assault, it's murder."

SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,koronicus,7,Wed Mar 11 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"Peter Singer, whose ethics is often the subject of controversy, states that we make judgments of quality of living all the time.  Suppose you break your legs, Singer asks, and at the hospital waiting room you are accosted by someone who is in a wheelchair.  She asks you what you plan to do, and you tell her that you want your legs restored to the order they were previously in.  She becomes incensed, saying that you have judged a life with functioning legs to be superior to a life without them.  Now, I think most of us will have to bite that bullet and indeed admit that yes, we do value a life without disability over a life with disability.  It is important here to clarify- every person who wishes to be alive has a valuable life worth protecting and aiding.    Disabled people can provide much value to the world and their loved ones, and definitely experience lives worth living.  But the question is, ceteris paribus, would their life be better without disability?  The answer seems to be yes, but it isn't necessarily so- their disability may add value to their life, by shaping the person they are.  This is a form of non-identity problem, on which Derek Parfitt has written. (Reasons and Persons is a great read, btw.)  The issue is that there is no ceteris paribus case- the person with the condition or disability is continuous with that disability- they are not defined by it, but it is part of who they are.  So to say that it is better, all things being equal, that they had no disability is conceptually weird.  To abort someone with a tendency to organic depression, for example, is to abort that person entirely, and whoever is born ""in their place"" is not a version of that same person minus the depression- it is an entirely separate entity.  The moral here is that it is very difficult to know whether it is just or ethical to abort or not- we might agree that bring into existence a being who is likely to suffer immensely and is therefore incapable of a life worth living is morally wrong, the vast majority of the time it's never that clear cut, and it may indeed be the case that disabilities lead people to the unique personalities of those that have them, and have lives wholly worth living."
SRSDiscussion,2ymbjr,WorkshopVillage,9,Thu Mar 12 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"This question cannot be discussed meaningfully without first addressing its underlying preconceptions.  A moral judgment has to first be based on factual beliefs. If those haven't been laid out, there's no basis upon which to discuss morality.  Is it true that someone with DS cannot experience pleasure and enjoy their lives? No, of course not.  Is it true that on balance, someone with DS will experience more suffering than pleasure? This question can have no universal answer because it's so subjective. The firsthand accounts I've read come down strongly on the negative side. Even if someone's hypothetical answer were yes, there is no justification for extrapolating that nonexistence is an objectively better state of being.  Deciding on behalf of someone else, especially moving down a privilege gradient, whether their life is worth living is inherently suspect. If a fetus will develop a condition that guarantees a nasty, brutish, and short life of constant agony, that's one thing, but whatever that may describe isn't DS.  Much of what hurts disabled people isn't the disability itself (or at least not just that), but rather the rigid social structures that the abled enforce upon society as a whole. I don't see any acceptable way to discuss this question without first unpacking those.  Ultimately, the ""one should abort"" or ""not aborting is immoral"" arguments boil down to some combination of misconceptions about DS and ""raising someone like this would inconvenience me, and I do not want to be inconvenienced, so abortion is better."" Mind you, aborting for selfish reasons is perfectly valid--everyone has the right to control their own body--but trying to rationalize selfishness into altruism absolutely does not fly. Here be dragons.  Abortion, in and of itself, is amoral--neither moral nor immoral. The attitudes one promotes about groups of people, whether with respect to abortion or life in general, however, can contribute to marginalization and thus their propagation can be immoral.  The attitude that it is better to literally not exist than to have a disability is disturbingly common and contributes directly to the murdering of innocent people by their caregivers. Responses to this are often--rather than revulsion at someone killing their own child--expressions of sympathy for the killer and lighter treatment by the justice system. Failing to recognize this reality in discussions of a disability one does not experience would be irresponsible at best.  Incidentally, the 2015 Day of Mourning for this was March 1st.  Basically, aborting due to fears that the child would be disabled isn't an inherently immoral decision, but it certainly can be the result of incorrect and harmful beliefs about disability. Since abortion itself is outside the sphere of morality, I would say that what's immoral is advocating harmful beliefs. A fetus can be disregarded, but the actual disabled people who have to live in a world structured in ways that harm them deserve not to have their experiences and marginalization erased.  The question of ""is it okay if we make people like you not exist"" really ought to be supplanted by ""how can social structures be altered to better suit your needs"" if the conversation is ever to lead anywhere productive."

I would say there is.  I think most people would probably say that not having a disability would be preferable to having one. That doesn't mean that having a disability makes one's experiences of the world inherently negative, though. In most cases, it is perfectly possible for a disabled person to live a rich, full, and satisfying life. There are disabled people who say that if they had the choice to end their disability, they wouldn't take it. Therefore, it's no more immoral to bring such a person into the world than any other category of oppression. Again, the situation is not the existence of one person either with or without DS but rather existence for two potential people, one with and one without.  That being said, knowingly taking actions that are likely to harm someone is irresponsible at best. Purposefully drinking while knowingly pregnant with a fetus one intends to carry to term is morally bad because it causes harm to the person that fetus will become. (Drinking while unknowingly pregnant can also cause harm, but the intentionality is what matters here.) Does that mean that subsequently giving birth to such a child is itself immoral? No. To say otherwise would be to say that nonexistence is better than disability, and such a position is untenable.   Even if abortion is ethically permissible I don't see why we can't ask questions about the morality of the act itself.   What is the morality of brushing your teeth? What is the morality of using the toilet? What is the morality of cutting your hair? These questions don't really make sense.

These are important to recognize because they influence our reasoning processes, moral and otherwise, and aren't necessarily shared by our interlocutors. A person who says it's immoral not to abort a fetus with DS, for example, almost certainly has both a flawed understanding of the facts and a strongly negative set of associations with disability, which would include a variety of negative value judgments.  As for JWs, they're exactly why I mentioned that. Those are examples of amoral actions that have been appropriated by external groups and forced into a framework of morality when they don't belong there. It makes no sense to consider an act that affects no one else as either moral or immoral.  Morality is fundamentally a question of the effects people have on each other and the world, positive or negative (are we helping? is there nonconsensual harm?). Some people do make special pleading arguments to add their pet ""oh and...!""s to that core principle, but we're not obligated to accept those as general truths. Questions of ""sin"" have no place in an evaluation of morality.

A bit more nuance to my last point (that if such an acne medicine existed, and a parent really genuinely had the resources to support completely support a child with Down syndrome, that I would disagree with the choice to take it but I don't think it would be fundamentally unethical.)  It's not unethical to have a baby after 50 if you can, even if the chance of trisomy 21 is 1 in 44. I don't think it would be unethical to take medication that helps serious medical conditions during pregnancy even if there's an increased risk of birth defects (ie, I'm probably not going to stop taking antidepressants if I get pregnant, though it'll be a conversation I have with my doctor when the time comes). The acne medicine hypothetical is an extreme in either of these directions, one that I think is more challenging to accept ethically because acne seems so trivial in relation to the health problems that stem from Down syndrome.   If I get pregnant I'll take folic acid to prevent spina bifida and anencephaly (because those are likely to be fatal right away) and I won't drink alcohol, because I do think it would be wrong to needlessly cause harm (pain, health problems, etc) to a child I'm intentionally bringing into this world.

And yet, all the villains in the story, orc or human, are based on Asians (Orcs), Arabs and Indians (Haradrim), and other PoC, and contrasted against the ""[white] men of the West.""  We can't blame Tolkien for this: he was merely a product of his time, as are we all.

But regarding the wars, I don't think something has to be a conscious allegory for there to be possibly clear inspirations for certain aspects of it, and I'm sure the wars probably inspired more in his writing than he'd necessarily intentionally use.  Just like you can say that he was probably inspired by anti-semitism when coming up with the dwarves, you could maybe say that it makes sense for him to have been inspired by the people he fought against when coming up with orcs and Mordor, if only as a concrete representation of war."

I think that alone can be problematic from a progressive standpoint.  On the other hand, I have a problem with criticizing aesthetic concepts based solely on the conditions that brought them about. Should we criticize cubism because Picasso was a womanizer?  That whole article (about the Belle) assumes that the style venerates the specific value of owning slaves without much evidence other than the style it's based on, not the style that it is, arose in a context where slavery was prolific. In other words, it seems to be saying that we should ignore or repress all cultural influence that arose from cultures with less than perfect values. It assumes that the revival of the fashion is based on everything from that time-period, not just certain aspects that the designers choose to venerate (while not involving other aspects). It forgets that the belles weren't the property owners, and that the slave-owning culture wasn't even close to 100% their fault. It neglects to mention that the description of ""The Southern Belle"" still applies to countless southern women today without the slave-owning, cultural imperialist BS. In other words, that article is advocating throwing the Aesthetic Baby out with the Cultural Bathwater.  By extension, I would have to say the same for Steampunk. It's unfair to say that the aesthetic itself upholds the values from the time in which it arose, unless those values are somehow integral. Could the Belle aesthetic have arisen out of a hypothetical culture that wasn't imperialistic, slave-owning trash? Yes, that is in no way directly related to the style. Could that same be said for Steampunk and outdated Victorian values? Then perhaps we shouldn't be so quick to criticize stylistic choices.  Individuals and artists may lionize, romanticize, and venerate the cultures the aesthetics arose from -- that doesn't mean the aesthetics are inherently wrong."
SRSDiscussion,2ygpzc,Clumpy,13,Tue Mar 10 13:24:04 2015 UTC,"Steampunk is a pretty niche genre with plenty of room to grow.  But to do sure, it's old school. I remember once reading a collection of short stories of the steampunk genre. The forward, written by the collector, noted specifically that there was a lot of racism, sexism, imperialism, and all sorts of less then politically correct elements to them. But there were also a lot of progressive, notably feminist, ideas in them as well.  Because the thing is, steampunk is also a very broad genre. While the ""southern belle"" aesthetic is deeply rooted into it, it's not a necessity. Rather, by definition, steampunk is science fiction rooted in imagined or alternate worlds that did not involve oil based technological advancements. The series 'Legend of Korra' being one of my favorite recent examples. (Which along with it's Asian inspired aesthetic, not white female protagonist, and confirmed same sex relationship, is probably the best example.)  If you're speaking more of the fashion, and not so much the fiction, then I can't disagree with you. It's very well rooted in the styles of the nineteenth century, only with more goggles and mechanical steam powered cyborg arms.  (One could argue, though it would hardly justify such a thing, that slave labour would be common place in a steampunk setting because of how difficult it would be to mass produce things without an industrial revolution.)  So I guess what I'm saying is, yes. You're right, it's very problematic. But I'm also saying it has plenty of room to grow and change, and in fact has over the years. There are still plenty of worlds, and fashions, to craft."

If we have a new jim crow, it's not because the neo-classical architecture in DC harkens back to the slavery of ancient Rome.  I'm not familiar with ""steampunk"" as a whole, but the question to ask would be, does steam punk idealize the Victorian era as regards its cultural tropes. The southern belle is not simply a woman who likes poofy dresses and drinking sweet tea--as the article shows, it's about an entire gendered code of conduct, and while aesthetics may be political, this southern ""ethos"" is clearly more ideological than aesthetic.

It's not like a western where the entire thing is characterized by repeated cliches and tropes which can be easily distinguished as defining the genre (steampunk has plenty of these but so much more that those cliches aren't necessary for it to be steampunk). Unfortunately, this means that in order to really discuss this you're going to have to parse out individual aspects or find out if there are subgenres of steampunk which might be more narrow in their scope."

I'll quote some of it:   Life was mostly unpleasant, brutish, and short; the legal status of women in the UK or US was lower than it is in Iran today: politics was by any modern standard horribly corrupt and dominated by authoritarian psychopaths and inbred hereditary aristocrats: it was a priest-ridden era that had barely climbed out of the age of witch-burning, and bigotry and discrimination were ever popular sports: for most of the population starvation was an ever-present threat. I could continue at length. It's the world that bequeathed us the adjective ""Dickensian"", that gave us a fully worked example of the evils of a libertarian minarchist state, and that provoked Marx to write his great consolatory fantasy epic, The Communist Manifesto. It's the world that gave birth to the horrors of the Modern, and to the mass movements that built pyramids of skulls to mark the triumph of the will. It was a vile, oppressive, poverty-stricken and debased world and we should shed no tears for its passing  The romanticization of totalitarianism is nothing new (and if you don't recognize the totalitarian urge embedded in the steampunk nostalgia trip, I should like to remind you that ""king"" is a synonym for ""hereditary dictator""  what would a steampunk novel that took the taproot history of the period seriously look like?  Forget wealthy aristocrats sipping tea in sophisticated London parlours; forget airship smugglers in the weird wild west. A revisionist mundane SF steampunk epic — mundane SF is the socialist realist movement within our tired post-revolutionary genre — would reflect the travails of the colonial peasants forced to labour under the guns of the white Europeans' Zeppelins, in a tropical paradise where severed human hands are currency and even suicide doesn't bring release from bondage. (Hey, this is steampunk — it needs zombies and zeppelins, right? Might as well pick Zombies for our single one impossible ingredient.) It would share the empty-stomached anguish of a young prostitute on the streets of a northern town during a recession, unwanted children (contraception is a crime) offloaded on a baby farm with a guaranteed 90% mortality rate through neglect. The casual boiled-beef brutality of the soldiers who take the King's shilling to break the heads of union members organizing for a 60 hour work week. The fading eyesight and mangled fingers of nine year olds forced to labour on steam-powered looms, weaving cloth for the rich. The empty-headed graces of debutantes raised from birth to be bargaining chips and breeding stock for their fathers' fortunes.   Sums it up exactly."

SRSDiscussion,2ygpzc,Tesseraction,2,Wed Mar 11 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"I think it is possible to romanticize some of the nicer parts of a culture with problems, without actually accepting or condoning those problems. Many of us get caught up in the dangers of romanticizing and fetishizing cultures.   With cultures that one isn't a part of, there is the worry of appropriation and fetishization. And with one's own culture, one can have fears of nationalism and supremacism.  But I grow a bit weary of that. It's okay to celebrate cultures. As long as one isn't celebrating problematic areas of them. It's pretty natural to want to like things, or have feelings of escapism. There aren't any cultures without problems.   Certainly, Steampunk is included in that. No culture should be loved and praised and romanticized unconditionally and uncritically. But it is okay to like things, and there are plenty of things to like about the Victorian era, Industrialization, and cultures that partook in horrid sexism, racism, and imperialism.

SRSDiscussion,2ygpzc,BrokeBrokerMDK,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"An interesting question, and not one that can have an easy answer - it depends wholly on the authors of such works, whether they're progressively minded or 'I miss the good old days' reactionaries. While the Ante-Belle-um (couldn't resist) is necessarily predicated on slavery-wealth, there is a potential argument that the fictional version of the Industrial Revolution which Steampunk clings to is meant to be (was meant to be?) more about the benefits of the division of labour and the possibilities it produced in terms of machinery and automation. It was under this setting that the labour movement started to demand greater rights.  Different creative minds could use this to bring about settings where egalitarian theories won over inequality rhetoric. The time period is more an accident of when the industrial revolution occurred rather than a particular love of the time. Of course, one thing that helped this time period be the remembered accident is that the same revolution aided in the production of mass print, which also opened the way to the educational literacy that enabled the 'liberal democracy' of today.  I suppose what I'm saying is that Antebellum romanticism is necessarily predicated on the fact it's 'ante' - the setting is by its definition specifically in the period of legal slavery. Steampunk's basis is more open ended - it is, after all, possible to have an industrial revolution without imperialism, so it's up to the author to decide if their fictional history plays out with British imperial terror.  That said I think Steampunk is horrible turd garbage so take from that what you will."

SRSDiscussion,2y8e01,LittleHelperRobot,25,Thu Mar 12 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"/u/SweetNyan is right. For OP's sake: conservative = wants the status quo. Liberalism = an ideology that came out of 18th century Europe, including individualism and rationalism and capitalism. Radical/Leftist = anti-capitalist and more communitarian/focused on equality of outcomes than equality of opportunity, roughly. So liberal vs. conservative in U.S. politics really refers to, e.g. individual liberties vs. a paternalistic state that can govern morality (like by defining marriage according to religious principles). The U.S. conservatives who are business oriented and want money = speech etc. are Liberals (or neo-Liberals), even though they're not liberal in the popular usage of being on the political left.  I have not actually watched many of Sarkeesian's videos, but I would say that if she's primarily focused on gender and pushing for women to have equal representation within the existing system, that is a Liberal/moderate view, whereas if she is connecting systemic sexism/patriarchy with racism/white supremacy and capitalism, and tying to change the system itself rather than just changing who holds postions of power within the existing system, those are radical/Leftist views.  (This is further confused by the fact that feminists use ""radical feminist"" to refer to TERFs, but in most other uses ""radical"" means leftist/anti-capitalist/opposed to Liberalism, but from the left rather than the right).

She isn't, say, calling for the total abolition of capitalism, suggesting the total automation of, I don't know, reproduction, or even suggesting the video games industry be totally dismantled, she's just mildly perturbed about the status of women in video games.  I'm not all too familiar with her videos, because I find them sort of boring, but from what I can tell Sarkeesian isn't interested in a radical restructuring of political, economic, social, etc. systems; rather, she'd like to see women portrayed a bit more equitably in mass media institutions. In this sense, she's fairly moderate.  As an aside, provided we're talking about most Western nations, ""very liberal"" and ""moderate"" are more or less interchangeable in the grand political ""spectrum"" -- it's just that after about 70+ years of choosing between the racist, sexist, imperial finance party (what's called the liberal party or something similar) and the racist, sexist, imperial finance party on steroids (what's called conservative), the range of ""appropriate"" political expression constricts a bit, and we're left with a lot of people who consider slightly left-of-centre attitudes, policies, etc. to be ""very liberal"" or even subversively left-leaning."

SRSDiscussion,2y8e01,eoz,7,Sat Mar 7 16:59:51 2015 UTC,"I wrote this somewhere else, but I think it applies:   As I see it (I'm most sypmathetic to anarcha-feminism and ecofeminism, so I may not be correct), liberal feminists are most concerned with legislation (social and business regulatory), integration into mass media (television, education, etc.), and representation in «important» organizations (corporate boards, legislatures, etc.). In essence, they're concerned with making sure that capitalist representative democracy is equitable.   This definition of liberal feminism applies to Sarkeesian because her focus is inclusion of positive/major feminine roles in mass media (especially video games) and the fostering of positive environments surrounding these media for women.  However, like most feminists do, she makes frequent use social scientific analysis in her work. This is characteristic of radical feminism as I say in the same comment:   [...] I see radical feminism as the movement that investigates how patriarchy is structured and exactly which forms of (structural) oppression can be (ultimately) attributed to patriarchy. This kind of tendency will inevitably produce a great breadth (and perhaps a great depth) of social scientific work. From what I can tell, radical feminists can have any combined political belief (liberal, socialist, even anarchist).   I wouldn't hastily exclude Sarkeesian from this tendency either. Perhaps, what is simply radical analysis of video games/other media and their subcultures is being mistaken for a broadening of liberal literature. Perhaps it's both. I'm not certain.    Nevertheless, Sarkeesian's work is compatible to both feminisms. Of course it's up to her to claim solidarity with whichever movement(s) she sees fit. However, you asked us what we think. From an extremely fallible third person perspective, I'd be comfortable with both labels, a radical feminist with a liberal perspective. Her role in feminist academia is to determine which social structures prevent women from having an equitable position to men in contemporary cultures.  e: Clarification and expansion"

She's about as fangless and uncontroversial as they come in her feminist beliefs and how she expresses them. I don't know why she removed her Bayonetta video. But I wouldn't be surprised if she did that because she found it too controversial.  And, as others have stated. A more radical position would be, for instance, trying to oppose Capitalism itself as a way of opposing Patriarchy.  Perhaps I didn't touch on anything particularly helpful. Sorry about that. I might not be the best qualified to talk about some of this."

SRSDiscussion,2y4rns,artifex28,7,Fri Mar 6 13:09:04 2015 UTC,"While I might quibble some some of your stats (US debt has increased 1500% is basically meaningless), your overall picture isn't a gross misrepresentation of the state of play.  The real question is to what extent can we re-coup labour's share of national income from capital. This has happened in the past - periods of high growth and moderate-to-high inflation make existing capital stocks less valuable as a source of wealth than labour. Hence income inequality in the new world was significantly reduced as compared to Europe at the turn of the 19th C. Of course, it caught up in the 20th C, though was once again assaulted quite dramatically during the wars.   It's interesting that you're so down on GDP growth, because it's only in times of growth (and capital shocks like wars) that we see re-distribution of income share to labour. Low growth economies, especially low inflation, low growth economies, favour capital much more heavily. Slowing growth will hurt workers far more than it hurts rentiers.  Piketty is well across this in Capital in the 21st C. And there are effective policy mechanisms to re-balance labour's share of national income without capital shocks like wars. The catch is getting the political will.  In the US it's easy to be dismayed. The failure of the Occupy movement, and Obama's dismal record on inequality are disheartening. But Obama never came to power on a platform of serious economic re-evaluating. Warren and Sanders might. (Clinton won't. Don't vote for her in the primaries!)  The west is still a democracy, and while it's easy to be cynical about that as long as it is true there's hope. Actual genuine hope, not Obama's Hope (tm). A popular movement to break the back of the Koch/Walton oligarchy and install leaders with a real mandate for economic change and renewal is possible, and an exciting prospect. I wouldn't give up on it yes.  (If republicans and/or compliant wall st backed dems take the Whitehouse in 2016 I'd consider a revolution, tho.)"
SRSDiscussion,2y4rns,TheEvilSloth,3,Fri Mar 6 13:29:45 2015 UTC,"Hence income inequality in the new world was significantly reduced as compared to Europe at the turn of the 19th C.    The problem with this too, though, is that it was basically that low because of non-normal factors (i.e., wars, revolutions). Even without capitalism and any other system - it really doesn't matter what it is - it would be very hard to curb income inequality."
SRSDiscussion,2y4rns,piyochama,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"Not really since war and revolution was still the norm in Europe. The key reasons for the difference - as Piketty argues - are that growth made capital less attractive. Keep in mind much of the capital of the 19thC rentiers was held in ""do nothing"" investments, housing and government bonds rather than investments in entrepreneurial activities. In the New world anyone with access to land - which was cheap and plentiful putting aside for a moment how it was acquired and focussing on the economics - could labor for a good wage. The high growth rate pushed up inflation which started to eat away at the value of monetary capital and capital held as land, since the value of land was kept down by oversupply. Working - in all sorts of forms - became comparatively a much better earner.  Again, my analysis leans pretty heavily on Piketty and to a lesser extent Leigh, but really every contemporary analysis of inequality has to start with Capital in the 21st C. There are economic solutions to the problem of increasing inequality, particularly as regards rebalancing the capital/labour split of income. The question is getting up the political will."

""It's only in times of growth (and capital shocks like wars) that we see re-distribution of income share to labour. Low growth economies, especially low inflation, low growth economies, favour capital much more heavily. Slowing growth will hurt workers far more than it hurts rentiers.  Could that be more of a consequence and result of the financial system we're living in?  The fact that the compensation to labor hasn't been increasing means that with growth or not, the elite has been netting more and more of the fruits of the labor.  What I meant by the 1500% debt increase in US since 1970s, was to just shed some light on what's driving economies forward. While the GDP has been increasing steadily with productivity, the amount of debt has been increasing faster when compared to the GDP. After all, it's the loans that drive the GDP to growth in the first place.  I do believe we'd need a major rework on how loans are assigned, but that's far from an easy feat. Currently the scenario is completely the opposite. Central banks are doing everything in their power to make sure that the money flows to keep the GDP growth on positive. Then again, the central bank authorities aren't the ""ones to blame"". They're doing what they can to keep us from the economic collapse and mass insolvencies. If the loans were harder to raise in general, the interest rates would start rising and that's something they do not want.  For that very reason, I believe that the existing loans need to be written down. That's the only way to get the elite to be the ones that 'have to pay the price'. In Greece's scenario, they've already suggested writing 50% of the debts down. We'll see how that plays. Might be a start of new wave of actions.  I believe it would be a political suicide to drive an agenda to either way. If you start limiting how loans are granted, the existing capital would simply be invested in corporations/areas/countries where such limitations wouldn't exist. You'd essentially be the Dark Knight, who's right in the matter, but you would gain no support. Then again, if you start driving agendas to write down existing loans, the elite wouldn't be quite happy about that, considering their status and influence.  Greed is a constant.  I'm actually Finnish, living in Finland - so Clinton certainly won't get my vote. :)"

Regardless of the type of capitalist economics. Piketty showed that under welfare capitalism and gold-standard capitalism and modern finance capitalism and all kinds of capitalism, wealth concentrates. A good and succinct review of Piketty's book was the first link in my first reply to your post here. Here's the link to the review again.  When they say in a different post that ""even without capitalism"" it would be hard to reduce inequality--that is true, but it's oversimplifying things. It's a lot less hard in socialism. The socialist countries, at least as long as there were actually committed communists running them, had way lower wealth inequality than the capitalist countries."

One major point to make is that Piketty's analysis can't apply to these countries because there was no place to ""invest"" one's money, which was what led to wealth concentration in the countries he investigated, which were all capitalist."

Even when it's administered in a more formal setting, there are some criticisms of the Implicit Association Test. However, believe it or not, it's a pretty commonly used tool in some fields of academic research, and has been shown to usefully predict behavior in a diverse range of contexts. Cruise that Wikipedia page a little and you'll find lots of info about the test's pros and cons.  Even if your test results weren't valid, I'd encourage you to consider the fact that most white and Asian people's IAT results indicate a preference for whites, as do the results for around half of black people. It's hard, but we all need to recognize that, even as we actively work to remove our internal biases, we shouldn't be ashamed by them. They were installed by our culture, which habitually confers negative associations to black people. The Harvard site that provides one version of this test has provided a very informative FAQ with the knowledge that the results of these tests don't always make people feel great about themselves, and might need help processing.  Again, that's not to say your results were valid; if you found yourself using any kind of a conscious strategy to keep up the pace they likely aren't. Just food for thought.

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,MassiveEstrogenicPow,27,Wed Mar 4 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"So, two things:  1) Yeah, BDSM fetishes are pretty obviously caused by (unequal) power distribution in society and often by actual oppression. There are enough specific fetishes for specific unequal power distributions that I don't think it's possible or desirable to try to deny this relationship.  2) Why does that matter? Oppression causes fetishes, but it's certainly not the case that fetishes cause oppression, at least not universally. Just because it was caused by a bad thing doesn't mean it's bad."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,BlackHumor,22,Wed Mar 4 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"Not into the BDSM scene at all, but I was wondering if someone was going to mention this. I don't have a ton to say, but I wanted to hop in to agree with your comment here. It seems every time discussions like this come up, the focus is on the symptom, which in this case, is the racial/pedophilic/sexist undertones in the BDSM scene. The symptom is not the cause. The cause is the racist, youth obsessed, and sexist culture we live in. Changing the BDSM scene will do absolutely nothing to fix those problems, so I don't even see how discussions about consenting adults who partake in this in a careful, informed, and healthy way is even relevant to anything involving social justice, honestly.   I think it would be naive to say that the fantasies acted out in BDSM scenes aren't a reflection of our social environment, but I think it's even more naive to think that no one in the scene is aware of that or critical enough to understand where their desires come from and treat them with caution. From my very limited observations of the kink scene, it seems a lot of the people are at least somewhat aware of the social influences involved and are bigger proponents of explicit, active consent than most vanilla people walking around today. I'm sure many of them take their fantasies and desires with a grain of salt, understanding fully that they're influenced by the culture they live in."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,i_am_a_meatpopsicle,5,Wed Mar 4 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that plenty of people in the BDSM scene are aware of these things and are careful of consent and so forth, and I'm by no means going to condemn the entire community or just the concept of BDSM in general, but doesn't the process of reification apply here sometimes?  E. L. James may not be any kind of mainstream BDSM practitioner, and certainly seems to be rejected by most of the community, but doesn't the book she wrote still contribute to the normalization of abuse?  I don't think you can say that anything in our culture is purely a symptom of cultural problems and not also a cause on some level, in at least some cases."

James may not be any kind of mainstream BDSM practitioner, and certainly seems to be rejected by most of the community, but doesn't the book she wrote still contribute to the normalization of abuse?   Oh definitely, but you said it yourself, she's (as far as I know) not actually involved in the BDSM community. Fifty Shades is pretty much universally hated by people who are, so you can't really pin that back on BDSM as it's not even an accurate representation of the scene. In the same vein, Twilight (literally in the same vein, since 50 Shades was a fanfiction. I still can't get over that...Lol.) also normalized abuse, but that doesn't mean there's something wrong w/ straight boys and girls in high school having relationships. A work of fiction taking an event, relationship, community, etc. and using it in a harmful or problematic way doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not the real life equivalent in and of itself is harmful or bad.   I don't think you can say that anything in our culture is purely a symptom of cultural problems and not also a cause on some level, in at least some cases.   Yeah, I agree with you here, I just think it's important to pin the blame on the people who deserve it in these cases. If people interpret the BDSM scene incorrectly or use it to abuse or control people, then they obviously deserve scorn, but other people in the community who weren't involved in that do not. The thousands of people who participate in BDSM consensually and carefully on a daily basis didn't write Fifty Shades and they're not responsible for the actions of those who abuse others. I think someone else in here brought up a good point about separating interpersonal relationships between individuals and the community itself. It's really not the community's ""fault"" if someone does something reprehensible, as that goes against pretty much everything the community stands for.   It's also important to remember that all of the things OP brought up (racism, agism/pedophilia, sexism) occurs in non-BDSM relationships too, albeit in less obvious ways most of the time. No one is immune from being influenced by those things, even those of us who post here, as much as we like to think we are. I don't think it's fair to single out the BDSM community for falling prey to those same problematic behaviors just because the nature of their fetish causes them to be more open and obvious about it.  Sorry, this turned a bit rambly. Lol. I guess my point is that we could round up everyone in that community tomorrow and ship them off to the moon and it wouldn't make our culture any less sexist, racist, or any other X-ist. It's not that people shouldn't critique the scene, I just think it's unfair to act like they're any worse than the rest of us."

I think my main point (which is probably muddled by now due to the long text walls I've typed, the terrible weather outside, and this beer. Lol.), is just that BDSM doesn't cause abusers to become abusers. Anyone can be an abuser, including people into BDSM, and including people who abuse others in a BDSM setting. So yeah, I agree with you. I just think a lot of non-kinky people, especially those I encounter, think they're the same thing, which from my understanding from having a friend who is in the scene and from what I've encountered online is not fair or accurate to the legitimately kind and good people who participate."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,i_am_a_meatpopsicle,4,Thu Mar 5 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"In that case, we agree completely! BDSM is a way of doing sex/intimacy/sensual contact/sensual noncontact, and unfortunately for those of us who are not abusers, the stigma against BDSM and the perception that it is abusive inherently leads to a lot of silence among victims who don't wanna be blamed or pathologized for their interests. The stigmatized nature also means that abusers can push more boundaries, and abuse using kink as context or apologetics for their actions. Especially in kink communities, there's a problem with serial offenders who seek out people new to the scene who are overwhelmed, less able to recognize red flags, and less likely to hear the warnings within groups. My abuser and I weren't part of a community when it happened, but a lot of that unfortunately applied."

Just because some, or even the majority of people who are into BDSM don't promote abuse doesn't mean that there's no one out there who was inspired by (possibly incorrect interpretations of) BDSM doing harm.

Valid point. I guess my stance on this is, you can be a practitioner of BDSM and be an abuser, but being a practitioner of BDSM doesn't automatically make you one. I view them as different things. Manipulating your partner, ignoring their feelings, forcing them into submissions, etc. is abuse. You can hide it under the guise of BDSM, but it's not BDSM. BDSM requires consent. No consent, to me, means it can't be BDSM by default. There are assholes and abusers in the BDSM scene, but BDSM doesn't make them that way, so I'm not sure how it's relevant, aside from being something to watch for vigilantly as it's probably easier to hide it when you're engaging in that type of play.   I think we can still criticize the cultural tropes that inspired Twilight (which is more than just ""high school romance""), though, the same way we can criticize the cultural tropes that inspired 50SoG.

And it's all well and good to say that we shouldn't blame practitioners of BDSM for the problems that inspire it, but at the same time you can't just write the whole phenomenon off as ""this is only a symptom"".   I'm not sure I agree or understand. I'm not sure where X-ist fantasies OP is talking about would come from if they don't come from our social climate. Personally, I feel like if we lived in a utopia where no X-ist attitudes existed, BDSM would still exist, but a lot of the very specific, problematic fantasies the original post was talking about probably wouldn't. If age wasn't fetishized in our society, why would age-play exist? If atrocities like slavery had never occurred, where would racially charged slave fantasies come from? I absolutely think our history and culture influences how some of these desires manifest themselves.   The one major criticism I would have would be that there seem to be some BDSM folks who think that BDSM should be more normalized in culture the way that LGBT+ relationships should be normalized, and due to the aforementioned blatentness of BDSM relationships and the fact that most people who aren't involved in that community don't do that kind of careful consideration of consent and power dynamics, that would probably result in reification or normalization of bad dynamics.

While I don't agree that the BDSM scene is analogous to the LGBT+ community (and find it a bit offensive when people say it is, since I'm queer myself), I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to not be discriminated against based on what you do in your bedroom. I think it's pretty shitty to be fine with sexual fantasies and dynamics that we're used to but then tell the BDSM community they don't get that same consideration because people might not get it. I think we should be very careful with the way it's presented in order to circumvent those issues you bring up (50 Shades is a very good example of how NOT to do this. Lol.) but I don't think it's fair to expect a group of people who aren't directly hurting anyone to remain ""in the closet"" so to speak for fear of upsetting people or not being understood."

There are obviously people who aren't into BDSM who will whine in the same way if you criticize their favorite porn, but they generally don't try to claim that they're being misunderstood in the same way.   I'm not sure I agree or understand.[...]   I don't mean that it's not a symptom - just that it's not only a symptom.

While I don't agree that the BDSM scene is analogous to the LGBT+ community (and find it a bit offensive when people say it is, since I'm queer myself), I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to not be discriminated against based on what you do in your bedroom.   But does what anybody do in the bedroom actually become relevant outside of their bedrooms?  The reason that BDSM is not analogous to LGBT+ is that romantic and sexual orientation (and trans status) is relevant to people's public lives because it makes a difference in what kinds of relationships they have, who they marry, how they present, etc., but none of that actually says anything about what kinds of things they like to do behind closed doors.  People just don't generally have to talk about things like what their sexual fantasies are or what positions they enjoy to participate in normal social situations, so there's not a lot of opportunity for discrimination on those grounds.  I realize some people like to have ""24-hour"" BDSM relationships, but I kind of feel like they should realize that that's perhaps not suited to all social situations, just like randomly talking about your sex life is not suited to all social situations."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,SuitableDragonfly,3,Thu Mar 5 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"I guess my point is that a lot of times when you bring up the way trends in BDSM are related to problematic cultural attitudes, some people will get really defensive and say that you're shaming their lifestyle at that you're only doing it because you're not into BDSM yourself and don't understand, and I think that sort of thing is not helpful and just shuts down any discussion.    Truth! I agree entirely with this.   I don't think there's any part of culture that doesn't influence any other part in some way.   Yeah, I think that's a good point. Nothing exists in a vacuum, so it's pretty much impossible for a decently sized community not to have influences in some way or another.   I realize some people like to have ""24-hour"" BDSM relationships, but I kind of feel like they should realize that that's perhaps not suited to all social situations, just like randomly talking about your sex life is not suited to all social situations.   Yeah, I feel that way too, but I was more meaning as an online presence, such as in here, for example. I just don't think that BDSM people should feel that their consensual, private activities are inherently wrong or harmful just because it's not as mainstream as ""vanilla"" sex is. I know SRS also dissects more prevelant sexual norms, but I just feel that BDSM could also be included in those discussions rather than separated out and picked on, especially when the issues being discussed are things like rape, age fetishization, etc. as in the original post. Those are issues that occur in all sexual communities, so to bring it up in a BDSM-specific manner just comes off to me as acting like the BDSM community has more of a problem with those issues than the vanilla sex people, which I just don't think is true."

I'm not sure it's always a one way thing. Some people who are masochists or submissives have low self esteem. And I think we should be careful about the things we internalize and what we foster.  Fetishes, in some cases, seem like they can be a part of oppression. And could help reinforce problematic feelings and ideas. Racial fetishes, for one, is something that many people of colour find oppressive.  The symptom is not the cause. But maybe it could be a contributor."

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,PlushgunMusic,7,Thu Mar 5 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"As someone with experience in BDSM (and yes, I wrote a song about it) I will say that a lot of the concerns are not only misplaced, but also feed into the same misconceptions that make 50 Shades of Grey problematic, and also drives people into it that really shouldn't be. And yes...the difference does matter, exceptionally. In fact -- it was the obsessive nature with clear, obvious boundaries that attracted me and my partner at the time to it. Sex comes with a great deal of anxieties, and having a clear picture and an emergency break is liberating for both parties involved.  Let me break this down as succinctly  as I can:   First of all, as it should be obvious, Do Not Use BDSM Porn as an Example - much like everything else BDSM porn is very unrealistic, and not at all realistic. People into kink tend to talk extensively beforehand about their desires and expectations. This is a net positive, and should be  practiced fully. On a similar note: people into kink tend to know what they want, and speak up about it.  Sex, like dancing...excuse me if that sounds trite....does require some level of a power dynamic. That dynamic can be fluid, and can be a pendulum, but with any coordinated physical activity, this is generally how it works smoothest. Not all kink is the same -- and it shouldn't be treated as such.  Kink requires a great deal of trust, trust that cannot be established via a one-night stand. Most kinksters have a nonsexual meeting before initiating anything. Are we going to have the same judgmental attitude towards  people who really enjoy casual sex, where trust is a dice-roll? I think not.  This line of questioning often leads to a dangerous ""Sexual purity"" mindset. Please...are we really arguing for a right way to do it-- that has some awful bedfellows. Go on fetlife -- there are just as many femdoms by ratio as male doms. Dominance is surprisingly gender neutral.  Furthermore, penetration is a form of dominance for a lot of non-kinky people. I'd rather people be upfront about their desires than affected by years of sexual repression mixed with patriarchal standards. Kink is a direct challenge to this expectation. In that sense, kink is certainly on the right side.    Ultimately, the point I am trying to make, is that there are way more net-positives to letting those kinky people out in the open to talk about it without the judgmental glare of the christian right and the hand-wringing left. Does that mean that everyone in kink is an angel? By no means. It is plagued with the same kind of assholery as every group of people who gather together with something in common.   We can drown in academic theory and honestly unconvincing psychological studies against kink (much of which has come from a pretty sex-negative mindset of psychology-past -- in fact recent studies suggest otherwise,] but that is not where I hang my hat here) but just go and talk to kinky people and hear how they feel about it -- and you may get some surprising feedback.   Edit: ok a lot of kinky people have responded. I wrote this on the subway and posted when i got reception back"

And is much, much different from the extremes of domination and submission.   Pre-established d/s situations are incredibly mutual..decisively mutual. I think the mistake you are making here is assuming that the sub is powerless in their decisions -- in fact subs have all of the control pre-negotiation It is their boundaries that need to be expressed and understood, they are the ones who ultimately decide on moving forward. ""Good doms"" tend to be very empathic, and their job is mostly to take the sub on their ride. Its very much a performance, and a game.   but does someone really have to make a first move? I mean, people can kind of initiate, on each other, at the same time.   I am not saying it can't happen -- but it doesn't really happen as much as hollywood would like us to believe. And I don't mean to sound mean about this, but there is an element of naivety that can lead to some pretty bad expectations. Holding hands is one thing -- people don't often need to talk about it beforehand.   (actually...in my more developmental years I did ask that if it was ok. It wasn't exactly sexy.)   When it comes to sexy times, discussion beforehand is always good, but rarely practiced. People are often, consensually, doing a lot of stuff they aren't totally mutually enthralled with for their partner"
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,DonQuixoteReference,1 point,Thu Mar 5 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I agree that subs have a lot of decisions. Or at least a lot of subs like making decisions. And that a lot of mutuality happens in planning and discussing. Though I have heard there are many subs who like losing control of a situation, and not knowing what's going to happen.  Also, mutually agreeing on how to dominate and submit to each other in great detail. And spontaneously caressing and simultaneously initiating on each other at the same time, mutually, seems different.  It escapes me in what all ways mutual initiative and caressing, and planned domination and submission seem different. But they do, to me.  I also understand the appeal of spontaneous and mutual initiate and caressing. And how affection is expressed, that way, And what emotional needs it fills. I don't understand the appeal, as well, to simulate fake violence as a way of bonding. I mean, since I don't get it, and this isn't a sexuality I have, it's never occurred to me how consensually doing violent things to someone, or having violent things done to me, would be a fulfilling way to express love and affection and sensitivity, at least, not for me.  I guess I'm pretty vanilla, but I understand cuddling, caressing, and soft sex where both partners continuously hold and gently touch each other. That sounds like a very appealing, and sexual way of expressing love. But mentally, I associate violence with violence, not with mutual love, caring, and sensitivity. I associate violence, even mutual, consensual violence, with hostility and competition.   I wonder what has caused that different between myself, and others. And how one would come to associate violence, generally associated with power and hostility, things that generally aren't about love and appreciation, with love and appreciation. When I look at or think about violence, I just see violence.  When I think about expressing empathy and appreciation physically, my mind comes to things like hugging. Not beating someone or simulating torture.   but it doesn't really happen as much as hollywood would like us to believe.   Really, I feel like ""Hollywood"" or entertainment, doesn't lead us to believe this enough. It feels like too many things in Hollywood send too many images of romance and sexuality as ones of unequal power. It's completely normal and healthy to have equality of iniative in the bedroom.  But I do certainly agree that talking, and planning, is an important part of healthy and mutual sex. Whether it's BDSM, or vanilla."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,DonQuixoteReference,6,Thu Mar 5 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I respond to these in a weird order, I am a bit dyslexic   When I think about expressing empathy and appreciation physically, my mind comes to things like hugging. Not beating someone or simulating torture.   Most BDSM that people delve in is not nearly like this -- there are sadists, but most d/s play is mental. Is lightly spanking a consenting adult really torture? Because that is 70% of kink play. Its a game, and it is meant to be fun. But even sadism itself is only one part of the equation that requires masochists. Is it healthier for masochists to put their tenancies elsewhere?    Though I have heard there are many subs who like losing control of a situation, and not knowing what's going to happen.   This is why safe words exist, a safe word is the ""emergency break"" and if something goes from good to bad...it is used. There are some subs that don't use safe words, which I consider to be an abominable practice - I, nor many others Ds, would ever engage in anything with someone who does not use safe words because as a D the safe word helps me trust my partner as well.     I guess I'm pretty vanilla, but I understand cuddling, caressing, and soft sex where both partners continuously hold and gently touch each other. That sounds like a very appealing, and sexual way of expressing love. But mentally, I associate violence with violence, not with mutual love, caring, and sensitivity. I associate violence, even mutual, consensual violence, with hostility and competition.   Sometimes mutually delving into the darker parts of our brain can be very liberating, especially for those who are affected by expectations and repression. A good example is orgasm control -- this is the act of denying the sub an orgasm, no matter how much they ask for it, teasing, etc. Unfortunately, there are women who have problems orgasming because of the anti-sex, body-negativity they are expected to contour with. Oftentimes, taking orgasm/pressure to orgasm off the table by not even allowing it can show that it actually...works. Not to mention another positive -- BDSM is not penetration centric, penetration takes up a much smaller percentage of activities than it does for ""normal people"" which also yields some pretty good results.  Now to really get to the heart of this -- if you had a partner who you loved and trusted -- and they wanted you to push their boundaries just a little, you would deny them their interests and tell them its wrong? I don't see how that position is more empathic  Edit: for caution/clarity, when I say ""normal people"" in quotes, it is meant to be heterocentric, insofar as that is what society normalizes."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,DonQuixoteReference,0,Thu Mar 5 03:02:08 2015 UTC,"Is lightly spanking a consenting adult really torture?   No, it's not. I didn't mean to characterize BDSM as that. But there are BDSM fantasies that are about fetishizing the idea of torture.  And I guess a lot of it doesn't feel like a fun game to me. Since I'm vanilla, and I don't really quite get it.  And I don't want to tell sadists or masochists how to express their feelings. But I do wonder where they come from. Trying to imagine what it would be like to be a masochist gets me to thinking about things that many in BDSM would find offensive and very untrue.   Sometimes mutually delving into the darker parts of our brain can be very liberating   Does it? Not for me, certainly. I have a hard time imagining it. To me, it seems like dwelling on and feeding into something. That might be psychologically unwell in the long term. Like, in the instance of racist fantasies, possibly internalized racism.  I would think that mutual affirmation, rather than degradation, would be more emotionally fulfilling. And how is someone who is suffering from sexual repression, going to feel better by being denied an orgasm? Isn't that normalizing and teaching that their sexual repression is good, and deserved?  Why would you want to respond to feelings of psychological sexual repression, by repressing your own orgasms? That only seems like it would make things worse, psychologically.  If someone responds to anti-sex, body-negativity, by dwelling on and replicating that in the bedroom, aren't they feeding into and reinforcing those feelings?    if you had a partner who you loved and trusted -- and they wanted you to push their boundaries just a little, you would deny them their interests and tell them its wrong?   I wouldn't do something I'm sexually uncomfortable with. Just as I wouldn't expect them to do something they're not sexually comfortable with. It's okay for them to have their fantasies. But if I'm to be expected to express my sexuality with them in a way that's not my sexuality, and a way that I'm not comfortable with. Then that would be a dealbreaker.  I wouldn't tell them it's wrong. But I, just like others, have a right to my own sexual boundaries, and what I'm comfortable with.

I get that it's not what you are into it, but you are also taking a binary approach to something that is much more complicated. And I think you are getting into the weeds by actually trying to simplify it.   The human psyche...in more or less words...is weird. What excites us is not always from the pure at heart: are we not allowed to enjoy old movies? Video games? Violence in literature? We like scandal, whether or not it comes from the best place.

And how is someone who is suffering from sexual repression, going to feel better by being denied an orgasm? Isn't that normalizing and teaching that their sexual repression is good, and deserved?   Well....ask them. Again, the human psyche is weird. I am not talking about acute repression, by the way, I'm talking about the normalized repression that comes in the waning stages of American Puritanism. But no matter how much we want to prescribe a social context to human behavior, in the end sex is a far more psychological experience than it is political. In this case, for some people denial is another way of saying ""don't worry about it."" Again, to a lot of people, that is liberating. Not to all. Not to you. But to a lot.

Like feet, or watersports, or collecting underwear, or exhibitionism, or voyeurism, or anthropomorphic animal outfits, or -- yes this is a thing -- sneezing? Are those more suitable?    Most of them don't bother me at all! It's only the things that I see violence or aspects of maledom in society, the exploitation and degradation of women, and things like that, which leave me feeling uncomfortable.  Feet are just a body part, and there's nothing unhealthy about being attracted to feet. In fact, I think that more body parts one is attracted to, the better. I think that the human body is beautiful, and worth being appreciated.  Partialism seems a little bit limiting. But I don't think that attraction to the human body is a bad thing.  For watersports, urine, contrary to what many people believe, isn't exactly totally sterile. But it's still not something unhealthy. Or nasty, for everyone.  Collecting underwear is okay, as long as it's consensual. Underwear thievery, is not.  Non-consensual voyeurism is also very bad. But there's nothing wrong with watching other people have sex, with their permission.  The anthropometric or furry fetish I have mixed feelings about. For one, I think that the ridicule leveled as furries has always been cruel and bullying, and has made me uncomfortable. On the other hand, it can be worrying when people fetishize so many characteristics together of people who can't consent. Like animals or children. A lot of furry characters, or fursuits, or things like that, look an awful lot like animals. And animals can't consent. The same applies to things like the ""moe"" or ""loli"" or ""shota"" trends in anime and animated pornography.   I think it's better to be attracted to human-like, and adult like characteristics, if possible. But with many furries, or people with a furry fetish, I think it's more about exoticism and being attracted to things which seem different, and novelty seeking, than fetishizing the idea of not being able to consent. People in fursuits and consent. And most fictional anthropomorphic characters, are characterized more like humans than animals. And things like ageplay and lolicon and shotacon worry me. Because in all of these cases, much of the time, someone, while they're not sexualizing and fetishizing and actual child, they're still fetishizing the idea of a child, of someone who can't consent. And some furry pornography it very borderline bestiality, and a lot of the ""loli"" and ""shota"" type stuff is explicitedly about children, not 1,000 year old demon dragon-girls, or whatever excuse is used.  Still, the more human, and the more adult, the better. And I would rather people fetishize humans in fursuits, or ageplay, or be attracted to fictional characters where no one is hurt, or young looking adults, than actual animals or children.  The more it seems like someone is attracted to the idea of someone who can't consent, like an animal or a child, the more it worries me. I'm comfortable that most people who fetishize fursuits are more attracted to the animalistic aspects because of exoticism, than rape. Most people who look at My Little Pony porn, don't think that actual horses are very attractive.  And I don't see what's wrong with fetishizing sneezing. Though sneezing can be painful, and if that's what someone is fetishizing about sneezing, it would worry me, a little bit.  And I do agree that the human psyche is weird. And maybe I'm oversimplifying things, when trying to understand them. Though I don't think it's unexplainable. And while I think that most human beings are flawed. I mean, look at Reddit. Humanity is far from perfect. This ""pure at heart"" that you describe, sounds like something healthy and worth striving for. And not something problematic, like Victorian ideas of purity. And yes, I do think that we, as a society, fetishize and love violence and conflict and maschismo too much, and empathy and compassion and understanding, too little.  I don't believe in a moral panic about violent video games that some are promoting. But I feel that we revel power and dominance and violence too much. And softness and sensitivity, too little."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,TheSpaceWhale,15,Thu Mar 5 04:27:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, yes, active bdsm player here. You are kinda wrong about several aspects of bdsm. For example, ageplay usually doesn't involve sex in any way. In fact, I'd say somewhere around 80-90% of bdsm practices don't involve sex in any way. The reason they are so often linked is because  the trust necessary in a partner to perform dangerous acts in the safest way possible is usually the same trust that one has with one's sexual partners.   That said, I mean, I like being spanked, and I want the person who is spanking me to be someone I care about. I like blood, and I want the person who is (not going into specifics here) to be someone I care about. Several other acts, up to and including sex, have to involve people I trust and care about.   Are these things sometimes problematic? Oh yeah. But if it gets me off and gets my partner(s) off, we're gonna do it. We will have strict negotiations and boundaries defined before we do, and we will talk about it afterwards, but it's gonna happen.   See, the public view on bdsm is very, well, wrong. It's the queerest, most radical, sexually affirming scene there ever was, and the people involved have their lives enriched by it. If it were just sex, I mean, sex is boring. Anyone can have sex. Scare me a little, why not.   (this stream of consciousness probably doesn't add to the conversation, but I wanted to say it anyway :P)   edit:   provide perspective from an actual bdsm practioner  get told I'm wrong by people who don't practice bdsm  SRSDiscussion  deaddove.jpg"

Even the pain stuff, it can feel enjoyable in weird ways, because, well, endorphins are an awesome thing."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,voiceinthedesert,2,Thu Mar 5 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"BDSM relationships are just relationships. Vanilla people kiss during sex, but that doesn't mean all kisses are sexual or about sex. Reducing people's kink to ""all about sex"" is just as insulting as implying that all affection in normative relationships are just about sex."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,voiceinthedesert,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:12:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. I guess as far as I understood, BDSM was sexual.  If BDSM in relationships isn't always sexual... what is it? Honestly, I think it's health for there to be an equal power dynamic in relationships."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,osmanthusoolong,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"I agree--foundational power dynamics should be as equals. Consent is only possible when two people are treating eachother fundamentally as equals, and working to counteract any unequal real power that exists.  BDSM is just a relationship with different roles, actions of affection, and/or kinds of sex. If bondage, power exchange, enjoyment of giving or receiving pain, are elements of a mutually preferred relationship, those elements make it BDSM (as well as other kinky stuff). It could be about sex, or affection, or roles."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,osmanthusoolong,-2,Mon Mar 9 07:14:05 2015 UTC,"DQR is being absolutely ridiculous. Cock-shaped pacifiers and begging Daddy for sex after a good spanking are totally not about sex. Neither is fisting, orgasm denial or rape fantasies. Obviously.   And catharsis is actually not a thing, because emotions and pleasure don't work that way."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,PowerOfTheMind,6,Thu Mar 5 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"These things only don't involve sex if you define sex as stimulating of genitals, they are sexual, and eliding that is really kinda dishonest. And age play is about sexualizing kids, or at the very least, the trappings and social constructions of childhood in order to sexually play with the power differentials involved in adult/child relationships.   Individual consent is a vital and important thing, but there is no reason whatsoever why it would be useful or healthy to refuse to think about the things that give you pantsfeelings! ""It turns me on so it must be good"" is kind of terrifying if you think about it for like, a second!  .See, the public view on bdsm is very, well, wrong. It's the queerest, most radical, sexually affirming scene there ever was, and the people involved have their lives enriched by it. If it were just sex, I mean, sex is boring. Anyone can have sex. Scare me a little, why not.<  I'm cringing so, so hard at this. You can't fuck your way to freedom, and spankings won't end oppression. The fact that most kink scenes are M/f really really disproves your claims that it's such a queer scene. (Or inherently queer! Hypersexualizing queerness is super homophobic!) Nor is BDSM sex inherently more interesting than non-BDSM sex. It's just more interesting to you personally.   Lastly: Kink isn't actually always good for the people in it. (Though that assessment is something the person in question should make themself, diagnosing others' mental health when you are not their doctor is shitty.) I used to be a switch, and submission was for me really a manifestation of my own self-loathing. It was actualfax bad for me. I also had an abuser who used kink stuff as a tool and cover for abuse. It was not a good thing for them in so far as it was something they used to actually harm people.   You really really didn't add to the conversation."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,osmanthusoolong,3,Thu Mar 5 00:43:14 2015 UTC,"Kink scenes do vary, but all the ones I've been in are much ""queerer"" spaces with greater gender, sexual, and relationship diversity than I see in the rest of the world. Yes most people into BDSM are hetero but most people are hetero. Proportionally I see more queer folks in the BDSM scene.  I'm pretty sorry for what happened to you; my partner is an abuse survivor. And I agree 100% that abuse is a problem in the BDSM community (as well as the general public) and we should call out abusers like a hawk. But my partner was abused by someone who was vanilla. Abuse isn't BDSM like rape isn't sex; you can abuse someone with or without BDSM. We should however be extra vigilant for it in BDSM because of the heightened potential for abuse."

Thank you, I'm nine years away from what happened, and in a much better place all around. I still think kink is really good for me, though a lot has changed with regards to what I am into (top now, no longer a switch because bottoming stuff isn't scary in the fun way anymore), and I think it can be really good and healthy and freeing for a lot of people.   You're also super right that abuse and BDSM aren't synonymous, but it can be a really useful tool and cover for abuse, so we do have to be extra vigilant, which was what I was trying to get at."

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,SevenLight,5,Thu Mar 5 01:03:28 2015 UTC,It is sexual. Pretending it's not is gross and ridiculous.  You're the one talking about how free and radical the kink scene is.

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,osmanthusoolong,4,Thu Mar 5 04:43:15 2015 UTC,"/u/osmanthusoolong is being a little rough around the edges, but the claim that age play isn't sexual because it doesn't involve sex sounds pretty absurd to anyone who doesn't have a definition of sex that strictly involves genitals touching.   Also, I have to agree, the claim that BDSM is inherent queer or radical should be taken with a healthy degree of skepticism. Sex-positivity might be a hallmark of some queer activism, but a tooon of kink is very M-F centered and most queers I know who engage in non-normative sexual practices wouldn't consider themselves part of a ""kink"" community; they'd consider themselves part of a queer community that also includes people who are ace or vanilla or not sexual active at the moment.   Queer is an identity that transcends how you like to fuck, and I think that a lot of queer people, myself included, are slightly skeptical of people who make how they like to fuck the bedrock of their ""community"" or identity. That's not to say that there aren't queers who are into BDSM, but the fact that some straight BDSM practitioners want to have their kink validated as a legitimate ""oppressed"" identity is a little gross."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,JustAnotherQueer,7,Thu Mar 5 20:21:04 2015 UTC,I'm not taking any stance on sort of classification of BDSM one way or the other here. I just take issue with osmanthusoolong's dismissal of DQR's personal experience and opinion on a very subjective topic and find it more than a bit hypocritical.
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,PiscineCyclist,3,Thu Mar 5 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"I guess I just view it more as a semantic argument than an expression of personal opinion. Like, anything can be sexual/non-sexual depending on how we define it, and maybe I'm just a secret Freudian to view most relationships as being intrinsically sexual, but it also seems as if /u/DonQuixoteReference is operating under a very strict definition of what counts as sexual.   There is definitely value in understanding how subjective experiences manifest themselves--and that those experiences should not be used to exclude other experiences--but it seems that things like what constitutes sexual interaction are precisely what critical attitudes towards sex should examine--i.e. we can respect subjective experience while still trying to orient that experience in a theoretical framework. That's not to say that viewing latent sexuality in age play is intrinsically the right way to look at it, but there are definitely political and theoretical consequences to how we look at things like age play."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,YourWaterloo,5,Thu Mar 5 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"Their experience is not irrelevant, but their refusal to acknowledge anything outside their own ass is not exactly adding to a conversation.

Which is either ridiculously naive or deliberately obtuse."

I believe it's possible to truly love a practice and also to think critically about it and about the people who also engage in it, and I think it's extra important to think carefully about things that are that intimate and so based in things that do relate to trauma and oppression."

Bearing in mind that I am very, very kinky, as in it's basically my entire sexuality. But that blanket praise for a community fraught with problems? That's doing the opposite of helping. Like, I've met some lovely kinksters. But at the same time, the worst, most abusive, creepy people I have ever met, I met through kink (they were male doms, for the most part). Also, like you've said, most kink stuff is M/f, and does nothing except add on to the age-old gender role shit we've been wallowing in for centuries.  There are lots of healthy, lovely people that are into kink, and there are healthy ways to practice kink. There's also a truckload of problems.

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,osmanthusoolong,6,Thu Mar 5 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"The ""queerest, most radical ..."" quote raised my eyebrow a little too, but I wonder how much that's very local-community specific? Like, the kink community I've interacted with has been significantly more queer, somewhat more politically radical, and rather more friendly than other social groups I've encountered in my city, but I know that's both not true between different groups of kinksters and from city to city, so I'd never make that kind of blanket statement. It's just interesting to see how different groups of people with very specific set of similar interests create such different norms from place to place."

Like, it's good not to hate yourself for your sexual feelings, but there's a middle ground between not hating yourself and being 100% uncritical /supportive of everything.   I don't understand how people can fully understand the concept of, e.g., enjoying problematic media but can't get behind the idea of enjoying problematic sex. Like, the fact that Game of Thrones has some bad depictions of women doesn't mean that it should be cast into the lake of fire, just like enjoying D/s doesn't automatically mean that you're some kind of moral pervert."

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,PlushgunMusic,15,Thu Mar 5 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"let's start by admitting that we cannot analyze sex in western/us society without thinking about patriarchy and misogyny. it defines the basis for all of our thoughts on sexual matters, from basic orientation to individual preferences. there's also nothing wrong with carefully analyzing the how our actions (including sexual ones, including those of oppressed groups (which I'm not convinced kinky people alone are)) reflect or reinforce prevailing societal norms. societal norms which are often oppressive.  and since it has been a while since i've posted regularly here, for context i'm a trans lesbian who participates in kinky-type sexy times.   And as it so happens, the vast majority of pornography is maledom of some kind. Even the pornography that is considered vanilla.   our entire society is maledom, and women are expected to get off to it. or at least to put up with it. which is not to say it's ok, or to give it a pass. you just cannot make this criticism about kink in isolation, which is probably one of the reasons that your thoughts here feel unbalanced to you.  kink is a reflection a lot of large scale societal ills. rape play, age play, race play, sadism, and humiliation all get their erotic charge from larger, intensely destructive societal forces. sometimes, these reflections can be distorted or even flipped, for example femdom, but that doesn't fundamentally alter the destructive nature of the societal forces at work or automatically provide any sort of defense of the practices.  i think there needs to be a lot more discussion about how these kinks come into wide-spread existence. and it is grossly improper to suggest it is used to heal from past traumas in the nearly complete absence of any significant level of community discourse around that. in the presence of such trauma, kink is at best a coping mechanism, and at worst it reinforces pain and trauma by associating it with sexual pleasure. this is powerful, primal stuff pulling at some of the strongest reinforcement mechanisms in us. it deserves to have powerful, thoughtful discussions about it."

Though that leaves a gulf between me, and those who feel this is incredibly wrong, offensive, and presumptuous.   It's true that, with BDSM, that maybe I just don't get it. As many people would say. But what you are saying here, is indeed what feels true, to me. And I'm very much in agreement with everything you've said.

The problem is that we are talking about consenting adult partners who are presumably not preying on children. To say that this hurts the innocent requires a level of mysticism that I'm not comfortable with. Sex negativity sounds too much like ""You can't have sex in an unusual way, because that hurts my feels"". This is a morally bankrupt stance, and must not be tolerated by honest social activists.   As with any political issue, make sure that your pride is not getting in the way of rationality. Everybody wants to boast to their friends about how they're keeping the children safe. Not many people actually do damn thing for the children."

The thing is, when I read this, it gives off the feeling of ""this is bad because it's born out of those problematic power dynamics in society"". If something is born from those...isn't it bad? Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and whole list of ills are also formed from power dynamics in society, and we definitely want to stamp those out completely.   I have a bunch of fucked-up fetishes but I've never harmed anyone and I don't let them influence my opinions on other people. It feels like some people here want to punish me because some other people can't take the time to look critically at what they get off to. And being told ""your fetishes are contributing negatively to society and born from society's fucked-up state right now"" is really demoralizing. I can't control what I get off to.

Like it might be a problem on a societal level (also maybe not), but regardless an unwillingness to explore it out of a fear that it could be bad seems like the wrong way to go about it.  Like, for example, I think the fact that more women trend towards ""caretaker"" type positions in society is absolutely born out of gender roles in our society. But if I meet a woman in nursing school I don't think that's a bad thing, I think it's great because nursing is a really important field. But on a societal level I think it's worth talking about why more women want to be nurses than men.  I get that it's easy to feel judged, but what I'm suggesting really doesn't come from a place of judgment, but rather the fact that I think it's better to talk about and understand everything."

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,PoopyParade,10,Sun Mar 15 00:25:38 2015 UTC,"Really? Personally, it seems like there a lot of link between the public sphere and private sphere. If not internalized gender roles and messages and things like that, where would these sexual messages come from? Do you think they're like sexual orientation, and people are ""born that way""?  I don't think that people who do ageplay things or have fantasies, are actually going to rape or want to rape children or adults. But that the idea that, on some level, the idea of raping is sexy and appealing to people, is a little bit worrying.  Aside from fetishizing about raping children and adults being common enough fetishes in BDSM. There are also racial and other facets to them. BDSM fantasies often contain racial slurs and racist scenarios. Most of these racist fantasies reflect ideas that are cultural and didn't come from a vacuum.   Do you not think that, at least in some circumstances, some fantasies, like rape pornography, lolicon and shotacon, ageplay, and sadistic rape fantasies between partners. Could help normalize and foster unhealthy mindsets? I don't believe that everyone who has a kink is an awful person who will hurt people. Or that it should be illegal. But it's worrying to me that the idea of rape and racism and exploitation and inequality, are such common fantasies.  There's also racial fetishes or preferences in dating. Not just in the bedroom, but for dating partners. Asian fetishism is something that many Asian Americans consider a serious issue of Asian oppression. As do many people of colour. I am pretty sure that racism and racial stereotypes play a part in racial fetishes in the bedroom and dating. And the racial ideas that people internalize. It doesn't feel disconnected from the larger society, to me, at all.  If not influenced by larger cultural ideas, where would fetishes and feelings like these come from?"
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,osmanthusoolong,11,Wed Mar 4 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"help normalize and foster unhealthy mindsets   This is a very reasonable reaction. However, there is no concrete evidence for this link, and I don't think there will ever be an answer.

Also, kindly lose the True Kinster nonsense. Bad tops are still tops, and they are our problem.  Or, to situate it within the greater sexual community: why the hell do you think so much porn designed to appeal to men involves coercion or nonconsent? Why is rape so fucking sexy to people who have fantasies about doing the raping?"
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,justajust,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"You have a good point re: the True Kinkster tone I may have been taking as perhaps a defensive position. I should say ""most kinksters"" and I absolutely agree that bad tops most certainly exist. I also think that, like any particular scene, bad apples can be attracted by the very nature of it, and for D/s the nature is sex -- and you can get some very bad apples. For this reason, consent rules were put in place.   Though, to briefly argue the service top thing...its really just a dynamic, like ""bratty"" that reconfigures the power dynamic. I am not referring to service tops as being the ""best"" kind; even in very strictly defined power dynamics the sub holds the negotiation. I think it is bad precedent to expect otherwise. Similarly, I am equally bothered by the idea of going sans-safeword -- which is another bad apple groupthink reality that the community has to deal with.   as for this:   why the hell do you think so much porn designed to appeal to men involves coercion or nonconsent? Why is rape so fucking sexy to people who have fantasies about doing the raping?   Studies show that most porn is consumed by those in the bible belt, where open kink communities are very limited. This not by any means a causal implication, but it does paint an interesting picture insofar as who is consuming this stuff and why. I am not disagreeing with you: there is certainly a power element at play, which I think is the main factor. Power defines significance -- power defies mortality. Sex and death. This thought process leads to rape culture, the same way it leads to power dynamic fantasies, but their umbrella cause does not mean they are the same species."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,osmanthusoolong,1 point,Sat Mar 7 07:28:45 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that the defensiveness of the kink comunity has led to serious problems within it. I mean, there's what I posted elsewhere (upthread? downthread?) about the higher rates of consent violations within the community, there's a huge tendency among kinksters to feel like the performed new rules regarding consent and BDSM are stronger or a magic barrier to abuse. (And I say this because, uh, I used to believe it?) If I subbed ever again, I wouldn't use a specific safeword, in that ""No"" and ""stop that right the fuck now"" would be mine. But I do totally agree with you that the dynamic of consent play sans safeword is really really not a great idea.   While most porn (I thought the studies simply showed that it was the majority of certain kinds of porn, I may be misremembering) may be consumed in the bible belt, it's still also universal everywhere else. And rape culture still totally is a thing among kinksters. I mean, we're great, but we're not that superpowered as to no longer be affected by society at all. I think the thing that's getting to be about the kinky people who fantasize about perpetrating rape is that I think it does absolutely come from the same place as vanilla people who do the same. I think it's dangerous and disingenuous to separate BDSM from other kinds of sex in terms of thinking critically."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,MySilverWhining,4,Sat Mar 7 19:03:33 2015 UTC,"I'm way late to this party, but I'll chime in:   Where does one draw the line between respecting other people's sexuality, that they express consensually or in fantasy fiction where no one is hurt. And not kink shaming or shaming someone for their sexual feelings, and being able to be critical of the culture of sexuality, much like feminist criticisms of movies, video games, and other entertainment.   I don't see why we should be able to be critical of something that doesn't affect anyone besides the consenting adults engaging in that action. What people do between themselves, when either party can stop and leave at any time, is entirely up to them. I don't think I, or anyone else, has a right to morally judge it.   And I can't imagine what healthy place fantasizing about raping children comes from.   Shit's weird to me too, but my stance is the same as I stated above: consenting adults can do whatever they want.   Even if practiced consensually, where would a fantasy like that come from?   No idea   Like, why not fantasize about your partner as being the consenting adult, that they are?   Not trying to be rude here, but this sounds a lot like ""why can't they enjoy sex/relationships the way I enjoy it?"" The answer is that they just don't and that's fine.   And I've also heard that, withing the BDSM community, maledom and femsub are normalized. And femdom and malesub are shamed. And are less common.   I have no experience or statistics with this, but it seems pretty unfair to put it in your argument without any supporting evidence.    I think consenting adults can do whatever they want. I'm not gonna understand a lot of it, but I don't understand feet fetishes either or water sports and all that jazz. As long as both parties are consenting and able to end it at any point, I don't see how we can possibly call it ""wrong."" I'm sure some of it is born of sketchy motivations, but some people just get off on doing shit that's taboo. Maybe it's sometimes a poor reaction to something else. Regardless of how people arrive at the decision to participate though, they are making that choice. To me, you rob them of their agency by telling them that they shouldn't.   Sure, bad things happen in BDSM relationships, but they do in every other kind of relationship as well. To pick up on something someone else said in the thread, no one picks on heterosexual relationships just because Twilight is an example of a bad/abusive one. We say that the abuse is wrong. In BDSM, it should be the same.   As a final note, I don't quite understand why it is that we, as a society, are so intent on finding out exactly why someone wants to do something sexually and making sure it's OK when we give them free reign to make poor choices for themselves in literally every other arena of their lives. Smoke cigarettes to deal with stress? Fine, your choice. Engage in dangerous hobbies/sports? Sure, it's up to you. Do weird shit, while naked? Wait a second, why exactly are you doing that?  I don't mean to be antagonistic and I hope you don't read this in that way. I've been reading a lot of questioning about if BDSM is ""OK"" lately. Those conducting these discussions are otherwise very progressive sources and I'm just baffled why we think it's OK to question people's right to choose what they do with their body in this instance just because it makes us uncomfortable."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,MemeticParadigm,2,Thu Mar 5 04:37:15 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be rude here, but this sounds a lot like ""why can't they enjoy sex/relationships the way I enjoy it?""   Why it's true that it's harder to relate to sexual feelings you don't have. I understand that many are sexually attracted to, many things that I'm not. And that's okay.  What's worrisome about this. Is concern for children, as many people in this world are sexualizing children, or the idea of children.  I don't have any problem with ""weird"" sexual feelings. And I don't think that being ""normal"" is important. But when someone sexualizes children, or even the idea of children, it sends up red flags.  And while I think that freedom is great, and I care about individual freedom. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be worried about people, I don't think. If you have concern and caring for someone, you're going to care and be bothered by someone hurting themselves, even if it's their own choice. Not wanting someone to hurt themselves, doesn't mean you don't respect their individuality. If someone wanted to become a professional boxer, family and friends would have a right to be concerned."

What difference would it make if sexual preference was formed by genes, infancy, some childhood sexual awakening or life experience?  People like what they like, and probably didn't choose to.

SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,Axelior,7,Thu Mar 5 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"I think that kink-critical commentary that comes from actually kinky people shoul be given priority and weight over that coming from people who have zero experience with it. And kink-critical people who are themselves kinky do exist (like me). I identify as sex-neutral, I have massive issues with sex positivity as a whole, I think kink needs critical examination because 1. it's a thing humans do and we can think about every other thing we do and 2. it's a thing that generally does hinge on a lot of heavy social things.   What you've heard about the gender disaparities and acceptable sexual imagery within kink communities is pretty true, unfortunately. And I do think a lot of the BDSM roles that people gravitate towards, like again, everything we do aside from breathing, is heavily influenced by cultural ideas. And I think that really merits examination! It's realy misogynist as hell that penetration is automatically considered degrading to the point that it's seen as a default part of femdom. (Same with any feminization as punishment, TBH. I'm actually pretty okay shaming that kink. As I am with the frequently unexamined racism in the kink community.)   That said, a lot of kink-critical stuff that is given the most weight is by people who are generally not themselves kinky, and are going on hearsay. Which... no? And a lot of it does tend toward claims that all  BDSM is abuse, which is absolutely horrendous when it comes to people who do kink and are survivors, or who have been abused in kink settings when it comes to negating their own lived experience and their abuses. It also tends to have some nasty victim-blaming where OF COURSE you're going to be raped/abused, what did you expect? Now we'll accept you, but only if you're willing to tell us about your abuses in detail so we can use you as a cautionary example.   I don't believe kink is an orientation, and claiming it is is homophobic as hell, when you're reducing queer people to sex acts.   Age play makes me really uncomfortable too.   So, uh, I'm a sex-neutral kink critical kinky person, ama?"
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,MemeticParadigm,6,Wed Mar 4 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same way.  People should be critical about the thoughts and fantasies they indulge.  BDSM is a difficult subject because like so many other things to do with sex, the same physical act can be good or bad depending on the context.  To make this point I'll paint two simple pictures, caricatures, one good and one bad.  Picture #1:  A person has a high-power, high-stress job and constantly has people looking to them for decisions and guidance.  They don't have anyone they can turn to, so the buck stops with them, and they never get to relax.  Then at the end of the day sometimes they like to be the submissive for a caring dom so they can give up control and have the experience of being helpless, passive, and cared for.  This helps balance out their otherwise unbalanced and unhealthy emotional life.  Picture #2:  A person lacks confidence and is not accustomed to making decisions about their own life.  They find themselves on their own and quickly fall into a relationship with a partner who dominates and controls them.  They don't enjoy being bullied, but leaving and being on their own again seems even more terrifying.  Their partner, though an experienced manipulator, is insecure and never satisfied with the level of dominance and constantly seeks ways to expand and reinforce their control.  This includes bedroom activity, so the sex starts to become rough and humiliating.  The person consents and even finds a measure of reassurance in the idea that their obedience ensures their partner's love and loyalty.  Their partner moves on to ever more extreme humiliations including bondage and pain.  The BDSM in the bedroom is used to establish and reinforce patterns of unconditional compliance that their partner depends on to control them in the rest of their lives.  These two extremes are stereotypes that are often used to respectively promote and attack BDSM.  In my opinion they are both realistic scenarios that probably play out every day in real people's lives.  There is no single answer to whether or not it is healthy for you to tie up your partner and whip them, or to be tied up and whipped by your partner.  Every person has to examine their own feelings, their motivations, and what impact it has on their life and their relationships.  It's a basic part of human nature that sometimes it can be extremely gratifying to indulge our weaknesses, and it can be extremely unpleasant to grow.  This complicates any initial reaction (pro or con) we have to BDSM.  We don't have conversations about that, though, because they tend to degrade into political hack argumentation.  ""Yes, BUT sometimes it's good""  ""Yes, BUT sometimes it's bad""  ""It's abominable that you would cast such aspersions on something that in SOME CASES is clearly positive""  ""I think you're ignoring the fact that for SOME PEOPLE it's bad""  ""Only because you're ignoring the fact that for some people it's really good""  This kind of argumentation comes naturally to big picture people who feel strongly about an issue, because they think in broad strokes and like to keep their eyes on the prize.  Progress has a direction, etc.  Getting bogged down in subtleties is a ruse, a rhetorical trick to distract from the overriding priority of ""more acceptance of BDSM"" or ""less acceptance of BDSM.""  Probably some people reading this already feel their determination rising not to get waylayed into the kind of detailed and nuanced discussion OP is calling for.  However, I think it's to everyone's benefit if we start to meet in the middle ground and talk about factors that would make BDSM healthy or unhealthy, how to identify healthy and unhealthy aspects of BDSM experiences, and so on, without falling into broad-brush arguments over what characterization of BDSM is more likely, more generally true, more representative of real BDSM relationships, etc."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,noonleyline,12,Wed Mar 4 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"My critique of picture 2 as an attack on BDSM is that the actual BDSM part is only unhealthy because it's the expression of a dynamic that's unhealthy to start with, whether or not BDSM is in the picture.  This, in fact, is my problem with most criticisms of BDSM - they focus on an expression of BDSM that is harmful or problematic within a relationship that is already harmful or problematic. It becomes a bit like any instance wherein people are criticizing a tool because some subset of the population has a penchant for using that tool destructively - the tool isn't the problem, the underlying motivations that would exist with or without the tool are the problem."

Why would I raise an objection to a positive example? I see nothing to object to? What sort of mentality do you have that suggests an objection to one side of an argument is somehow less valid if I don't also make some token objection in the opposite direction?  Furthermore, I don't agree that it ""can be positive or negative depending on yadda yadda,"" what I said is that it's a reflection of the interpersonal relationship in which it is expressed. What that means is that the discussion of whether or not it is problematic is simply the discussion of whether or not each interpersonal relationship in which it is expressed is problematic - which is a discussion about individual relationships, not about BDSM so, to my view, there is no discussion to be had about when or where BDSM in particular is problematic, in a way that is meaningfully different from the discussion of interpersonal relationships in general.   Fighting battles over whether to portray BDSM in a positive or negative light is a waste of time that could be better spent discussing the contextual factors that determine whether BDSM is positive or destructive.

It's good for people to have kind and empathetic fantasies. I don't think that people who have cruel thoughts will all act upon them. But having kind-hearted thoughts and fantasies is a good thing. To think well of others and want well of others, and fantasize well of others.  I'm worried about what people's fantasies and how they express them might normalize. Whether it's in porn, or video games, or movies, or comic books, or music. People draw comics of women and children being raped as a kink, do you think that's healthy, and reflects healthy feelings and desires?   I think the amount of rape or BDSM like rape would increase if BDSM actually became prohibited.   Why?  Surely, the best way to stand against and be against rape, isn't things like this. For people to express rape only in fantasy instead of reality. Of course, it just being in fantasy, no one is hurt. But why would someone fantasize about something like that, and it come from a healthy, loving place? It seems like wishing ill upon others, on some level. Even if one isn't doing ill upon others."
SRSDiscussion,2xx7wx,MemeticParadigm,2,Mon Mar 23 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"So my experience is that the ideas underlying BDSM are really awesome about consent and egalitarian and great. The reality is that there's a lot of douchebags who come into it without those ideas, and unless they cross really flagrant lines, calling them out is seen as ""stirring up drama"". In addition, there's a distinct tendency for maledom to be a lot more common in het relationships than femdom, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable confronting that from the position of a dude who bats sub.  Ultimately, the kink scene has better sexual politics than larger society, but it's not the perfect utopia it looks like if you just read kink theory."

And I can't imagine what healthy place fantasizing about raping children comes from.   Would you prefer that they were raping actual children?  Okay to move on: I have an age-play fetish. I know others online who are into it. And I can guarantee you that none of us actually want to fuck kids. The attraction of age-play isn't really about screwing kids, it's about the fact that a legal adult is taking on a youthful appearance and mannerisms. We do not use age-play as a ""substitute"" for screwing children. We find such sexual abuse to be abhorrent.  I have always held the belief that fantasy is fine so long as it does not bleed into one's real-life actions. I just don't like the idea of shaming someone for mere thoughts. Judge me all you want, but I've never screwed a kid, I've never wanted to screw a kid, and I don't want to collect images of kids being screwed because that's disgusting and nasty as hell."
SRSDiscussion,2xv2sb,Vault91,29,Wed Mar 4 02:38:59 2015 UTC,"It's not just about the ""sexiness"" of female characters, it's that female characters many times exist ONLY as sexy props. Male action heroes are usually sexualized too, but they are also usually the ""badass main character"" who saves the entire world almost entirely by himself. And there are many male actors who are successful without neccesarily being sexy.  Female characters (especially in things like action movies, video games, etc) are virtually always overly sexualized. But the real problem is that they are almost never main characters, and are usually poorly written when they are. Instead they get dressed up in ridiculous / impractical costumes, have little to zero actual effect on the plot (except for when they make some kind of error because they're not a tough, disciplined man-soldier like the main character), and more often than not is ""awarded"" to a male character after he saves the world. Male villians want world domination, female villians want vengeance.  So sexualizing men does happen, but they're usually still people. Women get sexualized but also don't get the benefit of being whole characters. Objectification of women is much much more pervasive and much more toxic in society than objectification of men. (The awful flip side of that of course is this: because people don't see men as facing as toxic shit in society as women it can sometimes be difficult for men to get the support they need.

Social constructs are but an idea that would not exist if not respected by society's inhabitants.    An interesting idea (and one I agree with) It doesn't invalidate anything that I've said, but it has merit on itself. Let's see:   The reason I say we're barely more than animals is because we can't always ""win"" over the strongest of instincts. From what my research has told me, the male's desire to procreate is one of his strongest instincts. This causes sex to cross his mind more times in a minute than any woman would ever be able to fully grasp on an applied-knowledge level. Which is also why trying to reverse those inherent instincts is nothing short of emasculation.    I think that the fact that we can win at all is what makes us different form animals (well that and ton of other stuff: we can imagine things that don't exist, we can figure out hypotheticals, we can think and worry about the future in an intellectual level, etc) I also think that with proper effort, we could control ourselves fully. But is just a theory.   Even if we could, it could have a ton of bad consequences, like the one you mentioned at the end.    Also, down-voting salient, tried and true facts because it somehow invalidates a community's agenda is oppressive and overall counterproductive to finding truth.

SRSDiscussion,2xv2sb,tibby_throwaway,7,Mon Mar 9 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"Something I'm not seeing a lot of in this thread, but I think deserves to be mentioned, is that we can't just examine objectification across gender lines as though it's a purely abstract notion on those terms alone. We have to examine things through an intersectional lens, and even without being an expert on the issue, that lens immediately lends me at least one example of how women can harmfully objectify men- the stereotypical privileged straight white woman who objectifies black men.   There's plenty of racist, privileged white women out there who pursue black men because they have racist preconceptions of black men as being dangerous, athletic, passionate, criminal, or any number of other things, not to mention the long-standing stereotype about black men being well-endowed, and the potential thrill of breaking social taboos. The notion of a white woman being uniformly attracted to black men because they represent something dangerous, controversial, or whatever else is definitely a form of objectification. A woman who does this is reducing the man to being an abstract symbol of his own race. Stereotypes of gender performance and stereotypes of race can play off of each other, cancel each other out, or multiply each other- as it stands, we live in a society that largely stereotypes black men as having traits that are also stereotyped as being masculine, and as such, in the process of turning the individual black man into a symbol of his race, the woman in this situation is also turning him into a symbol of gender. I think it's at least similar, perhaps comparable, to the notion of some white men being predominantly attracted to Asian women.   Of course, this objectification isn't necessarily a one way street. A black man in this situation can simultaneously be objectifying the white woman who is objectifying him. But that's not necessarily part of this conversation, interesting though it may be.   There's something to be said about straight women objectifying gay men, and I've heard stories from friends of cis-lesbians objectifying transmen as well.   My point is that we should look at this beyond a strict ""STRAIGHT CIS MEN VS. STRAIGHT CIS WOMEN IN THE ABSTRACT, NO OTHER FACTORS"" way.  All of THAT said, in the instances that you're talking about, looking at whether or not there's an objectifying female gaze in relationship with fictional male characters or something... It probably can happen in an abstract sense, but I would argue that the majority of media is ultimately made with the cis-straight-male audience in mind and the way that men are depicted in this media is aimed at fulfilling cis-straight-male power fantasies, rather than the desires of straight female or gay male audiences. Rare examples of male-as-object-in-media certainly exist (consider Tom Ford's A Single Man, or arguably even Mary Harron's American Psycho) but they are, sorry to be redundant, rare."
SRSDiscussion,2xv2sb,srsalphaprime,9,Mon Mar 9 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"There seem to be pretty varied ideas about what constitutes objectification. The classic example is a woman in skimpy underwear taking a sexy pose for an advert or calender or something. In this sense then yes, men are often objectified in the same way, there are loads of adverts with men in their underwear taking silly poses that show off their muscles or crotch even if this is less common than the female equivalent. I don't really buy the argument that because male models usually take masculine poses and female models usually take feminine poses this somehow makes it a completely different thing although certainly in other media sexy men usually have more sexual agency than sexy women.   However objectification can be a much more broad concept and men and women are often objectified in different ways. For example the most recent film I saw was John Wick in which the eponymous protagonist goes on a vengeful killing spree after his dog is killed by Russian gangsters. Now 90% of the men in that film do nothing except get shot, stabbed or suffocated by the main character; they exist only as objects to be killed in flashy ways. This is a pretty common trend in actions films which I think often goes overlooked as female characters are usually objects to be won or saved and therefore of limited but some importance while male characters are usually either really important main characters or completely unimportant minions who are just there to be mowed down. So when you think back to a film you remember the female character who was treated like an object, you remember the awesome male hero who did everything and you forget about the large number of disposable male characters who were treated like objects.  For a non-media example we could look at 'sugar daddy' relationships which are typically between wealthy older men and younger attractive women. Now there's no doubt that women in these relationships are usually treated as little more than objects to provide sex and companionship by their partner, however the men are also treated as objects to provide money and gifts in return. I've heard it been said that if society treats women like 'sex objects' then men are treated like 'success objects' which I think holds a lot of truth even if it is simplistic. So I think that while men can be objectified in the same way as women usually are, generally when they are objectified it is in a significantly different way than women are."

SRSDiscussion,2xv2sb,rmc,3,Wed Mar 4 12:29:29 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is how some straight male people will play the ""look the men are sexualised too"" card, like you describe. However I think if you want to see how men are sexualised for the male audience, look at gay media / adverts. There's a big difference in how a conventionally attractive men are portrayed in mass media (which is mostly targetted at straight men), and how they are portrayed in media targetted at gay male audience.  Many straight men really don't like that sort of gay sexualisation (and some react murderiously if they are hit on by a man). Which just goes to show how there's a difference in how men and women are portrayed in mass media.  (I'm a cis gay male, so I have no experience/knowledge of women objectifying men, so I'm not talking about that. Merely pointing out a data point.)"
SRSDiscussion,2xv2sb,Scrappythewonderdrak,2,Sat Mar 7 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"Objectification does not mean the same thing as sexualization.  Objectification is when you reduce a person from a subject with thoughts, emotions, and free will whose happiness is inherently valuable to an object with none of those characteristics whose only value is to serve others.  Sexualization is associated with objectification because women are often objectified as objects of male pleasure, but sexualization is by no means a prerequisite for objectification."

Because, yes, women ogling Channing Tatum are objectifying him. The result of that objectification is different, because (most of the time) within the current power structure objectifying Tatum reifies his status.   The male characters on ""Sex and the City"" or ""Girls"" are closer examples of what you're talking about. They're thinly characterized, sexual devices for furthering the female protagonists' narrative.   I'd argue that, while society remains toxic, within the smaller subcultures that watch and are affected by those shows, it's possible to ""objectify"" (see how it's still not quite the right word) the male characters without requiring their primacy in the story-world."

When you have male game protagonists or superheroes go around shirtless their status as a strong, desirable, masculine man is reinforced. A man is never just an object.  Even in Magic Mike, the story is still about the strippers themselves, they all still have sexual agency and they're all still more than just naked bodies."

SRSDiscussion,2xv2sb,justajust,7,Wed Mar 4 06:23:00 2015 UTC,"The question is -- ""can women objectify the same way as men?""  As far as I'm concerned, anyone can objectify. A woman's reducing a man to his sexual utility, ala Tatum, is objectification. It's still something people should probably try not to do to other people.  However, in the current dominant power structure, the net effect of many women objectifying a man is not comparable to institutional sexist representation.  So, I think the question ""Can women ever objectify men in the same way?"" is complicated. My feeling is that the sexual arena is institutionally sexist, so drooling over Channing Tatum keeps people like Tatum on top of a pyramid.   You couldn't argue that the male characters in, say, ""Girls"" are ""objectified"" in the same way as Channing Tatum. Rather, they are clever servants to a woman-centric narrative. A ""Girls"" in which hunky alpha-men are used and disposed of would undermine a true subversion of male/female tropes -- it would make the point that the ""Girls"" can do whatever they want as long as they have a hot cishet Man to fulfill their otherwise unmet needs.   Of course ""Girls"" is nothing like that, and ""Sex in the City"" is obviously its closest ancestor in that regard. The fact that women writers must use such complex means to subvert patriarchal narrative isn't something we should be proud of. But we also probably shouldn't reduce it to ""women objectifying men for a change,"" which is how some people undoubtedly read it -- my feeling is they're missing the point."

In it she argues that the trends, starting in the seventies, of more skin and homoerotic imagery in fashion ads with male bodies does allow women and gay men to objectify the male body in a way somewhat similar to the way women's bodies are so often objectified in images (and on the street, etc.). That said, I think she, like most here, would contend that it can't really be the same because of history.  She calls on the art historian (who I really like) John Berger's dichotomy ""Men act, women appear,"" to make some points about how women are objectified more fundamentally than men are. In her other work she points out that as per Cartesian duality, western culture often associates men with the brain and women with the body.   So, my points being: No, I think men can be objectified but not in the same way, and Bordo writes about this subject if you want to hear someone more articulate than me cover it."
SRSDiscussion,2xuvfm,RhinoFish,5,Wed Mar 4 01:38:50 2015 UTC,"What is a socially just world like and how can we know once we get there?    A socially just world is one were we'd actually have enough resources to be exploited in order to make the exploitation of humans unnecessary. As it is, every opportunity is also exploitation, as there just isn't enough of anything to go around: you successfully taking an opportunity takes an opportunity from someone else. At the very least, everyone would need to get back more than they give and our current systems just don't work that way. Being given a bare minimum that exceeds the maximum you have to provide.   That only works if every opportunity exists in excess. More work than workers, more food than hunger, more mobility than moving, more money than... can we really build a just world as long as money is a thing? Instead of monetary value being the objective of work, satisfaction of needs has to be the new currency. Instead of aiming to achieve an excess of money, aiming to achieve an excess of possibly satisfied needs.  There's more that would have to become obsolete. Any form of rigidness in gender, probably the concept of gender and sex itself. The concept of race as something more important than hair color or other physical traits. The concept of sexuality as a binary or spectrum, as a result of eliminating gender rigidness. In short, the possibility of freely defining oneself without standing in opposition to a social construct as a result.   In short, a socially just world is a utopia. We can have a socially juster world, but to even come close to a world is that is genuinely on the right track, we'd have to extend the mechanization of work in order to reach a state where more basic needs can be fulfilled than actually exist. Free of charge. Only then would every human actually stand on a basis from which something just could be achieved."

SRSDiscussion,2xuvfm,PiscineCyclist,2,Wed Mar 4 06:05:57 2015 UTC,"The problem with a lot of conceptions of a ""socially just world"" is that too many people who tackle the question formulate extremely high-level answers that don't directly address material conditions.  For example, the answer that a socially just world is one without exploitation. That's good and nice, but people disagree about what counts as exploitation.  All feminists agree that intrinsic exploitation characterises patriarchy. However, liberal feminists are very likely to disagree that capitalism is internally exploitative (hence the pleas to reform capitalism or to form a welfare state like Canada or Germany or Sweden). In turn, liberal feminists and (most) socialist feminists are likely disagree with anarcha-feminists that the institution of the state is exploitative. For liberals and some socialists, the state is necessary and integral to the good society; Marxist feminists may say that the state simply must be used by the working class.  If we cannot even agree on the answer to the question, ""what is exploitation?"", the task of creating a socially just world together based on the quality of a lack of exploitation won't ever finish.  I think the reason why people speak in this way, especially people who are supportive of a single ""social justice movement"", is because there are so many social issues, and the question of the socially just world must integrate all of them. There would be too many points of contention to move anywhere in unison - not only on peripheral details, but fundamental issues like core beliefs, goals, strategy, tactics and style of organization. I support movements that seek social justice, but I do not support a broad-base, big-tent social justice movement for this reason; I also don't believe that such a movement exists.  This isn't to say that movements should never overlap or communicate. To the contrary - we live in an intersectional world, so interaction is necessary and inevitable. In fact, it's precisely because we live in an intersectional world that a feelgood union of movements characterized as ones for social justice should not happen - at least on a basis of any permanence. Union for union's sake is unlikely to be useful.  TL;DR: The answer is simple: to create a socially just world. However, because people who seek social justice have too many different ends to meet, and too many different beliefs about how to reach their ends and what the ends look like, the goal cannot be met in unison in one social justice movement, which would be necessary to accomplish the work of ""creating a socially just world."" Loose association and ample communication is fine, but no one's going anywhere in a big movement.  e: a few words"

The change I support the most is overhauling our justice system in general to shift from criminal justice to restorative justice, which is the system that many European nations use. It focuses on rehabilitation, gets rid of the death penalty, and has shown to reduce crimes done by people incarcerated before.   Of course the biggest hurdles in getting any of this done is the general attitude Americans have in terms of punishment and prisons, and the sway of private prisons in lawmaking."

SRSDiscussion,2xbsgf,onlykindagreen,27,Thu Mar 5 21:07:40 2015 UTC,"Haha, this is actually funny because I just submitted a semester-long research proposal for a digital rhetoric class. I want to look at the term ""social justice warrior"" or ""SJW"", its origins, and the shift to using it as an insult, and how this mirrors pop culture backlash against women in the 70's and 80's as a result of feminism. I'm not sure if my proposal will get accepted but fingers crossed!  That being said, I don't even have a concrete definition, but that's kind of the point. From what I can currently tell (only like two days into very casual researching) SJW did originate as a positive thing, kind of an in-joke, people fighting for JUSTICE on the internet. It wasn't meant to be wholly serious. What I (personally) think that it kind had to do with was the idea that large change needs to come with a shift in ideals and opinions, which happens on a small level with people fighting against normalization of racism and sexism. Even if that's one comment at a time. So a SJW was a joke name that people kind of picked up for themselves when they would go out of their way to point out inappropriate comments or things that would usually slide unnoticed. They were fighting normalization on a minute level. That's what my current understanding is. But again, like two days of casual ""research"" ie browsing reddit and a little bit of tumblr (which I've never used and am so confused by).  However, people who don't agree with the idea of an ""SJW"", who see it as pointless slacktivism at best and at worst as someone who is actively trying to strip people of their free speech and their ""rights"" have adopted it as an insult. But the point is that there isn't really a concrete definition. It's a strawman insult. It's a term they can use to dismiss anyone who doesn't agree with their ideals. A lot of times they feel comfortable in the way things are, aren't totally willing to admit that something is an issue or needs to be changed (see: millions of ""oh god, it's just a joke!"" comments) and see someone who might call themselves an SJW as a pointless nitpicker and fun ruiner. They are just there to be a nuisance. SJW is the strawman for radical feminists, ""fake"" tumblr feminists, extreme feminists, people who are annoying, literally anything that they disagree with. There is no concrete definition for SJW because it needs to stay broad in order to be a tool in invalidating an argument without actually listening to it. If you just dismiss someone as a crazy SJW, their argument doesn't matter, you don't have to question your ways or change anything, you can just laugh at their ignorance and move on.  That became a bit of a rant, and currently this is just my personal observation and opinion that I'm hoping to spring off of with actual research. So, maybe I'll check back in, in a few months!"

People on tumblr? Just your friend and her posse? Anyone who fights against the normalization of offensive (I know, again, another highly subjective term) ideas? It's interesting.   Like, of the people I know in real life who endearingly call themselves SJW's, they are all college educated feminists (which is obviously personal bias because I'm in a college women's studies environment so of course I know a lot of these types of people) who are progressive, but who I feel I could have real conversations with, who I see as very grounded in reality. Personally in my mind, I see that ungrounded group as the minority, but the idea that all SJW's are ridiculous is kind of perpetuated by sites like reddit. So, basically what I'm saying is that I think your reply is interesting because it's weighted with the idea that SJW's are a definable group, who are ungrounded from reality, who are overzealous and can't be taken seriously.

All of the most extreme, most hypocritical, most loud ""SJW"" Tumblrs being mocked were trolls, who were themselves mocking what they assumed was social justice rhetoric. As a lot of these blogs got discovered as trolls, while r/TiA got bigger and bigger, the blogs that started to get posted turned into genuine feminist/etc postings that were unpolished or a little extreme, and then things got meaner and more sexist, racist, and generally horrible from there.   At some point, the parody/troll/hyperbole rhetoric became the movement in the eyes of people who say shit like the comment linked in the OP - that these obnoxious troll blogs are social justice, which is absurd. That compounds with people who actually do very much want uphold (or at least never have to think about) sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc etc, who push and push the idea that social justice isn't a movement, isn't something that helps people but a rhetoric that only wants to tear others down.   For whatever it's worth, ""social justice"" still means what it's always meant offline - the Unitarian Universalist congregation my partner goes to still has a social justice committee that organizes their activism, and lots of activist groups in general still organize under this particular ideological banner. And on the other end of things, there are people who have genuine criticism of the way social justice rhetoric is used, especially online (I have some disability rights activist friends in particular who feel very strongly about the way language is used as a barrier-of-entry, for example), but these people still continue to do good activist work even if they're uncomfortable with the ""social justice"" label.   Sorry of this was meandering or not particularly coherent. It's weird because there's both so little (people reactionary bigots, news at 11) and so much (language and communication are complicated!) involved in the way social justice has gotten twisted around in the public consciousness to produce the ""social justice warrior"", and it's both horrible and fascinating at the same time."
SRSDiscussion,2xbsgf,SuitableDragonfly,24,Sun Mar 1 05:17:58 2015 UTC,"The person who is more into social justice than me. That's it. It's an accusation that either a) someone is doing social justice wrong by being too aggressive, or b) someone is promoting social justice, and I find that threatening (so they're aggressive).  A redditor will call any feminist an SJW, the deeply racist/sexist subs will call redditors who at least pretend to have a shred of decency SJWs, milquetoast white feminists will call radical feminists SJWs. I've even seen SRSters use it to label those tumblr kids who don't actually get social justice and use it as a way to lash out/feel special or superior."

Maybe you should be more inclusive in your diagnosis of society's ills, so that you don't alienate all us 'moderates' out there."". But how the fuck am I supposed to critique existing power structures without actually being critical? You can't call white people privileged because it hurts their feelings to imply they may be at an advantage in life, regardless of their personal hardships. You can't ask them to empathise with black people getting shot by police because it comes with the implication that they aren't already being empathetic, which is then offensive. It seems like white/cis/hetero/etc. people want toothless activism because it is easier to swallow and doesn't challenge and doesn't require them to do anything."

Of course, though, there were some people that reblogged that and then later discovered how vitriolic some other people on tumblr were, and decided based on that that complaints about ""SJW""s were merited.

Many minority kids who are placed into majority situations feel incredibly out of place and even if you view ""integration"" as a virtue, little work is done to accommodate. The solution to the school to prison pipeline is funding for black schools, being taught by black teachers, run by black administrators.

However, approaching the education of underprivileged African Americans in a structure that is academically and structurally geared towards their race and economic situation has been proven to improve their performance.   So knowing that information, what do we do with it? Charter schools are one solution, yes. But as you and others have pointed out, the results of charter schools are by their nature mixed.   Personally, I would propose re-hauling the curriculum and structure in schools that consist of a black majority in a manner better geared to them racially and economically, as well as keeping close attention to how this change affects students of other races."

African American students do better with teachers of their own race, and a curriculum that takes into account their race. These are things that help white students to succeed, and that white Americans take for granted. I hate to throw around the word white privilege, but this is a perfect example of it.    The grim reality is that many students, and their families, simply don't care.   But why don't they care? Lack of prospects? Lack of role-models? Lack of interest in education? These are questions that need to be answered by the school system, and it does not do anyone any good to shift the entirety of the burden to the students and the parents.    It is a degree of entrenched apathy that money just can't fix.   Who said anything about money? Meaningful reform is what we need."

The answer, in my opinion, is going to be structural and academic reform."

SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,Marius_Eponine,22,Fri Feb 20 07:29:25 2015 UTC,"First: I think it's absolutely unethical and immorral on Jefferson's part.  It's hard to look at situations like this objectively from a 21st century standpoint. We cannot help but look at the situation from the perspective of our own cultural values which we naturally deem superior.   However, I'm not sure that the Jefferson/Hemmings relationship was exactly the same as rape, when you consider that Jefferson's wife could not consent to sex in the modern sense either. She was entirely under his control. She had no assets of her own once she became his wife. If she were to refuse him, he could force himself upon her and face no consequences. The idea that she a woman could be raped by her husband would have been entirely foreign to an 18th century Virginian.  Martha Jefferson was nearly as much Thomas's property as Sally Hemmings.  It's hard to distinguish this kind of action (which would clearly be rape in the modern world) in an era when women could not vote, could not own property on their own, and had virtually no legal existence separate from their husbands. From a 21st century perspective, no 18th century woman could meaningfully consent to sex, and all sex would have been rape.  I don't know precisely where you draw the line, but I don't think that ""As property, Hemmings could not consent"" is in itself good enough."
SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,quintus_aurelianus,9,Fri Feb 20 14:46:03 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good point, but at the same time, there is a long history of 18th and 19th Century white Southern wealthy men abusing their black slaves and later servants, the black community was painfully aware of it, and no one at the time would have made the comparison you are making between slaves/servants and wives."
SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,m__q,6,Sun Feb 22 01:38:01 2015 UTC,"That's true, and I certainly don't want to downplay slavery as if it were just like being a wealthy white plantation wife. ""Consent"" is a really difficult think to wrestle with in a past where so much of the population has so little autonomy - a past where sex, skin color, poverty, national origin - things that can be a major disadvantage now - but then would render consent completely irrelevant.   It makes it difficult to discuss things in the terms we're used to in our modern lives, because their lives were not like ours.   I don't want it to come across that I'm suggesting that it ""wasn't so bad"" just that consent isn't a simple concept where no woman had enough power to say no.   There is a strong tendency from our earliest history to make our past into stories with heroes and villains. Lincoln is a hero. Genghis Khan is a villain. Lincoln was a racist. Khan promoted religious tolerance. Neither of those facts undoes the other things that they did. Life isn't as simple as Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, even if that makes a better story.   As a 21st century person, Thomas Jefferson raped at least two women. Was Martha Jefferson a victim? She probably would have said not. Historical accounts suggest they loved each other very much. Was Sally Hemmings a victim of rape as well as slavery? I have no idea. My personal opinion is probably. But I can't know for sure because the story has gotten in the way of the history as it so often does."
SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,quintus_aurelianus,2,Sun Feb 22 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think it makes a ton of sense to say that every married woman was being raped even in a situation like that time period where women didn't have a lot they could do to resist.  Marital rape wasn't made illegal in every state in the US until the early 1990s, for example, and it certainly doesn't make sense to say that every married American woman in the 70s was being raped no matter how they felt about it.  That Martha Jefferson probably consented to sex and Sally Hemmings probably didn't makes a big difference even though Martha Jefferson didn't have a lot she could have done if she had wanted to not consent to sex."
SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,BlackHumor,7,Sun Feb 22 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"The 1970s were vastly different from the 1790s. In 1970, a charge of rape might not have been levied at a husband, sure, but the woman has enough options that consent can exist. She can divorce him. She can get her own job. She can make her own life. And while the husband might to face legal consequences for making her have sex, he would for abusing her otherwise.   Two hundred years earlier, the a married woman was legally inseparable from her husband. She can't own property on her own. She can't really get a job. Her only option is to go back into her father's care. She is under her husband's power. And any consent she offers must be understood in the context that she can't really say no.   A 18th century woman was completely in her husband's power in the way a 20th century woman was not.    That Martha Jefferson probably consented to sex and Sally Hemmings probably didn't makes a big difference even though Martha Jefferson didn't have a lot she could have done if she had wanted to not consent to sex.   If Hemmings did not consent, then there is no question about the rape. The circles we are going in seem to be about the idea that if Hemmings did offer consent that doesn't count as true consent because she was entirely in Jefferson's power."
SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,quintus_aurelianus,5,Sun Feb 22 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"Hm, I agree and disagree--I think we've got a systemic issue (that of rape and, more broadly, sex between genders) here and a personal issue here (Jefferson and Hemmings), and the intersection of those two things is tricky.  When I first started reading things like RadTransFem's pieces on consent, I for a time believed that no one could consent under patriarchy, not in the 18th century and not in the 21st. What changed my mind, of course, was realizing that patriarchy has cracks: there were/are plenty of women (in the 21st century and the 18th century!) who are out there in the world acting as sexual agents and consenting to sex. Everyone has to navigate consent in the context of patriarchy--where consent is a non-concept--but being sex-positive means hoping/recognizing that consent can be inserted into sexual relations despite patriarchy.  When it comes to the Jefferson/Hemmings relationship, I think the best we can do is understand the systems of oppression that Hemmings had to navigate to give/have-a-hope-to-give consent (which you unpack nicely, as does OP). I feel uncomfortable making a determination on whether, specifically, it was/wasn't rape, because I don't want to further deny Hemmings sexual agency (heavens knows there were plenty of systems doing that already!). I might put it this way: given the power dynamics between man/woman president/slave white/black, it would have been extremely difficult for Hemmings to meaningfully consent. The relationship was undoubtedly unequal; could they have pulled a meaningful human relationship out of that context anyways? One hopes."

Yeah, I'm sure there were. It's difficult to express the vast power differential to an audience that can't be assumed to be overly familiar with 18th century cultural dynamics.  Also, my expertise is in ancient history, so my ability to address the 18th century is limited to a broad overview.     The relationship was undoubtedly unequal; could they have pulled a meaningful human relationship out of that context anyways? One hopes.

SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,quintus_aurelianus,18,Mon Feb 23 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"I suggest reading The Hemingses of Monticello by Annette Gordon-Reed. It's long, but it's worth it-- a very in-depth review of Jefferson's relationship with Sally, and it won the Pulitzer.  Some things to note: when Jefferson began his relationship with Sally, he was 45 and she was 15. Additionally, Sally was the half-sister of Jefferson's late wife, Martha (Martha and Sally shared a father--he raped Sally's mother).  Gordon-Reed (who, if it's relevant, is an African-American woman herself) argues that of course there could not be full consent in Sally's relationship with Jefferson. However, evidence shows that she was not completely without agency. During their relationship, Jefferson took Sally to France with him where they spent months in a domestic partnership. There were no laws in France enforcing American slave laws, so, in effect, Sally was free when they were in France. She chose to stay with him there and chose to return to America with him.  Jefferson undoubtedly preyed on and abused Sally Hemmings. He is an ambiguous figure because he was probably our ""smartest"" president, but also said things like, ""Slavery is like having a wolf by the ear."" He saw it as a ""necessary evil,"" an institution that was harmful but whose dissolution would be disastrous. For many reasons, he should not be mythologized and treated as a hero.  In the 21st century sense, Sally Hemmings did not have agency and could not give adequate consent to have a relationship with Thomas Jefferson. She did, however, display some willingness to be with him, so the issue of consent/non-consent is more complicated than it seems."

SRSDiscussion,2wiz7a,TheSpaceWhale,8,Sat Feb 21 01:31:58 2015 UTC,"It's surely not my intent to excuse him.   In my personal worldview, slavery is about the worst crime that a human being can commit, short of something like genocide. Jefferson's role in maintaining the institution and personally keeping slaves for his own benefit is more than enough for me to condemn him whether or not he ought to be considered a rapist.  However, as an historian, it's important to understand the world Jefferson lived in. If we are discussing rape according to our modern sensibilities, it's important to understand that very few if any women were in a position to offer what we would call meaningful consent in a world where a woman is traded from her father's power to her husband's and her wishes need not be consulted. That all women were subject to rape is a useful topic.  However, if we're trying to set rape apart as a crime more heinous than mere marriage, the discussion seems to require a higher standard than ""meaningful consent.""  I'm no expert in sex and gender studies, so I can't propose what that standard ought to be. I do think that your comment about Stockholm syndrome is a useful line of inquiry when considering the topic.   Removed by three centuries, I find it hard to speculate as to the level of Hemmings's consent (irrespective of whether that consent is meaningful) given that the primary source documents are tainted by Jefferson apologists and Jefferson himself, who would surely not depict himself as forcing himself on an unwilling slave."

The concept of rape has changed over time. ""Rape"" as a word comes from the Latin ""rapere"" which described the practice of theft and looting rather than a specifically sexual crime. The idea that a woman has been ""raped"" was that she (or her sexual value) had been stolen - from her father or her husband.

Putting aside the fact that language in favor of the complainant does nothing to actually clarify such a rule's scope under ambiguous circumstances (which the author notes), it holds an insidious gender bias that codifies the idea that men are incapable of regretting sex.   Rules based on asymmetrical consequences for the complainant fall apart if we allow for men regretting the decisions they make while intoxicated with the same frequency as women.  If you believe this scenario is unlikely or downright impossible, I would argue you are perpetuating toxic masculinity, even to the point of desiring its codification into formal policy. As someone who opposes even informal instances of toxic gender biases, I shudder at the idea of enshrining it into policy."
SRSDiscussion,2wil5j,WorkshopVillage,5,Fri Feb 20 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"I think what both you and the author are trying to get at is that there's a tension between the pragmatic realization that men are the perpetrators and women the victims and the simultaneous desire to reject this kind of essentialized notion. Codifying this sort of distinction in policy definitely has the potential to shift the justification from pragmatic grounds towards these more hardened notions of gender in which men and women can only ever occupy one side of this dynamic.  When it comes to alcohol and drugs, I think the example given in the article is particularly compelling here--the scenario in which both parties place a complaint on the desk of a campus administrator at the same time. This scenario is obviously a little out there, but not impossible to imagine, and highlights the fact that the policy is based around the idea that this won't happen because only one party stands to regret the interaction."

You've more or less captured my thoughts with the exception of one point.  At the risk of espousing yet another unpopular opinion in this space, I find even the ""pragmatic justification"" for the policies in question to be insufficient and inherently unjust.

(Rape isn't strictly a male crime but how can we stop all rape if society can't address the most obvious form)  Fraternities, frat boys, and student athletes have a reputation (although not patent) on sexual assault and rape, and my local university seems unwillingly to punish frats even when they are getting in fist fights with each other in the street several times over 2 weeks (YES THIS LITERALLY HAPPENED). I'll believe ""culture of victim hood"" and I'll care about ""false rape accusations"" once universities show that they give a shit about what's happening in their campus, other than just to silence it.

Just because a football player raped someone doesn't mean another person who plays the same sport will do it. Just because one fraternity out of hundreds has a problem with sexual assault does not mean the rest do. I don't know much about student-athlete life but I'm very familiar with fraternity life and I think it's the same deal with both: they all suffer for what individual members or groups in their communities do when in reality they're all different. if you found a random number of friend groups, you would find that some were filled with shitty people and others were filled with good people. It's the same deal with fraternities/sports teams. They are not all the same, each group has an individual culture which determines how its members act. To me, generalizing all student athletes and fraternities is the same as saying, for example, that all musicians are drug addicts because some groups of musicians have been known to ingest them."

I am not denying that within SOME fraternity chapters there is a misogynistic, hypermasculine culture that leads to these crimes occurring. What I am saying is that they don't reflect upon the members of OTHER chapters who don't have that culture. You have to understand that depending on the school and location, the makeup of fraternities in terms of types of person tend to vary wildly. I have met fraternity members who are assholes. I have also met men who are part of chapters who don't really party much and focus the majority of their time on raising money for whatever charity they sponsor.

But this is the question I still struggle with, at least sometimes: what should the policy be in the meantime?

E: Like, I agree, we shouldn't be shedding tears over the mere possibility of innocent people getting caught up, and that these sorts of concerns are often a huge distraction from the bigger message, but it seems like the question of policy is more complicated than whether I should invest a lot of time caring about random men getting caught up in hypothetical false accusations."

Whether this is a result of social conditioning, biology or something else is anyone's guess of course.  I suspect that the difference in anti-vax beliefs is largely because mothers are more likely to consider themselves experts in child-rearing than fathers and therefore more likely to trust their own intuition over expert advice. This would hardly be surprising given that mothers spend more time on average caring for their child and anecdotally I've found the ""mother knows best"" attitude a lot more prevalent than ""father knows best"".  I don't think that this makes it an inherently gendered issue but it should probably be borne in mind, when trying to convince anti-vaxxers, that this is the type of mindset that you're up against; mothers tend not to respond well to direct criticisms of the way they raise their children. Also many arguments made in favour of vaccines focus on the social good and on the benefit that it provides to other children who can't be vaccinated for whatever reason, this is probably counter-productive as it will likely be perceived as asking the parent to put their own child at risk for the sake of others."

I'm not saying everything that comes out of genetic research is a good thing...but it's hard to pin a moral or ethical restriction on something involving plants in my opinion.   Comparing GMOs to torturuous experiments like Milgrim is heavy handed...as humans we can't exactly say that any particular agricultural advancement has been good for the ecosystem -- we are an inherently invasive species. Nitrates, for example, helped end hunger. It also led to huge population booms. And at the rate we are growing, it is impossible to create a system that can feed the world without some level of GMO. Just consider the environmental impact alone, how much acerage would be needed for an entire world fed on organic crops.  The only other solution is a some sort of population-reducing event. People aren't going to wake up and stop having children. Especially in countries where women have very limited social liberty.  Should we let a bunch of people die off, because of moral ""what-if"" scenarios?  Don't get me wrong: I care a lot about food. I love urban farming. I think sustainable, local food supply is important. I think it's possible to create urban green spaces where nature and science can work together to make a more efficient, cost effective, greener and healthier world. I live in a food desert in Brooklyn -- of you can't shop at the ""organic"" rip-off stores, you aren't getting fresh produce. Affordable, fresh produce is one of the only ways to combat the lower income fast-food problem.    Then take the actually positive things that GMOs have done, such as pest resistant cotton.

To be honest I'm not overly fond of the ""what if scientists fuck it up"" argument. There's no real difference between an organism that has been genetically modified or artificially produced for generations, so any claimed effects on the ecosystem are extremely hypothetical. Seeds on the market are the result of artificial selection, and you are disrupting the ecosystem in exactly the same way as you would with GMOs every time you start a farm in a new area - farmers don't artificially select their own crops from scratch any more, and a lot introduce pesticides into the ecosystem as well. It's not just crop-related either. What happens to the ecosystem everytime someone builds a road? GMOs are taking a lot of flack for a phenomenon that already happens all the time.  My biggest concern is that GMOs can do a lot for world hunger, especially in parts of the world that are difficult to grow crops. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh here, but as far as I'm concerned a lot of anti-GMO scaremongering is getting in the way of making the world a better place.   Having said that, there are very good reasons why GMOs should be treated with caution. However, it's not really about the science, but about the politics. Unfortunately GMO companies aren't exactly paragons of virtue, and a lot of governmental regulation needs to be put in place in advance to prevent any immoral business practices that may arise from complications in GMO use."

""Best practices"" for nutritional advice for the pregnant mom, breastfeeding, and labor and birth itself have swung wildly back and forth for the last few generations, and some past practices are pretty horrific (tying women down to beds while on drugs that make them forget everything later--yeah) I think it's easy to see that the kind of vigilance and mistrust that a mom often cultivates if she self-educates about the history of childbirth (especially if she's also planning for natural birth) could carry over into vaccine mistrust by analogy, especially if there's a little PPD in the picture.

If you bring this to HR, they will likely not really care and, honestly, that is a defensible position. You may get your name written down somewhere as 'uppity' with 'potential liability' scribbled down somewhere closeby. HR's job is to protect the company from lawsuits and in this case that will likely translate to protecting the company from you, not protecting you from being offended.  That said, this guy is just professing his idiotic beliefs and he has a right to them. If he's calling someone a faggot or a nigger then he deserves to be reprimanded and probably terminated. If he's bullying or changing his provided care based on these criteria, he deserves to have his license revoked.

He said he didn't think race factored into it, it just so happened that the black neighborhood had more crime. He also wanted to have more people pulled over and stopped for minor things because in other places this had drastically reduced crime. He wasn't thinking about from a social perspective at all, just crime and safety.   I don't agree with what he said but it was interesting to hear this perspective. Do all cops really see certain places/people as a crime waiting to happen? Do they just go on autopilot and say ""the last 5 people I arrested looked like that/were in this area. Better check this guy?"" I don't know. He just had a very different sense of reality which did end up reducing crime, but also ended with the city being sued and some cops even going to prision for their tactics."

It sounded like all cops made things difficult but only a handful actually took it to the level where it was criminal. That being said, if you have 5 cops that are criminally harassing 5 people a day, 5 days a week for a couple years, that's a lot of victims. Worse, many people were repeatedly victimized just because of where they lived or because they were out an about. There were people that had been stopped and frisked every day for a year.

That's not a good point at all I've seen people change their opinions after being in a debate over stuff like that. I've changed peoples opinions myself.  The thing is there's a difference in censoring free speech and censoring hate speech. And plus it's never actually anyone taking their ""right"" away.

They'll probably never admit to you that you made them think, and they probably won't admit it to themselves until one day they find themselves thinking something along the lines of, ""Wow, that comment was really unnecessary, do we really have to sexualize every ciswoman on Earth?"" and suddenly a paradigm shift occurs.

If you are an individual that has been born and always lived in a society where you are the vast majority and a person who isn't part of that majority comes to you and tells you there's discrimination you wouldn't believe him/her because you have never experienced discrimination because you are part of the majority. Or better said your interpretation of ""discrimination"" is vastly different. You also don't interpret certain actions or words you do and say as discrimination because for you it's just an established fact. You've always heard a certain type of logic and never heard anyone challenge it. Calling someone a racial slur to you sounds like calling a potato a potato. So when someone tries to convince you there is discrimination and tries to change the way you act and talk you feel like you're being wronged. Imagine you come from a society where hitting women is not a crime or even looked down upon. Imagine someone trying to suddenly change that. To them it would be a discrimination against them and their perfectly normal myogenic culture.  In recent years with the Euro zone crisis you could see a sort of a diss-off between German and Greek media. Greeks were astonished and incredibly offended that they were presented (in the most direct and comical way possible) as lazy southerners, who are corrupt, and all their problems arise from their own stupidity. On the other hand Germans were even more stunned and puzzled by the fact that the Greeks presented them (in the most shocking way possible) as corrupt, arrogant, racist, lazy and even more tax evading then them. Both countries see themselves in the same way. As honest, hard working, cultured peoples who have fallen a victim to outside forces who want to steal their money.  It was very ironic how both sides would argue their own opinion and newspapers are the reality thus it must be, and how the other side is just uncivilized and trying to be offensive without any grounds."

SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,SenatorCoffee,4,Tue Feb 10 06:14:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't, but you asked what they meant and I was explaining what the common argument is. To me the argument comes across as almost threatening, even when coming from people who are opposed to the violence.  It's like when abuse victims are told they were asking to get hit because they tried to defend themselves."
SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,psyduck_best_duck,18,Tue Feb 10 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"Hate speech laws give me the heeby jeebies. They really seems like the best example of a non-fallacious slippery slope argument.  Where does hate speech start? If someone is in speaking out in favour of Hamas, is that hate speech? If someone is speaking out in favour of suicide bombers that strike civillians in Israel, is that hate speech? If someone is speaking out in favour of suicide bombers that strike civillians in your city, is that hate speech?  Or, an example I've seen made in this sub before, that violence is justified as a tool of social justice/protest, is that hate speech?  For these reasons, I always get concerned at the mention of extending hate speech laws."
SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,JManRomania,9,Tue Feb 10 06:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally agree.  I mean I totally get this, I read a lot about what for example *trans people go through, and I want it to stop as much as anybody, I really do, but I also know how things just are right now, and if something like this gets passed you can bet your ass that the most protected class would obviously be ""politicians and rich people"".  In a way this is already somewhat the case here in glorious ""socialist"" germany, and where I really think the states with their insistence on die hard free speech got a leg up.  Like in my eyes when dealing with the current workings of the government being insulting is just about the only rational way of express my opinion. Ok, I can be academic if I want to but that is already giving those people to much credence. The only way to realistically describe Angela Merkel in my view is as either a ""lobotomized automaton"" or ""baby-eating cannibal"" depending of how much benefit of the doubt you want to give her. But expressing something like that will get you charged here in germany.  There are a couple of compromises that could be made that avoid this like outlawing hating on someone in public space, and furthermore putting hefty fines on it, that could perhaps protect minorities in the ways that matter, but if its about the internet, press etc, I see no way around just insisting on the absoluteness of the principle.  Finally as a buddhist/anarchist I just don't think that further regulating ""hate"" with ""law"" is the productive way to look at those things. The hate is a product of the good old ""crabs in a bucket"" problem, and the only way to ever solve this shit is at the root.  I know as a white cis male I am speaking from a privileged position, on the other hand I was born in the most dysfunctional of lower class families, and it is just obvious to me that a lot of this critique against ""SJW's"" is in a way justified. Ok, it's just true, we all know it, 30% of this crowd, MY crowd, are just very privileged in the one way that just outweighs all the others:  C.R.E.A.M. And then those people just talking down on the lower classes for like not being PC enough, just feels really alien.  And I mean I am really not trying to put this onto the ""SJW"" clichee, this is basically everone. The whole ""intellectual"" upperclass. Times magazine, CBN, BBC. All getting in outrage over some assclown saying something ""incorrect"", and then going back to sipping martinis and wasting money on the most decadent crap, while their very neighbours can't pay their rent with a 50 hour job. It just feels wrong and its part of the most predictable game of ""manufacturing consent"", and its at least somewhat understandable that there is an an antireaction.  if you believe that these problems could get solved by the academic class just wagging their finger hard enough at the ""ignorant masses"", you are just operating from the worst kind of authoritarian thinking. Ok, its a clichée and its a target area of the enemy, but I have spent enough time among the conventional left to just know what I know.   Here is the thing: If your dad makes 120k as a corporate lawyer, or even 50k as a college professor to finance your lazy bohemian ass, criticizing the system where it actually counts is of course impossible to you. So what can you actually do to still feel all ""humanitarian"" and ""holier-than-thou"" ? Of course !! complain about ""people not being nice enough to minorities"". It just doesn't threaten your own position. It's just empty.  I am going on a tangent here, and I dont know maybe this will get me banned here, but I really believe that if the left ever wants to go anywhere this is the shit they have got to figure out, and yes it sadly means going against the narcissism of their own ""class"" (!).  If I finally want to justify myself as ""not a manarchist"", I can only state that if I personally come across somebody being only ever so slightly sexist, trans- or homophobic, you can bet your ass I will come down on them.  I just don't think that trying to solve those issues in the walls of what I see as the final institution of privilege ""the academy"", or even worse ""the government"" will ever lead to something good."

SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,Scrappythewonderdrak,3,Thu Feb 12 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"well take france as an example:   The hate speech laws in France are matters of both civil law and criminal law. Those laws protect individuals and groups from being defamed or insulted because they belong or do not belong, in fact or in fancy, to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or because they have a handicap. The laws forbid any communication which is intended to incite discrimination against, hatred of, or harm to, anyone because of his belonging or not belonging, in fact or in fancy, to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or because he or she has a handicap."
SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,tilia-cordata,14,Sun Feb 15 02:56:27 2015 UTC,"The problem with restricting speech in general (not hate speech laws in particular) is that those laws tend to be used against the usual targets.  For instance in the UK they proscribe groups for burning poppies:   On 10 November 2011 British Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group after it planned to repeat the poppy-burning demonstration; membership of Muslims Against Crusades became illegal at midnight.   And if you say innocuous (by Reddit standards) things like ""all soldiers should die and go to hell"", you get a criminal record. But I'm pretty sure you have to be Muslim to be arrested for saying things like that.  And since we're talking about France, they hold a huge march for freedom of speech (in honour of some white people who made racist cartoons). But as soon as a black person says something prejudiced ... arrest that guy!  So I look at curtailment of freedom of speech laws and I just see an extension of broken windows over-policing of communities of colour."

SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,tilia-cordata,3,Tue Feb 10 06:05:16 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with most of your point, but I hate when people bring up Dieudonne in conversations like this. He is incredibly, incredibly anti-Semetic - he's a Holocaust denier (which is a separate crime from hate speech in much of Europe), he popularized a reverse of the Nazi salute as a gesture, he's a friend and supporter of the leader of the extremely racist Front National political party, his whole act is to blame Jews for all the world's problems, and the ""joke"" he made on Facebook was about his identification with the attacker who killed 4 Jewish people in a supermarket, not with the people who attacked Charlie Hebdo. His whole rhetoric is unambiguously hate speech.   Is the law applied fairly? No, not at all. But is Dieudonne being unfairly persecuted? I really, really don't think so."
SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,Shablone,2,Tue Feb 10 13:16:50 2015 UTC,out of curiosity what is the reverse of a nazi salute  an image of a white supremacist throwing an arm out behind them and punching their buddy in the face comes to mind

SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,NXMRT,3,Wed Feb 11 03:36:56 2015 UTC,"Charlie Hebdo cartoons about Islam can't possibly be classified as hate speech.   It's the subtle difference between insulting a religion which is in turn insulting to people who belong to that religion, and insulting people for belonging to that religion."
SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,WhatTheHellDudette,0,Thu Feb 12 04:43:58 2015 UTC,I agree that insulting a religion is not the same as insulting people. But they draw Arabs with big noses and black people with big lips. So it's a pretty racist publication.

No... not at all. Are you familiar with their domestic policies? When they won a majority in the palestinian authority they enacted a lot of policies restricting the rights of women.   Israeli occupation, violence, and theft of resources is terrible, but Hamas isn't any better."
SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,Shadow_x_Banned,4,Tue Feb 10 06:12:22 2015 UTC,Are you familiar with their domestic policies?   Their domestic policies? That is a pretty flagrant derail. We are discussing how support for Hamas could potentially be categorised as hate speech (as a threat to Israeli civillians). I'm honestly a little stunned that I have to argue against in SRSD.
SRSDiscussion,2vdbfm,xanax_pineapple,2,Tue Feb 10 06:15:58 2015 UTC,"Defense mechanism. Why do bigots also seem so strangely intent on silencing, either through legal institutions (new laws) or informally (violence, threats, DDOS, etc.) anyone they dislike? It is because the value of ""freedumma speech"" is only valid when it protects their assaults."

If you said ""raisins are fine why can't they be in the salad, you can eat around them"" I'd say no way! Raisins are not fine! I don't want to have to eat around them just because a few people really enjoy raisins. It's weird. They don't belong in salads. It makes me uncomfortable. It's my salad, I should have the right to say raisins cannot be there!   While this is sort of annoying, it's not really wrong. I don't like raisins and if other people do, then they can have them on the side or something. Unless you are actively trying to empathetic to other people, I think it can be really hard to see them as more than something that is unpleasant and annoying. ""I don't want a trans person in my bathroom! It's made for people like me, I not people like him/her! It's weird! I don't like it! If other people do, whatever, make a different bathroom for them, but not the one for normal people like me!""  If they really thought about it, it would be about as big of a deal as it is to pick raisins off a salad. There isn't any solid argument other than that it seems a little weird or is just something you don't prefer. In fact, I can think of more valid reasons for why people should keep their damn raisins out of my salad than I can for trans people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their x/y chromosome.   TLDR: I think it's just emotional and they don't really care. If they thought about it too hard they would maaaaybe change their minds about some things, but if you don't know any trans, gay, black, etc people... Maybe you just don't see the point of forcing yourself to care or put in effort."
