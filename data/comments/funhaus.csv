funhaus,3e2sq6,cvbk,14,Tue Jul 21 19:52:07 2015 UTC,this was television worthy. Heres hoping that you get the pick!
funhaus,3e2sq6,Trick_Ranger,7,Tue Jul 21 15:27:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks bud, uploaded a 480p version for now, but the Final cut is gona be exported at 720p. I could also work with 1080p but need a better render farm ( yes I have a render farm)"
funhaus,3e2sq6,vk003200222,9,Tue Jul 21 15:34:58 2015 UTC,What kind of animals live on your render farm?
funhaus,3e2sq6,Black_Nerd,11,Tue Jul 21 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"Mostly insects. They hide and burrow until a critical moment then fuck shit up. Got to get the bug exterminator on the case!   Although an insect might not be technically an animal. If not then most likely bunch of monkeys, eventualy they will make something useful!"
funhaus,3e2sq6,Black_Nerd,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:06 2015 UTC,I do some 3d stuff here and there. I know how long that shit takes. (at least on a single mid-high ranged PC)
funhaus,3e2sq6,Darkdjrios,10,Tue Jul 21 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"To the Fun Haus team. I once asked if I could animate a spin-off series for your channel back at the old days on the channel that shall not be named!   Sorry that it has taken so long, but my previous youtube animation job prevented me working with 3rd parties (red tape sucks) Now that I am no longer affiliated, heres hoping that an awesome CG series could be started?"
funhaus,3e2sq6,Darkdjrios,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:29 2015 UTC,holy shit yes! Make this happen. I would gladly donate a couple bucks per episode or something. No idea how to compensate you but we would figure it out. Or possible you get hired by funhaus.
funhaus,3e2sq6,White_Limo,2,Tue Jul 21 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"I am honestly not after money, I just got a fairly sweet job in Germany. ( moving from UK) I am simply looking to work together if possible since i highly respect what you guys do, (been a fan since ""Skyrim with guns"" days) possibly get some beer/coffe money and at best amp up the render farm for some SWEET grafix. Just watch this space for the final episode, where everything is familiar Fun Haus, but digitally exaggerated!"
funhaus,3e2sq6,AlvaroBR,6,Tue Jul 21 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"How long did this take to render? You must have an absolute beast of a machine! Good job, man."
funhaus,3e2sq6,RohnJobert,6,Tue Jul 21 16:59:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   I do have a beast of a machine, but unfortunately with 3D rendering nothings ever enough. So I also use cloud rendering systems to render shots while I animate the next one.  So far all of what you saw, in 720p took 4 full days to render. Buddhist level patience here."
funhaus,3e2sq6,Skitspel,5,Tue Jul 21 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"Holy fuck, that just made me vomit in my mouth a bit. Serious dedication, good job bro. I was looking through your channel and you have some amazing work. Do you study animation or is it just a hobby? I've always wanted to get into it but I've never quite had the talent!"
funhaus,3e2sq6,Lawrence_8,3,Tue Jul 21 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"Ha, what a reaction. If you have as good as a bad-ass keyboard as I do, you would hold that stomach juice in no matter what!   Thanks mate, its an old portfolio channel so some stuff is REALLY old! I am a professional animator. Have always wanted to be one since I was 12. Through the thick and thin I always stuck to it even at times when I had barely anything to eat or sleep on.   I have, self taught, university and studio education in 3D animation. I know 3Ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D, Blender, After Effect, Premiere and a some other stuff.   If you like the power of creating literally ANYTHING that pops into  your head, dive into animation. The rush of bringing your vision to real life so other can see it is incredible! but it takes patience, lots and lots of patience and persistence."
funhaus,3e2sq6,Johntario,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:19 2015 UTC,you dont have a bunch of old computers to make a render farm with? :P
funhaus,3e2sq6,Butter_Jugs,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"I could do, but the electricity costs would be crazy. UK aint cheap. Also, I use a heavy AO rendering style which requires ray casting and blending, etc. So it would take a while. However I do use real servers out on the web, but traffic and other user can slow it down. I am looking into switching to Rebus Farm (https://gb.rebusfarm.net/en/?gclid=CJXPyY3k7MYCFYbItAodbxwGTA)"
funhaus,3e2sq6,NinetiesAlternative,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:31 2015 UTC,well when they say 3000 Xeon CPUs for rendering anybody would want to throw their money at them! :P I really love the style you went for.
funhaus,3e2sq6,NoodleCaptain,4,Tue Jul 21 18:01:23 2015 UTC,This is really good! Love the art style. I hope you're able to do more with this in the near future. Would really love to see this become a series.
funhaus,3e2sq6,superrope95,3,Tue Jul 21 15:57:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for that! Hearing this make me that more determined to produce it. Not one but several over a period of time.

funhaus,3e2sq6,ThatBritish,2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:06 2015 UTC,Have you considered making these actual felt puppets? They look super well designed and could be easily sewn.
funhaus,3e2sq6,Trick_Ranger,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"In my head they more resembled vinyl figures ( so there a possible toy/ action figure angle ;D ) a lot like these    https://dyn0.media.forbiddenplanet.com/products/2955162.jpg.square-true_maxheight-285_size-285.jpg   Felt in CG means a lot of texturing work, here my goal is to make an efficient streamlined series which could be animated in a week, rendered the next and then ready to go."

The subtle, more realistic movements occasionally transitioning to full-out puppet mode looks really awesome and is a really funny visual gag. I hope you do a lot more with that concept and I'm super stoked to see more! :)"
funhaus,3e2sq6,Wings_55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"Ah cheers for noticing that!   The style is aimed as sort of midway between awesomely smooth actions with a smearing of shitty/noisy hand-puppet like distortion. :D  There will be more, in fact i have been animating more unseen stuff for the past 4 days and am trying to animate now, but I keep getting distracted with this all of these awesome comments!"

funhaus,3e1iad,DeltaRaiden,26,Tue Jul 21 06:07:33 2015 UTC,"That's the same with me. Except for the number measurement they use for the size. I told the lady for short but spike hair.  She give me crap about about different numbers until she said 4 is short but not too short and for the side to be a a few centimeter shorter than the top. I just give her a blank look and went with it. Let's just say I was I few inches off from being a bald guy and when she kept saying if it was good I....just nodded and smiled...nodded and smiled as she cuts my hair. I went home and stared at the mirror looking at what she has done to me, only good thing was I didn't need a haircut for the next 3 months. And to this day I still have no idea to what the numbers mean and hope not to make the same mistake again."
funhaus,3e1iad,Amildmexappeared,32,Tue Jul 21 07:02:03 2015 UTC,Here are the general lengths specified by the different numbered length guards:    •   #1 – one-eighth of an inch   •   #2 – one-quarter of an inch   •   #3 – three-eighths of an inch   •   #4 – one-half of an inch   •   #7 – seven-eighths of an inch   •   #8 – one inch
funhaus,3e1iad,Sliver-Spy,3,Tue Jul 21 08:09:21 2015 UTC,I can tell that was described very well but I still have no good understanding and probably never will
funhaus,3e1iad,deliciousdave33,9,Tue Jul 21 09:04:39 2015 UTC,"n=n/8in  so if he got a 4, that's 4/8 inches or half an inch"
funhaus,3e1iad,bootyfaceguy,3,Tue Jul 21 09:54:06 2015 UTC,"It's a length. Just grab a ruler and take a look at how long you want your hair. Come back to that nifty guide in the comment, and ask for the number you want next time. From there, you can go up or down one depending on how it looks. Haircuts aren't hard, I've known the number that looks good on my for years just because they tell usually tell you the number they're using if they bring out the clippers (or if you ask).   It's kind of a simple thing to do and will cut down on your bad haircuts by a ton."
funhaus,3e1iad,dailyapple,9,Tue Jul 21 13:12:11 2015 UTC,That's why you find a barber who runs a small little shop with one chair. That man is guaranteed to know what he's doing and remember your cut.  Source: haven't told someone how to do my hair in 3 years.
funhaus,3e1iad,Gil_Demoono,2,Tue Jul 21 11:07:08 2015 UTC,"Nice artwork. I always get a nice laugh out of these quick comics.  I second that advice. I used to go to Supercuts all the time and wound up with messed up hair every time. I finally found a nice small Italian shop close to my house and have been going there for years now. A few times I've gone to fancier places as favors but, each time I walked away with barely a trim and a lot less cash in my pocket."
funhaus,3e1iad,vecman,2,Tue Jul 21 13:10:39 2015 UTC,"Basically for the hairstyle you wanted, which is what I have, you would want either 2 or 3 on the sides and back of the head, and scissors on the top to thin the hair, but leave enough to style. Also just the buzzer to get rid of sideburns, clean lines, and towards the neck."

funhaus,3dzzre,spiral6,100,Mon Jul 20 22:15:06 2015 UTC,i think they gel quite well with the demo disk gameplay.
funhaus,3dzzre,axell001,39,Mon Jul 20 23:48:20 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, if you cut flash games from Demo disk, Demo disk will be like...half the length, with a lot more of just sitting and staring! Plus the suggestions they come up with in demo disk from random conversation is great for flash games."
funhaus,3dzzre,Black_Nerd,4,Tue Jul 21 03:33:00 2015 UTC,yeah the demo disk needs something to fill the gaps so you cant really take the flash games out. so having another video with just flash games would be too much i think. flash games are great because you're not expecting much from them and you only need a minute to see what its about. Also the flash games dont get funnier the more you play. whereas with the demo i think they start pretty funny and they can get better.
funhaus,3dzzre,axell001,8,Tue Jul 21 07:39:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, I feel like the flash games are a great bonus to other shows and might not be strong enough to stand on its own although I do love them. Also considering they currently film the flash stuff whilst waiting for games to install, splitting aspects of a recording session up for seperate shows seems a little awkward and it would be hard to keep track of how much content you've created if you're recording two shows at the same time. This would probably also affect the flow of conversation and the callback references to jokes earlier in the episode."

funhaus,3dzzre,Trick_Ranger,4,Tue Jul 21 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's funny because they put in little bits in between the demo disk games (and steam roulette before they were FH) Some of the funniest moments of the show were those flash games, but if you just play flash games, it'd get boring in no time."

They don't want you to wait around for them to post or comment, they want their fans to contribute and build a community.  Or they are all busy fighting crime. Either way really."

I never even finished the game because I kept dying on the second-to-last level and my frustration got the best of me. Maybe I should dust off the game and try to beat it after all, if only to deal with my childhood rage quit trauma.  FYI, I'm not talking about the sexy flash game, in case you got the wrong idea."
