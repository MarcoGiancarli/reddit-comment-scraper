I talked to our HR person about a possible August opening and he said not to worry- he has a list of Kansas teachers willing to break their contracts to move to our district. In addition I've spoken with half a dozen parents moving to our area who are no longer looking in Kansas for housing. It's not unusual for parents to ""school shop"" when they move to our city and from what they're saying they think Kansas districts are on the decline. These are top Kansas districts losing both highly qualified teachers and highly desirable parents. A local TV station reported Kansas has 3,700 openings. To those who think for every teacher Kansas loses more will take their place don't understand there's a reason why those applicants don't have jobs. Half of all prospective teachers graduate in the bottom 50% of their class and those are the people applying for the openings created by experienced, talented teachers leaving.

education,3e29vz,savedabol,4,Tue Jul 21 12:07:50 2015 UTC,"Blackboard has been thrust into a rock and hard place situation. It's the culmination of years of advances in technologies and concepts but engineered in only a few breaths, all the while being a tool expected to be used in an infinite number of ways by people who probably shouldn't even touch a computer, let alone, design an online course for people who come from completely foreign paradigms of behaviors. The company itself has undergone numerous structural changes and every client it services has their own set of circumstances that often derail the overall implementations they pay gobs of cash to successfully incorporate into their institutions. Ultimately, and sadly, Blackboard is a minor example of how clustered Higher Education IT is when it comes to suffering from severe leadership issues, budget shortfalls, and lack of intensive scoping capabilities it so direly needs. It also acts as representation of how myopic most professors are when it comes to their use of this kind of technology. You would not believe the number of courses that exist where an instructor dumps a bunch of documents all over the Blackboard course only to force his or her students to go scour through all of them and call it learning...but the cherry on top of this shitty sundae is the passive endorsement of myopic learning: the education system, even without realizing it, is stringing along the Gypsy Moth mentality by advocating the fewest clicks possible and calling that learning... As if learning is nothing more than a goddamned Facebook status update.  Reading articles like this only goes to show how ill-conceived great ideas are after they've been ramrodded by toxic groups of people. Conceptually, Blackboard could be argued to be a godsend considering everything it can do.

However, if you really mean that I shouldn't speak up about bad features of a system, or try to change the meta-system that reduces my choice of systems, or that the people who make and perpetuate this system have no responsibility for what it looks like... then I think we need to agree to disagree.   what have you done to fix your issues?   For one thing, I went to a different institution, where they don't have a Bb contract. I was also active for a few months on Bb's online whatever-it-was (some kind of online Bb community/focus-group thingy? I probably have my login info on my HDD somewhere). That seemed to go nowhere. I sent several (meaning ""several dozen"") emails to my university's learning platform coordinator, the official contact point for faculty with Bb. I sent several emails to Bb's ""contact us"" online webform (which was all I could find for customer service at the time). And I ranted on my blog. Overall, I got little or no response from Bb's central help people (I recall I was told to contact my campus rep once or twice), little help from the well-meaning campus rep (who must have had a copy-paste text file on his desktop with his polite explanation that he had contacted Bb and/or had seen this issue before, and nothing could be done), and for most of my questions and concerns the online forums had posts from other frustrated faculty with similar issues, even more frustrated because Bb didn't respond. The blog ranting got a response, but the response was a (very cheerful and nicely delivered) ""sorry, we really can't do anything about any of those problems.""  So yeah, jumping at someone because of your assumptions about them is poor online form, now that you mention it.  You're also doing something that's both annoying and a bit (rhetorically) undherhanded: by asking/demanding whether I've done a long list of things I might do, your implication is that I shouldn't complain in any way not authorized by the corporation unless I've already followed all your suggestions (and I assume you'd have recommendations for exactly how to do them, too). That's not always reasonable, and that strategy is usually a screen for deflecting criticism (""You can't comment on any problems until you've done everything possible to fix them yourself!""). It's also not capitalist, which Bb really, seriously is. It's a corporation. It doesn't get to make a bunch of rules beyond market rules for my behavior vis-a-vis its product. Neither do you.   Any company privy to something they know their clients will like or want will do what they can to add it to their product    No, or else nobody would complain about Comcast customer service.   as that instigates return on investment.    Sometimes. Companies often follow different strategies for maximizing ROI. It's either frustrating or refreshingly innocent that your first response to a criticism of a corporation is to assume that the person complaining about the product must be in the wrong, and to assert that the product surely would have been improved if only the company had heard the complaint.  A business corporation is a shark. It's a self-feeding, self-replicating organism. It is 100% psychopathic, without empathy or morals. The employees (including leaders) are almost always not like this, but they are not the company. The company, as an organism, lives or dies based on ROI or profit or the bottom line or whatever you call it. There is a strong economic environment to ensure that this is the case. Individuals might make decisions based on morality or concern, but those decisions are almost always smoothed away, over time,  by the company's need to remain profitable. I do not believe in 'good' companies, because I think the concept makes no sense in a standard contemporary capitalist economy.  Therefore, the apparent suggestion that I have some kind of responsibility to a company beyond simply paying for my products is, to me, silly. The company will certainly not recognize any responsibility it has toward me, either.  Bb's product is getting better (from what I've heard; I don't use it anymore), but for several years it was profoundly broken in various ways, and the company clearly made decisions to break it further or to leave broken aspects in place, despite many pages of frustrated user comments about the broken issues over several years. The company did not do this because it is bad; it did this because someone concluded that this was more profitable than fixing things. Since many of these things had become standard in online apps in the post-web 2.0 world, this behavior was clearly not due to the mind-boggling difficulty of the tasks. They just didn't have to do it (because their competition and market share pattern was such that they experienced relatively little real competition--including buying all their competitors), so they didn't do it."

The marketplace is structured so that these effective monopolies can be created. Companies have learned how to sell long-term, high-commitment rent contacts to universities. Fear of losing the time, money, and effort of the I.T. team and faculty deters any real switching to another platform, as does fear of annoying students who just figured this one out. The thought of having multiple options available on a campus (which I favor) is also frustrating for students, and is aggressively resisted by companies like Blackboard, who would suddenly have to start innovating again.  I loathe Blackboard. It's actually not a terrible product, but I loathe it for its trajectory rather than its position. BB Learn basically killed much of the functionality of the previous iterations (which had their own problems, but more functionality in key areas), all while causing an unknown number of cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. I griped about its limitations and idiocy so much on my blog that some Blackboard reps contacted me to see if they could help (they couldn't, but they invited me to spend some of my time volunteering to improve the product--maybe--by providing help to other people on their online systemthingy. I didn't). I want the company to experience serious, existential terror. Until that happens, no reassurance by a CEO is going to convince me they'll suddenly become a great product.  I really think some back-end and UI standards for learning platforms could help. I'm sure BB would fight them tooth and nail, but it seems like one of the few things that might level the playing field.

I realize I know little about software standards, but I assume that the standardization of website elements and open document standards could provide a model of how to do this. MS, Google, Facebook, and about a thousand other companies have really settled on some common and predictable (not to mention usually ergonomic and low-learning-curve) user interface options, for example. A lot of thought and evolution goes into where the ""X"" is to close a window, what happens when you have clicked on something then hit Tab, where on a page certain useful content is displayed, etc. I assume there are Smart People who know lots about online learning platforms who could, if sufficiently motivated, begin to hammer out some UI specifications that would be respected by all the LMS players. Including standardized keyboard shortcuts. Oh please, keyboard shortcuts.   LMSs always have a core of very similar functions: gradebook, quizzes, assignments, etc. Those really need a consistent, well-thought-out, and intuitive set of rules to govern how they work (at least to the user, and possibly even to the tech team who has to set them up and keep them going).  To some extent this is already happening, but beyond the simple UI, the back end is where I get lost. My vague understanding is that this kind of thing happens with open document and web standards, but I don't know how it happens. I imagine that the people who build and implement LMSs would be the ones who would understand all the dimensions.   Naturally, like Microsoft, I assume Bb would resist this, because standards inherently reduce freedom. And in Bb's case (just like MS in the 90s), it would reduce the ability of a large corporation to leverage its market share for profitability. That is, Bb keeps its contracts partly because the quirks of its system relative to other systems make switching systems a huge pain. Standards would make it easier to switch systems, so Bb would be crazy to embrace them.  Which is why they would need to be encouraged to do so with the right kinds of incentives. Like a law, or a bunch of universities partnering with Moodle and refusing to even meet with sales reps from companies that don't toe the standards line.   OK, the law seems more realistic. Honestly, I'm not optimistic about this."

education,3dyd2g,wealy,12,Mon Jul 20 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"Here in California, we code unfair help for charter schools into state law, despite research showing charter schools in our state perform no better than the traditional schools they're pushing into closure.  One of the most obvious is an annual state-produced list of the worst performing schools, with families at those schools given permission to transfer elsewhere without local district approval. Charter schools are exempt from appearing on the list no matter how badly they fail.  And as routine, you can freely transfer out of your district without approval if you are going to a charter school. If you're transferring to a traditional school, you have to file a request, which usually then requires an appeal, with your local school board.  Most of the charter schools in my county have their charter established through the same remote one-school district that is sometimes more than 100 miles from where the charter school opens. Basically, charter schools invaded our county without a say-so from local school districts... which rightly are repulsed by this failed reform that does little more than spread students too thin and force consolidation and closure of traditional schools."

You're comparing one teacher to another based on different students.  I'm sure we can all attest to that fact that each year is different.  Last year, I had three students out of 30 with an IEP.  This upcoming class has 10.  So if I had left and another teacher had come in and their scores were lower than my scores this year, then they would be deemed ineffective.    That's ludicrous.

What about a teacher who doesn't bring up test scores, but inspires a lifelong love of learning?  By the time the results are in it's too late do do anything about it, or so it would seem.

Estimates of teachers’ effectiveness are more stable from year to year when they combine classroom observations, student surveys, and measures of student achievement gains than when they are based solely on the latter.

If the quality of the X your produce is the one and only measure of how good you are as an ""X-er"", then yes, you're correct, university education is outmoded and obsolete.  However, if there's anything more to being a professional ""X-er"" than ""doing X well"", then online courses are by the large not going to get you there. You'll find yourself at a disadvantage vs. other applicants who not ""do X well"", but also ""understand the fundamentals of X"" and ""do X well along with and among other X-ers"".  This last part is often undervalued. It's been shown time and again in many different fields that socialization into a community of X-ers is at least as important as learning to X. So knowing the rules, the lingo, the daily routines, the collaborative aspects, the standards for good X'ing, etc., are all things that go into being a professional X-er that no online course can honestly teach you.  That's by and large why universities still exist. Professors explore the fundamental aspects of X-ing that every X-er should know, and thus socialize novices into a discipline, and then these novices go into their apprenticeships (internships or entry-level positions) and learn the rest by doing, collaborating, and imitating. This is what we've been doing for thousands of years, with every X you can think of: doctors, lawyers, midwives and tailors, sailors and football players.   Division of labor, the basic social organizing principle that makes civilization possible, depends on this mechanism of cycling knowledge of X from practicing X-ing into novice X-ers.

If they are, then all of this makes sense.  Maybe we could streamline the testing process so kids don't spend as much of their school time on test taking and prep.  But ultimately, the tests give valuable data and have been a kick in the butt for schools who have had huge achievement gaps.  But if not, then the focus on testing and optimizing test scores is disproportionately hurting low income students.  They attend the schools where everyone is now asking why test scores aren't rising.  More affluent kids are getting a an education in diverse skills, arts, critical thinking and problem solving, project-based learning, etc.  But disadvantaged schools don't have time for that, because it's not the most efficient way to raise test scores.  The best way to raise test scores is to practice testing skills, memorize common question types, and recognize the kinds of answers that echo ideas from grade level standards.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of civil rights groups aren't really thinking about the question of whether standardized tests are setting the right goal at all.

Definitely not saying academics should be ignored, but when the test prep gets in the way of building a positive relationship with your school and teacher, the test only serves to make the neediest kids hate coming to school.

The achievement gap does not exist because the people working in low income schools are inferior to those working at high income schools.    The achievement gap exists because of poverty and home life.

education,3dpw4l,adamwho,5,Sat Jul 18 13:06:17 2015 UTC,"I see this sentiment frequently in schools.  The kids I interact with are very good at navigating the web and utilizing social media. They have a very limited understanding of application interfaces, digital etiquette, computing fundamentals, standards, file management, safety, and many other skills deemed necessary by ISTE and other organizations.

This is just a sales line urging schools to chase the taillights of the tech industry and to waste a lot of money on new tech toys to ""revolutionize education.""  Tech companies love using this line as it results not only in a never-fulfilled promise of better schools, but in lots and lots of sales to clueless schools who are then distracted from their primary mission and who cannot afford to implement, retrain and support the new technology.  As soon as the next/new superintendent or technology director comes in, the projects are then scrapped and the cycle of buying the ""next new high tech system to revolutionize education"" starts all over again.  Edit: And what is the source of the ""study"" that reported these ""shocking"" findings? Some teacher working on their dissertation or doing a thesis project for their master's degree?

Teachers receive no support from administrators on discipline issues- In our ravenous quest for more and more data, one of the worst things that has occurred was the decision to measure a school's safety by its numbers of incidents, referrals, and suspensions. It was a natural progression for administrators, both at upper and lower levels, to find ways to game the system and avoid climbing statistics. In some schools, this has been done by encouraging teachers to handle every kind of situation in their classrooms and not involve the principal's office. Teachers receive the message that they are the ones who will suffer if students are given referrals. Because of that, behavior that would have been met with an instant office referral only a few years ago, is allowed to continue in the classroom and creates even more distractions for teachers and students.""  This one hits home the hardest. It's something that's commonly known by teachers and administration, and probably most of the public too.   That one video series about the ""behavior"" school recently posted? Where all the kids are EBD? Chair-throwing, swearing, fighting, drugs, assault, etc.? Yeah, those are the kinds of kids that are in our ""failing"" public schools. Not in that concentration, of course, but really--can you imagine even handling a few mixed in with 15 other students? Well, that's what teachers are being told to do: deal with it. And with diminishing support. They're out, they ""talk it out"", and they're back in the classroom not 10 minutes later.  This came off as venting more than I intended. But it's seriously frustrating. Even in the age of data, excessive testing, evaluation programs--this is the one that is by far the most egregious.  ""Yes, these particular kids will actively show physical and verbal aggression to all those around them regardless of age of peer status. Yes, we will come to get them for a few minutes and send them back in (that is, if we're not dealing with another problem at the moment--if so, you're on your own). Yes, you are failing if you are not engaging these particular students. Yes, you are not doing enough if you are not reaching these particular students. Yes, you need to do more.   And please stop calling the office for help.""  Seriously, nation. Help us do something about this. I think the only real way to get the message across is for every parent to call their local district and say ""please stop putting students with severe behavior problems and mental health issues into our classrooms"". They belong somewhere where they can get mental health services, which no one in a school, save for a single psychologist (or two, if the school is large), can legally provide.   I'm a teacher. I didn't earn a doctorate in psychology, and I don't plan to. Stop asking me to provide mental health services. I'm not qualified to provide mental health services.  /rant"

I teach in a district that ticks every one of the failing district boxes, and parents here are given entirely too much power. They bully teachers and administrators to get what they want, they never hesitate to tell us teachers how to do our jobs, they fight us on everything from due dates to tenths of a point on grades. I once had a parent of a SPED student threaten me with due process because I wouldn't take his kid's late homework (I was not in violation of the IEP, but I was told to ""just take the work so he'll shut up""). It all stems from SAO's attitude of ""give them what they want so they'll go away,"" which, from what I've heard from teachers in similar districts to mine, is not an uncommon attitude.   On the one hand, yes. Parent involvement does make for better schools. On the other hand, do I want parents in my district to know that we're discouraged from writing referrals for behavior issues or that there are a lot of inexperienced teachers here? Not so much. In a good district, this knowledge can empower parents to be more active and work to make the district better. In a failing district, I'd be afraid they'd use the knowledge to take advantage of teachers."

I EPs are legally binding documents so if we dont provide everything it is a breech of contract.  Often it is the little things that the school doesn't always provide. They will provide the big things, like ipad devices for communication or mobility chairs, but not little things like sensory toys and different types of cups. For example, last year I ran out of colored printer ink in March. We were told there might be more coming. But I got a new student in April who needed a communication book and it was clearly written that the pictures had to be in color ink on his IEP (which i did not write).  I asked around if I could use another teacher's printer but everybody was rationing at the time. So had to get my own printer ink to do it.   Also, if you don't have tenure you would never dream of just not providing extra stuff. Which sucks because that is when you have the least money. You are an at will employee for those 3 years (in MA) and can be let go without a reason at the end of your year long contract.

Coloured fabric on the walls, fairly lights, coloured rugs, cushions with ""dream"" or ""imagine""  add little to nothing to real learning.  There have been studies into decorating classrooms that have found that overdecorated rooms distract students and impact their learning.  Have a look at classrooms around the world in photo galleries like this and this, and you will see that in most countries around the world students manage to learn without superfluous crap stuck on the walls and hanging from the ceilings.  The article is right it is mirage, even an illusion, it gives the impression that your child is attending a space where they will learn amazing things in amazing ways, but it is smoke and mirrors and what is it covering?

Well halfway through the year, the teacher decided to return and the school administrators gave my coworker the boot. TFA didn't have another placement for her, so instead she volunteered her time to paperwork, recruitment, and trainings.  She continued this beyond the typical 2 year requirement, only to be told one day that alum only count if you did 2 years of teaching. They removed her from alum lists and asked her to stop attending events.  Imagine the emotional toll that took. She dedicated years to a cause she truly believed in only to be told her time and skills weren't good enough.

Teaching in under served communities is beyond challenging. Compound that with learning Special Education law and you are in way over your head. My problem is with the fact that so many corps members that go public put all of their blame on TFA.

The threat from the district is we could lose funding, but as an affluent district we don't receive any of those funds. The threat was also that we could be labelled as in need of improvement and have to do extra testing. Good luck telling wealthy parents in a district where 75% of the kids pass (about 30% statewide) that.  If, in the end, there are no consequences I fully expect even more kids to opt out next year.  NYS tests provide very little information to teachers or parents. The only argument I have heard from a parent in favor is that it helps you see where your kid stands compared to others. In other words, how do I know my kid is better than others without the test. As a teacher we get vague information which proves meaningful at all, and certainly no more helpful than notes from prior teachers.  The change away from Pearson might help as the tests might actually be well created and the new company has already said they will provide practice materials.

education,3djt80,tee2green,7,Fri Jul 17 00:26:18 2015 UTC,Education reliably rates as one of the issues people say the care about most. In a purple state it could easily be chosen as a political football that the two sides use to attack each other. That would make for very unstable policy.
education,3djt80,Dodgson_here,4,Fri Jul 17 00:58:59 2015 UTC,And can you explain why more state power is better for a blue state and won't change things in a red state?  EDIT: Is it because Dems want to repeal NCLB and Reps want to just keep it in place?
education,3djt80,tee2green,3,Fri Jul 17 02:10:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry my hypothesis was for the purple state part. Education reform doesn't break down so simply across party lines. Conservatives tend to prefer state and local control of education over education on a philosophical basis. This is why far right conservatives tend to despise common core. This doesn't mean they would side with teachers unions as they would prefer that those unions not exist. These same politicians also see most bureaucracy as a source of waste and would prefer private enterprise and personal choice drive educational reform through charters and vouchers  Many democratic politicians are also feuding with teachers unions over reforms as they would prefer reforms to be far reaching and come from the top down.  These democrats push for more STEM, national curriculums, and teacher evaluations dependant on test scores.  I prefer evidence based changed that comes from within the profession and not subject to the whims of what polls well this week or who is lining the pockets of a Senate committee chair.  I believe that unions improve educational quality, that tenure is necessary for teachers to act on professional opinions, and that real reform will come only when those with the knowledge to create good policy have the authority to implement it."

education,3djt80,bookchaser,6,Fri Jul 17 01:34:07 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell:  The good: weaker requirements that assessments of schools be based on standardized tests.  The tests must be given, but flexibility is allowed in how different measures are weighed to determine ratings.  It's possible this could be a really good thing in states where the testing backlash is getting traction.  Also provides some additional funding for interventions in low performing schools, and schools with large numbers of English language learners.  The bad: more of worship of charter schools, and more grant programs for them.  No one expected this Congress to make an effort to restore neighborhood public schools, and they didn't.  Also, the bill weakens protections that were designed to prevent states from just using federal funds to decrease state education spending.  So places like Kansas might see even further cuts to education budgets as they get more flexibility to lean heavily on federal grants."

I'm sure there are good charter schools, but giving a tiny group control of education with no public accountability is absurd.   At a charter my friend works at, students who transfer back to public receive double credits and can graduate early despite taking the same courses as students who attended public school the whole time.

IMO secondary teachers should have an undergraduate degree in their content area and only begin fusing that with pedagogy at the Masters level. Really, I think all teachers should be required to have an MA, perhaps substituting developmental psychology for a specific content area as an undergrad pre-requisite for Elementary teachers.

All of the professions with a ""bar"" like exam also require graduate school (law, medicine), while teaching doesn't in most states.  I don't have faith that our current undergraduate programs prepare teachers to actually pass a more rigorous gatekeeper than is currently in place.  As to the good, motivated people - every state has an alternative certification program.  Heck in Montana you can get a 3 year temporary license almost trivially as long as you have a related degree.

State funding and local funding. The state funding is not based on property taxes. The state funding formula is based on poverty level and number of students.  Because my district is high poverty we have very low local property taxes. So the new budget finally addresses the issue of poor communities not able to fund their own schools.  My district has been one of the highest funded per student in the state. We also have 100% free lunches. I agree with you about everything you believe in.

In my view, No Child Left Behind ignores several important factors in a student's academic performance, specifically the impact of poverty, access to adequate health care, mental health, nutrition, and a wide variety of supports that children in poverty should have access to. By placing so much emphasis on standardized testing, No Child Left Behind ignores many of the skills and qualities that are vitally important in our 21st century economy, like problem solving, critical thinking, and teamwork, in favor of test preparation that provides no benefit to students after they leave school.   Compare to Hillary's answer:   When the No Child Left Behind Act was enacted, I viewed it as a historic promise between the federal government and educators. I hoped that it would lead to a greater sense of shared responsibility for our schools' success.

What becomes our standard for who to name things after and what to memorialize?  The author admits Lee was a pretty stand up guy and a model Southern gentleman. But he was a racist and more importantly an insurrectionist.  Mant of our founding fathers were British officers before turning their back on their king. Texas celebrates figures like Austin Houston and Travis. FDR interned the Japanese.  But all these people did some pretty cool things too. Do we just push this all aside?  It's hard and probably unfair to hold historical figures to todays moral standards. Its a problematic way to view history.  I think its probably more fair to think about how a figure confronted the issues of his/her time and what lessons or inspiration can we draw from that.  Lee was a man who believed in honor and integrity.  He graduated west point with an immaculate record.

Hoping the Senator will act during a special session and vote to repeal the governor's veto of the bill. David Johnson is one of 23 senators the teacher emailed, and here is the response from David, according to the article:   “Good to hear your view,” Johnson began in his response. “But apparently you lack the courage to tell us where you are from and where you teach. BTW, the session extended by the Democrats unnecessarily cost me that same $2,000. My money, not taxpayers’. ”  “Quit whining,” the email concluded. “Kind but skeptical regards, David Johnson.”   What a terrible way to conduct yourself as a representative of your state government.

It lists a bunch of statistics implying not just correlation, but causation with the subject matter. It then devotes like 85% of the article to an appeal to emotion by following one poor family that struggled with evaluating the different school options. And may I point out, he received his first choice; which undercuts the earlier point of ""the poor simply cannot get their first choices because the middle class have all the advantages"". So because he and his mom apparently simply neglected to even look at where the schools are located, this is a condemnation on school choice!?!  ""But they didn't understand and picked the wrong school!"" Ok, fair enough. So they then appealed the selection (which, again, was their first choice to begin with) and they were able to find and be placed in a school that seems like it will work out better for them. But instead of praising the outcome, the article, however, plays this off like some kind of ""Oh and by the way, they got lucky"" ending.   If anything, this seems like a success story for the school choice process!  Given, it's a relatively new bureaucratic process that I am sure is confusing and frequently unfair, but this article takes a positive result and by adding all sorts of completely unrelated ""poor"" backstory and ""stressful"" context, tries to cast it as a huge negative.   But the icing on the cake:     But such a choice can be a burden, even a danger, when children and parents don’t know how to judge their options   Good god ...

Given that the students are not given choice leading up to high school, you already have a class system within the elementary and middle schools, so some kids start with more advantage.  The choice only comes at the high school level and it's an application system like applying for college.  Students can go where they want if they qualify and of course the better high schools get most of their students from the better middle schools.  The system promotes upward mobility for a small percentage of students while keeping the majority right where they are."

It is hard to think outside the box on this topic because the box is pretty hard-wired into most of us. I'm open-minded enough I suppose, but I still have little conscious inclination to distinguish between sex and gender. I use the terms interchangeably like many people.  The movement to make gender non-binary is valid, just as valid as the movement to make marriage gender-neutral. The problem here is that the solution proposed is patently stupid. ""Boys and girls"" as an address has a long history of innocent usage and is rooted in the physical sexual reality of 99.9% of people who are born as either biological men or women. It's true that it implies that sexual identity can only be binary, which is pretty arguably wrong, but it's clueless to outlaw the phrase in favor of one that means nothing at all.  At one point in time, it was perfectly acceptable to make the following assumptions:     Homosexuality is a mental illness. Americans are Christians. Men only marry women. There are only two genders.   Policing language is vilified as out-of-control political correctness, but it does have its place and it does work over time in conjunction with broader changes in social mores. My parents were decent people, but when I think about the assumptions that went unquestioned by their generation, it makes me appreciate the fact that some speech they were perfectly ok with is verboten today.

You have a commanders in chief of the United states that have never served in the armed forces, Secretaries of Agriculture that have never been farmers.    Arguing that a politician can't handle a portfolio because they have never done a base level job in that field is a substantially flawed argument.

education,3cpvgc,Funkyjhero,6,Fri Jul 10 03:29:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I think the general thought is that most administrators  should have experience being teachers since that's who they are in charge of evaluating, managing, assisting, hiring, etc. That being said, creating policy for the entire American Public school system is a completely different environment than teaching and I agree that the position doesn't require former experience as a teacher.  Furthermore, the guy was magna cum laude in sociology from Harvard and took a year to write his dissertation on ""The values, aspirations and opportunities of the urban underclass"" (Source).

To me, a successful administrator is about creating a positive culture, getting buy-in on endeavors/projects, addressing problems holistically, etc. Clearly there will be overlap in things like communication and organization,  but I just don't think an administrator needs to have been a teacher in order to be successful.  I know a great many business managers who do not have the technical skills to actually perform the duties their subordinates do, but they know how to positively encourage those workers and how to keep as many distractions and problems from getting in their way. They are wonderful managers.   Now clearly a good administrator with a teaching background could make him/her even better, and lack of this experience could cause them to be horrific, but to me personally, an intelligent administrator can be successful without having been a teacher."

Not only has he been a complete idiot with his handling of Standards based testing and the Common Core, he was sitting on his hands while for-profit colleges have been screwing over gullible Americans.   It also betrays an attitude that (unfortunately) is in line with most of America. That is, we say we value education; we don't. We value the military. It feels very nice to say how important education is, but the average American family either can't or won't support their children in the same way as (for instance) traditional Confucian-style Asian parents do.  Think about this: do you honestly think Americans would sit still if an American president appointed a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that had never served in the military? And you're right--good teachers don't necessarily make good managers. However, am I supposed to believe that there isn't a single qualified individual for his job that has actually worked up the ranks? My own superintendent has not only a Phd in Education, but has worked his way up the ranks from a classroom teacher. He raised lead us while we raised test scores every year, and was able to help us get through the Great Recession without a single layoff by (this is shocking, I know) working with the teachers union.   Being a teacher is a great help in leading in education. It means you truly understand how the rosy picture of new legislation actually looks like when the reality filters down into the classroom. That experience in precious, and Arne Duncan is clueless about it.  Try this, too: we haven't had a Secretary of Education with actual classroom experience since the very first one (appointed by Jimmy Carter). What does that tell you about how important Duncan's job is?"

Think about this: do you honestly think Americans would sit still if an American president appointed a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that had never served in the military?   No that is impossible by the very nature of that job.  But as Arne Duncan worked in Education?  I think you'll find that he has.  Look at the heads of any branch of the military, you will find many if not most of them entered service as commissioned officers, not as enlisted soldiers.  This is very similar to being an administrator and soliders understand that commisioned officers have the knowledge and skill to lead without having risen from the bottom.  If there hasn't been a Secretary of Education who has been a teacher since the first one, it seems a little unfair to insinuate that Obama is the first president to appoint a non-teacher."

There is a quantitative, objective difference between what I believe and what you do.   The Secretary of Education is the leader of the federal government's organization for supporting schools. You're apparently okay with over thirty years of political appointees with zero public school experience carrying out that mission.  Try applying your standard to other professions; ones that Americans actually take seriously. As I've pointed out, there's a completely different attitude regarding our attitude (obsession, I believe) regarding the military. Who was the last head of the American Bar Association that didn't have a law degree? How about Attorney General? How many army commanders have not served? How many heads of the American Medical Association have not been doctors?  My own district was formerly headed by a policy wonk, public sector idiot who not only screwed over our finances, but alienated teachers to the point that our union sent a letter of no support and was talking of striking. He made bad decisions that contrasted sharply with what experience teachers knew would work in the classroom. Arne Duncan does the same. He is not a leader, but a follower of popular trends in education. As I pointed out earlier, he was sleeping behind the wheel in regards to what was happening with student loans and for-profit colleges. Somebody in tune with what's happening in education should have seen this years before.   Colin Powell, despite his being suckered into supporting the Iraq War, had combat experience in Vietnam. From that experience he was able to push policy towards what was one of his strongest principles: that American troops cannot be put at risk until a mission is not only feasible, but well defined. In other words, there has to be a tangible goal that our forces can achieve so that they can define when it's over and they can get out.  Arne Duncan is completely clueless about 'boots on the ground' ideas like that. Instead of letting teachers and experience administrators guide the standards and their execution, he's let private interests guide him. How is that a problem? Let me give you one specific example, in this case regarding the Common Core:  The tests are all on computer. As a teacher, I knew that this was a huge mistake. I knew that it would force schools all over the nation to invest millions (billions, when you add it up) in new computers, extra bandwidth, and additional classes to shore up their students' keyboarding skills. By making the tests computer-based, teachers quickly realized that any student who could type effectively would have a significantly easier time writing their answers.   So, are schools now doubling down on typing curriculum because they're guided by the idea of creating 21st Century learners, or because they can't afford to get dinged on their test scores?   An experienced, professional educator would to better."

I understand that, but to say your standards are higher is arrogant.   You're apparently okay with over thirty years of political appointees with zero public school experience carrying out that mission.   You are ignoring some pretty significant facts, Duncan was in charge of Chicgao public schools for 8 years, that isn't exactly zero experience is it?  There is little point comparing other professions, either of us can use other precedents to make a case either way.  Ie Who should be in charge of air traffic control at an airport, an experienced pilot or an air traffic controller who has never flown a plane?  Who should be in charge of a airliner, an air traffic controller with 30 years experience or a pilot?   Colin Powell is not a good example for your argument.  The image of a combat veteran is myth that was sold to the American public so he could sell ideas to them.  He served as an adviser in Vietnam, went on one combat assignment and was responsible for burning down people's homes.  His actions regarding Iraq and non existent WMDs is a good indication of his status as a puppet rather than a leader.  Why do you think he has stayed out of politics? His past won't stack up to public scrutiny, that's why.  Look I'm not saying Duncan is doing a great, good or even acceptable job, but arguing he doesn't have the credentials, qualifications of experience is a very superficial argument.  "" Duncan has never taught"" might look good on a placard at a protest, but doesn't add much to the debate.  I've seen plenty of teachers squander opportunities and  mismanage schools because they have no managerial experience.  I also live in a state that has nearly been bankrupted by an ex teacher as state leader.    An experienced, professional educator would do better? Could do better is more accurate. They could also do a lot worse, have you ever met a good teacher who does things differently than you?  I know teachers who use techniques or philosophies that work terrifically for them, but would be a disaster for me.  Now imagine that on a national level.  No different to the debates around common core or standardised testing.  If you elect an ex elementary math teacher from a rough neighbourhood their decisions are not going to well respected by secondary English teachers in affluent schools?

Through the elimination of the welfare trap thanks to basic income, this would mean that anyone choosing not to work -- instead opting to just live off their basic incomes -- would be earning less than everyone choosing to work for additional income. This could not only decrease unemployment and increase productivity, but simultaneously fix the situation we have right now, where it's possible for the unemployed to actually earn more in equivalent benefits than the cash incomes of those who are employed.  Plus, the very ability of people to not need a job, makes it that much harder for employers to exploit employees with insufficient wages and poor working conditions. The ability to actually say ""No"", means the empowerment of labor on an individual level -- no unions required.  Simply put, basic income makes work actually pay.    Source"

Are graduation rates in NV and the South low because schools are not preparing students to be able to pass high school or do those communities just not value education highly?   From what I have seen in rural NV, many female students drop out because of teen pregnancy due to a lack of sex ed/ women's health care. Also, many male students drop out because they see uneducated miners making great money and see no reason to get an education.  It would be interesting to see this data side by side with teen pregnancy rates. I have heard that the south has high teen pregnancy, which would almost certainly reduce high school graduation rates."

It can be hard to get kids to care about graduating when they see jobs working at bars, clubs, etc.  When a student leaves a district they are counted against the district graduation rate (counted as a non graduate) which drags down the reported graduation rate lower than the real graduation rate.

Why this certainly does exist in small pockets of the population, the same couldnbe said for pedophiles and rapists who think it is ok to continue their behavior. In essence all this hullabaloo is over a very tiny segment of population, and frankly I don't care what flags fly over a state capitol as long as it has something to do with history. I think the Whitehouse rainbow lights were offensive for some people, and as I said nobody is going to change people.

The civil war was all about slavery and indeed the Southern States were actually against states rights, in particular the Northern States rights not to return fugitive slaves.  What amazes me is the proof of this  is all around, just look at South Carolina's Declaration of the Immediate Causes   The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them.    Quite clearly S. Carolina objects to the mentioned states enacting their own laws. Where is the mention of Northern States Rights?   The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress   Quite clear that slavery is a key point here.   The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor.    And here.   We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States.   And here.   Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.    And here.   A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.   It really is quite clear and it was written by the seceding States.  Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union"

When I want a deeper small group interaction, I make sure the whole class has done a similar activity and can do it with little to no assistance from me.  I might do a quick check-in (circulating the room to see that groups are beginning and on task).  Then I'll hunker down for the duration (or split it equally between two groups).  If I do this, it is always with a group I know I need to focus on (they struggle with group work, they are all low skilled, they are all advanced and need to go to the next level, they haven't had much teacher time, they are all extremely shy, there is a student who always takes the spotlight and needs to learn to share stage time, etc.)."

So the short of it is I would like to go the school to learn all the information I can bout the sciences and fact check/creative brainstorm about everything we learn and make this my daily life for at least 4 years.

You can knock out general education courses and remedial courses for relatively little money, and you can get letters of recommendation from community college professors. You shouldn't spend huge amounts of money on your education until you have a goal in mind for what you will do after you graduate. Like a career you want to get into. You don't want to spend four years only to end up with a degree that doesn't help you in the job market."
education,3c6njx,eeo11,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:14:57 2015 UTC,Do you have the money for this? The reason I suggest waiting is because you can spend thousands of dollars on a degree that won't get you ahead in any way and won't be worth the cost in the end.

Have you looked into what schools you would apply to? It seems like you're looking for a higher educational experience where you can immerse yourself in learning, so I would make sure to speak to recent alumni from different places who can give you an idea of what the classes are like at their respective schools. Large lecture halls rarely allow for this intimate level of discussion, so I would aim for a smaller school. Also, with a bachelors, you will have to take general education courses in subjects that might not be very interesting and it could feel like high school all over again (it definitely will at times). Once you narrow down the schools you'd be interested in, make an appointment with a dean so you can introduce yourself an ask questions about the program and the application process. This is where you can mention your HS transcripts and see if they have any advice for how you can stand out regardless of that. It is possible. I just got accepted to a highly competitive masters program after making up for many semesters of failures when I first went to college. Just make sure you have a solid plan for how you will live and take care of yourself while you go to school and a solid plan for what you will do when you get out."

As a college professor, I can tell you that we love to have students like you.  Don't worry that your transcripts are a decade old, it's not like you wasted that time.  Consider it from the perspective of college admissions team.  The first question is: are you prepared, academically and psychologically, for the program?  Your transcripts and your SATs are used to see if you have the academic background, supplemented by your reference letters.  The second question is, are you a good fit for the college?  That's where your personal essay is essential, though again your references are important.  Recommendation don't have to be from teachers or academics.  In your case, it would make more sense to come from your work (your boss or project manager, for example) and from your superior officer in the military.

You can ask them simple questions such as (always remember to ask WHY so you can get them speaking more):  What age is a good age to be married?   What makes a good husband/boyfriend?  What makes a good wife/girlfriend?  How many children is a good amount?   What are good jobs for men/women?   Is it safe for men/women in (insert area/environment)?

However,  isn't that true of many people in this country.   It sucks, but if you're poor you may have to make more sacrifices and work harder your would-be peers. In turn, you use that to your advantage.   You show that you have developed an excellent work ethic to get where you are. You commit yourself to excellence in everything that you do while continously searching for more opportunities.

In Missouri, I wasn't apart of the union for the first 3 years of my career and I never paid dues. Since then I've joined, and I pay dues. If you choose not to join a club, and they make you pay anyways, that's close to extortion, even if it is for a good cause. I wasn't even aware unions forced members to pay dues until earlier this week. Doesn't seem like a fair practice to me. If someone doesn't want the unions help and doesn't pay dues, don't represent them. If the ""scab"" sees enough evidence of the beneficial nature of joining, they will eventually just like I did.

Wages are determined largely by the areas tax base and whether the administration and the board can convince the voters for increased taxes. 75% of the revenue goes towards employee costs, such as salaries, board paid health care and matched pensions. There isn't much room for negotiation when 75% of the money goes towards teachers anyway.

I think that unions can be more than people are aware of if they are powerful enough and have enough membership.  The problem that I see with the debate on unions is that the supreme court case is basing their ideas on first amendment issues.    I agree with the California attorney general (quoted here:   Ms. Harris said the challengers’ arguments were far too sweeping.  “Negotiations addressing routine employment matters — procedures for taking leave, for example, or the condition of faculty lounges, or the method for processing employee grievances — are not ‘political’ ” in the sense the Supreme Court has used the word in other First Amendment settings, she said.  “Even if petitioners are correct that some topics of collective bargaining could be said to involve matters of public or policy interest,” Ms. Harris added, “this case offers no sound basis for testing whether there is a constitutionally relevant line between conditions of employment and matters that are principally issues of public policy.” That is because, she wrote, “petitioners argue that all public-sector bargaining is ‘political speech.’ ”   I don't want to sound conspiratorial, but there are powerful conservatives in America who want to see the end of unions and they are using everything in their power to do it.  Vegara was started by a silicon valley billionaire and I'm sure the people backing Campbell Brown in New York are very well off, too.

My aunt retired from teaching not too long after that, and after 30+ years, she was only making something in the high $30,000s.   I'd always been curious about teaching before those two instances. After that, and seeing the kind of work and bullshit that they had to put up with, I never gave it another thought."

No professor even came close to using language like that, and I think if they had I would have had a major problem with that kind of language being used in an academic setting, and would have maybe thought long and hard about the kind of professors my college was employing.    A couple of exceptions:  A language professor talking about the words translations.  An English professor talking about it's use in a book.

The difference between a high school class and a college class are like the difference between a part time job and a full time career job.  The academic tone is set by the language the teacher uses, and it absolutely does change the tone when the teacher uses it.  It doesn't have anything to do with how much you learn, but it does have to do with the tone of the class, and like I said before, I never heard a teacher even come close to using it.    Even the fact that the teacher is discussing another student in any way shape or form, that could happen in high school and does constantly, but you would almost never see that happen in a college setting.  Edit:  Downvotes with no explanation?  I am offering you the standard classroom expectations for high school and college as I have taught both, and am being met with silent downvotes.  Go to any teacher and ask them if it's professional to say ""fuck"" in the classroom.  Sure some teachers do it and get away with it, but it is DEFINITELY not the standard."

education,3bw7b5,juxtapolemic,-5,Fri Jul 3 02:43:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  You consider using the word fuck to be pushing students to experience the range of human thought.  I would consider it to be exactly the opposite.  You are changing the entire tone of the classroom to be less than formal and you are using a shortcut in the way of vocabulary.  What you could express using another more descriptive word, you are using something that, by it's very nature, is meant to offend.  While I do agree in pushing boundaries, I do not believe that it has to be done using curse words.  There are exceptions, which I have already discussed.  A course on language usage would be one of those.  But if I was taking a class on ancient history and the professor said ""fuck"" in some way that was not meant to be academic, it would be a gigantic red flag and I would want their department chair to know about it.    In general professors do not use curse words inside the classroom.  It is seen as VERY unprofessional.  I, as a university professor and as a university student, never heard another teacher use a curse word in a formal classroom setting, and would have been very shocked to hear any one of my colleagues or teachers say that.   I will not give out the name of my university.  Lets just say for argument it was Xavier.  It wasn't actually Xavier, but it was similar in size and background.  It was a very formal academic setting where ideas were pushed and challenged every day.  Obviously we encountered the word ""fuck"" often in our readings and like I said before, maybe in the classroom, but a teacher would have never said it on their own in the classroom setting.  It would have been very unprofessional."

I can't recall any of my professors using that kind of language while addressing the class as a whole, but I had some who didn't mind using such language in conversation with students in and out of class. These were also some of the best educators I've ever had the pleasure of studying with, relaxed, charismatic, and considered professional by their peers.

The one who is ""boring and formal"" is the one who has spent their life studying this subject and probably knows more about it backwards than you ever will forwards.

I guarantee if these teachers you are talking about had formal evaluations and they dropped the F-bomb, they would be at least spoken to about it.  If it continued to be a problem they would eventually be fired.  What does this mean?  That the teachers and observers both know that it is frowned upon in a formal educational setting.

While I (of course) agree that teachers aren't paid enough, we can't say as a blanket statement that all teachers are consistently working far beyond their contract hours.  I am one of those teachers who is willing to put in extra hours to do the job, and from talking with my peers it seems like I put in many more hours on average then they do.    Still, on a typical week I only stay an extra 2-3 hours, and in the summer I only work 2-3 hours a week on school stuff.  Add it all up and I work maybe 100-150 hours a year outside of my contact.  That's less than 4 weeks of additional work, even though I enjoy 12 weeks of vacation a year.  Not insignificant, but I certainly couldn't complain that I don't actually get a vacation.  I get plenty, shown by the fact that I am writing a long-winded response to an article on Reddit on a sunny day in July while most of my non-teacher friends are at work.  Yes we need to fight for higher wages because most people don't have the option to work more hours and earn it the traditional way.  My district hasn't funded summer school in years, so I couldn't earn more money even if I wanted to.  They're trying to pay us for part-time work while preventing us from working full-time.  Anyone who's worked as a retail/service industry wage slave knows this game well.

Median teacher salary in the country is $55,000 (which is more than I make after teaching 12 years, but I live in AZ), that's not a bad job.   We have genuine concerns, salaries are a part of it.

education,3bvg41,nobodytrickedme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:00:31 2015 UTC,"So I am working off languages I have studied in the past.  I teach Physics and Math but I love languages so during college and grad school I took German and Japanese.  I also tutor a girl in Japanese right now and am going to try to start a language club next year for Japanese.  With that in mind, there are a ton of resources online.  There are some best practices you can follow.   Look for good self-study textbooks for cheap (Genki 1 is good for Japanese!) Find a website to help you with grammar / vocabulary (www.jisho.org for vocab and Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese for grammar) Find a way to practice writing and reading (I recommend finding translations of Harry Potter if you like the story, or the Hobbit).  Children's books are also good, but I get bored.  Find a simple novel you like and look for a translation. For writing practice the website Lang 8 is pretty good for interacting with native speakers.  You help with their English by correcting their sentences, and they will help you!  You get out what you put in. Find a way to learn most common words.  I use a deck from the program Anki (shared decks are online and easy to find).  Don't over study vocab!  Read more instead! If you can, look into Duolingo.  Lots of free courses that are fairly well structured, there is a phone app as well for free!  https://www.duolingo.com/   PM me any questions you have."

education,3bvg41,philnotfil,2,Thu Jul 2 20:49:02 2015 UTC,"Let me start this comment by saying that I am Australian (and thus our system is different to the American system) and I am only in my first year of studying my Masters of Teaching, and have thus spent only the equivalent of six weeks in the classroom.  Teachers here have it very damn good, in my opinion. Typically school hours are 9-3, and teachers are 'required' to start 30mins before and stay until 30mins after last bell. Staff meetings are taken out of class times, they get fifteen days of paid sick leave a year as well as having their long service leave come into effect after seven years within the profession. Plus, of course, the twelve weeks of school holidays.  What I have noticed from other teachers is that the school holidays provide freedom. If you know you have a lot of planning and marking to do, you can (generally) do them early, and have a break. A teacher at the school I was just at taught the last Friday of term, went straight to the airport, was going on a two week holiday overseas, and was to return two days before the start of the next term. She could do this becAuse she pre-planned through the term, and was going to mark assignments on her flights.  Am I doing teaching for the money? Hells no. I could have gone into higher paying jobs, but I'm doing it with the idea that I want to give back to the community, and do something 'good'. However, when a teacher can earn upwards of $100,000 a year, I don't think that it is worth really complaining about.  I brought this story to my first supervising teacher. I told her that my manager at my local supermarket was on $60,000 a year salary, and over Christmas he had to work eighteen straight twelve-hour days. And this salary is after over twenty years of service to the company. He gets hounded daily and is so stressed and running ragged. Here the starting teacher salary is $60,000, with you being expected to move to $70,000 in your first two years."

I never complain about my salary, or my general conditions. I took a term paid long service before I was 30 (and it was glorious). Add to that they hold your position for 7 years after you have a baby and have to accommodate any part time request you have when you return.

Ultimately, few teachers are optimistic that anything will change. “At the end of the day,” Klem said, “you definitely don’t do teaching for the money and I realize that.”   Odd.  Somewhere along the way I got the impression that teachers (or their unions) were the ones standing in the way of that optimistic future where quality affects pay."

education,3bx6te,translostation,2,Fri Jul 3 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"The availability of things like honors versions of specific classes isn't a matter of the state's education system. The state covers the basics, like what courses you need in order to graduate. For example, many schools don't offer an accelerated algebra 2 course. Japanese is not common at all either. I think the most common options for language are french and spanish. Health is mandatory, but I think it's only every other day and you have to do it 9th and 11th or 10th and 12 grades, so it doesn't take up a lot of your time.  At the end of the day though, you really shouldn't worry about it. It's not like there's much that can be done to address it and I'm sure your guidance counselors will be working very hard to ensure a smooth transition. Often for transfer students, you might find yourself taking courses taken by other students at a different grade. For example if one school does the science sequence as chem->bio->physics and another does bio->chem->physics, then you might find yourself taking bio with freshman but it's no big deal. Same might be true for US/world history.

I had a minor thing come up with errors in one of my formal evaluations, it was a small matter but she gave it her full attention and was prepared to do whatever it took to make sure that the errors were corrected.  If and when the union gets involved with a teacher in trouble, it's typically a confidential matter only between involved parties.  Sometimes there are whispers that the union is ""involved"" with someone, but if the matter is not something that other teachers in the building are aware of it likely goes unnoticed (or certainly isn't advertised).

Someone's skill in the classroom sometimes, not always, but sometimes has little to do with their dismissal. I would think this would be most appropriate for the union to step in.

They believed that their society was many times more successful, virtuous, and important to the economy of not only America, but the whole world. And to preserve southern supremacy, the institution of slavery had to remain in place and since blacks were the only race that had been able to be successfully enslaved and handle the workload, that was the type of slavery that they needed to preserve.

The southern states believed it was their right to have slavery since their economies depended on the institution, and if the radical republicans in the north kept winning elections and threatening to emancipate the slaves, it was also their right to secede from the union. Both states rights arguments still revolve around the issue of slavery.  Saying the war was about states rights, and nothing of slavery whitewashes why the war was fought. But, back to the article's main point, teachers don't neglect slavery in the classroom as the primary cause of the war. Little confederate sympathizers like Daughters of the Confederation, who are arguably bias in their opinion on the subject, play this goofy game of saying slavery wasn't the cause of the war."

General Lee abhorred slavery, he and his wife illegally freed and educated slaves, and Lee wanted to abolish it.  The ""myths"" are the ones being made in this article.  There was a Senator from Pennsylvania who for years spoke in the North of the evils of slavery...and he was a laughing stock for doing so, he was a Pastor.  If you look at the meetings in Congress, slavery was discussed but was far from the main subject leading up to the Civil War, it was thrown on the table once the North knew negotiations were going to fail, this is when they took that same Preacher/Senator, after negotiations fell apart, and put him at the forefront of the North's stance.  This didn't stop the North from forcing thousands of Irish right off the boats to fight in the Civil War.  This didn't end slavery, slavery didn't end until after the war, even in the North.  I was born and raised in New York, and for years I believe what I was taught, that the South is and always has been, inherently racist.  I never read anything about thousands of free African Americans in the South owning tens of thousands of slaves at the time of the Civil War.  I never read about free African Americans fighting for the Confederacy who were brutalized, tortured, and hung at the front of POW camps in the North.  Who is re-writing history?  Please.  And then what did the Union do (after Sherman's march didn't do enough damage raping white and black alike, and pillaging and burning everything for thousands of miles)?  The Union took everyone out of office, and replaced them with Northern sympathizers or even Northerners themselves.  Carpet Baggers from the North sold land they didn't own stealing the life savings of free African Americans and everyone.  This is why the KKK was first made, to protect both black and white Southerners from Northern carpet baggers.  Eventually it became the evil institution it is today.  It's sad that history is one-sided and these people mention that we have to stick to the facts while purposely hiding many facts of the war.  edit:  I can tell by the responses and downvotes, that no one actually read what I posted, because it is all actually factual history.  You can look up most of what I posted from legitimate sources like the Smithsonian.  I can tell you all look at what I wrote and just automatically assume I'm some redneck from Kentucky, and I have to hate everyone who isn't white, and it's the biggest joke out there.  I was born and raised in New York, and I used to believe the same history you all do.  But then I started reading the actual letters, the minutes from Congress, actual history from historians, and learned that what actually happened during the Civil War is far different from what we were all led to believe, I'm a history buff, I love it.  And I'm not just White, I'm a mix of every ethnicity of nearly every race in the world, that's how far back I can trace my ancestry.  And I get in arguments all the time with people about how ""racist"" I am.  It's a joke.  You're all brainwashed.  You don't question authority, you don't think for yourself.

All the issues that started the war were related to slavery and at least in my state (which I thought was one of the more backward ones in the union, but apparently we're ahead of most since we teach this correctly) we teach slavery was at the heart of most issues that began the war. It certainly wasn't the only reason, I could write an essay on here explaining all the reasons I've learned, but it seems to be en vogue today for people to dumb down serious social/economic problems to racism alone. Its like Ferguson, which I live about an hour from, when that cop killed that kid and the riots ensued. All you hear from that is ""white cops are racist"". Most people haven't even been there and they already made up theirs minds that racism is the single cause for why Ferguson is such a shitty place. It certainly is a major factor, probably the biggest that permeates all the other reasons for why that city is such a shithole, but certainly isn't the sole factor in the equation.

The problem is that you can't differentiate from racists who did those killings, and a group that was protecting the South.  It's like how the Guardian Angels at first fought crime on the streets of NYC...and then eventually started taking over the crime that they were stopping and rubbing out.  You are so blinded by your hatred, that you ignore the truth, and actually fool yourself into believing lies.  To you up is down and down is up.  When in reality if you admitted the truth, you would be laughing at the KKK even more for being so dumb and losing track of their very own origins.  In other words, what I am pointing out, actually supports your case against the KKK even more, but you're so mixed up, you can't even see it.  It's laughable.  It's even sadder that you were upvoted so much, because this means it's more than just you, there is a whole group of you, who have your logic completely messed up, and think I'm actually vouching for the KKK, instead of actually driving them down further.  And here for example, is Nathan Bedford Forrest, a person highly regarded by the KKK, giving a speech in the South in front of a mixed crowd (mostly African Americans):  In July 1875, Forrest demonstrated that his personal sentiments on the issue of race now differed from that of the Klan, when he was invited to give a speech before an organization of black Southerners advocating racial reconciliation, called the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association. At this, his last public appearance, he made what the New York Times described as a ""friendly speech"" during which, when offered a bouquet of flowers by a black woman, he accepted them as a token of reconciliation between the races and espoused a radical agenda (for the time) of equality and harmony between black and white Americans.  His speech was as follows:  Ladies and Gentlemen I accept the flowers as a memento of reconciliation between the white and colored races of the southern states. I accept it more particularly as it comes from a colored lady, for if there is any one on God's earth who loves the ladies I believe it is myself. ( Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.  I will say to you and to the colored race that men who bore arms and followed the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt - that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.  I have not said anything about politics today. I don't propose to say anything about politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgement in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.  Many things have been said about me which are wrong, and which white and black persons here, who stood by me through the war, can contradict. I have been in the heat of battle when colored men, asked me to protect them. I have placed myself between them and the bullets of my men, and told them they should be kept unharmed. Go to work, be industrious, live honestly and act truly, and when you are oppressed I'll come to your relief. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for this opportunity you have afforded me to be with you, and to assure you that I am with you in heart and in hand."" (Prolonged applause.):   The point being, you're being very ignorant of history, because the actual history of what happened, doesn't fit the white washed, or demonized version spoonfed to you by the victor.  The South wasn't some evil racist demigod that needed to be crushed.  The North was just as evil, if not more, and we are not benefiting any more today from their victory.  Slavery was becoming unaffordable and the owners knew it wouldn't last much longer, the North was well aware of this.  We have not benefited from this strong central government, it is the reason why power is so centralized and the government is so corrupt today.  We all would have benefited more from a Southern victory for State's rights, we will still benefit from it now, and that's the reason why now, more than ever, while our Federal Government is likely at the most corrupt it has ever been, that there has to be a push, to vilify decentralizing powers from the Federal Government, back to the States, as an inherently ""racist"" idea, that belongs back in the South during the pre-Civil War era, and has no place here today to combat the overreaching and overbearing Federal Government that causes so many problems for its own citizens, instead of serving us like it was always meant to.  It has become a self-serving entity, which is what the South warned us of, what the Founding Fathers warned us of, and something that people like you keep trying to label any reform or movements to undo this corruption as inherently racist.  You're basically kicking yourself in the ass and blaming it on a ghost."

It didn't hover around how free blacks in the Confederacy were slaughtered, that's how it started, and went on about how the Confederacy treated their POW's less because of a lack of resources due to the blockade, but the Union didn't suffer these lack of resources and still committed far worse atrocities.

The programs at local public tech centers and community colleges far exceed the curriculum at ITT Tech, DeVry, or University of Phoenix.  You might argue that the for profits have bachelors / masters programs and the non-profit equivalents do not, but if the classes for associate degrees are not accepted by state universities, how much actual worth does a higher degree from a for profit school hold?

education,3br7hc,christ0ph,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:36:22 2015 UTC,"No, this data-mined child is not European. There are much stricter data privacy laws in (many) European countries, especially for children.  While I am not thrilled at the idea of government-run surveillance, I trust public school teachers and administrators with student data. I do NOT trust the data-driven internet economy with children's data! Let's put aside concerns about corporations who mine adult user data for advertising and whatever else they do with it. It does worry me, but my concern is mitigated by the fact that adults give (nominal?) consent when accessing and purchasing e-commerce products and services.  Children CANNOT give consent! A child's skills, abilities, behavior and developing personal preferences shouldn't be harvested by commercial enterprises, nor should the government allow access to such information. According to the article,   the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, has been weakened in recent years, making it easier for schools to share student data and personally identifiable information without parental consent.   Thanks to initiatives such as Common Core (although it isn't fair to blame this entirely on Common Core, as there are many other offenders), we now have situations like this:   PowerSchool intakes a large variety of data. Its site touts administrator tools including discipline management and reporting; student and staff demographics; and family management. Pearson says the company has provided ways of allowing educators to track the performance of individual students...   What happens to that student data now?   educational services giant Pearson announced that it was selling the company PowerSchool, which tracks student performance, to a private equity firm for $350 million. The company was started independently; sold to Apple; then to Pearson; and now to Vista Equity Partners. Each owner in turn has to decide how to manage the records of some 15 million students across the globe..."

The reason they are being deregulated is the perceived need to offshore large amounts of administrative work which currently is being done locally in developed countries. Privatization of educational services will come with a lot of consolidation and administrative chores will likely be centralized and move elsewhere.

This is a way of doing to public education what was done to American manufacturing, then to American technology (e.g. IBM and Microsoft) and even to services (telemedicine).  Public education can't be off-shored until it is privatized, and edtech (facilitated by the internet) will be the means of implementing the off-shoring just like it is used for customer support and everything else. Broadband quality, speed and access is necessary for edtech to be an effective means of off-shoring, thus the big push by Obama and his technocrats for better broadband in the US.

The only way things got this far is that the school district in question thought they had a clever idea to work around the ban on vouchers with a technicality.  They set up a ""charter school"", which did not actually exist.  No classrooms, and no teachers.  The students assigned to this "" charter school"" were delegated out to the (mostly religious) private schools that participated, and the per-pupil funding was passed along.  So the students technically attended a fictional charter school, which ""subcontracted"" with private schools to handle the details of actually educating.

education,3bl2fr,christ0ph,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"In 1998, the US signed the ""Understanding on Commitments in Financial Services"" annex to the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services.  This is the very same document that the US cited as the reason the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act needed to be repealed.   For the US to ""give money to the poor"" - whether it was a loan or gift, would require modification of scheduled commitments in Financial Services as it would create significantly less favorable conditions for banks if the government went into competition with them in the business of lending money. If the government gave money to the poor it would basically eliminate the need for poor people to borrow money at interest. Its clear that many banks are international firms (investors) and the Understanding was specifically intended to create a global ""level playing field"" between the corporations of different countries. In short, your proposal is exactly the kind of government action ""indirect expropriation"" of the investors property interest in the market, that the trade deals are designed to forever prevent.  In GATS, there is a procedure, GATS Article XXI, which could be utilized by a country - at the request of a corporate interest, to force the taxpayers of the other country to compensate 'injured investors' for 'their lost property'.  its a state versus state version of ISDS.   its this very big sea change - largely unnoticed, that occurred twenty years ago, that has prevented our country (well, my country, the US) from having affordable health care.   An act of that nature requires the modifying member to negotiate compensation with members whose investors are adversely affected. Basically they would need to be compensated by agreeing on the value of lost expected profits and the country paying them, in advance.  In addition, such an attempt may violate the Understanding’s “Standstill” provision, which as far as I can see, specifically requires that any “conditions, limitations, and qualifications” to commitments in the Understanding be limited to those on the date the nation committed to the Understanding, February 26, 1998. In other words, the palatte of possible government action is limited to measures which increase the profits of investors only, and the level of liberalisation of all kinds that existed on February 26, 1998 should be seen as a high point of government action and a floor for liberalisation which has to only increase. (in other words, government interference with the market has to decrease, never increase).   A less trade distorting way to handle poor people's needs would need to be found. With education it might be accomplished by privatizing it and then replacing the current schools with private schools staffed by teleworkers or by natural persons from other countries with the stipulation that no wage parity or artificial numerical quotas on wages was required. In other words, a less trade distorting situation than wage and hour laws. Thats basically what is being negotiated now."
education,3bl2fr,christ0ph,2,Wed Jul 1 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"I am engaged in a conversation in a PM that I think should be moved to the main thread. Here is the answer to the person's question as to what does my attempting to explain why charter schools endanger the very existence of public education in all countries which have signed onto the USppromoted WTO general Agreement on Trade in Services. Please let me know if this is not clear in any way.   ---reply below-----  For current/former public education sectors (for example, K-12 education as a whole -or any public sector service sector) to be exempt from rules requiring mandatory privatization of ""services"" as a precursor to putting those services up for global ""liberalisation""  those services need to be a *""service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority""** or one of several other exemptions which even more clearly do not apply.   So what that means is this- the question of whether all education will be privatized in countries hinges on whether there are already private schools there. If there are private schools, then the service sector will fail the two part test which is referred to explicitly in the public ""negotiating mandate"" documents published by the EU recently. Since these are definitions, the reference to the earlier GATS is by way of using it as their definition, it clearly also applies to the US.   The very existence in a service sector of Schools which take money in exchange for providing education, prevents that service sector from being seen as a service provided by the government as an exercise of governmental authority.  Were the US to want to preserve its future rights to have public education or health care, it would have needed to bar - in those service sectors, all services which are not run directly by the government and provided for free to all. That is the only way for a service sector to pass the 'is it a ""services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority"" test' in Article I:3 (b) and (c)  This is made explicitly clear in Article I:3 (c)  **(c) 'a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority' means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers."" **  According to the same set of rules,    ""a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority' means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers."""

They might be physically brought back here, but at the same time, services liberalisation might open up the service jobs market to global firms paying their workers who were temporarily here, in their home country. This is a completely different ball game and in my opinion its an extreme abuse of workers on all levels.   Think its bad when commercial firms do it, just wait until that starts happening to much of the public sector (like education) down to the municipal level.   Those workers would be working on special trade related visas, intra-company trade visas, (think ""SchoolsCo"") which . are basically mandated by trade deals. They have no wage parity or necessity tests associated with them, (no test to see if any national firms or workers from a country could do the jobs first- that is actually forbidden by the trade deal itself) The media has had stories on H1B visas, but only a very few stories (that I know of) on these other visas and both had inaccuracies one was full of inaccuracies.

If there were no segregation, the Top 10% of each school would be dominated by whites. The existence of overwhelmingly black/hispanic schools is what ensures they can be represented in that Top 10%. Segregation means that the bar for entry is implicitly lowered for blacks and hispanics without doing so explicitly by law, which is why the program is used at all."

If minority representation is a compelling state interest, Texas should be permitted to simply state flat out ""the black entry SAT score is X% of the white score"" and be done with it.

education,3bim7g,nogodsorkings1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"I think that calling affirmative action 'racist' is a poor attempt to co-opt the connotations of that word.

It's just a race-aware policy, and to label it 'racist' is watering down what little substance that word has left."
education,3bim7g,JohnFest,3,Tue Jun 30 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that perspective but I respectfully disagree. I believe that affirmative action is rooted in the best of intentions but it is intrinsically racist and is a short-sighted and simple-minded way to address racial disparity.  The example of college admission is an easy-to-explain example. It's no secret that blacks are (and long have been) under-represented in higher education, particularly in very selective programs at very selective institutions. It's also a fact that blacks are more likely, in statistical terms, to come from disadvantaged backgrounds that make it difficult-to-impossible for them to compete with people who come from advantaged backgrounds (statistically more likely to be white or Asian). So it would seem like justice to say that these selective programs must accept some black applicants because it's simply not fair to have few to no black students in your selective program because the bar is too high and the disadvantages that disproportionately burden black applicants make it too difficult to clear that bar.  However, one must recognize that college admission is a zero-sum proposition. If Fancy University has 100 spots in their biology program this year for the 500 applicants; and fifteen must go to black students but, in objective terms and all other things being equal, only 5 black applicants would get spots; ten non-black applicants who should be admitted on their merit will be denied admission because of their race.  Again, you can argue that this is justified. You can argue that the cost of denying admission to some students based on race is okay because it promoted diversity. You can argue it's okay because certain races (usually black or Latino) are disproportionately burdened by society and lowering the bar a bit is a way to correct that disparity. Hell, you can argue that it's just better PR to have more black students mixed into the otherwise-homogenous population. However, to argue any of this, you have to also argue that the cost of racially sorting some students out of admission to make room for the students you're racially sorting in to admission is acceptable and that acceptance is, by it's most basic definition, racist."
education,3bim7g,nogodsorkings1,2,Tue Jun 30 03:56:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think it [affirmative action] is justified, I just think that opponents of progressive policy goals are shooting themselves in the foot by trying to appropriate the word. This is not something that non-progressives are allowed to get away with in American politics, as it is impossible to disentangle the concept of racism from a history of power disparity in the current narrative.  Most policy that attempts to elevate blacks does so at the expense of non-blacks. It suffices to call this stupid and unjust, without trying to flip the concept of racism around on the proponents, as such words are as impactful as tissue paper in the hands of the opponents of the progressive goal."
education,3bim7g,JohnFest,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fair and accurate indictment of how our ""bipartisan"" rhetoric works these days. That said, I think it's an unfortunate consequence of that rhetoric and the false dichotomies we're forced to operate under that someone who thinks affirmative action is an inelegant, deeply flawed, and/or intrinsically racist solution to a complex problem are inherently not ""progressive"" or are ""opponents of the progressive goal.""  Speaking only for myself here, I'm very progressive and socially liberal. I tend toward the center on a lot of fiscal/economic/foreign policy issues. Sadly, I can't criticize affirmative action without many on the Left immediately dismissing me as a Neocon Klan member. Likewise, I can't discuss the merits of reformed background checks for firearms without folks on the Right dismissing me as the lovechild of Marx and Hitler.  I am a proponent of the progressive policy goal that affirmative action seeks to address. However, I think that affirmative action is a wrongheaded, self-defeating attempt at resolving it. I think that we should reevaluate the justification and implementation of affirmative action and how it impacts both the people within and those excluded from the special considerations it creates.  I think affirmative action lets people feel like they're fixing or have fixed the issues of institutionalized, systemic racism without actually addressing any of the causes. If we want equality of opportunity for black and Latino applicants to get into college, I'd argue that we should focus on strategies to better prepare those students for college-readiness rather than selectively lowering the bar. Maybe affirmative action is or should be one branch of a broad approach that also looks at those issues. Maybe affirmative action is or could be a stopgap, temporary solution while we work on implementing the long-term, large-scale changes that would improve the lot of disenfranchised and disadvantaged Americans (primarily black and Latino) such as stopping the drug war, dismantling the prison-industrial complex, addressing sentencing disparities, improving access to mental health and addiction care, etc."

I think affirmative action lowers the bar when we should instead focus on what keeps certain groups from reaching the ability to clear the bar where it is.  Another example that illustrates this point without the racial component is No Child Left Behind. I think that everyone agrees NCLB had the best of intentions. I also think that just about everyone now agrees NCLB is an abject failure and achieved approximately zero of what it intended and actually screwed up our education system more than it already was. NCLB sought to level the playing field but to do so it ended up leveling the playing field to a much lower point instead of filling in the low points on the playing field by improving the opportunities and education of those who were struggling/disadvantaged.

Income inequality, poverty, breakdown of family and community networks, the war on drugs, anti-intellectualism, disparities in law-enforcement and sentencing, lack of early education, and the list goes on. To break a cycle, you've got to step in at some point (or multiple points) on the cycle and stop it from going to the next step in the loop. That's what affirmative action does. The intention is a good one. There's a lot to be said for the benefit of getting a kid into college who might not have gotten in due to a disadvantaged background that s/he had no control over.  Really all I'm saying is that we have to be realistic and honest about the costs of any given social program if we're going to be able to measure its benefit. It is a simple numerical reality that favoring one race in college admission means disfavoring another. We may, as individuals or as a society, decide that it is worth the cost (presumably a cost born by the advantaged majority) if it furthers the cause of equality for the disadvantaged minority. It's reasonable to argue that and we have those kinds of discussions all the time about every social issue. Saying you think affirmative action is a good thing and the ends justify the means doesn't mean ""fuck Whitey,"" and saying that the cost of affirmative action (effectively flipping racism in order to repair the damage of racism) isn't a morally viable solution doesn't mean ""fuck the poor, especially the brown and black ones."" It's a complex issue and if we have any hope of actually achieving progressive goals, we're all going to have to do a better job of coming to the middle to talk about it rather than pushing ourselves and one another into diametrically opposed Liberal/Conservative, pro/con, good/evil false categories."

The children use these items for hours on end, creating their own imaginary worlds.   This school is in  Auckland, New Zealand. In America, the situation is quite different.  Charter schools and voucher programs suck affluent well-adjusted kids away from public schools, causing closure and consolidation of traditional public schools. The remaining public schools have a high percentage of students who have extreme behavior disorders (and many other issues). [This is all part of the school privatization movement... break public schools and then move in private industry to run private schools using public money. But, that's a debate for another day....]  I can imagine the physical harm that would come from adding wooden planks, tires and hoses to the playground and then giving students an 'adult-free recess.'    Injuries. Psychological trauma. Lawsuits.   Some students have personal attendants purely for the purpose of protecting other students, staff and property from injury or damage. Such students can't be expelled, and the only other option is hiring a teacher for exclusive in-home instruction (which state and federal funding don't cover... an entire teacher's salary for a single student... then count the number of such students who need one-on-one instruction because of the physical risk they present). And such teaching positions are hard to fill because they're quickly vacated when an instructor no longer feels safe."

They're basically private schools run for profit, with the guaranteed funding source of taxpayer dollars.  In some states (such as mine) charter schools are public, but operate with a bevy of preferential laws that directly harm traditional public schools.   My local school districts fought the invasion of charter schools, and I do mean invasion. The first charter legislation had no geographic restriction, so a remote, tiny one-school district accepted charter applications that were far away because there was a slight economic advantage to the district without any of the downsides of having those charters actually located in its district. These public charters don't play by the same rules as traditional public schools because the rules have been changed specifically for their benefit, to the detriment of what the average person considers to be a public school with local accountability from the surrounding community."

education,3bg2tj,bookchaser,2,Mon Jun 29 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"I taught in low SES schools for seven years.  The first three years was in a traditional public school that is very similar to what you describe.  The students were highly controlled, made to walk in lines in the hall, had to be silent in the cafeteria, etc.  Even so, fights, gangs, weapons, drugs, rape, etc, were all common.  The second four years was in a private school.  The vast majority of the students in this school were recipients of DC's voucher program.  The school was located in the poorest area of the city, and the demographics of the population was exactly the same.  However, how we treated the students was different.  We worked with our students in a social justice model.  We afforded them a great deal of trust and placed high expectations on them.  Despite a similar student population, there were not the same discipline issues.  In fact, I can only remember one fight in my four years.  I understand that this is anecdotal and not proof, but there is research to back it up, but you asked for my experience and there it is.  Before you go and say, 'well, your school just attracted the best of a bad lot.'  Let me assure you that this is not the case.  We had a student move and so he had to attend a new school.  When I caught up with him later, it turned out that he lasted exactly two months in his new school before he was permanently expelled.  This was a young man who while troubled, was also absolutely brilliant.  He had a strong appreciation for music of all types and even while in middle school was tuned in to political and social justice issues.  I consider him one of the great tragedies of my career, and I hope that we was able to eventually overcome the system he was trapped in."

Second, adults are certain this wouldn't work (as above) and are reluctant to try it.

I commented that the major roadblock to trying this in the U.S. would be adults (as has been borne out by what you've argued). What you haven't addressed is the degree to which massive over control of children at all levels and lack of time outside has lead to such behavior. There is plenty of research supporting that more time on recess and physical activity and more self-directed activity in fact cuts down on just the behaviors you cite. This is among (yes, only among; no one is citing this as a silver bullet, either) a long list of things that would actually help. And no one, least of all me, is in any way discounting the loss of financial support or the very real threats to public ed now. That has only a little to do with this. The charter sector educates a relatively small number of children across the country (and yes, I am aware of who they are and are not). I really don't think we can blame this one on them. The threats to public ed shouldn't mean we lose our own ability to innovate and improve and learn; quite the contrary."

Because I don't accept your premise that children are 'over-controlled.'    In my experience, children are given great latitude in the classroom and on the playground. The adults are spread so thin that they're preoccupied with 'controlling' children who pose a danger to themselves and others around them. Thirty years ago, the percentage of such children was much lower, and they weren't in traditional public schools because they weren't mainstreamed.

As long as the children aren't going home with severe gashes, a few scrapes and bruises along the way are just parts of childhood that are minor issues compared with the much larger issue of their play being limited. Students are so heavily regulated in their play that they rarely get the opportunity to be creative and access their imagination.  I've also found recess to be one of the best times to get to know children because the time is so unstructured. A lot of teachers like to use recess as a time to stay indoors and get a break from the children, which I respect. However, I feel like the heavily structured curriculums and micro managed schedules give me little time to get to know the children other than their abilities in different content areas. By playing with children at recess time I've been able to gain their trust much more easily because they no longer look at me as their supreme overlord.  We're constantly trying to add more structure to schools, but unstructured time is some of the best time for students to be able to apply what they've learned or for them to be able to learn completely new things."

If you ignore the spin and look for facts, that's not what happened.  Really, this is a straight-forward review process.  There's a subjective element to the grading, and sometimes a student will get a grader who just really doesn't understand where they are coming from, or otherwise scores the exam lower than they deserve.  If the school feels that happened, they can ask for the exam to be rescored by a new scorer, who is exactly as independent as the original.  The results speak for themselves: of the rescored exams, 5 scores increased, one didn't change, and 3 decreased.  Exactly what I'd expect to see from an honest appeals process (keeping in mind that appeals were self-selected already for exams the school feels should have scored better), and not from a scam to graduate kids who didn't earn it.  Keep in mind that no one is claiming these were examples of stellar performances.  Even the adjusted grades are borderline passing.

But, knowing what they are posting, how they interact, and how they construct their identity isn't information that I have access to, or really want to have access to, because interacting with them through social networks is a place we dare not tread.  Based on what we do hear or find out about, I can say that students are more likely to be uninhibited through social networking, letting parts of themselves come through that usually don't.  Although, I think that there is also an issue with exaggerating parts of themselves they want people to think they are.  For example, the quiet girl who's Facebook profile only shows her cleavage and open legs, and who posts sexually explicit content to impress boys.  Or the straight-A student from a bad neighborhood that threatens to bring their ""chopper"" to school to shoot up a classmate they aren't getting along with.

So they're usually caught in this reactive position where they have to reverse engineer students' interactions, usually from an outcome or a secondary source, to get at the cause of a problem.  Institutional teaching and learning as we know it, is not well-equipped to answer, let alone research the question.  The naive approaches I had seen in edtech involve accessing the student's network, identifying interactions s/he makes in that network as their authentic interests and learning opportunities, and from it, model their acquisitions of and adjustments they make to his/her conceptual understandings.  In fact, there are specifications out there that can be used to make that model interoperable (like xAPI).  Sometimes these models are compared to some normative framework for student knowledge (like the Common Core).  Others looked into individuals and resources in the student's network to validate their competencies to determine if they are reliable, and help direct other students to them if they have similar interests.  There are of course privacy concerns with these approaches, but when implemented in a moderated, closed network, as districts prefer, little of what would be construed as identity or knowledge comes off as authentic: it's like mining for gold and mostly finding pyrite."

education,3becwc,breadbeard,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"This article presents the challenges better than I could: schools are used to adopting edtech tools for their structured objectives, assume learning as the primary outcome, but don't find much value in the network itself, or its norms.  Social networks conversely self-organize around any body of knowledge, interests or objectives, and have their own mechanisms and norms (think Reddit circle-jerks or controversies) to determine a participant's 'cred', identity or role.  The two systems interact little, and indirectly, but the latter (because it's all communication) likely has much to say about a student's motivations and self-identity, though the so-called 'informal' learning they may take away is typically not very well structured, or even recognized as knowledge in the former.  It's hard to capture when much of a student's activity may not be learning-oriented, hard to validate, and hard to correlate with those particular competencies that a school is charged to measure student progress or success.  Rustici Software, the authors of xAPI, (and SCORM before that) have a list of adopters that make use of their experience model.  Many are corporate training companies that have very specific objectives and norms than what you're looking to investigate.  Some are PreK-16 and are widely used, but still only use a small portion of what the spec is actually capable of."

They, by design, do not serve a teacher's purposes: they aren't able to assess mastery with a great level of detail, are slower and far, far more expensive than informal testing, and they simply don't give information in a fashion that helps you adjust instruction.   Standardized tests are useful for university and policy-level academics to study whole areas. To assess whole systems and populations. Bringing them to the individual level is insane.

I've never heard of that ever happening. It does cause a bit of stress, as there is some underlying culpability that teachers should help students perform well - but we're actually in the middle of a change to issue our 3-year Provincial Achievement Tests at the beginning of a school year to specifically prevent administrators from using tests as summative assessment of students (or teachers too I suppose).

Those that are upset are talking about the current tests, how they are implemented and how they are used.  Given the current accountability system, what teacher would not ""teach to the test"" and/or spend an inordinate amount of time on test prep? That is the rational response. And of course districts will move the adopting Pearson created programs with the hope that it will be most aligned and similar to the test.  This benefits only Pearson.  As well, at least in NY, the tests have had flaws every year. Questions thrown out, errors, inappropriate reading levels, etc...  It's ironic and sad that the accountability system for teachers has no accountability.  We are forcing school to be about taking a specific test, or type of test, and then the reformers complain that students aren't college ready, colleges and employers complain that students don't have the requisite skills and aren't independent thinkers.

These things all correlate very positively with success in life.  But they do not determine it!  If you insist on reducing success to average adult income, then let's take a look at the Washington Post article.  It shows that differences of one grade point, which is a lot on a four point scale, can account for about $7000 per year in adult income.  But my income jumped by ten times that when I moved from Colorado to California.  Does every guidance counselor in the country inundate their students with advice on how important it is to move to New York or San Francisco?  It might make a far larger difference in their adult income than bringing up their GPA.  This isn't too say students shouldn't work hard or worry about grades... they should!

By the early 2000s, every state had developed and adopted its own learning standards that specify what students in grades 3-8 and high school should be able to do. Every state also had its own definition of proficiency, which is the level at which a student is determined to be sufficiently educated at each grade level and upon graduation. This lack of standardization was one reason why states decided to develop the Common Core State Standards in 2009."

education,3axonv,anonoman925,11,Wed Jun 24 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"So supporters are using a 'false flag' argument.    Nyuk. :P  True that it has always been used by white supremacists, but its prevalence in mainstream life in the South doesn't date all the way back to the end of the Civil War. It came into common usage during the Civil Rights movement, as a direct response to integration. Georgia, for example, incorporated Confederate symbolism into its flag two years after Brown v. Board of Ed. In South Carolina, it was raised in the early '60s. Unless you're going to argue that the flag appearing all over the South just as Civil Rights began is a coincidence, you have a hard time making the case that flag represents ""States' Rights"" and not racism.  It's revisionist bullshit anyway to suggest that the South seceded over anything but slavery, which should be abundantly clear from the fact that the roles were reversed just a few years before the Civil War, when the South used their disproportionate influence in the federal government to force through the Fugitive Slave Acts, with the intent of forcing the Northern states to help the South enforce slavery laws, even if those states were opposed to slavery. In other words, Northern states didn't have ""States' Rights"" to avoid enforcing unethical laws.  It's also pretty clear in the various Declarations of the Causes of Secession: all of them talk extensively about slavery, with complaints of the Northern states failing to enforce fugitive slave laws, and little mention of ""States' Rights"".  And the Confederate Constitution was almost exactly a clone of the United States Constitution, with the only major difference being that states expressly didn't have the right to opt out of slavery:   Article IV Section 3(3): The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several states; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form states to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory, the institution of negro slavery as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress, and by the territorial government: and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories, shall have the right to take to such territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the states or territories of the Confederate states.    So, the same Constitution, with fewer rights for states and more emphasis on slavery.  To top it off, many folks don't realize, the flag in question is not actually the national flag of the CSA, but the military flag of Virginia. If your use of the flag is meant as a political statement, why have you chosen a flag of a militant wing as your symbol?  The whole thing just reeks."

If your use of the flag is meant as a political statement, why have you chosen a flag of a militant wing as your symbol?   AFAIK the whole reason they needed a separate battle flag was to have something visually distinct from the Union flag to avoid friendly fire issues.

education,3axihc,cdsmith,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:05:58 2015 UTC,"Since the answers you've gotten so far for the US are unclear, I'll try to summarize.  In the United States, we do not have one education system, or one set of organizational principles for how to structure education.  Most decisions are made by school districts, which are local organizations that govern anywhere from one school (common in rural areas) to hundreds of schools.  There are around 14,000 school districts in the United States, and each one could have different policies about whether and how they group students by ability.  These school districts are constrained by policies set by each of the 50 states.  (For example, most states have some laws about requirements for high school graduation, and states vary on how much of the requirements are up to the school, or set by the state government.)  Sometimes there are -- just by convention -- similar structural properties for schools in broader regions of the country.  But fundamentally, each district can do things very differently.  So it's hard to get any kind of consistent characterization of educational practices in the US.  It's very common for teachers who have worked most of their life in a few districts, one state, or some region, to assume that the practices there are more widespread than they really are.  So if you're not aware of this, you are likely to be misled.  That answer may not help with your research much, but that's the truth."

education,3au9lv,philnotfil,2,Tue Jun 23 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking.   However, I do remember colleagues who scored some previous state tests say that at least two scorers scored each test to assure that each test was scored correctly. If a scorer does a good job on most of her/his work, will Pearson catch the few that are not graded well with its current system of using only an occasional check? If a scorer has a bad day, and Pearson doesn't catch it, those students and teachers are going to suffer."
education,3au9lv,cdsmith,3,Tue Jun 23 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"I am nearly always on board with criticisms of Pearson, but this one actually seems off the mark.  Third grade and fifth grade essays don't seem beyond the abilities of average college educated professionals.  And this test, more than any other, is not at all intended to contribute toward any educational goal; it's purely assessment.  It's not as if the graders are providing comments for the students or suggesting skills to work on our practice work.  Perhaps the reason this sounds out of place is that people are assuming the test results have some educational value in the first place?"
education,3au9lv,amalgaman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:59:53 2015 UTC,"It's more the idea that teachers are being evaluated, and hiring decisions are being made on the test scores which are coming from (in part) people who have no investment in the scores or the job of scoring other than a paycheck. The McDonalds analogy is fitting. I wouldn't judge a Big Mac as something to aspire to."

Technology needs to evolve to meet the needs of the business. If we just stick a bunch of scientists, tech leaders, and artists to design innovative systems for our schools, then it will be a disaster. There is a reason we have systems analysts in IT as well as developers. Sys analysts bridge the gap between the users and the developers to be able to create a system that is both powerful and efficient, but also one that is user friendly and addresses the problems or eliminates the obsticals that users have. You can't drive innovation without the help of those using the innovation. Teachers should absolutely be a part of innovation."

If you asked people what they wanted in a phone 15 years ago they would have said higher sound quality, not a camera, music player and video games.

See Ideo on innovation in the classroom. The Stanford design school is another."
education,3au8lw,adamwho,5,Tue Jun 23 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"And people in the tech industry have no idea what customers need. That's why they need to be brought together so that the users can say ""this is what I do, these are things I would like to do, and these are current problems we have"" and then the technical teams explore options to fulfill the scope of the project that was designed around the users input. I'm not saying you're wrong, but it's not the whole picture. Without teachers input, there can be no innovation"
education,3au8lw,General_Hide,-2,Tue Jun 23 20:18:51 2015 UTC,So when I say tech industry you automatically think IT and engineering?  You are right those groups in the tech industry are not the innovators and are generally not good at understand customer needs..  However I am talking about design and innovation people.

Much of what I do is meeting with users so that we can come up with and design a system or process that will help the user based on what they've told me. I know  exactly what the tech industry entails and I'm not selling it short. You can't tell me that design and innovation companies like Ideo completely disregard the input and expertise of the people that work in the field that they are trying to innovate? Every successful project begins with recognizing an issue or opportunity, and then collaborating on ways to innovate, and that requires user input (in this case, teachers).  To reiterate, I'm not saying teachers can do it alone, but that it can't be done without teachers"

The article went on to say she split with the board on vouchers, but didn't bother to tell us her position on that matter.  It MAY WELL BE that she's a right-winger who is willing to make creationist science an educational agenda for TX, in which case, I would take issue with that.  But if she'd voiced such a goal, surely this author would have loved to feature it in this article.

Yes, the socioeconomic status of students will keep them doing fine education wise. They will be critical thinkers and readers. The unfortunate problem is we live in a competitive workforce in a global economy with incentives for competitive education. The smartest kids at my school where I teach are smart. They will do fine in life. But they have been robbed of opportunities to be better and to compete with their peers in better schools.

Eventually this program changed its named to REACH (unsure what it stands for) because parents complained that their children were being discriminated against as not being gifted or talented.  Increases in inclusive classrooms are causing more problems where the bright students fail to be challenged while the teacher AND the resource aid spend their class time helping all of the students who are struggling. This leaves the gifted students spending most of their time waiting for others to catch up, rather than pushing them ahead and challenging them.  In addition, there is a culture within many schools of it being cool to be ignorant and you are labeled an outcast if you are intelligent. No one wants to be the ""nerd"" so many bright students purposely hold themselves back from their interests."
education,3aqo0x,eeo11,0,Tue Jun 23 15:08:31 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this since I was failing 7th grade: It's because our educational system is outdated and seriously needs an overhaul.  The educational system honestly needs to be able to mold itself to whatever the needs of the community are.   I am also a firm believer in making children responsible for their own education at an early age, and giving them a certain amount of freedom in choosing what they learn about. There are several states where programs such as these have been run to varying degrees of success depending on the approach they have taken.  We should be tasking our young learners with choosing their own path starting in Middle School at the very least. Perhaps they wouldn't be ready in Elementary school, but at the pre-teen to teenage level, they should be capable of at least choosing a few classes on their own.  Granted, there will be classes that they will need to take, but...why force a student to learn a language they may never use? why force them into an area of study that they have no interest in?  The way I look at it, the problem with our students is that they aren't being challenged enough to take control and take initiative. As a matter of fact, we hold their hands so much throughout the early years of schooling that by the time they reach High School, they aren't even remotely familiar with the concept of making their own choices, because all of their choices have been made for them throughout their entire scholastic career.  When I first discovered that I wasn't going to be told which class to attend next, I was absolutely petrified. Nobody warned me; nobody prepared me to take matters into my own hands. It's difficult to be prepared for any kind of responsibility when we remove the opportunity for personal responsibility only to dump our kids on the curb at the end and say ""good luck.""  Maybe if we started appropriately preparing students for success later in life, they would be more successful from a younger age and we wouldn't have this problem. Just a thought."
education,3aqo0x,stoudman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you teach but everywhere I have been in both Florida and Texas students starting in middle school begin picking their own classes. Yes in middle school they have to take their 4 core classes but the other 2-4 classes they pick. However what is available varies by school. The usual is 2D art, 3D art, graphic design, band, orchestra, choir, guitar, dance, PE, football, soccer, volleyball, other sports, various computer and business classes, and others.   Once they get to high school they are still required to take their 4 core classes however there are usually several ways to satisfy the core class. For example for science 1,2,3 you can go into various biology, chemistry, physics, marine biology, Integrated science, anatomy, etc.   Maybe I'm misunderstanding you but everywhere I have been students have a wide variety of classes they can choose to take or not take starting in middle school.

That being said, I have to say that I am glad to see that happening more often. My experience in this area is limited, to be honest. That being said, my experience was one of total bewilderment, as nobody explained anything to me, and in the end I was simply given classes to take — although I was told that there were apparently opportunities to choose my own classes. I guess what I'm saying is that we should be preparing students for the responsibility of making their own choices, not just taking them from one school where they have every decision made for them and dropping them off at another school where they are suddenly expected to make their own choices with no explanation of how the system works.  When I first experienced college, it was like a revelation; this was the schooling experience that I had longed for since I was a child, and it took me until my adult years to get there. It had nothing to do with people or experiences and everything to do with the freedom of deciding which classes I would take, when I would take them, where they would be, and how I would attend them. I think all scholastic endeavors should be like that, and I feel like I might have been better prepared to take on the challenges of every day life had my earlier education been structured in such a way.  I went from flunking middle school to earning consistent A's and B's in college simply because I had the freedom to choose classes that fit both my schedule and my desired focus of study.

education,3avamu,raxsdale,6,Tue Jun 23 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"Do say teachers make money off the existing system is misleading. Teachers are paid within the current system, but they are paid at charters as well. Unless you're argument for charters is that teachers should be paid less, then that isn't really the issue.  Teachers don't make policy or distribute funds. Teachers are not in charge of administering social services, making neighborhoods safe, as well as the myriad of other factors that have about 10 times as much to do with student learning as the teacher does.  If we have successful schools in the country, which we absolutely do, why not follow their lead? Oh right, they are generally in areas of higher SES with students from those same backgrounds. Meaning equity in funding education and working on issues around poverty is actually what is needed.  In most affluent districts a very tiny minority of teachers aren't very effective because those districts are in the position to fire said teachers before they grant tenure since the jobs are attractive. Make all teaching jobs attractive, hire better administrators, and you will have a stronger teaching force.  The only thing I can see around the issue of teacher is more rigorous requirements to become one. In NY it's more rigorous than in most other states."

And I didn't distinguish teachers between charter and district, that's a distinction you asserted that I made, to then dispel it.   The point is that parents aren't biased by job protection issues, or salaries when picking the best school for their children -- hence they are the most unbiased arbiters of what's best for kids.   Do you let the Post Office decide how many FedEx and UPS stores there are -- or do you let the public vote with their feet and the chips fall where they may? In education, just like package delivery, doctors, universities and everything else in our lives, we should let the users of the service decide where to go, not let the providers of the service tell everyone else what to do."

education,3avamu,seemoreglass83,3,Mon Jun 29 10:29:49 2015 UTC,"um, 100% black sounds pretty segregated to me.  Also, it's not just about segregation based on race but other things as well.  Charter schools for instance serve fewer students with special needs so it allows parents to segregate their children away from being in classes with special needs children.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, I understand why parents like charter schools.  If I were a parent, I would probably send my kid to a charter school if my public school option wasn't good.  However, that doesn't do anything to fix the larger problems in education which is poverty."
education,3avamu,DrippingYellowMadnes,-1,Mon Jun 29 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"No, 100% black isn't segregated if it's located in a neighborhood where the district schools are also virtually 100% black. (Or, if you maintain that's still segregated, then you'd have to say the district schools are segregated too, which I don't hear too often.) Moreover, the pejorative power of the word ""segregated"" is that it usually implies white flight -- whites using charters to flee the minority-dominated urban district schools. Trouble is, rarely does data confirm that. Instead, it's just used as an unsubstantiated talking point, intended to scare people through race-baiting.   Special needs accusations fit the same talking point non-standard of substantiation -- just say it as if you know it's true at most charter schools, and hope no one calls you on it. Have there ever been examples of charters that discourage special needs students? I'm sure. But there are many charters with higher-than-average special needs populations. Hell, there are charter schools designed for special needs students. (Google it.‚) This is just a bomb that gets dropped without people feeling the need to support their claim.   I appreciate your honesty that you'd send your kid to a charter school if it were better. I mean really, who wouldn't? But the poverty excuse does little to explain how well some schools are doing educating low-income kids, charter, private and district, while sometimes a school across the street with the exact same population demographic produces 50% dropout rates. Poverty is the education establishment apologist's favorite excuse for running lousy schools and avoiding all accountability."

Feel free to read the links that I sent you elsewhere about how high poverty charter schools can obtain higher test scores than neighborhood schools.  Also feel free to read research that shows that charter schools on average do no better than public schools.  I won't go back and forth with you on that as I don't think you are open to debate since you think poverty is an ""excuse"".  I'll just address one thing.  I do think districts are segregated.  I've taught in the same public school for 10 years and never had a white student.  A lot of schools in america are de facto segregated by the neighborhood you live in.  I see charter schools as another way to segregate without having to move, but that doesn't mean segregation doesn't exist in the public school system, because it does."

Page 65, ""Black students who attend a charter school on average have 14 additional days of learning  in both reading and math compared to black students enrolled in TPS [traditional public school].""  You can find on page 77, ""Charter ELL [English Language Learner] students have 36 more days of learning in reading per year than ELL students in TPS [traditional public schools]."" It's all here: http://credo.stanford.edu/documents/NCSS%202013%20Final%20Draft.pdf  Especially noteworthy, CREDO shows charters, on average, outperform district schools despite lower spending/student.  On the segregation issue, again, thanks for being a fair broker with respect to segregation issues pertaining to district schools as well. Seems to me, as long as we have entire neighborhoods in America that are mostly white, or mostly black, or mostly Hispanic, or mostly Asian, etc., it will be inevitable that schools will mostly reflect that local dominant ethnicity of their location. Not sure how you get around that, short of massive busing of students, or forced government reassignment of where everyone lives.   What irks me about this debate is when others do what you have not done -- hang-wring about woeful charter segregation while pretending some absurd myth about the district schools being somehow not segregated. That's a fundamentally dishonest, good old fashioned, double standard."

Does any one else find it hilariously ironic that despite her opposition to ""Eurocentricism"", the universalist progressivism which she espouses and wants to impose on her students is purely European, even Christian in origin? When she refers to ""diverse"" writers (e.g., e.g.), what she means are non-white writers who have come into contact with western progressivism and learn to parrot the same causes (anti-racism, anti-sexism, egalitarianism, etc.). Anti-western nationalism, too, is a western export. What does she think caused the Haitian Revolution? Where did Frantz Fanon study, the University of Timbuktu?  If she was actually interested in diversity, she might have her students read the Qur'an and the Analects of Confucius. These would expose her students to what are by western standards, wildly reactionary perspectives, but hey, that's what true diversity entails. By drenching her students in western progressivism, she is engaging in what she might call ""cultural imperialism"". That's fine, we all do. It's impossible to escape the reality that you are a westerner teaching in a westernized world to your western students (that includes ""people of color""; the west is not a race or geography), and that today's range of opinions is western in origin. All the more reason to actually teach the western canon."

I don't know any adult progressives that think Shakespeare has no relevance or value and want it excised from education. In fact, I'd say such a notion is antithetical to intellectualism entirely.   And not only do I dislike Shakespeare because of my own personal disinterest in reading stories written in an early form of the English language that I cannot always easily navigate, but also because there is a WORLD of really exciting literature out there that better speaks to the needs of my very ethnically-diverse and wonderfully curious modern-day students.   There have always been two aspects to Shakespeare that have made me love his writing. For one, I have just always been a sucker for his flowery descriptions and dialogue. Sure, he could have said, ""this time, last night,"" but it's not nearly as interesting as, ""last night of all, when yon same star had moved to illume that part of heaven where now it burns."" Gotta love that.   But what made his work fascinating was the fact that it was hundreds of years ago -and the same conflicts and human flaws that plague us today are showcased in his work. Just the famous ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy offers a window onto the human motivations of suicide and fears of death showing us that we haven't really changed much at all.  I don't know, maybe education just isn't for this teacher.   What I worry about is that as long as we continue to cling to ONE (white) MAN’S view of life as he lived it so long ago, we (perhaps unwittingly) promote the notion that other cultural perspectives are less important.   The fact that she thinks teaching Shakespeare is the same as promoting the notion that other cultural perspectives are less important tells me she's walking into this with a chip on her shoulder."

All the celebrated ""diverse"", ""multicultural"", ""post-colonial"" ""voices"" I was made to read in college are ""white voices"", in that their opinions are entirely of western inspiration. Confucius is unmistakably and uniquely Chinese, Mohammad is unmistakably and uniquely Muslim, but James Baldwin basically has the same political opinions as his cosmopolitan friends and patrons, who were white. Gandhi's hippie Hindu revival? Anglophile liberalism, French revolutionary nationalism. Mandela? The African National Congress was founded by Christian missionaries. Edward Said? Don't even get me started.  The only reason why these writers found currency in the English-speaking world is because their opinions agreed with (because they were basically derived from) English-speaking intellectuals. Who were, by and large, white western progressives.  Truly indigenous thinkers like Confucius and Mohammad have opinions that are shockingly alien and, in Europe, illegal to say out loud. Do they have a place in a classroom meant to teach the virtues of diversity?  So to assert the superiority of European values, we instead call them universal, and showcase a bunch of non-white writers who happen to agree with them. That's sham-diversity.

It's kind of like Coffee Beans being sold with a picture of an African woman on the front. It doesn't matter what her religious or political views are, its the essence that yes, she is included with us that allows the product to be consumed by sensitive middle-class (mostly white) citizens.   That being said, I think you might be pushing too much for an ""authentically non-White"" perspective. I think, if you get down to it, Confucious' views are very Chinese, but they also have a lot to in common with Jewish patriarchy, stoicism, and a reverence for authority present in many ""white"" religious traditions like Catholicism.   As well, Mohammad did not emerge in a non-European vaccuum and was both influenced by, and influenced, Christianity.   I think that it is important to herald different ideologies, but you can't discount non-white people's perspectives (like Edward Said), just because their views aren't out-there enough. The fact is that non-white perspectives do have a little bit of flavor to add to the conversation, even though many of their ideologies mesh well with the current liberal paradigm.   As well, we don't really teach Nazism as a philosophy in High Schools from an insider perspective with a focus on its' ethics, so there are clearly ""white"" ideologies which we care little about as well."

As an I/S English teacher I know that questioning the canon is important, but I think it's also important to give the students the foundations needed for future academic pursuits. If she does not teach Shakespeare and the students decide to go to university to study English, encountering the texts then will be more difficult.   There are alternatives that teach the themes while allowing the students to learn at different paces. There are graphic novel versions of Shakespearean texts with different texts varying from the original text to slightly more modern English, to modern speech. All the students would have the same book, but can understand and learn at different levels together. There are also text message versions of plays out now. (I'm not a huge fan, but it can be worked in.) The use of comparison books, texts, or even movies and other media can be used to make the text more relevant as well.

The themes are clear and there's some worthy points for discussion. I think it's also a nice way to introduce younger readers to dystopian writing. The biggest benefit of books like HG is inspiring students to read and giving lower level readers something to start with.   Or do you think 12 year olds who hate reading should just start with Dostoyevski? It's easy to lambast authors for their writing, but pulp literature can be a useful tool.

You can introduce more diverse authors and still spend some time on Shakespeare. The two ideas are not mutually exclusive.

Handing disadvantaged kids stack of verse older than a Sequoia leads a lot of perfectly sensible teachers to make the choice in the article.  It's not one I agree with but I certainly understand it.  I had one student dismissive of Julius Caesar, who in the same period would babble excitedly about Breaking Bad.  Once I actually translated the scene with Cassius first testing the waters with Brutus, he got the thematic connections.

I personally didn't ""get"" Shakespeare until watching a film version of Henry IV and for whatever reasons it finally clicked and I appreciated Shakespeare's genius.  I think when teaching Shakespeare it is much more important to emphasize individual scenes. Shakespeare wrote brilliant scenes. A single scene can tell us so much about ourselves and the human condition. Get students to understand the gist of the story/plot/characters (teach them to not care about ""spoilers"") and then focus on a few individual scenes within the story. It shouldn't even be a requirement to read the entire play. Read a few scenes, analyze those scenes in-depth and watch film versions of the scenes to go along with the reading. Then watch the film in it's entirety. Don't force kids to read the whole play, I feel like even Billy would find that ridiculous!! It's meant to be viewed on a stage.

Provide them with cheat sheets that explain all the thees and thous and other archaisms so they can better understand them. Watch the Lion King before reading Hamlet. Take themes from Shakespeare and apply them to modern situations. Just giving up on reaching your students is lazy teaching.  2) these students are already disadvantaged and underprivileged. Removing Shakespeare from the curriculum for them just disadvantages them more by eliminating the cultural capital that Shakespeare provides, which they may need in college."

The best schools I've studied were the ones that had a cohesive mission that aligned both teachers and administrators. Having the professionals in the school working towards the same goal and supporting each other in the process - that's the best recipe for success I've seen."

I would like to add that I think testing home-schooled students periodically is a very good idea. Students who are home-schooled will have to pass the SAT or ACT test to be able to go to college. At that point, it would be too late to really do the catching up that would need to be done to correct significant learning gaps. For the older child, you might look at the PSAT test which is given as early as 8th grade in some places. That test would also tell you if he/she is on trace academically.

education,3ai9so,YourPureSexcellence,17,Sat Jun 20 13:07:39 2015 UTC,"First off, I think it's terrific that you care so much about your brother and you are consciously working with him to develop really important math and literacy skills.  I am a little concerned with your ""fervor"" though... he's five and there is nothing to ""fear"" when it comes to his intellectual development right now.  In children with a typical developmental pattern, most will learn to decode by the age of 7 with ample opportunities to listen, speak, read, and write with others.  These opportunities should come primarily in the form of spontaneous and intrinsically interesting activities and by family that pays attention to the developing child through play and conversation.   Five years is time for exploration.  If he is curious about letters and words and sounding out and spelling, then indulge his curiosity, but don't ""hammer"" him with concepts.  Same thing for math.    Do not use rewards to get him to read or do math.  Reading and arithmetic should be reward in itself. Extrinsic rewards is a quick path to disengagement, because rewards undermine natural curiosity (rewards = prize for doing something unpleasant).  Curiosity will trump anything when it comes to learning.  I would be working at developing his listening and speaking vocabulary as much as possible through interaction with the real world.  Decoding is important and will happen if he's already accomplishing what you are describing.    Still, a fun resource - and it should always be a game - is this book (although I want to point out that the age range is 6-9 because that's the age where these skills are typically learned)."
education,3ai9so,NotACynic,-1,Sat Jun 20 14:43:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything up until your point about extrinsic rewards.  I'm not going to claim to know better, especially since I'm in my phone and can't make any citations, but I'd argue from my experience as a trainee teacher that extrinsic rewards form the basis for much of classroom management and are used in ""outstanding"" level classrooms.  Children can't always have that intrinsic desire to learn, and extrinsic rewards can be used effectively at first to motivate some children.  And that's the key, this could is 5, it's common for 5 year olds to new more extrinsic rewards because they can't grasp the intrinsic values of things yet.  (This part may be controversial, so if you disagree I'm afraid I can't reinforce myself right now with any reading.  Sorry)  You are right though, relying on then to heavily is bad for the reasons you stated.  But my point is to avoid people dismissing extrinsic rewards altogether.    This guy knows his brother, if extrinsic rewards are used to harbour curiosity, there is nothing wrong with them.  Again, I'm not disagreeing with you entirely, just making a justification for extrinsic rewards.  Other than that (almost lexical) gripe, I second what you said.  Though I don't know if it means much from me."
education,3ai9so,GracefulxArcher,9,Sat Jun 20 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"I think NotACynic has it right--a five year old should not need extrinsic rewards. The pleasure of reading and figuring things out is certainly enough--at this age, and, if encouraged, at any age.  While some schools use rewards like stickers and candy, you have to remember that they are leading structured learning of groups of kids.  When you are working one-on-one with a kid, you can tap into his curiosity much more easily."
education,3ai9so,theMstates,2,Sat Jun 20 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"The question, I think, becomes: where does intrinsic motivation come from?  If you believe everyone has a natural intrinsic desire to learn how to read, then what you said makes sense.  If you believe, like I do, that all goals (beyond survival) are environmentally acquired (that is, your upbringing determines what you consider worth your time) then extrinsic motivation may have a place in young children's learning, where intrinsic values haven't yet emerged.  If you concede to my point there, assuming my premise is sound (which I admit is a big assumption to make) then the question that follows is whether or not a five year old has had the time to gain the intrinsic values mentioned.  I don't believe all five year olds have, and if some haven't, then using a variety of tactics is better than limiting your use of motivation, in my opinion.  This is speculation though since I don't have access to anything to back my point up."
education,3ai9so,GracefulxArcher,3,Sat Jun 20 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"All of what you said makes sense to me. I do think children have a natural curiosity about the world that will continue if it is encouraged. Since it is a sibling who is encouraging this academic growth, I think he can go a long way in setting the environment that would stimulate natural curiosity and excitement about learning this summer. Go on trips to the zoo, and read the signs. Visit the library, pick some books, and read them together right then and there. I think that sort of activity will be more enjoyable and more helpful in the long run."

education,3ai9so,GracefulxArcher,2,Sun Jun 21 09:09:51 2015 UTC,"I am going to jump into the motivation conversation.  With someone so young, particularly with reading, you intrinsic motivation should be the goal.  I was almost held back from leaving the first grade because of my low reading level.  My parents pushed me to read and I got better, but I didn't enjoy it.  However the next year I found a book that I wanted to read but couldn't and that gave me my own motivation to learn to read.  And it is from that motivation that I gained my life long love of books.    If the only goal is to impart knowledge or skills, extrinsic works and is often the easier path.  But I am guessing a concerned older brother/sister isn't focusing on test grades."
education,3ai9so,Luskar421,8,Sat Jun 20 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"Rewards might be used in many classrooms, that doesn't make them something to promote or encourage. They certainly shouldn't be in your initial approach or plan, perhaps as a last resort & then only used sparingly. Especially as OP is  not talking about a reluctant learner. It does sound like there is potential for the 'lessons' to overtake the interactions though. The priorities should be on making sure the lessons are fun & interesting to the child, so that he wants to learn more. Not just do it for a reward, or because he feels pressure from his brother. Because this child has a long life of school ahead of him, it will be easier if he is excited & interested in learning. He sounds like an average kid- so let's assume he enjoys play, is still curious and gets joy out of discovering & learning. There is plenty of scope there to make the learning fun, interesting and self rewarding. Such as:    Promote fun with language- fun with rhyming & alliteration (books, songs, making up your own rhymes) To promote an awareness of letter sounds. Make them silly, use different voices, really emphasis different sounds.  Head to libraries & bookstores to discover favourite books- fiction & non-fiction, so that your brother can become fascinated by what books have to offer, then as you are looking at them, teach incidentally, and as it is relevant, drip feeding information. i.e This word starts with the same letter as your name. Listen and respond to his interest in the words & letters, but don't let it be your entire focus. Promote the love of language & reading first & foremost.  Set up imaginary play scenarios- e.g playing shop- Make money, price labels, menus for a cafe, use real props (cans, coins, takeaway menus)  as well as making some. Let him take the lead in play- let him choose who plays what role, make suggestions for what goes on the menu. Promoting his ability to explain, discuss & negotiate will also boost his vocabulary- which is needed for being a proficient reader. This also provides play based scenarios to drip feed real information about letters & numbers. While he is captivated in a fun game, and is motivated to learn as he sees the real life purpose of knowing that information.  Go on letter & number hunts around your neighbourhood, take a camera, set challenges ""how many number 5's can you find?"" Take a clipboard & pen, record your findings. Let him write however he writes (don't correct him). Let him see you write (Make sure to role model correct letter formation, print the letters & use correct letter starting points don't write all in capitals!)  Use resources like playdough, lego to develop fine motor skill & strength for pencil control. If he enjoys these activities, you can take pictures of your favourite creations and make up books & stories about them. Perhaps make your own instruction manuals for how to build the lego creations he invents.  Play ball outside to promote eye tracking needed for reading, hand strength for writing.  Bake/cook together. Look through recipes to find recipes you like. Write shopping lists together. Plan a budget, go to the markets together, let him look for the things on the list- matching words on the list to the label. Let him help follow the recipe, counting out ingredients, mixing & stirring, scooping all good for developing muscle control & co-ordination. Also promotes scientific thinking- our mixture looks to wet/dry what ingredient should we add?  Write postcards, send pictures to family members. Ask them to send things back.  Use photos and drawings to make your own books. Don't focus so much on the correctness at this stage, more on the motivation & building interest. Be a good role model, and focus on what your brother can do really well. Be specific with your praise, praise effort rather than 'being clever'.    Basically look for fun, real life practical applications of reading, writing & maths. Make the learning relevant to every day life. Drip feed the 'teaching' rather than formal instruction. As your brother's interest develops he will want to know more. Try and avoid using a deficit model when you think of your brother (Don't focus on what he can't do) Instead build on what he can. Prioritise building self confidence, a willingness to try his best, a willingness to try new things, to cope with mistakes, to persist with difficult tasks. Those are the dispositions that will help him thrive at school. If he knows how to do those things, then ANYTHING he needs help learning will be easier.  You are a good brother for doing this :)"

education,3ai9so,GracefulxArcher,2,Sat Jun 20 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"This is a really complicated issue. How learning and achievement motivation develops is very difficult to determine and psychology hasn't figured it all out.  However, there is a mountain of evidence that supports Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan) which I referenced above that has shown that curiosity and engagement is undermined - over and over and over again - when rewards are introduced.  The chain of logic goes like this - ""if I am getting a reward for this activity, it's because the activity has no value by itself, so why would I do this activity without the reward?""  Using extrinsic rewards are more often a self-perpetuating tactic.  Once they are used, it is nearly impossible to not use them.    I will agree there are situations where extrinsic rewards are necessary - particularly when there is one teacher and 22 seven-year-olds in a classroom.  I would say, as well, that those situations should be actively avoided as much as possible in the classroom...through thoughtful lesson planning and regular reflection on the kinds of verbal and non-verbal messages sent in the classroom.    When we're talking about an older sibling interacting with a younger brother, then there is absolutely no good reason to use rewards."

You can practice more by reading a book and having him tell you which word you read first. Ask him what direction we read in. Where do we go when you get to the end of a line? Have him point to the word as you're reading as you read out loud (and watch to see he doesn't get tricked in thinking two syllable words are different words). It's small stuff but making sure he can do this well will set him up for success when his other reading skills develop.   The other thing that comes to mind is sight words. You're doing the right thing but orienting him to the letters in words and thinking forward to sounding out, but there are so many common english words that 1. Can't easily be decoded and 2. Show up everywhere. You're thinking of Dolch words when you say that list the guy made in the 20s. Go back to that! The pre-primer list is a good place to start.

The best lesson for this kid to learn is that a) you don't know everything, and b) even when you're the smartest in the room, you still have to treat others with respect, no matter how smart they are.

And I don't like how everyone in the comments is assuming he's an asshole [this next part is directed toward the entire thread, not just you]. He's admitted to two accounts of smart mouthing. It's high school. People have bad days. Without knowing more information, it's unfair to assume that he's a jerk of a teenager.   For example, one year in high school I had four teachers. Two disliked me, one was ambivalent towards me, and one liked me. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't mean and I tried not to be snarky. And I was by no means the smartest kid in the class, though I was smart. I was disliked not for being intentionally rude to my teachers but for being honest. I didn't have much of a filter.   For example, my English teacher was mad one day because our whole class had misunderstood her instructions about something and she kept saying ""is it me?"" while we were all basically scared and avoiding eye contact. I apparently nodded my head (I did not know I was doing this) so she asked me to explain what she was doing wrong. So, thinking she wants me to offer her constructive criticism (it was English class after all, and that's what she said), I very politely stated some of the things she had been saying/doing that were causing conflict in the class. She did not like that.   Another time, our science teacher had been fired but was allowed to finish out the school year, so she was not invested in teaching us anything. She tried to teach us stoichiometry but the only people in the class who understood were the four people (myself included) who had learned it the previous year. The four of us stayed after school and taught the rest of the class. She also didn't like me because after the incident with the English teacher, I sort of became the voice of my class, so I was the one to tell her things such as how we didn't understand why we were reading My Sister's Keeper instead of learning biology.  My history teacher liked me because I thought critically about things and brought up a lot of interesting questions, but our personalities clashed and also he thought I was being intentionally disruptive when in fact I was being unintentionally disruptive (I was quite clumsy...also there was a 'cocaine' incident but that was my friend's fault). He was also very sarcastic so I could never tell if he was serious or not but when I interpreted things literally he would think that I was doing it to be annoying (I wasn't).  My math teacher liked me because I wanted to learn even though I struggled with it and because I was nice and I volunteered to help her with stuff and school events and the like.  I'd never been disliked by so many teachers in one year and I haven't been since. I don't know why I decided to share all of that, but I think my point is that there are always circumstances that we are unaware of. This was a nice article and I thought his response was civil and honest. Until there's more information, there's no reason to assume he's a bad kid."

I'm not sure it's true younger teachers are more radical, but what you're suggesting is an expansion of tenure (ie, due process) to all teachers, not a changing of the system.  I mean, I view tenure as a band-aid on a bad situation. I'd rather have, as they have elsewhere, termination for cause implied in all employment contracts. (In some countries, you can't fire anybody without demonstrable cause.) And even that is a band-aid. I'd rather eliminate the employer-employee relationship entirely, and replace it with worker control of their workplaces."

Tenure in an education sense is usually when you get off annual contract and at that point they have to have a documented reason and evidence to let you go, most of us call it due process. That's pretty much what youre talking about but you want it to apply to everyone regardless of length of service."
education,3ae3zx,nobodytrickedme,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"I think most people agree that it needs to be relatively easy for a school - or any employer - to decide that a new employee isn't working out, for whatever reason.  Maybe they don't get along with anyone, or they looked great on paper but have trouble doing an adequate job in the classroom, or they have trouble making it to school on time... or whatever.  That is a far more likely situation than a teacher who has been performing satisfactorily for years suddenly ""going bad.""  If you accept this, then it makes sense to ask teachers to take a job for a limited time on the understanding that the employment is provisional; and then to offer them full employment, with strong due process protection, after that is done.  If you insist on the same protections for a new teacher in their first week that you'd hope to offer to an established teacher with a record of success in the school, then you end up either promising unreasonable amounts of process to new teachers and getting entangled in paperwork for necessary personel decisions; or else extending weaker protections than you'd ideally want for established teachers.  So that's the general reasoning behind why it takes a couple years to qualify for tenure.  I think a lot of people who follow this debate from the sidelines tend to confuse tenure with seniority - the idea that salaries, promotions, etc. should be awarded partly based on length of employment, rather than exclusively based on demonstrated job performance.  Many of the arguments I hear against tenure are actually arguments against seniority.  I have a lot less sympathy for seniority-based salary and promotions than I do for tenure.  I see no reason to assume that older teachers are better.  But tenure doesn't make that assumption.  A teacher who just got tenure has the same due process rights as a teacher with 30 years in the district.  It's just the first few years, where you are proving yourself, that are exempted, because the school does need to have the right to make a subjective judgement call about whether its new teachers are working out."

These are things that tenured teachers can be fired for. All that's required is documentation to demonstrate that these are real issues. It's not at all unreasonable to expect people to show up to work on time but it's also not at all unreasonable that it you're firing someone citing habitual tardiness that you can actually demonstrate habitual tardiness.  Even first year teachers have been through student teaching and several years of preparatory courses. We know how to read clocks."
education,3ae3zx,syd_malicious,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:29:35 2015 UTC,"Not showing up on time is maybe the one example where it wouldn't be very difficult to quickly correct a hiring mistake.  But not getting along with others, just not showing the same energy that they had during interviews, being unable to establish positive relationships with students or parents... those are subjective matters that are not just a matter of documenting them and citing some clear-cut line.  To actively fire a teacher with cause, the school would probably need to bring in impartial third parties, at considerable cost, to examine the situation and recommend an action.  I've hired employees, and even when hiring someone with a decade of documented job experience, I'd be terrified to make a decision if I knew the decision would be subject to that kind of scrutiny if the employee didn't work out.  In fact, I now work for a large software company famous for very strict hiring, and accepting only a tiny percentage of applicants... and these things still happen sometimes.  We need to admit that initial hiring decisions are a lot of luck.  Maybe your student teaching weeded out unmotivated teachers, but that doesn't mean all of them do.  Certainly no amount of coursework guarantees that anyone is prepared to succeed - especially with the thiriving industry of cheating in universities these days.  No matter what happens, every time a school hires a new teacher based on interviews and references, they are taking a risk that the teacher is going to be bad for the school.  So no, tenure from the first day on the job doesn't sound like a great idea at all."

Anecdote time:  I never took required reading seriously. I also never took math and science seriously. Because I never had the choice and an A never meant much to me because it seemed meaningless. I kept a 3.3 GPA because I was afraid of failing and I found some stuff intriguing. And I trapped myself.   I enjoy teaching because of the choice I have. My wife is stuck in a job where she has little choice. She does really well, but at a cost of her sanity. I did better than her in school out of fear of ending up like my parents. Kids shouldn't be driven by fear, and many are - like my AP classes.   Businesses need innovators. Drones aren't cutting it anymore."

I know it's not a popular position for a teacher to hold, but I see the end results of students - students who can't make choices, have no idea what future they'd want to make for themselves, and have to be fed material in a binary form.   You can call it the effect of NCLB, but I still think incentives are perverse, rules are invisible, and there are multiple stakeholder disagreements that leave kids in the lurch.   My only disagreement is the idea that there are some kids suited for this. We need to nurture choice, curiosity, and, well, the internal drive to strive."

I agree the factory model isn't perfect, but he's not offering any models as solutions. Paying teachers more (which I support) does not change the factory model. Decision makers (politicians, often with no curriculum theory background whatsoever) must change their way of thinking to allow a more diverse curricular atmosphere.  Check out the report The Future of the Curriculum by the Ben Williamson for the MacArthur Foundation to get a sense of where curriculum theorists see us headed. (Quest to Learn and Partnership for 21st Century Skills each have promise.)  Part of the problem is richer, more engaging models don't scale well. Policy and decision makers as well as stake holders view education through business lenses. How many students can we teach and can we do it cheaper? They want to see cheap, scalable models but we're discovering that cheap isn't good and good isn't cheap. There's the business adage ""You can have it good, fast or cheap; pick two."" The timetable is somewhat fixed. ""Fast"" isn't possible because we have to educate adolescents as they emerge through different developmental stages. So you have this dichotomy: good or cheap. (Politicians don't want to raise taxes.)    Because of our inability to change our way of thinking, we have an inability to change our way of teaching."

Universal standards and curriculum necessarily invite bias - it becomes a battle where every interest group attempts to assert their ideal model of education on all.  What starts with big concepts: ""Reading and writing are THE most essential skills in society and need much more time."" ""I think we should focus more on STEM!"" ""Social studies is a tragically underrepresented aspect of education!""  Gets more focused: ""It is necessary that citizens 'properly' understand the original intentions from the founding of this country.""

""I think the founding is less important than understanding the powerful social movements like labor in the late 19th century and civil rights in the mid-20th century.""

The absorption of lead is one that is more prevalent in older city environs, so it is not one I would have thought on. My experience would have suggested that instability in living conditions has a greater negative force on student performance, so I was engaged  in something new as I read.    These are not the only characteristics that depress outcomes, nor are they necessarily the most important.     We see from John Hattie's research the importance of certain factors in improving outcomes, so it was still a surprise to read:   That students’ social and economic characteristics shape their cognitive and behavioral outcomes is well established, yet policymakers typically resist accepting that non-school disadvantages necessarily depress outcomes.   with   This report describes how social class characteristics plausibly depress achievement and suggests policies to address them.   and   But educators can do more, seizing opportunities to coordinate school improvement with community services that ameliorate socioeconomic disadvantage—services such as early childhood care and education, nurse home-visiting programs, after-school and summer opportunities, school-based health centers, and sponsorship of community lead cleanup.    Strong school or district leadership is of paramount importance to advancing the community school. (Marzano and Hattie both confirm this with abundant research and detail.) I am not sure if the authors realize that these expectations of educators require a common vision and an uncommon school. I work at one of those (I will share the name if you wish to PM me. I am privileged to work there.) yet how much easier to get that kind of advocacy in a more wealthy district.  In contrast to the significant evidence for each of these five social class characteristics having a negative impact I did not see as diligent support for the ""plausible pathways"" to ameliorating or eradicating these ills. Further, reading these three quotes together creates an impression that the suggested policies within this article will be of limited effect.   TL;DR: A primer in support of educators seeking to improve the community as well as the school without definitive protocols to bring about success."

As someone who is invested in the world of Education, I'm not going to simply give up trying to close the Achievement Gap because there are significant social issues out of my control. Despite those social disadvantages, I've seen schools turn around and successfully close the gap. Those disadvantages are real and hugely significant, but too often I think they are used as an excuse. I've seen schools succeed despite those challenges among it's students, so I find the title somewhere between ""wrong"" and ""misleading."""
education,3a2aj7,JohnnyCwtb,5,Tue Jun 16 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a false dichotomy, and I think the authors would agree as well.  But their point is that policy makers too often ignore those social issues for moral/political reasons and disadvantaged people are suffering because of it.    The authors do not believe these five particular issues are outside of the control of either educators or politicians.  While a given party may not be able to do everything, this does not mean they can't do anything.  The authors also acknowledge that some people may use socioeconomic disadvantages as an excuse for poor performance, but it's still important to recognize those socioeconomic realities in order to create policies to address them.  Finally, they acknowledge that some people face every disadvantage and still overcome, but the unfortunate truth is that the vast majority will not."
education,3a2aj7,stoopkid13,3,Tue Jun 16 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"So I think the issue of undoing societal disadvantage is hugely (virtually solely) within the power of politicians, but I disagree that it's the job of educator's to fix these issues.   ""But educators can do more, seizing opportunities to coordinate school improvement with community services that ameliorate socioeconomic disadvantage—services such as early childhood care and education, nurse home-visiting programs, after-school and summer opportunities, school-based health centers, and sponsorship of community lead cleanup""  If political leaders want to set aside money for these things, I'm 100% in favor of them - but I think it's absurd to ask already overwhelmed teachers and schools to find time/money for those  activities. Or at least, I think everything on that list has an inverse relationship between cost/feasibility and how effective it will be at combating social disadvantage in disadvantaged populations.   My point is that while social issues obviously have a huge effect on the world of Education, I think it's asking a bit much for teachers for schools and teachers to fix those problems in addition to their responsibility to teach content. Yes, a talented teacher will find ways of doing both, but if you're going to spend x/y time and money developing teachers, I think you'll get more distance out of pedagogical/content training than trying to make teachers into effective social workers.   Yes, these things are deeply related, but I'm more in favor of letter teachers be teachers and putting the responsibility of combating social disadvantage on the government social problems that specialize in those particular areas.   Also, for what it's worth, I agree that poverty is the single biggest obstacle to providing quality education to all of our students. Yet, 50 years after The War on Poverty, I'm not convinced that it's something that can be solved in my lifetime. In contrast, I've seen the achievement gap between poor and wealthy students closed in just three years of high quality education.   For educators, I think there's more to be gained for your current students by developing your abilities as a teacher than developing your abilities as a social advocate."

Test scores can't measure how successfully we've accomplished this goal thus the entire concept of closing the achievement gap by closing test scores is meaningless.  Research shows that standardized test scores are very weakly linked to future success.  Expecting to bring kids out of poverty by raising these scores is thus quite misguided.    My concern is that we've convinced people that closing those numbers is sufficient and it's not.  Resources are being poured into raising scores, often through instruction that focuses on skill-drill and specific test taking strategies.  These strategies and scores might help kids get into colleges but they are useless once there.  However, once we see the scores are closed we often assume our job is done.  But we've failed to actually teach skills that are highly correlated to college success (self-advocacy, self-determination, intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and executive functioning skills).

Almost every study done on the influence of SES on test scores has recognized a positive correlation between SES level and test scores (for all intents and purposes, lets simplify the debate by using test scores to represent the achievement gap). See below for examples:  EARLY TEST SCORES, SCHOOL QUALITY AND SES: LONGRUN EFFECTS ON WAGE AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES by Janet Currie and Duncan Thomas  The odd correlation between SES and achievement: why haven’t more critical questions been asked? A call to action by Grant Wiggins  So my question to you once again is: How does a teacher overcome an obstacle such as SES with teaching practices alone?   Another side question: How does a teacher close a large gap (I'm a teacher who regularly sees students reading on the kindergarten level in 7th grade) in the space of 1 school year while concomitantly addressing students' social and emotional well being, lower SES, unsupportive or neglectful parents, little to no access to health care, and the myriad of other issues that low-income students bring with them into the classroom?"

education,3a2aj7,JohnnyCwtb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:08:58 2015 UTC,"First side question: Lots of good practices.  Very carefully choose content that is both rich in rigor and complexity, as well as interesting to the student population you're teaching.  Use effective behavioral management systems that maximize learning time. These will differ based on the personalities of the teacher and the student, but I've seen a variety of teachers/students find systems that worked for them.  Use lots of accountability tools. Leverage independent work so students are often engaged in actually doing something, but make sure to pair it with a ton of accountability systems so you don't need to watch over everyone's shoulder all the time.   Develop a culture of error in your classroom where you normalize making mistakes, and use it as an opportunity to explore what went wrong. If you normalize ""getting it wrong"" then it makes it much easier for students to discover their mistakes and get help from the teacher/peers.  Practice. You can call it ""test prep"" (I do) but it doesn't need to be boring. Break down the exam into it's component competencies and find interesting and varied ways of endlessly drilling students on those competencies. Basically, I think the standards are fundamentally sound, so it's just a question of making sure your lessons are properly aligned to those standards.   I study teachers who routinely close the gap (in both charter and district schools) and these are the things that they're doing. (I call it ""studying the bright spots."")  I've seen teachers close 3-5 year gaps in one year, but you'd need a ton of support to close an 8 year gap in one year. Usually what I see in schools that are ""closing the gap"" is that students will come into 5th grade at a pre-K level, and it'll take until 8th grade to get them above grade level. Silver lining though, assessment is moving towards value-add instead of raw score, so if you can move your 7th graders from K-3, then you've got a hell of a lot more movement than most students of privilege will see. I'd still count that as a win.  I don't mean to minimize the challenges that poor students face, those are the same challenges my own students faced and I know them well. Hell, I've heavily dedicated my life to Education and if I could have perfect schools or eradicate the problems you mention I would do the latter in a heartbeat. I agree that they are the bigger problem. I just also don't think they're solvable. And in contrast, we can make schools significantly better - better enough to compensate for those inequalities - in just a few years.   So for politicians and policy makers, sure, pressure them for social reform before school reform. But when you're talking to Educators - I think you have much better leverage to make them better teachers than you have to make them better caretakers."
education,3a2aj7,JohnnyCwtb,2,Sat Jun 20 23:29:26 2015 UTC,"I'll take these point by point:   You may or may not realize just how much of the content is dictated in Title 1 schools. We are given a canned curriculum that even has scripts for us to read. Yes, I said that correctly; scripts. That being said, as I gain more experience, I realize the utter ridiculousness of having a canned curriculum and am going in my own direction in regards to content. Behavior management systems are a given for any teacher who wants to reach their students. You are right that they are especially important in lower-income classrooms. The difference lies in the fact that in suburban classrooms (yes, I have experience in these types of classrooms as well), you may get 1-2 behavior issues in your ""worst"" class. In lower-income classrooms, you are looking at anywhere from 5-12 genuinly disruptive students or more. I'm talking about students who have absolutely no desire to do any work or behave according to your so called ""Behavioral management system."" Consequences are mostely innefective (especially without a supportive admin team, which is sadly the case most times). Rewards are laughed at. Relationship building is viewed with apprehension. There is no consequence you can dish out that will be worse than any of their lives'. Kids who have no structure after school who play video games or hang out on the streets will not ""buy-in"" to even the coolest rewards  system because, let's face it, there is no reward that can compete with having no rules at home.  Accountability systems are wonderful. They really allow the class to build a positive culture. The issue with accountability systems in lower-income vs. upper SES schools is the fact that the type of collaboration expected in a classroom with accountability systems is ingrained in the suburban students, which is taken for granted. Lower-income students need to be taught these skills. Not only that, they must be drilled repeatedly for the majority, if not the entire school year. This is time that could be spent on shrinking the ""achievement gap.""  Culture of error? I like that. I always stress the fact that my students will fail during the course of the school year and that part of being a successful person is dealing with failure. The issue with this philosophy is that oftentimes, students in lower-income schools cannot fail. The grading system is rigged to promote them whether they do a ton of work or no work at all. Every assignment handed in can receive no lower than a 50%. This makes it nearly impossible to fail and yet, up to 25% of students are failing in certain classes. Why should they work at all when they know that they will move on to the next grade regardless of how much work they turn in? Since many low-SES students come in without the same social skills as their suburban counterparts, getting help from peers falls under the same category as accountability tools; meaning it needs to be continuously drilled into them until they can do it. Practice--What you call practice, I call ""drill and kill."" When low-SES students spend inordinate amounts of time preparing for the test, they are losing out on time that could be spent on developing their intellectual curiosity. I'm assuming that you are talking about the Common Core standards, and yes, they are fundamentally sound in my opinion as well. However, when students are entering class 8 years behind, the grade level standards are replaced with remedial instruction. Yes, you can challenge the students to meet your expectations but it is not really fair to expect a student to understand an assignment that is 8 grade levels above their current ability. Teachers closing 3-5 year gaps are miracle workers and should be commended. The students that progress 8 years in just 3 school years is amazing. In my opinion however, this simply cannot be done through ""best practices"" and these students had a change in their home life that allowed them to make these gains. If you have to be a caretaker for your 3 younger siblings while your single mom works 3 jobs, no amount of teaching practices will overcome this obstacle. If your mom overdosed on drugs the night before, no amount of teaching practices will overcome this.    You are absolutely right that a single teacher cannot control the inequalities that we face as a nation and so should focus their attention to what we can control. However, you make it seem as if following best practices will magically erase years of neglect, poverty, abuse, and inequality and this is simply not the case."
education,3a2aj7,TheDudeAbides31,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback :)  I think it's worth pointing out that for me, the unit of measure worth investigating are schools, not teachers. Yes, you have to go into teacher's classrooms to see what they're doing, but when I see success, it's usually because of decisions being made at the school level that enable success at the classroom level.  So when I talk about a culture of error, or management systems, or content - those things are executed by teachers, and they need to be executed by teachers in a consistent and coherent manner, but it's really about finding the right balance between the guidance offered at the school level and the right amount of autonomy given at the classroom level.   In defense of scripts, I've seen them move schools from performing far worse than predicted to only slightly worse than predicted. If you're working with a truly bottom-of-the-barrel group of teachers and the administration has no capacity to train them, then sometimes (but rarely) turning the teachers into robots is a step up (although usually only when the starting point is when the teachers are incompetent, unqualified, abusive babysitters.) In nearly all of my other experiences though, scripts have handicapped schools. I've seen this a lot more since  Pearson started producing Common Core modules. Scared Principals/Boards have decided to implement the modules as mandatory scripts instead of the guidelines and examples they should be. I've never seen a school who does this do more than ""reach average."" In all of the bright spot schools I studied (ones that were closing the achievement gap between poor black students and their wealthy white peers) the administration made sure to give the teachers freedom in how they executed their lessons. The phrase ""adapt"" rather than ""adopt"" defined the difference. One superintendent (of an incredible, gap closing school) used the phrase ""you can use them, or change them, or throw them out"" when talking about the modules. All this is to say that it's a shame that so many schools have been scared into using scripts, because it's really holding them back imo.  When I talk about behavioral ""systems"" I mean school wide systems. The same infraction should carry the same punishment in all classrooms in that school, and it should be enforced with nearly identical consistency in all classrooms. Schools need to work hard to get teachers on the same page for how and when and what they do when students violate the system, but very quickly it becomes hugely effective. Particularly with kids that come from unsafe or uncertain homes, being able to accurately anticipate the consequences (for themselves and others) of actions ends up being a huge comfort. In schools have consistent, school-wide management systems (it's worth pointing out that they need to be fair to the students too, consistently harsh isn't going to win anyone over) very quickly (like in 3 months) buy into the idea that the school is a safe place, and they look forward to coming and staying. That, I think, is a pre-requisite for any kind of academic advancement.  Like what I've been harping on, accountability skills happen as part of a school culture more than what one teacher can do in her classroom. If you have all teachers on the same page with the same accountability expectations, then it's something you can spread out across all classrooms, and reinforce across all classrooms, not something you build up in one class over the course of a whole year just to lose. Yes, charter schools are able to build school-wide systems easier than district schools, but when I study odds-beating district schools, they've also managed to create these school-wide systems. In all things, whether it's teacher autonomy of content, or behavioral management, or accountability, I think having the whole school of teachers being on the same page (led by the administration) is essential.   Whether you call it a culture of error, or grit, or resiliency, it's (I think) an essential skill on the day-to-day level, failure should be normalized as best as you can. The schools who do this well use phrases like ""I'm glad you made that mistake, that's going to help everyone in the room understand this better."" Ideally a teacher should have control over whether a student has gotten a problem (or a test) wrong or right. Even if the school is going to force the promotion of students who are no ready for the next grade (ends up being necessary - or at least the norm - if they're coming in several grade levels too low) you can still work on a culture of error in the day-to-day, at the classroom level.  When I hear ""drill and kill"" I think of rote call and response of various skills. And I do think that has it's place in some times and places, but not most of them. What I'm talking about is using lots of formative assessments to identify which standards students are struggling with, and then prioritizing review and incorporation of those standards in future lessons. Schools/teachers that are closing the achievement gap are doing so because they've had enough formative assessments to know precisely what their kids don't know. And they triage these gaps with spiral review in their Do Nows, in their questioning, in their Exit Tickets and in their homework. Collect lots of data on what your students do and don't understand, and spend more time on the stuff they don't understand. In ELA this might look like whole group reading with intermittent interruptions by the teacher to question them about the setting - if they're having trouble with settting. In Math, it might look like the teacher unbundling all of the components of a procedure that the students should, but don't, understand as they're working through how to solve a larger problem. In really great, gap-closing, schools, teachers differentiate their HW/Exit Tickets/Independent Work so that students are working on precisely the areas that give them the most trouble.   Among my own students I had those issues you speak of. Also students who were evicted and living out of a homeless shelter. Also a student whose little brother was put into the hospital because another student in the same class curb-stopped his teeth out. These kids have to deal with some serious shit, and it would be insane not to acknowledge it or discount it in some way. Yet, the kinds in that class did achieve multiple year gains. There are day-to-day setbacks, even month-to-month setbacks. But in the classrooms I've studied and the classrooms I've taught in, it has been done. It's just really, really hard.  I don't mean to say that it'll happen magically or easily, only that I've seen it happen. And I've seen it happen in schools that did not have the capacity to address the underlying social issues. Some schools can do both - like Harlem Children's Zone. I love their approach and I think it's a great model for schools that have lots of resources and good community support. But in most cases, schools really only have control over what happens in their classroom - and in those cases, I think effort is better spent on promoting good systems than trying to compensate for neglect, poverty, abuse and inequality.   Thanks again for your response."

education,39xkdw,ampfin,25,Mon Jun 15 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"you don't think that most private schools do a better job than most public schools?    No. The leading indicator of student achievement is the same between public and private schools: the income and education level of the parents.   Move students from low income and poor families into private schools and their achievement is statistically unlikely to improve.   It's why school vouchers are a failure (well, they do help some private schools stay afloat as a subsidy).  On paper, private schools may sometimes show better test scores, but the primary difference is the students themselves, not the quality of instruction.  What matters most to a student's education is what happens in the home. Half of all Americans are low income or living in poverty.   With poverty, many other negatives trend... physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse, learning disabilities, physical disabilities, serious psychological issues, sensory issues, malnutrition, reduced vocabulary, neglect, lack of enrichment opportunities, etc. etc. etc.  My regular, ordinary Title I elementary school (with roughly 50% low income families) has a staff psychologist, a 'safe room,' a 'sensory room,' and personal attendants who shadow students... not to provide personal instruction. They're paid to protect other students, staff and property from harm.   At least one, maybe more, students are so severe they receive at-home instruction... a position that is hard to fill because (as I heard) the last person left the position because she didn't feel safe. It's a step not taken lightly because it's so damn expensive to hire a teacher for a single student, but we're legally obligated to serve the discards of the charter school movement in my state.  The affluent families are given blanket special permission to transfer out-of-district if they transfer to charter schools, while poor families who depend on bus service make traditional public schools a gravity well of the most problematic students. And, of course, in my no-voucher state, private schools only have even more affluent students -- with parents who have the money to pay for private education.  So, no, I don't for a minute believe private schools are better than public schools. The students are the difference."

Driving fast matters, yes, but that doesnt mean the cars don't either, hense the false dichotomy.  Two identical drivers in two different cars might reach new york at different times. Conversely, maybe the difference in cars don't matter, but it would not be because drivers matter.  It could be because we have speed limits, a Ferrari is more similar to a Ford than people think, the make matters more than the model....  To go back to schools: yes, students' backgrounds are the best predictor of students' outcomes.  And yes, it's possible (and I would agree likely) that private schools perform the same as public schools once you control for students' backgrounds. But the only way to conclude that different types of schools have similar outcomes because outcomes are determined by students, is if we also assume that students are the only factor (which you admit is untrue). So the real answer is that private schools are comparable to public schools because they are in fact very similar except for their students, or spending more on per pupil spending doesnt matter, or private and public schools are so varied the distinction is meaningless, or some other factor related to schools. Essentially, you cant explain why two things are similar by pointing towards a third."

But that doesn't tell us if one type of school is better; it just tells us that there are more important factors.  Just because one variable is important, does not mean that others are unimportant--both variables could be important.  But you imply that because student family backgrounds matter, the type of school they attend does not matter, hence the false dichotomy (which by the way was my entire point which you seem to be avoiding; if you don't know what a false dichotomy is I suggest looking it up).  And your answer could have been more exhaustive if it explained why the differences between private/public schools are immaterial.

education,39xkdw,DrippingYellowMadnes,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"No. The leading indicator of student achievement is the same between public and private schools: the income and education level of the parents.   But bookchaser doesn't support that argument.  Or his/her support is that achievement is unlikely to improve because the student's family background hasn't improved.    bookchaser doesn't really explain what the key differences are between the schools themselves and if/why those differences matter.  It's a question that I think is worth exploring.  Instead, bookchaser focuses on differences between students, which might be important, but is something separate from differences between schools."
education,39xkdw,stoopkid13,0,Tue Jun 16 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It doesn't matter what the differences are between the school facilities, resources, teaching staff, etc. if the assessment tool used to measure student achievement indicates those differences (presumably better facilities, resources, etc. at a private school) show no statistically significant impact in the assessment results. What matters most is the income and education level of the parents. The only jump I'm making is to suggest the reason is the home life provided to these students. Everything else I've said is simply factual in nature."

They can reject poor kids, disabled kids, hungry kids, kids with parents in jail, and any other kid that they feel might drag down whatever metrics they're shooting for. There isn't a private school in the country that can take all comers and produce the same results as a robust, well resourced public school system with empowered educators."

education,39xkdw,DrippingYellowMadnes,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"Never mind that Marxism ignores the effect of incentives on behavior   Ah, good ol' ""human nature."" Marxism, and all the fields of study it has spawned over the past 150 years, and all the intellectual work and research, just happened to ignore “human nature.” It is amazing how this is presented as an intellectual critique, and the Marxist dialectic presented as anti-intellectual, when the human nature counterargument is based on the assumption that human motivation is monolithic, simplistic, and in no way influenced by external or personal factors that differ from place to place, person to person, era to era. It is intellectual laziness at its finest, because it relies on no research, or even personal observation beyond the behavior of a few extremely wealthy individuals.  The idea that human nature is greedy and selfish and that these are thus primary motivating factors that are ingrained in the way we behave has been debunked by studies performed by the University College of London, M.I.T., the University of Amsterdam, the University of Princeton, the University of Berkley, Washington State University, Emory and Carnegie Mellon [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. They're artificial, and exist as a by-product of our survival instinct. Under our current economic system, as well as its previous two exploitative iterations (feudalism and slavery), money equals survival. The more you have, the better your chances are.  This is supported by the works of evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith, anthropologist Robert Trivers, political scientist Robert Axlerod and Primatologist Frans De Waal, and economist/zoologist/evolutionary theorist Peter Kropotkin.  All of these go into detail into why human beings are much more cooperative, altruistic, reciprocal, mutualistic and empathetic with one another than they are selfish, greedy or egocentric. None deny that these latter aspects of behavior exist, but simply hold that they do not account for the concepts of emotional contagion, targeted helping, cultural transmission, consolation, game theory or self-recognition. If you can explain these with 'human nature is selfish and greedy', by all means I'd love to learn how.  Source #2, particularly, which is Dan Pink's seminar on Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose, reveals that once people earn enough money to satisfy their basic needs they become motivated by having a sense of autonomy (ie. the desire to be self-directed), mastery (ie. the urge to get better at things), and purpose in their work and life. Money is simply a means to those basic needs, and if you were to eliminate it altogether, and provide those means to the people another way, or for those means to be guaranteed/readily and freely available to them, people would no longer engage in the kind of behaviour you call ""greed"".  The need for food, water or shelter is biological -- a lack results in death. However, human society has changed how and why resources are gathered. The biological necessity is the same: humans need to eat, drink, sleep, stay out of the rain. But society has developed a way to transport current resources into the future for use in that future -- money. Thus, humans seek money.   and nevermind that there isn't a single example of communism producing a good outcome.   Sure, if you take Cold War propaganda at its word. It is intellectually dishonest (again) to ignore the manner in which Russia went from an ignored backwater of Europe to an economic superpower in a matter of years, as did China. There was indeed a human cost to this, though far less than is typically presented in propaganda. I am a Trotskyist and have little interest in defending Stalin, because he bureaucratized the USSR and created a new capitalist class, but claims of genocide applied to him have little validity.  For instance, the holodomor: The notion that the Holodomor was man-made by Stalin is a 30s fiction. The USA picked it up from the Hearst newspapers—anti-communist publications and perpetuated that fabrication precisely to build up the myth that it was caused by Communism. It was a terrible famine yes, but it was caused by two bad weather years, some bad planning and by the kulaks who slaughtered livestock and encouraged their sympathizers to do so as well. You can do your own research on the sources rather than parroting Western propaganda.  Read about it from Doug Tottle in his book Fraud, Famine and Fascism. The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard (Toronto: Progress Books, 1987). Tottle was affiliated with the Canadian Communist Party, and some of his statements are apologetic. But he did his homework on the fraudulent nature of this myth.  After WW2 the “man-made famine in Ukraine” myth became the credo of the pro-Nazi Ukrainian Nationalist groups, many of whose leaders were settled in the US by the CIA, and were funded to carry on their anti-Soviet propaganda. Until the early 1960s these fascist Ukrainian nationalist groups had terrorist cells within the USSR as well.  Today this myth is an integral part of the nationalist ideology of the state of Ukraine. The reactionary capitalists and former CPSU members who rule it have to construct a history that legimitizes Ukrainian nationalism.  This myth of the “man-made famine” is an integral part of the project of historical formation for Ukraine. Since Ukrainian nationalism has been fascist from the beginning, the only way it can be “legitimized” is by ferocious anti-communism.  The gulag – another HORROR of communism – is rivaled by the US, a capitalist state, which has more prisoners as a percentage of its population than Stalin’s Russia ever did.  Regardless, though, the “body count” thrown about so casually and without evidence in critique of socialism is not only inaccurate and out of context, but completely one-sided in that it refuses to acknowledge the far more massive body count of capitalism, including deaths due to imperialism, genocide, slavery, child labor, sweatshop labor, and a host of other human rights abuses that can be traced back to the means of production being run for the profit of a specific class. Even if we were critical of Soviet wealth, or the wealth of other socialist countries, built on human rights abuses (and to some extent they were), it is nothing compared to the human rights abuses that formed the foundation of wealth for capitalist societies.  Where has socialism worked? Yugoslavia, Catalonia, and the Paris Commune, to name just a few. I can recommend some reading on them if you are intellectually honest (as you claim I am not) and want to actually inform yourself, instead of spouting off in ignorance. Cuba rejected American hegemony and done far better than Haiti, despite the former and the latter having very similar economic histories. Cuba has, in fact, eliminated homelessness, despite an illegal embargo imposed by the United States."

education,39xkdw,pierresito,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:22:31 2015 UTC,"I guess I should preface this by first stating that I just finished my second year of teaching.  And I'll be honest right now as well, I look down on inflexibility so the following statement is heavily biased against it.  A teacher should always keep growing, it shouldn't be a question of how many years they've paid their dues before they can hang up the apron so to speak.  We aren't frozen in time.  Just as our students change year after year, month after month, week after week so should we be striving to change and become better.  I am a hell of a lot better teacher this year than last year, this semester than last semester, and I think that all humans should be striving for that anyways.    But as for your question of if I can put that into a practical frame of reference? No I'm sure I can't.  If I could then it'd be something applicable that I would submit to my district tomorrow so they can start paying their teachers fairly.  Alas, much like a lot of people in this forum my sentiment can only be anecdotal:  OK, at my school the kindergarten teachers were passing kids on to first if they knew 14 letters of the alphabet.  Imagine that, first graders who didn't know the whole alphabet, let alone knew how to write their name.  They have been teaching for 20 years.  When a new principal came in and asked for more the response was... wanna guess?  ""But this is how we've always done it."" They didn't see anything wrong with a whole class of first graders being unable to read because that wasn't a problem 15 years ago.  Now this is a title 1 school, so things are already rough from the get go, but damn did that teaching mentality make things harder.  The bar they had set was outdated by a decade.  A third grade teacher would be on my case last year because I (fifth grade) wasn't doing packets with my kids.  ""Drill and Kill, that's what works"" was their mantra.  They have been teaching for 10 years and seeing as I was new they didn't think my program was steering me in the right direction.  The district had changed the year I came in to a modified ""reading workshop"" model and there was A LOT of push back from this teacher at every training my newbie first year self went to because even though the training had empirical data on why reading a SHIT TON was important, this teacher didn't like it.  I wish I was making this up.  There was no other reason given.  They just liked their worksheets better.  I'm new, I don't know any better, but I do know raw number proof... one side was giving me that, the teacher was just pulling the equivalent of ""didn't read lol"" in their classroom.  A fourth grade teacher would come in to ask me for advice on a weekly basis during this same year (which there is nothing wrong with, that wasn't the issue).  They are 13 years my senior in the teaching profession.  But she didn't ask me about what she actually needed help with (classroom management/culture, her voice rang through the halls as she berated kids daily) but instead on how to use anchor charts.  They had no idea their teaching style was a problem until another teacher asked the AP to stand outside her door for a few minutes.  The teacher was concerned since she heard them call kids stupid and idiots and blind because they couldn't solve a math problem... to which her advice had been ""YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER!""  But each of these teachers made more money than me this year since we're paid by seniority.  Even though I outperformed them in every metric (test scores, parent/teacher relationships, student surveys, fucking football games attended etc etc.)  Do I care? No not at all, I knew what I was gonna get paid when I came into this profession.  But if we're suggesting paying teachers based on what schools they work at and the way they perform then that metric measuring performance most certainly can't be ""How long have you been a teacher?""  It shouldn't be ""how well did your class do on the state tests"" but it most certainly shouldn't be ""how long have you taught"" either.  Because even though these teachers have taught for so long, they have become stagnant and ineffective long ago.  And for every one of them there are 3 teachers who are way better who have been working just as long as they have, but who get paid the same.  And to say that they ALL should get a raise just based off that and not merit would be insulting to those true excellent teachers who have grown and improved over their decade long career.  See the issue?"

education,39xkdw,ArguingWithAssholes,8,Tue Jun 16 01:44:25 2015 UTC,"I am from an alt cert program (not TFA).  I don't know how much training you need in the ""how"" of teaching before you begin.  In large part because it seems that education, as a field, doesn't use empirically supported techniques all that much.  The how that our district wants us to use is based on whatever is trending in educational circles, not what is supported by research.    .  I am came in with some idea of classroom management, but like other first year teachers I struggled and learned a lot.  My second year was a breeze and I enjoy my school and the kids.  I think that alt cert programs, and the field as a whole,  undervalue content knowledge and fluency.  And that it is really difficult to assess teacher ability.    .  Flipping a coin to determine if a teacher is above or below average will be correct 50% of the time.  There is some evidence that principal walk throughs get that right about 60% of the time.  VAM are a mess that don't really provide that much information on teacher ability.  In order to really judge these programs, you need to be able to evaluate the teachers they produce.  To do that accurately we need a better method to evaluate teachers."
education,39xkdw,MrPants1401,3,Tue Jun 16 02:54:18 2015 UTC,"I agree fully on the content knowledge component. I was an English Lit major instead of an Education major and honestly, I feel my depth of knowledge in my subject was far more helpful than any of the Education courses/alt-certification classes I was forced to take. Having actual knowledge about a subject, not just the ""how"" of teaching allows for greater exploration of a subject. Sure, taking some classroom management courses helped me, but I feel I was able to provide more for my students because I really knew what I was talking about."
education,39xkdw,cyvaris,5,Tue Jun 16 11:20:39 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, unless you're teaching a college level class, your content knowledge doesn't make much of difference. I took the alternative certification track after getting my BA in zoology. The thing is that knowing what you're talking about doesn't make you a great teacher. Knowing how to explain what you know to kids and knowing how to manage a classroom will get you much further. If I am some sure of a topic I'm teaching, I can always look up information to help me. But if I can't explain something I do know inside-out on a level that can be understood by a student, then that makes me a bad teacher."
education,39xkdw,Lewyso,8,Tue Jun 16 11:55:10 2015 UTC,"Knowing how to explain what you know to kids and knowing how to manage a classroom will get you much further.   I think that content fluency is important to know how to explain things to kids.  When I teach asymptotes I am also foreshadowing limits and using that language so when the kids see it next year, its not a brand new thing.  It also allows me to adjust more quickly on the fly since I can come at a topic from more angles. I don't think you need to have a degree in the topic that you are teaching, but you need to thoroughly understand the topic and the areas above and below it that interact with your material.  I don't think this makes a teach great, but I think it is a necessity for a teacher to be great.  I don't think you can get to the explanation without the knowledge.   But if I can't explain something I do know inside-out on a level that can be understood by a student, then that makes me a bad teacher.    Maybe, but this is an extremely limiting piece.  If you are constantly having to teach yourself things and interrupting class to go look up information to explain an idea, its slowing down your class you are there are going to be times you are wrote repeating and idea instead of communicating the entirety of a concept.  There are a fair amount of teachers at my school who can't teach off script.  On good days its fine, but when there is confusion, they can't adjust.  .  I also agree that behavioral management is important, but I think that this is mostly learned in the classroom.  Things like school culture and interpersonal relationships with the students play a huge role in this.  I don't know why you'd think a 4 year program would provide greater preparation than an Alt Cert."
education,39xkdw,MrPants1401,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:38:52 2015 UTC,"First of all, I never stated that a 4 year program would better prepare you to manage a classroom than an alternative certification. It is neither stated nor implied in my response. I simply believe that teachers would be better equipped to teach if they had some opportunity to learn classroom management. Not the theory of classroom management, but actually gain practice in a classroom before entering a teaching position full-time. I understand that this is the purpose of student teaching, but internships are provide an unrealistic experience to say the least.   Also, I don't know why you assume a teacher would interrupt a lesson to research a topic he was teaching in the middle of class. That would be both unprofessional and disruptive. A teacher does need to be versed in the subject they are teaching, but it isn't necessary to know the details. A good teacher anticipates questions students will ask and formulates responses to the questions AHEAD of time. If I am teaching a topic that I am rusty at or completely new to, I do my research when I begin the unit plan so I can make sure that I know what I'm talking about when I am teaching that topic. Additionally, I take the time to research connections that can be made between that subject and prior knowledge as well as looking at the misconceptions students can have."

Yes, the first year of teaching most of the TFA teachers are fucking clueless, so are most first year teachers in general.  The difference is that TFA teachers are receiving 70 plus hours of professional development and have MTLDs up their ass regarding data and planning forcing them to be focused on instruction and data in a way that most first year teachers are not.  How do I know?  Because I went through a traditional teaching program, taught for three years, then joined TFA and went through their preparation program and subsequent two years of support/professional development.  And guess what?  I'm a better teacher for it.  I learned to monitor progress and meet individualized needs in a way I never had in my traditional teaching program and I had the pleasure of watching some incredible people grow into amazing teachers and choose to stay in education beyond their two year commitment.   No, TFA isn't going to fix the problems in education, but it is also not the cause and everyone needs to stop attacking the teachers working within the organization because they feel threatened.   Do students in low income areas deserve veteran teachers?  Absolutely.  But the reality of the situation is that they aren't going to get them.  There's not a line of veteran teachers waiting for the positions TFA fills.  Generally there's a line of unqualified long term subs.  I'd take a caring, college-educated individual receiving ample professional development over a long term sub any day."
education,39xkdw,Justsaynotololcatz,14,Tue Jun 16 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"I understand some of what you're saying. I really think many TFA teachers really do care, and can help kids in need of help. But understand that some schools are hiring TFA'ers and using the availability of that low paid labor to undermine working conditions (unions, pay, working hours and expectations). Perhaps most devastating, TFA and the idea that it only takes a few weeks of training to become a teacher, undermines the profession of teaching."
education,39xkdw,Structure0,4,Tue Jun 16 00:34:52 2015 UTC,"TFA in no way states that it only takes a few weeks of training to become a teacher, in fact they know the opposite.  That's one of the reasons so much hands on professional development is provided the first year.  They are well aware their educators aren't prepared that first day of school.  In fact, due to feedback from critics regarding this they're piloting a new program where they recruit college students in their third year and begin enrolling them in education classes for the final year to help better prepare them to teach.   They're not attempting to undermine the profession of teaching and we cannot lay the blame of the state of the profession of teaching at their feet. Now, I'd like to clarify that I'm actually not a huge supporter of TFA, however I get tired of the misinformation.  As for schools using TFA'ers to undermine working conditions, that may be true in some areas, but it is not the norm.  I know in the area I taught TFA filled vacancies in schools no certified teachers would teach.  Each year these schools were full of long term subs because even TFA couldn't fill all their vacancies.   I think it's an unfortunate fact that the state of education is so abysmal that TFA is needed, but in many areas, it truly is necessary.    ** I should clarify, perhaps Wendy Kopp stated the summer program prepared teachers, but for most people involved in TFA, she's a joke.  Most of the teachers, MTLDs, and those actually working in classrooms are not under the illusion that TFA teachers are prepared after their summer training."

Like the Boyd et al., study, this study found that, in math and reading, students of 1st year teachers from TFA, the NYC Teaching Fellows, and other uncertified teachers did worse than those of 1st year teachers who were “regularly certified.”  (However, the authors include teachers licensed through “transcript review” and temporary permits in the same group as college-prepared teachers, thus minimizing the effect of teacher preparation.)  They also found that the negative effects were generally reduced or eliminated in math as teachers finished their training and certification and gained experience.  However, in reading, the initially uncertified groups of teachers continued to have a negative effect for all 3 years (for Teaching Fellows and other uncertified teachers) and for 2 of the 3 years (for TFA).  Like the other study, they found very high attrition rates. By year 4, close to 90% of TFA recruits were gone, close to 60% of other uncertified teachers were gone, about 50% of NYC Teaching Fellows were gone, and just over 40% of “regular certified” teachers were gone."

TFA is now embedding select alumni in congressional offices and in high-ranking jobs in major school districts, including New York City and D.C. It’s providing start-up cash to alumni to launch “game-changing” advocacy groups and business ventures. Its political arm, meanwhile, is recruiting veteran tacticians to identify key levers of power in cities such as Houston — then help alumni seize them.   This is a deliberate and coordinated attack on public education. They are ramming through legislation in congress, for instance, declaring teachers in training (i.e. their staff) to be ""highly qualified"" to take charge of classrooms. They are taking over school boards in order to make districts renew contracts with TFA, earning themselves some honest taxpayer money and simultaneously evicting the existing teaching force. They go to statehouses, in many states, and squeeze billions out of budgets to divert education funding to themselves and other new private outfits -- at a time when local public schools in every state are all feeling the pressure of strained budgets and growing needs.   It is disgusting, and TFA should be shut down. Their employees, and dedicated educators, should take up roles in their own local community organizations.

The idea that any cultural bias renders the number meaningless would, if applied everywhere, completely decimate the social sciences as a field of human knowledge."

education,39t56j,structuralbiology,26,Sun Jun 14 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"To the extent that Hunter Rawlings is correct, that college is not a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs, he has identified an existential threat to higher education. Where he is deluding himself is in his analysis of the source of that threat and how to resolve it.  Colleges charge money for their services and won't deliver if they don't get paid - that makes them the seller in a transaction. Perhaps the biggest threat that higher education faces today is that it has lost sight of the requirement - requirement - that they deliver adequate value to the buyer or the buyer won't.  The price of a college education has been growing rapidly for a long, long time and the important question that colleges have to ask themselves is whether or not sufficient value for those incremental dollars exists - and whether or not their customers agree with them. Increasingly the answer to that question is obvious: a resounding, ""NO"" from the students, the parents and the taxpayers.   The buyer, not the seller, gets to decide whether or not the transaction is worthwhile. It's okay that the author is decrying that the buyers aren't using his valuation model but it's economically ignorant to expect that the seller gets to dictate the price and mandate the transaction - the market simply doesn't work that way. The fact is that higher education is approaching a tipping point where the price (as determined by the seller) will exceed the value (as determined by the buyer) and when that happens the market their services will crash.   If you can't force your buyer to purchase, you have to provide sufficient value to make him want to purchase. Higher education needs to look within for solutions, not without and return value to the transaction."
education,39t56j,Barking_at_the_Moon,8,Sun Jun 14 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. I think the author's most fundamental error is that he is either creating a straw-man or misunderstanding the argument that college can be analyzed as a commodity.    The courses the student decides to take (and not take), the amount of work the student does, the intellectual curiosity the student exhibits, her participation in class, his focus and determination — all contribute far more to her educational “outcome” than the college’s overall curriculum, much less its amenities and social life. Yet most public discussion of higher ed today pretends that students simply receive their education from colleges the way a person walks out of Best Buy with a television.   This assumes that the ""educational 'outcome'"" is the commodity being purchased. In truth, it is only a part of the purchased good. A larger part is marketability and career options. High schoolers and their parents are not stupid uninformed consumers. They understand that much of a college education depends on the student. Some part of a career, however, depends on the college. And marginally better career prospects are what consumers and students want to purchase.  On a separate note, a student's ""educational 'outcome'"" also depends enormously on his or her peers. I suspect even if the education at different colleges were identical and prestige-based jobs less common, high demand to attend higher-ranked schools would persist because good students want to work with other good students."

Students and parents over-sold the education treadmill because anything that is sold is always over sold. The more people on the treadmill the more being on the treadmill becomes meaningless. Lots of certified mediocre people emerge where your best chance of employment is less your learned skills and more who you know to help you into employment.

That argument makes no sense; the ""then"" doesn't follow from the ""if."" With respect to school not being a commodity, he's right: A commodity is defined as a good that satisfies a want or need, ""which is supplied without qualitative differentiation."" Meaning, a pound of wheat is a commodity because you don't care where it came from. With an education, you absolutely do care about the source.  It's his conclusion that's whacky. Higher education IS a service, and services can be compared against each other for value. To prove it, one need only look at analogous services: gym memberships, certification programs, and adult learning classes. Each of those requires the customer's effort to realize the value, yet each has clear differentiation with respect to price points, qualities of service, and reputations. People can and do decide if it's worth it to get a professional certification, and they make their purchasing decision based on that calculus.

Then, write down the various materials you will need with quantities (don't just write 'copies of worksheets' write '35 copies of worksheets'). Also, if relevant, list whatever national standards the subject entails. After this, write out the procedure of how things should flow. Be prepared to have this fluctuate in real time, but having it written down presents a better way to do it. Be sure students have opportunities to observe it, hear it, and try it themselves. Don't be afraid to have a Question-free time and a Question-rich time. Maybe part of the lesson, you'll not allow questions, then after, let them flow. Make sure there are opportunities for students to do the work themselves. They need to try it out. Worksheets, question prompts, building supplies, whatever you have them doing, make sure you have set them up to be able to do it.    Make sure that the students have time to wiggle, walk, talk, etc. Let there be group AND individual work. Do some things as a whole class as well.

It's easy to see the argument of parent's choice to select a charter or private school; however, what is discussed less frequently is the students who are left behind and what happens to those schools and communities. The decrease in funding leads to a lesser education because there isn't money for resources beyond just the classroom (i.e. healthcare services, tutorials, social workers, after school programs). If enrollment and funding drop too much, then the school can get shut down entirely and the community is now left without an integral piece of its neighborhood while the kids have to be bussed elsewhere. Property values are lowered and the sense of belonging and pride a community school can offer is lost. Additionally, the ability of the parents and community members to engage with the school is lost because now the kids are going to schools outside of where they live. This is, at least to me, where the comparisons to public libraries and other civil servants make sense. We wouldn't remove libraries from communities because they offer a ton of assistance beyond just books to community members so why would remove schools?"

I mean, if we let people opt out of paying taxes to pay police officers just because they hired their own security, we'd end up in a very different society - likely one rife with inequality, corruption, and crime. I mean, can you imagine? Public police officers would be far less effective, far understaffed, far under-equipped, and far overworked, because the more people who opted for their own personal protection, the less money that would go towards the public servants. The rich would probably live in gated communities with their own protection and anybody who couldn't afford to be safe behind those gates would probably be subject to a hellish atmosphere where you'd be lucky to get an officer on scene if you needed one.

That said, couldn't the argument be made that school funding accounts for so much larger a part of our taxes (about 1/3) than most other things that it deserves special consideration? While k-12 and higher ed funding is around 33%, public services is more like 1% (source). I might be wrong here, but I don't think the tax breaks being talked about to parents that want to send their kids to private schools are going to drop the entire percentage that would normally go to public school funding. And in the sense of investing in the future and all that, it's not like the parents aren't still doing that. They're still going to be spending a lot of money on schools, which are still subject to a lot of those standards implemented by the state. And it's also not a permanent loss of a tax payer. Once the student graduates, the parent will lose the tax credit and return to their civic duty of funding the school. I'm a little fuzzy on the numbers here, so correct me if I'm wrong- but considering the ratio of tax payers to students in any given town, the amount of tax money coming from a particular set of parents is a lot less than the cost to the school per student, so subtracting the cost of a student as well as the taxes from that student's parents would seem to be a positive gain for the school, right?  I love DR, and I totally get what she's saying, which seems to be more focused on the principle of the matter, but I'm not entirely convinced by her argument here. Not to say I'm necessarily in favor of the tax credit idea either, I guess I'm just being contrarian at the moment for the sake of discussion. I'd love to see some counterpoints as honestly, even though I work in a private school right now, something in my gut makes me want to oppose this bill even though logically I can't really find a reason for it."

It's just that they don't. As you'll probably recall, taxes are based on a percentage of the payee's property value and/or income (depending on the type of tax we're talking about here). So not everybody is paying the same amount. Losing the taxes from a lower-income or middle-income family is not the same as losing the taxes from a higher-income family, even if the cost of their child's schooling are the same. Through the method public schooling is funded, upper-income citizens indirectly subsidize the education of lower-income citizens. It's not a perfect system - as can be seen in inner-city schools or rural schools where the collective property taxes are low enough that schools often end up under-funded. But it's a system that our society deems ""fair"" because most of us believe in equal opportunity for education and also that taxes are more ""fair"" if they're based on percentage, not fixed amounts.  The worry is that if enough upper-income families bail on public school, public schooling would be losing a disproportionate amount of funds to the cost of educating each student lost, because upper-income families pay more into the system than lower-income families. As the greatest source for funds for public schools decrease, the quality of public schools will diminish. This will entice more and more families - basically whomever can afford the tuition - to send their kids to private schools. Which sucks for the children left behind."
education,39nimu,waitwuh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:11:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's a valid point. But now I'm wondering if the tax break given to families who choose to send their kids to private school will be a percentage of their taxes, or a fixed number. I'm really not sure how it would work but for the reasons you pointed out it makes sense to me that a fixed number would be more appropriate."
education,39nimu,Youre_Government,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"Well, another related reason people oppose it is because of the ideology behind public school as a public good. Many would argue education as a 'public service' just doesn't work when private schools become popularized. Personally, I believe education is a human right. I also believe it has the capacity to create equal opportunity, which again is a right I think that all people should be afforded, (even if it's idealized and may never fully be realized). But tax breaks to parents that send their kids to private school deeply trouble me, because I see that as a mechanism for undermining the quality of public schools and thus blunting the greatest tool we have for creating equal opportunity. It creates two seperate ""levels"" of society, based on who's parents can afford what school-sytem. It brews inequality.  I understand some of the reasons that people want children to be sent to a private school - don't get me wrong. When public schools in their area are lacking, it's in their child's best interest to send them someplace better. The problem I see is that it doesn't serve society as a whole to do that. I think that if you have a legitimate reason to doubt the quality of education in a public school, then it is your civic responsibility to push for meaningful change. And if you're personally invested in public schools, either through taxes you pay or through children you send there, you have much more reason to do so. To allow people to ""opt out"" of public school, at the least by sending their children to private schools and furthermore by removing their obligation to pay for public schools, is to allow them to stop caring, altogether, about the system. To abandon it. Because it no longer affects them. And it becomes something of a ""tragedy of the commons,"" here, because by acting in their private interests, they've gutted a public good.  And, unfortunately, those who are most likely to be able to afford private schools also tend to be those who are most capable of making a meaningful change in public school systems. Higher socio-economic status means a lot of things - it's not just more money. It's also that they generally have more time and more resources and more know-how to be able to take on tasks such as challenging their local government, their local school-board, and so-on to bring awareness to issues and to muster up fundraisers and volunteers and so on and so forth."

She treats upon the history of public education as a respected public service to disguise her real purpose which is to defend the hegemony of the public teachers unions and their enormous privilege. Where public education was once about a progressive agenda for society, today Ravitch seeks to defend the monopoly the schools enjoy not to serve the community or the children but the teachers.  From the days of Horace Mann, the purpose of public education has been as much about inculcation as education. Sold to the public with the idea that education should be free, universal and non-sectarian, it quickly morphed into a tool used to assure ""...social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends."" Public education isn't so much about teaching Johnny how to read, it's about teaching Johnny what to think.  That said, the growth of alternative channels for education is less the result of politics than economics. Monopolies always fail because they do exactly what Ravitch is suggesting: they intentionally stifle competition which results in a lack of innovation and a growth of price. It was once unthinkable that public monopolies such as the telephone or electric utilities would be broken up but they were. Thus, too, is writ the future of public education."

The only exceptions I can think of is some of my load cells, used to measure force, come set to pounds, which is easily changed as a default. Even my analog pressure gauges have pressures in both systems indicated. Perhaps some of the very old ones only have psi.  However, when building a new piece of equipment most of all the fasteners are 'imperial'. Meaning we are often using both systems, and needing to be very careful about it. Particularly with fasteners it is very easy to mistake a metric bolt for 'imperial' and vise-verse leading to some epic cross-threading events.   I do of course agree that the subset of metric 'standard' units makes calculations much easier."

I went through grade school memorizing arcana about bushels and pecks and rods and furlongs most of which I have forgotten.  I still think in terms of pounds and miles and pints but I do know in my heart of hearts that the metric system is better.  I have taken science courses where everything is metric and I worked in a medical school where I never heard an English system measurement.  I can switch to it if necessary.  For example, last month I hard that the antarctic ice shelf had sloughed off 55 trillion liters of water.  A little thought led me to the conclusion that that much water would cover the state of Pennsylvania - where I live - to a depth of 18 inches.  (Yeah, yeah.  I had to make a couple of conversions there but they were easy.)  I think we will eventually go metric but, for everyday life, it will be a long haul.

I realize that our semi-imperial system is easy for us to think in since we're raised in it an used to it, but to make a statement that it's easier to work with mathematically just makes no sense.  It's a variable-base system (12 inches to a foot, 3 feet to a yard, 5280 feet to a mile) as opposite to the static-base system that is metric.  Sure it's easy for us to make do the mental calculations to the point where it's ALMOST instant but it's just so much easier with metric.

I like both systems and subject my students to both on a regular basis.  In engineering you are free to use inches as your basic unit, then specify every dimension as a decimal: big things can be hundreds or thousands of inches and really small things are thousandths. I have this recollection that the space shuttle was done this way (can't find a reference, tho.)  In other situations, like carpentry, the imperial system is almost magical in its beauty. Twelve is a wonderful number, divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6. Fractions of an inch are a delight, because you can easily shift the precision of your measurement depending on the scale or roughness of the work you are doing.  The kids I teach are utterly ignorant of both systems, however.   ""Mr. PigBoyOhBoy: there are a hundred meters in a kilometer, right? ""  ""Mr. PigBoyOhBoy, how many feet are in a mile?""  ""Mr. PigBoyOhBoy, how do you expect us to remember how many centimeters are in a meter?""  Now.. for physics, anyone would have to have their head examined for not using metric.

True, but there's also having teachers that teach according to your school's mission and actually, personally believe it. My company teaches that everyone on your staff should be aligned in terms of core values, no matter how long they're there. This school has decided that two of its core values are, basically, maintaining a professional social media presence at all times and tolerance and respect to all its community members.  When a faculty member shows that his or her values no longer align with that of the institution, it's the institution's right and obligation to terminate that member's employment to ensure those ideals and methodologies the school upholds as best are, in fact, carried out in the classroom and administration.  ...Granted, this philosophy works better at private-independent institutions, who are our primary clients, but I think it can apply to public schools, too. If a public school decides that exemplary social media conduct and tolerance are two traits it wants to cultivate in its students, it stands to reason that the school should hold its teachers accountable.  Besides, few people would think that any teacher protesting this woman's dismissal were trying to defend tenure, no matter what that teacher said.

As a result, public colleges and the Commission on Higher Education, which sets regulations for in-state tuition and scholarship eligibility, have adopted policies that define these students as non-residents. These policies, attorneys argue, violate their clients’ rights to equal protection under the Constitution.

These are usually free!  You might also wanna try posting your plea in r/Iwanttolearn to see what other resources/help people are willing to offer."

education,39fguz,Sw3dishCh3f,22,Thu Jun 11 10:58:15 2015 UTC,"I also think it's important to realize that a lot of people who don't work in the field of education and who are fairly well-off just don't see this as an issue. A local politician (I live in Indianapolis) was asked about the issue of poverty and how it effects test scores and he was quoted saying ""we feed [the kids] breakfast, and we feed them lunch, so it shouldn't be an issue."" The reporter was shocked and asked him what he meant, and he just repeated himself. I think it's hard for the general public to understand how food insecurity and a stressful home life can have such a detrimental impact on a child's education. The other thing that's super important is the hierarchy of needs. Humans cannot function at a higher level if their basic needs aren't met (food, water, shelter, safety). I can do all I can to be an ""effective"" teacher, but if a child doesn't feel safe (maybe because they're homeless, or hungry, or neglected, or being abused) they CANNOT LEARN until those more basic needs are addressed."
education,39fguz,k8sowelly,8,Thu Jun 11 13:02:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think in large part this comes from people who just don't fully understand the many ways poverty works to hold back kids from doing well in school. It is a bit short-sighted, but they isolate school from the rest of life. It seems like they think: ""these kids aren't doing well in school. Kids do better in higher quality schools. The quality of a school depends on the quality of the teachers. Therefore, we need better teachers."" Instead of thinking ""these kids aren't doing well in school. There are many things that can influence their ability to do well in school. A low quality school can make it hard for them to do well. But also... A stressful home life can make it hard for them to do well in school. Living in a low-income home often is associated with a high amount of stress and insecurity..."" and so on.

However, when students from poverty hear that education beyond high school is what they need and then hear at home there is no need or no way to pay for it, why should they work hard to get there.    We don't support a mind set in the US that all students can have a college or career path.  We have standards that tout that premise but not the support to get students there.  I know several students with a poverty background that worked hard to prepare for college, got some scholarship money, but there wasn't a support system to help them stay in school to finish.  Being in poverty is about survival today, and tomorrow or maybe a week ahead.  You can't plan for the long term if you don't see or believe in a future that is detached from your daily life experiences.   Students from generational poverty come to school behind their better off peers in language development, social development and feelings of security.  Before they can be expected to learn and succeed they have to catch up.  The testing that is driving education at the moment doesn't allow for extra time and support for all students."

I've worked for only 501(c)3s for seven years now. I didn't do it on purpose it just kind of ended up that way. My loan payments aren't bad ($125/month) but I also won't be fully paid off by the 10 year mark.

I probably don't have the credit to re-finance due to a couple shitty decisions (never missed a loan payment, but had some credit card issues in college).

education,39bdsk,ayriana,2,Wed Jun 10 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"To answer your original question, there are scholarships and grants. Students fill out a FASFA form for each school year. It's advised that they have it in as early as Valentines Day to have better luck. At least, that's what they told me in 2004. The FASFA is through the federal government and grants are awarded based on family income mostly from what I can tell. If you come from a middle class family or higher, you're basically screwed. If your family falls under poverty level, you might get a full ride. I can tell you that even if your family falls below poverty level, about halfway through your college career the government will suddenly offer you less in grants and a lot more in (hopefully subsidized) loans. This is what they did to me. By my senior year, it was like 75% loan and 25% grants. They're not dumb..  They know that if you've already invested 2 years, you're not going to drop out midway over loans. As Ariyana points out, paying back the loans is manageable but it severely sets back life plans. I was lucky that my family was poor, I was the first to go to college, and I qualified for a merit-based tuition waiver scholarship that would renew each semester for 4 years as long as I kept a 3.5 GPA or higher. So, my debt was minimal, but my husband (white male from a middle class family)  got absolutely nothing and left college around 90k in debt. You should also know that if you come from a middle class family or higher, they hit you with higher interest rates on the loans - - well, it seems that way. My husbands' loans vary from 7-10%. My highest was legit like 3.4%. Anyway, we want to start a family and have at least one kid, but we won't be in our 30s until that's economically feasible. That also puts a limit on how many kids we can have tbh."

I know I might get down voted for saying this, but honestly it helps if you are poor, minority, or female, or any combination therein. Bonus points if you'll be the first to go to college in your family. I work in higher education, and the students who match those demographics are mostly the ones getting free rides for their courses. Personally, I think they all should be merit based. I see many students with full rides blow off classes and ultimately fail. They retake the course(s)... And they're still not paying for it. I see that as a waste of federal money.

So there's immense pressure to increase high school graduation rates, and it has happened... sometimes in the ways we might hope for, and sometimes not.  The thing is, none of the techniques discussed here can be soundly condemned.  They aren't fraud or cheating.  They are just the natural result of saying ""it's important that as many students as possible graduate"", instead of valuing the entire, complex, individual picture of students accomplishing what they are capable of.  The most damning example is the number of high schoolers who are suddenly leaving to be home-schooled, rather than dropping out.  You might imagine this is reporting fraud by the school.  But I find it more likely that the school is putting more pressure on the students not to drop out, and parents are responding by making a half-hearted commitment to homeschool instead.  If those parents mean what they say, then that's a better outcome than dropping out.  And the school can't put itself in the position of telling some parents: sorry, we don't believe you, so we're going to call your child a dropout.  It's even clearer, with credit recovery, alternative schools, and alternatives to the graduation tests, that these are things the school is trying to do to keep kids in the educational system.

I'm currently attending a state university for my Master's Degree, which I'm only spending 18months to complete, and it's nearly 3 times the amount I paid for my undergraduate degree ( 4 years) at another state school. Funds would have to be allocated in a radically different way, and with our current system, in which universities make mass profits from its students, there is almost no incentive for universities to agree to this.   I do agree that access to quality and affordable education is something that every citizen in the U.S. deserves, and my thesis is on the disparity between the academic achievement levels of the socioeconomic classes.

I went to a big state school where it really isn't that hard to get into, but they just fail people out after getting a year or 2 of tuition and fees out of them. Many of my 2nd year classes had <50% pass rates. These were giant classes that were either taught by T.A.s from Asia or by professors who you could barely ever get ahold of. One of my fears is that, at least for a decade, free college would mean colleges accepting way too many students so they can charge them things like B.S. fees (I had about 15 on my bill) and books that change editions every semester to make up for the loss of profit from tuition."

The other one I can think of is Hart and Risley's (2003) article The Early Catastrophe that speaks about the differences in language and perhaps even content acquisition for children/students at a young age and how the gap between the rich and poor simply becomes bigger and bigger.

So it seems to me that it's not as simple as ""the rich get richer"", but that it helps maximize potential and is the easiest variable to measure of much more complicated factors.  Edit:  Parents having money may be a key factor for being able to pay your bills until you finish college, but you have to value education to get there and suffer through it. Money alone cannot explain the large disparity in college enrollment, especially since  there is aid specifically to help the poor go to college.  An interesting companion piece would be to look at rates of completing high school, which seems to correlate with class and wealth as well. I would expect that the poorest groups don't go to college as much because quite a few of them don't finish high school. (A local rural county here has overall high school grad rate of only 3 in 5.)"

education,396qk7,thechungdynasty,-2,Tue Jun 9 21:31:08 2015 UTC,"the commenter doesn't consider dynastic wealth to be an independent determinant of academic success...   because it's not.   thanks to the modern society being somewhat meritocratic (brains are being rewarded), and to smart people marrying primarily other smart people, and producing smart offspring, the society is going through a big sort.   that's why we'll eventually need a guaranteed minimum income, but that's another story."

It also sounds like you're assuming perfect correlation between parent and child IQ. I think most studies found a correlation closer to 0.5. This study apparently found the genetic contribution of parents to be near zero when subject families were poor. If this ""big sort"" is happening, parent IQ is a very imprecise mechanism."

Our meritocracy is a way that some that come from privilege, and I do, support a system that provides unequal educational opportunity, thus maintaining the wealth gap.  Research the cohort effect in education. If you move students to a higher performing school, with better resources and opportunity, their performance improves. They didn't magically get smarter."
education,396qk7,kaosotis,2,Wed Jun 10 00:55:48 2015 UTC,"It has been shown again and again that SAT prep/tutoring adds very little to the students score (single digits for math section, low teens for verbal/language section).

I guess you either believe that intelligence is completely fixed or  current research that that shows fluid intelligence, which is the ability to learn new things, is flexible and can increase or decrease based on environmental factors including your stress levels and education.  I think the former is antithetical to the very idea of a meritocracy that you brought up, since it implies you are essentially born into your station."

That's why we need guaranteed minimum income and universal medical care, plus federally financed schools with good teachers across the board.   We will never close the ""gap"" - since IQ is genetic, a couple of doctors are probably going to produce a smarter kid than a pair of minimum wage earners, but if those minimum wage earners found themselves at the bottom of society not because of their genetic cognitive abilities, but because their parents had lead based paint in their houses, at least their kid will have a good chance for upward mobility."

Generally speaking IQ measures how quickly you process and apply specific types of information to specific types of problems. I would agree that it is somewhat generic, but all modern brain research shows that you can increase your IQ. IQ is not fixed, it's a combination of nature and nurture.  It's a bold statement to say that wealthier people have smarter kids. You would have to adjust for opportunity, quality of education, life stressors, which cannot really be done. In fact research is now showing the tremendous impact that life stress has on learning, interfering with any clear measurement of ability.  Anecdotally as an 18 year veteran teacher in an affluent area who happened to grow up in the same area and who happens to have an extremely high IQ,  I can tell you that wealth is just as likely to be a function of opportunity than IQ. I know plenty of kids of wealthy people who have strong students, and just as many that have struggling students. Having connections and opportunities cannot be discounted when it comes to wealth.   That doesn't mean that people with money don't have better opportunities. But that comes into going to a state school vs Harvard.

Obviously we disagree on the validity of IQ as a measure of intelligence. Arguing that they are a predictor of success means only that, that people with higher IQ's are typically more successful. Our ideas of what intelligence is seem to be at odds.  I think the actual core of our disagreement is semantics, as you claim rich people are taller and smarter, when what you appear to really be claiming is that smarter, as measured by IQ, and taller people make more money.  Rich people aren't taller, tall people are richer and I think this semantic difference is important.  It seems that either one is arguing that tall people with higher IQ's are superior to others and thus deserving of higher quality education, opportunity, etc... or that the current state is such opportunities are provided to taller people with higher IQ's and this leads to greater success.  We seem to be in agreement on some things, although I'm unclear if you are for universal healthcare and minimum income because the belief that some people do not have the ability to be successful (not defined as rich) or because of the role environmental factors play in the equation and therefore the need to level the playing field.  Oddly enough I am actually arguing against my own privilege. I come from an affluent, very well educated family in the NYC suburbs, graduating as roughly an A student from one of the top HS's in the country, am 6'3"" and was reminded by my mom on several occasions when I was lazy in middle school that my IQ was measured at 150 and 159 at 2 different times in my early childhood.

You're the first person like that I've met. Maybe you should have had more lessons at school.  It's also obvious that writing neatly requires greater dexterity than doing a cave painting.   you miss my (very obvious) point that penmanship is as obsolete as cave drawings   I didn't miss it. I rebutted it by giving reasons penmanship is useful. There are plenty of things I learnt at school which I do not use in my daily adult life but which have contributed a huge amount to my general skill set, my appreciation of the world around me and be overall development.  (BTW if you think there is a clean distinction between calligraphy and handwriting you really didn't have decent handwriting lessons at school.)"

education,3939br,silentflight,2,Wed Jun 10 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"As of next year, parents in Nevada can have 90 percent (100 percent for children with special needs and children from low-income families) of the funds that would have been spent on their child in their public school deposited into a restricted-use spending account. That amounts to between $5,100 and $5,700 annually, according to the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice. Those funds are deposited quarterly onto a debit card, which parents can use to pay for a variety of education-related services and products — things such as private-school tuition, online learning, special-education services and therapies, books, tutors, and dual-enrollment college courses. It’s an à la carte education, and the menu of options will be as hearty as the supply-side response — which, as it is whenever markets replace monopolies, is likely to be robust.   Notably, families can roll over unused funds from year to year, a feature that makes this approach particularly attractive. It is the only choice model to date that puts downward pressure on prices. Parents consider not only the quality of education service they receive, but the cost, since they can save unused funds for future education expenses.   Accountability is infused throughout the ESA option. Funding is distributed into the accounts quarterly, and parents provide receipts for expenditures to the state. In the event there is a misuse of funds, the subsequent quarter’s distribution can be withheld and used to rectify it. Students must also take a national norm-referenced test in math and reading, a light touch that doesn’t dictate students take a uniform state test."

education,38wpu0,Broan13,17,Mon Jun 8 04:52:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think what it comes down to is that adolescents/teens aren't as good at self-regulation as their adult counterparts, and that it's not just because of lack of experience. Part of it is because their brain is still developing, and the ability to control impulses and regulate emotion and so on and so forth is strongly influenced by brain structures that we know tend to finish developing later rather than sooner (as in, when people are 18-20 on average). So it's not just that they're in need of developing certain skills/behaviors, but that the brain structures that facilitate those skills/behaviors aren't fully available to many of them quiet yet. They need a little more time. Another part of it is that many are still experiencing raging hormones that are telling them that conversing with Sarah is 10x more immediately important than learning algebra. These two things are working against them, against their focus, whereas a older student or an adult doesn't have these setbacks as much.  Certainly, some teens can feel their phone buzz, switch their attention to some text for a few seconds, then put their phone back in their pocket and switch their focus back to class, and be fine. Some can't, though. Not being able to ignore their phone, or at least not being able to switch their attention between two things easily, and often not being able to determine/decide what's more important at the moment, makes it extra hard for them to do well in class even if the teacher is phenomenal. So limiting cell phone use is one way to help prevent them from struggling with distractions until they really do have the ability to self-regulate. As they mature, they'll be better equipped to manage a cellphone and not be fully distracted by it from work or class. And certainly, some will reach that ability sooner than others. But until then, it's easier for everyone that we limit what kind of distractions are available. We can't limit all of them (there's plenty just by putting a bunch of teens together anyway), but we can limit phone use."

I mean seriously, the idea that cell phones are useful in education is so offensive to you, that you'd rather bury any discussion of their merits than to have that discussion?

Small number but still awkward enough make me choose to use the book or get the school iPads instead.  If you are wondering why those students don't have smartphones - the phone itself may be cheap but data is not. Or, in some cases, my students have old school phones due to bullying on social media.  I love technology and have asked some of my kids to use their phones in class before but that doesn't not mean that cell phones are not a distraction. They are. They were to me in college! And I loved learning! It is incorrect to assume that all of these kids will only be on the webpage/app that you want them to. Kids will try to open other apps and other pages - and guess what. They aren't great at multi-tasking. It will distract them."
education,38wpu0,mell87,-2,Sun Jun 7 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"If your school has ipads, that just makes me so happy.  My main point is that distraction isn't a cause but an effect.  Students that are interested and learning will look attentive and engaged. Classically that has led to a lot of people thinking that the reverse is true... that someone who looks attentive and engaged is therefore interested and learning. This leads to a lot of rules about quietly sitting at your desk with your eyes on the teacher, taking in a lecture.    I assure you, just because someone is quietly listening to you speak, doesn't mean they are learning anything. That classic way of thinking, like most classic ways of thinking, was just wrong.  Interaction and engagement are the bread and butter of education. If someone is uninterested in your lesson, you can give them a computer play with, a rock to play with, or force them to sit quietly and stare at you... the result is all the same."
education,38wpu0,jonivy,3,Sun Jun 7 22:26:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points. To be honest, a kid who is that disinterested in school probably won't even make the effort to turn on the iPad and open up a random app.   Believe me, I love tech! I requested iPad carts my first year, we got them. I asked for an Apple TV to then project the projects/kids screens, I got one! I asked for a Chromebook cart, we are rolling one out next year. I LOVE technology and am so lucky to have access to it. But, it really only works in an ideal environment.  I teach 6 classes, and every class is different. I use tech with my lower levels all the time - but would very rarely let them use their phones in my class. They are very immature, and the class is HUGE. I can't walk around 26 and 28 kids and make sure they are on task and understanding whatever it is that we are doing. If we are doing a project and they need to pull up a dictionary - sure take it out but put it away after you look up the word. You need to write down your HW in your notes? Okay, I'm going to stand right behind you as you type it in. But by and large, they should not need their phones at all. We are learning a grammar point right now, there is not reason you need to pull out your phone and snapchat a photo of your partner.  That's the issue with cell phones right now. I agree it's an amazing tool, but you can't assume that it will always only be used at a tool. And that's the roadblock we are at. I think most teachers know whether their class is mature, and well behaved enough to use them or not. I don't agree with what this teacher did, but I can also understand why some teachers collect cell phones at the beginning of the period. Everyone is different, just like every lesson is different."

It should be about seeing the bigger picture, and how what you're learning ties into the world of the past, present, and future.    And how do computers affect that?  Well, they allow us to see more of the past, present, and future, and to have it all at our fingertips.  They allow us to answer questions from the mundane and simple, to the complex and theoretical. The applications of computers networked together around the world are endless.  Education is more about understanding than knowledge, but having the world's knowledge at your fingertips can greatly aid in understanding any topic.  The people 3,000 years ago were just as smart as we are - a baby from then would be raised just fine today - we just know more, and have the technology to promulgate and preserve that knowledge.   Looking up the answer to a workbook question doesn't mean you're learning - it just means you're able to write the answer.   The same can be said about multiplication tables. Memorizing large sets of data does not mean that you understand that data. The error is in believing that reference material prevents or hinders understanding.    If I can teach someone how to look up information, then I've taught them infinitely more than if I had just provided the information to them.  So on all that, we likely agree.  But you've commented on me supporting the use of technology in the classroom, and so I have to assume that your comment was meant as a retort.  If you understand how to do long division, but don't understand how to use a calculator, are you better off than someone who understands how to use a calculator but never learned long division?  What's funny about that question is how outdated it is. Long division was invented long long ago, and the calculator a while ago, now.  Both can be considered technology. Both are outdated technology at the moment.  So when does the calculator go the way of the abacus?"

They know the answer, but don't understand the underlying principles of mathematics that make it work. Memorizing the answer doesn't make them any smarter.   If I can teach someone how to look up information, then I've taught them infinitely more than if I had just provided the information to them.   Learning how to do research is an integral part of education. Looking things up, however, is only one part of education. It's an introductory level skill.   So on all that, we likely agree. But you've commented on me supporting the use of technology in the classroom, and so I have to assume that your comment was meant as a retort.   I meant it only as an alternative point of view.    If you understand how to do long division, but don't understand how to use a calculator, are you better off than someone who understands how to use a calculator but never learned long division?   You can do more with a calculator, and when solving complex problems it certainly saves time, but the person who doesn't understand the underlying mathematical principles is certainly at a disadvantage.   Here's an example of when a student of mine benefited significantly from understanding basic mathematical principles and used technology appropriately to his educational advantage (note, he was only able to use technology to his advantage because he understood the underlying principles): The student was tasked with calculating the orbits of planets and identifying the relationship to their distance from the Sun and their Orbital Period. There is a procedural way to accomplish this task which the older California State Standards mandate be taught, but this particular student was able to write an equation in Excel, and have an input table, and have Excel perform all the calculations for him. He then got curious and did the same for all the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. He finished all this and made a power point presentation before any other student had finished the calculations by hand.  So, why didn't they all do it in Excel, you might ask? Not a single other student in class understood how or why his equations worked. They didn't understand math well enough to follow what he did - their whole lives they have been taught by rote memorization (something we're both saying is bad). That's just how they learned math.   Technology can have it's place in the classroom, but it can't be a distraction, and it can't be used in place of learning the underlying principles of how things work. I can look up online how to solve any given math problem, but that won't tell me anything about why the math works the way it does, which is what students really need to know."

Eh, I think they will. In my old place of work someone was fired for habitually using their cell phone at inappropriate times (meetings, meetings with clients, while doing solution prep, etc). I had a student tell me a sob story about their asshole boss who fired them for texting while taking an order at a Deli. The rules regarding cell phone use in the classroom (use it when appropriate, don't use it when not) translate well to the real world.  I have found that 90+% of students are distracted by their cell phones, even when taught how to use them appropriately. That's what I have a problem with. I'm not some Luddite - I just acknowledge the problems with cell phone use in class. They significantly hinder learning, rather than contribute to it.  Hell, there are teachers on campus who claim that cell phones are GREAT tools to use, and then you see their scores on common assessments, and their 20% lower than their peers who forbid the devices.  Ask the kids, one-on-one, whether they think cell phones hurt or help learning. That's what I did, and it's ultimately what swayed me into the Ban All Phones camp. Almost every student I asked said that one student does the assignment, takes a picture of it when you're not looking, and then sends it out to the other students in the room. They pretend to use their calculator or Periodic Table App (or another similar application), and then switch back to the picture when it's unlikely they'll get caught. Kids aren't stupid.

People will stop mid-conversation to answer their phone. I've seen people in the middle of making an incision in the OR have someone answer their phone for them (without messing up the sterile field, of course).  I've used my phone and iPad countless times during school and it's been insanely useful to facilitate my learning.   even when taught how to use them appropriately   Maybe that's the problem. Maybe they weren't taught well enough.   I just acknowledge the problems with cell phone use in class.   Or maybe it's your limitation and controlling your children's cell phone usage. But in the real world no one is going to force you to do anything, either.   Hell, there are teachers on campus who claim that cell phones are GREAT tools to use, and then you see their scores on common assessments, and their 20% lower than their peers who forbid the devices.   And we all know how great scores translate to real life!   Kids aren't stupid. Like 99% of us, they'll take the path that takes the least effort to complete the task at hand.    What's the problem with that? Was the assignment adequate to even teach the proper material in the first place?    I have a huge problem with paternalism in medicine, I think teaching is the only place where it can be potentially worse. I guess in medicine it's bad because of the paternalism towards adults. At least they're making efforts to make paternalism less of an issue (they're actively talking about it in psych class), I've seen no such thing discussed about education, which is sad.  It should be about facilitating learning, not about enforcing rules (sometimes for the sake of enforcing them or because of the ""do  what I say!"" mentality, without consideration for if you're actually even doing anything). Didactic teaching isn't always my cup of tea, when it comes to the enforcement of rules."

It has been such an uplifting experience because of this and many other small differences the school has put in place to focus the students.  There has yet to be any reason why a student has needed a phone in any class I have taught that couldn't have been solved better (due to the distractions that phones place on teenagers) by planning the lesson differently to take away the need for students to look up the info in the first place.  There are other ways to teach searching for information in projects, papers, etc. where gathering information that requires the internet is a focus rather than an offshoot focus for a normal lesson.  There are some apps that could be helpful in learning physics or math, but these are not necessarily better than other methods.  Technology has to be able to do something more than I can provide them without it for it to be worth the headache that it causes.  One thing I do with technology is do demonstrations using it.  In these cases you focus all the kids to one screen (the projector) and have them interact with it through you.

One of the best tools I found for teaching people math is Khan Academy. One of the best learning tools I've had personally in medicine have been apps (Medscape and UpToDate are the two big ones, but there's also Epocrates and others). I've had significant detriment in a class environment personally where we weren't allowed to use cell phones, or even the internet (internet was off across campus during school), and it can be hard to follow your professor when you don't know what a word or acronym like CURB-65 means when they're talking about it. Obviously it's different for adults than teenagers, but still. I still strongly believe that if it was possible to effectively teach kids how to use technology earlier, their performance would be beneficially effected in situations. Maybe giving privileges to people who would benefit from them as teaching methods, rather than an across the board for simplicity's sake."

education,38wpu0,raspberry_noise,-2,Sun Jun 7 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"Well, my main point would be that utilizing smart phones in lessons would have an engaging effect.  Whereas the main problem expressed in this forum is one of distraction, I would say a good solution is to have a more engaging and interactive experience for the student. Distraction is the result of boredom.  Boredom and disengagement by students = no learning going on, whether or not they're playing a video game or texting a friend.  The ""distraction"" that teachers see is a symptom of a poor learning environment, not a cause.     These sound like ideal situations to use school laptops.   Absolutely!  The same arguments would be levied against that though, ""The students are constantly surfing the internet instead of listening to me talk. It must be because they have poor impulse control, and so we shouldn't allow laptops.""    Boring lessons are the real culprits, and the real thing to be fighting against.

There's a good chunk of learning that is less exciting than chatting with friends about the latest video game or YouTube video, but is still going to happen if students don't have the option to watch YouTube under their desks for a lot of the class.  Maybe some of that could be taught using technology, but (a) it would still be less exciting than talking about video games with friends, and (b) these technology-centric approaches are not always the most efficient or best ways for students to learn.  If you automatically classify anything that involves using a mobile phone as the better way to teach, just because some kids are obsessed with their mobile phones, you are denying the truth.  Most of my teaching is computer programming, but I still don't always have students sitting in front of a screen, because that's not always the best way to learn."

I have students using them (as an option, quite a few don't have one) a few times a week on average.  But it's totally unrealistic to say that they aren't a distraction, or to compare it to pencils and doodling.  I've had students take pictures and video of me and send them via snapchat (without my permission), attempt to answer calls during class, text friends to go to the bathroom at the same time and meet them in the hallway, and generally be checked out from class until either they put away their phone because they were asked, or I confiscate it because they don't.  Sure, they'll always figure out other ways to not pay attention or communicate (like the old-school note passing), but that doesn't mean we throw our hands up in the air and say ""fine, do what you want.""  We cannot center every single lesson around phones.  My classes are highly interaction and discussion-based, students are speaking with others, completing activities and then sharing responses with others, peer-editing, moving around, etc.  There's still always a few that are chronic phone-offenders, often when their partner is standing there trying to hold a conversation with them.  While it's maybe 4 out of 30 students that truly have a phone issue that is causing their education harm, unfortunately if I apply the rule to only them and not others I'm the one that ends up in the crosshairs of a parent or administrator.  Free technology use is great in theory, but unfortunately high schoolers need to be taught the concept of ""time and a place"" before it hurts them in the long run."

Maybe you haven't been teaching very long, but students being checked out from class, or ditching to go hang out in the hallways, or doing anything aside from learning has nothing to do with cell phones.  Cell phones are relatively new, in that regard.  No one has an easy answer for getting students to be engaged and learn things.

Again, as I described in my original reply, just because other distractions exist outside of cell phones does not mean that we throw our hands up and give up.  At that point your argument basically leads to ""do nothing about all distractions, because there were always be distractions.""  In other words, chaos, giving up on those that are easily distracted and letting them fail.  I'm not trying to prevent distractions because I hate fun, I'm trying to prevent them because I care deeply about these students' education, even if at that moment they don't feel the same way.  That's the job of a teacher.  And no, I'm not saying that all students would be doing just fine without phones, notes, distracting friends, whatever.  Some would still struggle, for a plethora of reasons.  But I could sit down right now and list students that have huge potential to be really successful, but they can't stop trying to text, leave, talk to people, etc. long enough to fully participate in class.

Simply because they are wasting time through other means doesn't mean we throw up our hands.   Research, writing, pictures, checking grades. Pretty much what you'd expect.   We don't use digital grade books and research is something that typically is done at home if at all.  Writing is done on laptops.  Why do students need to take images often enough to legitimize using a phone?  Writing notes by hand has a lot of benefits that taking a photo doesn't do.  The only tech we really have are some laptops and a few projectors on carts.  It doesn't sound like the tech is being used for anything that needs to be done during instructional time and isn't really adding anything that different lesson planning wouldn't do without the added distraction."

For example, I have a bio certification, and back when I was teaching middle school I considered getting physics, chemistry, and earth science certifications (because paying for those 3 tests was less costly than going back to school and paying for a broadfield major), but my principal advised me that even with all 4 certifications I would still technically be less qualified than a broadfield science major.

I attended a rural school, did all my student teaching in suburban/urban schools, and now teach in an urban school. I also live in Kansas, which, if you're not aware, is a beacon of educational progress right now.  In my experience, most of what they say about urban schools is true. They are underfunded, underequipped, understaffed (whether by number or experience), overpopulated, and still suffer immensely from resegregation, red-lining, and legislature to push school funding back on the local tax base. Despite that people will say urban schools receive more grants and funding, we still lose out to suburban schools almost every time. However, the students are diverse, fascinating, interested in many, many things, and can be less tiresome than suburban students.  Suburban schools have their issues as well. There is a lot of competition between districts and even between same-district schools to outperform other students, both academically, according to college placement rates, and athletically. Despite a mountain of research that says graduation rates have been stale for the past 30-40 years, suburban schools feel the pressure to push the ""college preparatory"" marketing package to keep parents and students. They suffer from administrative errors or turnover, over-stressed students, hyperactive parent base, and keeping up with demands for more and more advanced coursework (despite additional research that says this might be harmful for students).  I'd be interested to know what you'd like to learn. Keep in mind that I am working to get over a slight bias against suburban schools (I grew up with those districts taking money and families away from the districts around me), and that I've only experienced several districts in the NE Kansas area. That being said, I've done a lot of research both as an undergraduate and through my M.S.E. on comparative suburban/urban/rural education, and would be happy to discuss!"

education,38owso,mattmx204,3,Fri Jun 5 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"Again, in my experience, working in the suburban school (AP Lit & Comp, English 12, Creative Writing I & II, and ACT Prep) was more stressful because the problems students were honestly of less interest to me. Most of the kids were college-bound, most had the financial background to do it, and my ""purpose"" was to help them gobble up more prestigious scholarships and grants. Grades were of utmost importance - I had parents enraged over a B+ paper (which was more honestly C quality work). Many late hours running writing workshops and AP exam prep, crying students because of academic stress, and the insane ""accountability"" was desensitizing and tiresome, so when real issues of learning were occurring, I had more trouble dealing with them. In my mind, my job is to teach you as best I can while trying to help you develop as a person and maybe even opening new interests to you. It is NOT my job to hold your hand into opportunity hoarding.  My challenges with urban kids, while more intensive and hard to solve, were more rewarding to me. Talking about race and class genuinely. Helping students with 1 or less working adult in the home. I was more passionate about helping these kids, because their problems were more real to me than earning a 4.5 GPA or a National Merit Scholarship. That being said, urban education is conducive to burnout, and we need to stop romanticizing it as this martyrdom at the expense of rural education and at the risk of becoming biased towards suburban schools (as I became in my undergrad).  And the Kansas part was a joke. Brownback (our governor) is a conservative extremist, so much so that the Republican majority are starting to question his motives. His office has published a lot of misinformation about school funding, has instituted harsh cuts and block funding measures that only wealthy suburban districts approved of, and he is a strong advocate of private schooling above public schooling (despite research suggesting neither particularly matters until you're in the five-figure tuition range). State employees, most notably higher education employees, are actually facing furlough starting Sunday because they refuse to back off of extreme tax cuts and we just don't have the money to fund schools and colleges anymore.

My public high school was in a very nice neighborhood (some kids got brand new Jeeps for their 16th birthday- not me) with students from <15 (or 10) miles from the school. Being able to drive and having a method of flexible transportation was pertinent- without access to a car, you're kinda stuck to the bus schedule and it limits options for extracurricular activities. (Note: no sidewalks, no public transportation, yes school bus- but, they're school buses. They don't run after hours.)   Based on my limited knowledge, I imagine that transportation would be a different story for urban students. For instance, the city nearby offers free bus passes to the metro students- whereas the high school neighborhood has no public transportation to begin with. I'm not the biggest fan of this phenomenon.   TL;DR suburban students are immobile without access to a car. How is it in the urban area?"

Unless you join one of the English language programs (which are rare at the undergraduate level), fluency in German is a necessity. It's not just so that you can communicate; to be able to do homework or take exams in German, you need to be able to think in the language. Unless you can do that, your degree may be cheaper, but it's also going to be a lot harder. And B2/C1 fluency is an admission requirement for German language programs, anyway. You won't be able to acquire this level of fluency overnight. There's ... well, let's call it an impedance mismatch between the American and the German education systems when it comes to the transition from school to college. Virtually all German students will have come through the college prep track or something that's equivalent. While the tracking system has its downsides, it does put the average German college student 1-1.5 years ahead of the average American high school student (barring AP courses) and is one reason why a bachelor's degree in Germany takes three years instead of four. German students will also have acquired the basic skills necessary to study at a university before ever going there; as a result, there's a lot less handholding for college students in Germany. If you're interested in attending grad school, there's not much of a difference anymore, but if you're looking at undergraduate programs, you do need to be prepared. Note: the same goes for many other countries in continental Europe. This is why German universities ask for a 3.0+ GPA AND either a number of AP courses OR a SAT/ACT score in the top 10%-15% (other countries with similar education systems have comparable requirements). You likely won't be able to get loans or grants. Because tuition is essentially non-existent, almost all loans and grants are intended to cover cost of living and are awarded to German nationals who could otherwise not afford college. College in America can be more expensive, but if you can get a loan and/or scholarship, you may be able to afford it even if you can't handle the upfront expenses. German universities are a sink-or-swim environment. Because even some of the best German universities practice essentially an open admission systems at the undergraduate level, they can be ruthless at weeding out underperformers in order to maintain a sufficient academic standard. While this can hurt, German students have the option to fall back on the excellent vocational training system, which can still give you a pretty nice middle class life; as a foreigner, you'll probably have to return home with little to show for your efforts (I don't mean to scare you, you just have to understand that getting in can be a lot easier than staying in). Culture shock can be a real problem. While some people take to a foreign culture like a fish to water, plenty are also experiencing stress when suddenly nothing is familiar anymore. Loneliness can also become an issue when you are suddenly separated from your family and friends by an ocean and 6-9 time zones.   Keep also in mind that Germany is also not the only European country with such an arrangement; there are other countries that also offer college with no or very little tuition.

Boredom and bullying are symptoms of inadequate programs and staffing... which are symptoms of inadequate funding.  Musk should acquaint himself with just how far public schools have been cut in California, where he currently resides. We've had 10 years of cuts in state funding. Federal funding (at least at my school) has been halved, despite improved/good test scores.  At my elementary school, we saw:   Vice principal eliminated. This position handled discipline issues.  Psych counselor eliminated, or replaced with college student. Special day class instructors (special ed) eliminated. Computer instructor eliminated. Paraprofessionals (class aides) reduced to 40 minutes per day, and only serving in K-2 classrooms. Full-time librarian reduced to 4 hours, with a low salary mostly paid by low income parents. No library budget for 12 (maybe 15?) years. The librarian raises her own money to buy books, book repair supplies, etc. And forget about the library being a multimedia center. As if. Libraries at many other schools have closed, or never were created in the first place (thank you charter school legislation!). Office staff reduced from 3 to 1.5 positions. There's nothin' like the principal covering the front office so the secretary can take a bathroom break or, you know, eat lunch. School nurse reduced to 1 hour visit per week to do legal paperwork. If a student needs medication, the parent has to come to school to administer it. Teacher development days sporadically canceled for the year (where teachers grow and learn new things for their profession). Reading and math intervention greatly reduced, some positions eliminated. Budget for field trips eliminated. Music instruction eliminated in K-2. In 3-5 grades, it's 40 minutes per week for a portion of the year.   And so on, and so forth.

education,38is2t,doilookarmenian,3,Fri Jun 5 10:31:06 2015 UTC,"Education reform in America is geared toward privatizing public education. Both political parties are focused on it because greed is a bipartisan issue. Politicians follow the money, and education has been realized as a cash cow... from testing to curriculum to administration. Students = money.  All major education reforms are breaking public education, and are being followed up with moves to have schools run by nonprofits and corporations using public money. This isn't a conspiracy theory. It's happening.  Musk's private school for his own kids supports these efforts. Every student he helps remove from a public school is a point in favor of privatized education, a point that materially harms the schools those students would have attended.  I bet you the students at his private school do not, to a significant degree, suffer the issues of more than half of all American kids. First, half of all Americans are low income or living in poverty. Many other negative factors trend with that one statistic... More... kids suffering physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse, drug use in the home, limited vocabulary due to under-educated parents,  malnutrition, coming to school hungry, lack of enriching opportunities, parental neglect, physical disabilities, mental disabilities / learning disabilities, sensory impairments, severe psychological issues, etc.  Musk has built his kids an island to live upon so they're not in the general population of kids. It's exactly this behavior -- parents with the means to seriously improve public education and instead exclude themselves from it -- that contributes to the decline of our schools.  Public schools become a gravity well for high needs kids while kids with wealthy parents stay safely away from the event horizon. In short, Musk is not helping anyone except his own kids and any other kids at his private school.  No conclusions about the effectiveness of Musk's school can be applied to public schools because the students at his school are nothing like the real world. The leading indicators of student achievement are the income and education level of the parents. To fix schools, first, rich families (or, hey, what's left of the shrinking middle-class) must return to public education. That will cause those voters to care what happens in public schools and start taking notice of how politicians are dismantling public education."

Obviously, there are limits, and if a child is being berated for not succeeding at something, that's a problem.  But the idea that elementary aged children come born with their own set of interests, and that it's a problem if parents encourage an interest that didn't arise innately, is ridiculous.

I recently went back to school to pursue a different degree and found the classroom to be a lot more stifling than it was in 2007. For example, in a psychology course I took, we were discussing sex differences in personality because there is a biological link to certain traits. I would assume that it was a given that there is variability in the levels of these traits, however, my poor professor was met with quite a bit of backlash. Students were arguing over the definition of gender vs sex and couldn't answer thought-provoking questions like ""can men and women really be friends?"" without being offended that the question excluded transgendered individuals and those with non-traditional sexual orientations. It seemed as though my professor couldn't discuss facts found in decades of research regarding men and women without offending a handful of students. It is known that there are exceptions to what is commonly seen, but for some reason, talking about the majority has become incredibly offensive.   Also, I'm fairly certain that while we credit a white male with the creation of the scientific method, I remember learning that a similar method was originally described by a Muslin scholar.  A great deal of ground-breaking research has been conducted by women and those of color, so I have a hard time understanding that tweet."

To me a lot of these criticisms come off as trying to throw whole movements under the bus because of the existence of a lowest common denominator. It's interesting how much attention the ""SJW"" gets in some circles in comparison to a more well thought out point of view. It just says a lot about the goals of those people that they can only argue against hyperboles.  I had a similar exchange to the one you described in a class I took about social movements. A couple of students got offended by something that was presented by the professor. The professor turned it into a 30 minute discussion. I watched a couple of female students who identified as feminists mostly argue against one white man who took his own perspective. It was probably one of the most interesting and passionate exchanges I've ever seen in a classroom environment and really helped frame these issues in a way that a test or most lectures never could.

education,38d7jf,avematthew,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:28:00 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the ""SJW"" meme for a minute, social justice has always been an extreme thing in unjust societies/institutions/power structures. Jesus was an extremist in the time of the Roman Empire, that's why he had to be executed. Some very prominent examples of people who sought social justice in one way or another are Che Guevara, Eugene Debs, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Pussy Riot, Hrant Dink, Daniel Ellsberg, Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and so on. What ties them all together is their acts of resistance to harsh, unjust, and powerful regimes who in their eye committed wrongdoing. What further ties them together is that they all knew to some degree that by acting the way they did, they would be severely punished for their actions, and they did it anyways. And they were all punished.  Even many people who we rightfully consider terrorists often have an underlying theme of persecution and approach their struggle from a social justice standpoint. The word ""Jihad"" translates to ""struggle against"" or ""resist"". This concept of a religious struggle goes very far back. It's up to us as individuals to decide who's grievances are legitimate, who is taking just recourse against an illegitimate power structure, and who is committing atrocities under the guise of social justice or a just struggle. Most of us can agree that using terrorism/violence is a very extreme way to go about trying to change something, and we rightfully point out that these peoples' actions are hideous. One of the biggest paradoxes is how easy it is for us to condemn acts of violence committed against us and how long it takes for us to realize the illegitimacy of our own mass violence (the Iraq War). That's one of the running themes of social justice.   The threat of being fired or blackballed because you hold a controversial view also comes from those who hold reactionary or institutionally favorable points of view quite often too. It's not something that's exclusive to social justice movements. The Red Scare and McCarthyism are great examples from earlier in American history. The University of Illinois fired Steven Salaita for tweeting negative views about Israel. Right now there is a group making a list of pro-Palestinian student activists with the intention of denying them a chance at getting a job. Phil Donahue was fired by MSNBC for opposing the Iraq War. etc. etc.   To me, the space occupied by ""SJWs"" in a broad discussion of social justice or radical social movements is very small. I suppose tweeting controversial opinions can get you fired and therefore it is a small act of resistance in a Western society. But I obviously don't think it's very constructive. In the same way, I don't think getting a professor fired for a disagreement is very constructive either. The truth is though that both people interested in social justice and those interested in the status quo have used this strategy, so I think talking about one without mentioning the other is quite disingenuous."

education,38d7jf,jwjmaster,35,Thu Jun 4 01:57:39 2015 UTC,This is exactly the problem with the teaching profession though.

education,38d7jf,somanyroads,-1,Thu Jun 4 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"While most professors don't want to be bad at their job, some just are and there needs to be some student input to make sure the university doesn't hire back a bad professor (or provide resources to restructure the class). The issue he was getting at is the students perhaps giving poor reviews of professors for hurt feelings. I'd certainly make a note if a professor doesn't treat student concerns with respect, but it should be up to the university to evaluate whether I'm being overly sensitive or if the prof is a dick. Colleges being consumer driven would likely side with the student (I see it as a monetary approach and making their college more appealing to retain future students, but there are of course other factors at play as to whose side the univ chooses).  I find a problem in this when the university cant distiguish a bad professor from a coddled student. Cultural emphasis on political correctness can get absurd and it takes a toll on the younger generation  (I'm a millenial) which affects how colleges approach teacher contracts.  When taking science classes I notice there's a much clearer distinction of a bad professor when they fail to communicate the concepts and lack the effort to try. I notice professors who probably get amazing reviews because the class was easy. I've had several professors who were tough but I didn't learn much, and a few where it was easy and I learned some, a select few that are tough and amazing. One of my (moderately bad) professors got talked to by the department head that their grades were too high. Easy fix is to curve down, or make material more challenging and curve if necessary. More challenging is tough though because I'll run into brute memorization courses which piss me off because it feels like I didn't learn anything but that's another topic. Anyway, the college figured out he made the class too easy but asserted that he just taught it better and he got fired (probably because he also isnt particularly respectful and likely pissed off the dept head hah).  I know some dumb as nails kids who just had their heart set on going to college and by their fb posts (read ""shares"") they seem to be the social advocate type that fucks everything up. They'd misplace their anger with a professor over a poor grade or potentially offensive material and take the opportunity to grand stand. That's not an acceptable reason for a prof to get bad marks (getting fired, not getting re-hired, not getting a raise). So long as a professor shows reasonable attempt to address student concerns respectfully. If they don't want to change because of the comment, a brief explanation may help. As for students that take the stand mid-class, they're just asshats and the prof needs to play the fun game of make them feel heard and move back to the topic of discussion/lecture. I'm glad I can unfollow posts on fb, but I'd love to unfollow the comments of that kid who has something to say (usually not well thought through) about everything in all of my classes.  Some professors are dicks, some students are sensitive as hangnails. Figure out the difference from a course eval!  Universities can't cater to these whining hangnails of social advocates, and should be the ones responsible here. Students misusing the course eval when they're feelings get hurt is a problem but course evals are a must as the university needs to hold professors responsible when they're ineffective.  After writing a lot I realized I like what was already said, but here's an additional perspective."
education,38d7jf,dg46rox,2,Wed Jun 10 03:16:25 2015 UTC,A lot of that comes from our public schools prior to college. They push kids through when they aren't qualified to move to the next grade and when they get to college they expect the same crap.
education,38d7jf,eeo11,-1,Thu Jun 4 08:43:31 2015 UTC,"Well the world needs ditch diggers too.   Unqualified students get accepted pretty often and in private schools will lead to a massive tuition bill that may not pay out either because interest grows like a tumor by the time they pay it off or if they drop out. I guess I wanted to blame universities for letting people in and then seeing it either in a lower quality secondary education or higher drop/transfer out rates. But the burden falls on the student, so the student needs to be better educated during the college search what their decisions will mean and how tough it can be to pay for college should they drop out or overpay for a degree.  I'm upset my parents and advisors of my high school let me go to an expensive private school with little question or even an informative talk with the entire grade. I did have reason (accelerated degree track and effectively guaranteed seat in med school, so I took the seat at the cost of 3 year private school tuition with moderate scholarships), but too many students I meet here certainly do not have reason to spend private school tuition price for their degrees. I, and I'll generalize to many students across the nation, would've benefited from more knowledge on colleges, and even what to do if not goimg to a 4yr college, trade schools, good places to look for entry that can turn into a decent career. Instead I have a friend who didn't attend college and instead has been shifting around jobs that sit close to minimum wage which keeps them well below the income to support themselves independently. It's kinda sad because I really want her to figure out something she'd like doing besides marijuana (where a fair portion of her money goes), but that takes motivation and some perseverance to learn about and understand more careers. We had a job fair in school and a career day, but it just wasn't quite enough.  I feel insensitive for referring to caddyshack, but the world does need people to fill the less specialized jobs. I just wish she finds one that's more enjoyable and sticks with it to get above the poverty line so she can move out and support herself. But depression and anxiety seem to give her trouble whenever she tries. I've tried to advise on occasion trying to find various ways to build motivation while addressing mental health from external help like a therapist (not sure how insurance works with mental health, maybe CBT would help?) to regular exercise, that improving yourself physically may develop more positive self image and build that motivation making the career hunt easier to pursue. But there's only so much I can do through our occasional conversations. This went off topic. I'm just thinking of a friend in a scenario that could quite easily take a turn for the worse and I really dont want her in that position given her current state of mind."

And don't be afraid to participate with them.  One of the worst bad school habits, of the sort you allude to, is trying to get away with doing the minimum requirement.  To get away from this, as much as possible, try not to be the bad guy.  Instead of you telling them something isn't good enough, try to get them invested enough that they will criticize their own work and set high standards for themselves, and build a sense of pride.  This can be tricky with things that feel like schoolwork, but it's a natural feeling towards art.  Or, introduce then to an environment where they have to do a good job to reach their OWN goals, and position yourself as the helper.  Competitions are great for this.

Despite having to pay this back, as the student loans here aren't too bad it doesn't feel like I've had too pay very much. That's not to say I think paying for education is right, quite the contrary, but for undergraduate level study its accessible for all.   The problem I have with the UK system is postgraduate study (MA/PhD/etc). I want to study a masters and hopefully eventually undertake doctoral study, but currently there are no student finance options for this. The government has claimed there will be student loans for postgrads coming into effect from 2016, but its still at the consultation phase and so not guaranteed. Unless funding is readily available very few people in the UK can afford to do a masters as they average around £6000 just on tuition and are undertaken when you already have £27000 worth of debt from the undergraduate study. That's without maintenance loans as well! In total before I can even think about my funding my MA, I owe £37500... That's pretty depressing.  The trouble with paying for University (even with loans) is that you pay to undertake a certain level of study, which then usually grants you access to a better career than you would usually be able to get without one, where you then pay higher taxes due to your higher earning.

Unfortunately, not everyone has realistic access to a quality publicly funded higher education.  As far as whether more expensive colleges are better: maybe.  If you are comparing out of pocket cost between countries that do their funding differently, though, don't expect that to tell you anything about quality.  You'll have to find other objective measures to compare universities in different countries.  In the U.S., there are many kinds of universities, and the cost-benefit analysis is different for each.  Some prestigious universities, such as the Ivy League, are more expensive, but end up worth it in the end in the connections you make, if you can get admitted and are prepared to take advantage.  They also tend to have generous financial aid.  Other expensive institutions, known as for-profit colleges, are just outright scams, and our government is working on shutting them down when there is a legal basis for it. And there is everything in between.  Hopefully, your university in France will help you tell the difference between a prestigious institution and one that's just been set up to make a buck.

(Right now would a good time to do some research, but the testing cycle requires all computers be loaned to math and ELA.)    You might be interested in the EEI curriculum. Some of it is sharply defined for California, but the units that tie together ancient civilizations and their footprint are cool.   http://www.californiaeei.org/curriculum/  I also am having good success with phET labs. They are especially helpful where students cannot do hands-on, such as with their build_a_molecule simulation. It helps students understand bonding and reinforces the concepts of different atoms for each element.  https://phet.colorado.edu/  ...but computer access is a challenge, so I am also exploring monthly readers such as Science World.

What was the Principal's purpose in choosing to tell his parents about his sexuality before he had the chance to tell them himself?   The only reasons I can come up with is that the Principal is bias and perhaps hoped to get the student into trouble with his parents.

But these gun nuts in the US will never get it.  You don't need a gun to feel safe, and guns won't make you feel safe, they just make everyone feel anxious.

Do we truly believe that a successful rapper or successful basketball player is the sole motivator for success for a young, impoverished, disenfranchised high school student?  If Steph Curry visits this school, is that REALLY going to convince these young men and women that basketball is the way out?  I really feel as though we're underestimating these young people.  Academic success is facilitated by so many different factors like invested parents and effective educators.  If a young person is persuaded by Steph Curry that basketball is the only way of achieving social mobility, that young person has already been failed by his/her support system.  And, let's remember, Steph Curry is a success because of his dedication to hard work.  Without such a work ethic, he would not be the man he is today.  That's an important message to send to young people.  Steph Curry had an amazing support system.  His father was a veteran NBA player with a degree from Virginia Tech.

I went to every class in my major and minor fairly religiously, but the only Gen Ed class I had to attend that way was Statistics (it was hard yo), Spanish (everything was group work, so we had to be there), and a few others that took attendance for a grade.

Also, historically speaking, not their role. I think this was an expansion of the role of higher education that has benefited society but, still, it was a relatively recent expansion.

There's nothing wrong with hard research but there is a limit to how much of it society can afford - and ultimately it must provide society with benefits commensurate with the investment or it simply isn't sustainable. You're obfuscating, however: the argument about the place for research in the modern higher education system isn't much in dispute.

It's probably around 40% of reports that are false.   not even taking into account the rapes that are never reported,   I made no claim about cases that are not reported. The majority of rapes are never reported, especially in poor areas where police are viewed as hostile.   But similarly, a false accusation doesn't have to be made to the authorities to cause harm. Just the rumor is enough.   There are definitely a lot of barriers to reporting rapes, but there are also a shitton of barriers to even prosecuting real rapes,    Obviously. A lot of cases lack evidence which isn't also consistent with consensual sex.   For the exact same reason that makes it difficult to prove guilt it's also difficult to prove that an accusation was false.  Those 5% of cases that are proven unfounded are mostly found out because the accuser admits it, or incontrovertible evidence like video footage of the accused 200 miles away at the time of the alleged crime.   In most cases a false accuser won't admit that they lied, nor is there iron clad proof that they lied. So 80% reports are neither proven true nor false.   It also takes a special type of terrible person to want to falsely accuse someone of rape,    Yes.   It also takes a terrible person to rape someone, but you don't seem to have trouble believing that rape is common.

If it was legal for redheads to steal from people, redheads would steal a lot more than they do now. They wouldn't suddenly be worse people, it's simply the result of a lack of consequences.   ut even so it seems to fly in the face of common sense to thing that ""the rest are probs false too"" when indeed most experts seem to think the opposite.   Most of people who claim false accusations are rare, aren't experts at all. They are ideologues.   Current feminism is built around the rape mythology. Without it, feminism is dead. They aren't interested in truth, they are interested in portraying women as oppressed.  What the studies show is that 5% reports are proven false, and 10% are proven true.  The studies that go a step further than proof, find that around 40% are false.   Those are reports to the police. Reports to college tribunals are probably far more often false than reports to the police. There is now a whole subculture built around fetishizing victimhood."

And somehow, many young men turn this into a discussion of ""what if I was accused of rape and I didn't do it"".  They're much more interested in hypotheticals instead of addressing the reality that many rape victims face."

Let it be stated for the record: I believe in justice systems that are in keeping with procedural standards that have been developed over centuries to minimize the risk of wrong judgement being passed.

It probably starts with parents and teachers telling their children their art looks great and always encouraging arts. Whereas with math we tell a child when they do something wrong and they stop liking math, science, and engineering.   It's probably a combination of fear to do other things, and higher opinion of artistic abilities than they should.   I'd guess most of the people at art school have no business being there. And if they left, the prices would drop and more closely represent the value of an art education.   I want to be an artist and make video games. I have no talent so I don't."

While this poem is perhaps ""extreme"" for public school, I don't believe it'd actually do any real harm to any students and I think it's a bunch of fussing over nothing that probably led to costing students a great teacher.

I've also been fortunate enough to teach undergraduate classes both at Oxford and in the suburbs of NYC. I am also the parents of an 8 year old and a 12 year old.  My personal opinion is that children/students are exposed to both sexual themes and violent themes younger than I'd care them to be.   Hopefully, my own children, and those whom I have taught will experience sex and NOT violence. Just last evening I was talking with my daughter and said that the large percentage of people you meet you will not have any experience with them and their sexuality. Sex does not take up is just not involved in the majority of the relationships we encounter in our lives.  Yes, this poem has mature themes. Is the theme mainly about the physical act of sex or the denial of affection?  It is my belief that all humans, in some way are suffering. Often, our actions are centered around alleviating this suffering. Would this poem be any more or less powerful if it centered upon any type of harmful escapes from the pain that shows through the poem? Would it be any more graphic if it were an addict looking for and fulfilling their next fix? Would it be any more graphic if the person traced a razor against their skin to 'test' the numbness of his soul?  The students were not adults, but they also were not children. I doubt that this poem was the most obscene thought of the day. Is it shocking? Most certainly yes. I'm sure that was the intent of Ginsberg. Was it even disturbing? Of course. That too was the intent of Ginsberg.  In this day of 24 hour ""news"" coverage and internet, could this even come close to be the most shocking or disturbing event students observe all been involved in?  At least the students weren't exposed to this in isolation. Any conflict could have been brought up with the teacher to be explained. Would this be available if they were watching old youtube videos of people jumping to their deaths from the World Trade Centers?  If it sparks a discussion, even an angry one, it causes the students think. Could there have been a better piece? I don't know.  I do remember being in 'honors' English and being assigned to read ""biography"". At the time, I hated biographies. On top of that, we had to read, and act out a passage. In my infinite wisdom, I chose Lenny Bruce. I read the passage where he was at a party and hiding in the bathroom, sitting against the door, and a lengthy discussion of how to shoot up heroin. I was suspended. Was I being a jerk on purpose? Yes. Could this have been a diving board into a larger discussion? Yes."

Streamed students tend to have better outcomes in the social sciences and language arts, but less so in the sciences and math.   Secondary is a really different beast than primary, as I am sure you know. At this level, one has to start thinking about students' eventual career and post-secondary options. A student at the primary level can be at most 6 years behind his peers, which is bad. I've taught students in the higher grades who didn't know how to read at all. Imagine teaching a student in grade 5 who was 8 years behind. If you had to do it without an EA (in that case, more like a special needs aid), you'd probably pull your hair out.

My school has personal assistants for certain students to protect other students, staff and property from harm because there is no special school for them, and still there are some that are so dangerous they have in-home instruction. I'm talking elementary school kids with serious issues. This sort of thing isn't remotely close to being covered by the state, and sucks away the little discretionary funded there is. Our state began allowing schools to use their GATE (gifted) funding for other purposes long ago, in acknowledgement that schools are in crisis due to underfunding. A requirement to not overcrowd K-2 classrooms was also blown, where they dramatically reduced the daily fine incurred for having too many students in a classroom so the annual effect was less expensive than hiring another teacher."

However, localized property tax measures do get passed to pay for infrastructure upgrades (repairs) because the state doesn't covering buildings falling apart, asbestos removal, etc.  The state implemented a new funding system last year. I'm not familiar with it, except I know it's designed to focus even more money on students with special needs (e.g., below average students). But, the state hasn't retracted its rule change that allows school districts to funnel GATE/gifted funding to non-gifted uses. For example, a school could spend GATE funding to hire a new teacher to alleviate overcrowding, and claim, well, any gifted students in that classroom are benefiting, so that justifies not having a GATE program."

I'm not blaming the local homeowners; I get why they don't want to pay more property taxes, but they're decision making has nothing to do with improving their schools. Furthermore, they often become angry with the schools because they may not see the benefits of the additional funding and simply believe the schools are full of greedy teachers."

In this case, both factors are partially responsible, but it depends a great deal on the state and the university. In CA, the second problem has done far more to drive up student costs. Only a few years ago the state was paying for 80% of the cost, now it is less than 40%. Overall spending has remained flat on a per student basis (though some rearranging of the deck chairs has gone on), so the difference has been made up for with increased tuition and fees."

If you are living off-campus, though, or if the campus layout is such that it will take you more than 30 minutes to get back to your dorm room between classes, then you will really come to appreciate those hours you save by working on a laptop instead of heading all the way back to use a computer.

education,37nai2,jwjmaster,4,Fri May 29 00:57:46 2015 UTC,"There is a distinct culture who oppose Academic intellectual freedom in America. A Teacher being fired for making a judgment about the educational value of a poem (and being fired for that judgment call) makes me pretty upset as a professional in this field. Doctors and lawyers are afforded greater protections in their fields and far less micromanagement of their actions. If we want children to be prepared for adulthood, we have to be able to expose them to adult content at some point before they're actual adults so WE have an opportunity to provide context and encourage thoughtful reflection among students. 17 and 18 year-old AP students are capable of such reflection. Even if the subject matter is controversial, the point is to provide structure and nurture independent thinking around such material. That's why teachers need tenure, and it's situations like this that make me wonder how weak our profession really is to be manipulated by public opinion so blindly.  Read the poem. Let's not be naive about what it is, the teacher could easily have been challenged to do so by students who thought he probably wouldn't (for fear of being fired) and did it to shock the students (and was subsequently fired). Having read this, -I- personally wouldn't have elected to read this poem aloud. But 17 and 18 year-olds have said and heard far worse than anything described in this work. What is the goal of FIRING a teacher for reading this aloud? Is it reformative? Punitive? Is it the knee-jerk reaction of an embarrassed school board? I don't condemn the board or the parents or the teacher. I think the whole thing could have been avoided had the teacher NOT read it aloud, but by doing so, the teacher reveals to all of us the weakness inherent in our profession - being FIRED for reading this is punitive and reactionary, not reformative.

Yes, this is the crux of the matter.  The article defends the poem by mentioning that a court has ruled that Ginsberg's work has enough redeeming value that it shouldn't be illegal to publish.  But it ignores the vast distance between saying that Ginsberg's poem should be considered obscene and banned, and saying that it's okay to require minors to be present in a class and discuss it there.

That seems to well overshoot the argument you were making."
education,37nai2,almodozo,1 point,Sun May 31 22:50:03 2015 UTC,"versus the polite conversation material deemed suitable for a Thanksgiving dinner?   See, I'd argue that a classroom (like Thanksgiving dinner) doesn't require polite conversation, but formal conversation. I liken my practice to that of a doctor's or lawyer's when students swear in class, or try to use sexual language for fun (one of my students was sent to the office on Friday for a quip about the contrast between ""just the tip and penetration"", for instance). As for drama, intensity, and various controversial subject matters... you must have a more polite family than mine, as the fights during Thanksgiving in my household are, and I choose my word carefully here, epic.  I'm a teacher. I have a formal designation. What happens in my class is necessarily in the public sphere. The teacher in question knew, on some level, that what he was doing was questionable, hence the ""What happens in AP English..."" statement and his closing the door. When he tried to make the classroom a private space instead of a public space, he violated the trust of the public. The relationship between teacher and student is not equal. One holds power over the other. Would we be okay with a politician sharing this poem behind closed doors with a group of staffers? A police sergeant with constables? A principal with teachers? A boss with employees at a staff meeting? I can't imagine that it would be appropriate in any of those circumstances, much less so with a teacher and underage students. (Yes, they're taking college-level classes, but that doesn't mean that they're college students.)  The student who brought the poem to class shared it with the teacher privately. If the teacher had discussed the poem privately, then we wouldn't be having this conversation. I've been downvoted for suggesting that there are many, many, many other poems out there that have more artistic merit and less controversy. He chose to bring it to the attention of the class, then chose to draw the class's attention towards its taboo nature by his statements, both verbal and in action.   The Connecticut Code of Professional Responsibility for Teachers, c.1.A, states that teachers must ""Conduct himself or herself as a professional realizing that his or her action reflects directly upon the status and substance of the profession"". c.1.D is that teachers must ""Strive to exercise the highest level of professional judgment"". As a teacher, I'd argue that his actions reflected poorly on teachers in general, and specifically teachers of literature; and I'd argue that his professional judgment was poor.   You mentioned students in another thread who were okay with what was being taught, but does that student know for a fact that all students were okay? My wife was asked to read The Wars in school and was deeply disturbed by the two rape scenes in the novel. However, she chose to say nothing. Perhaps the teacher thought that all of the students were mature enough to handle the novel, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it should have been taught, or should be taught at all.   In sum: the teacher knew, on some level, that what he was sharing with the class was questionable when he shut the door and subjunctively suggested that this not be shared with those outside of the class. The teacher should have known that a classroom is a public place, and underage students should be treated differently than adult students. Had he discussed it privately with the student who brought it in rather than publicly, there likely wouldn't be an issue. Finally, I'd argue that there are limits on free speech in the classroom.   In my province, teacher conduct is adjudicated by teachers. I'd be interested to know how other teachers feel about this situation."

education,37ngni,ademnus,15,Fri May 29 15:35:55 2015 UTC,Spoke with the admin team today and since the districts are still required to have highly qualified staff and have to report that to the state the consensus was that districts probably won't actually hire anyone without a teaching degree. Most of us felt this was a way for choice schools to cut even more corners while making off with voucher money.
education,37ngni,computrtchr,3,Fri May 29 00:53:08 2015 UTC,Choice schools already have this kind of system in place. I taught at two voucher schools in Milwaukee and they had people with just bachelor's teaching. It was very bad for the students.   My worry is that our education programs enrollment is dropping (why would you want to be a teacher in Wisconsin currently) and this will be the way they make up for it in the future.
education,37ngni,berrieh,12,Fri May 29 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"So, I didn't have a teaching degree when I started, just a Bachelors. (I started in FL, which has fairly lax requirements to start teaching.) I had an English degree, and I teach ELA, so that helped with the process, but I got temporarily certified in other subject areas (Elementary, Science) as well as English before I even taught by taking content area tests. I went back for my MAT, but I don't think that MAT actually taught me anything, to be fair. Most of the work was busy work. I never interned; my job counted as my internship. But my first year was overseas anyway - by the time I was a first year teacher here, I had 3.5 years teaching experience abroad. Still, my first year here while messy wasn't really any worse than the majority of first-years I've witnessed (it was better in many cases and so was my first year abroad, frankly).   Basically, I'm not really buying that an Education degree is mandatory. Steps to certification? Sure. Show you want it, show you have some competencies. But I could've never become an educator if I was required to do that slave-internship. I have worked (for pay) every day since I was 15 and couldn't have afforded to voluntarily make myself unemployed for that. I could've maybe taken the 4 months themselves, but I couldn't have afforded the uncertainty of being unemployed with a gap after that. It's a bum deal and anything to fix that bum deal is a good thing in my book; if they're not going to pay interns or offer flexible options in the Ed programs, they can at least give you other routes.   This part   And any person with relevant experience — even a high school dropout — could be licensed to teach in any other non-core academic subject in those grades, according to the provision.   I do question. Requiring a Bachelors degree seems good sense, as well as some demonstration of subject knowledge (every state has tests you have to take for this anyway, even with your Ed degree usually) and maybe giving you a few years for specific coursework where they feel you're lacking. But Education programs are already too rigid and, frankly, I don't see what they truly ADD to a toolbox. I see things they could add, but you can also build your skills and information in other ways. Alternative routes should be available and widened."

Most of us play an employee contribution to healthcare and pension these days. And tenure... well, that's a dying bird too - not dead yet, but it's being stripped away in many states and districts.

education,37ngni,Devchonachko,1 point,Fri May 29 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this, but I wanted to add a little more nuance to my original post. Under ""benefits and prestige"" I would count non-financial factors as being of paramount importance. Things like teachers have more control over the curriculum in their class, having more planning time, being able to rely on strong mentorships and professional support in the first 3-5 years of their career, being able to make meaningful decisions at their school in conjunction with administration.  I also think pay should be higher. The bar for becoming a teacher should be raised, not lowered. If we treat the teaching profession like we treat doctors, with a required ""residency"" period, demanding only the brightest graduates, and increasing the amount of education it takes to join the field, then teaching as a career starts to look more competitive for bright college students. It stops being a career where people go, ""I don't know what field my degree leads to... I guess I'll teach for a couple years!"" And it becomes a career where we value teachers as incredibly well educated professionals who should have greater control over their classrooms and their schools.  See this paper for more information about what causes teachers to leave high-poverty schools. Note that it's not salary; it's school culture, administration, and collegiality.  http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1231814.files/Teacher%20Turnover%20in%20High-Poverty%20Schools.pdf"

education,37ngni,firstroundko108,2,Mon Jun 1 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"True! And I'm not saying it's not important in many contexts. My point about tenure & due process stand, however. Even if it's not called tenure--or formally recognized by a board--teacher longevity and the correlated difficulty of dismissal is still present, as is with ""officially"" tenured professors. This could mean that once a teacher has put the time in--which, you maintain, if they're really all that bad, they'd have left way before then--they can slack off, burn out, and do their students a disservice, not being properly punished for crappy evaluations due to their tenure.   This hypothetical, from what I've seen, heard, and read about, is more common than we'd prefer. My own science education was severely damaged by just such a lazy dipshit. He had us watch videos of him snorkeling with manatees and his wife getting ultrasounds instead of teaching us earth science--which my bio teacher had to do in the first month of AP Bio the next year. That was eighth grade ""honors"" science, too. Oh, and then there's the sixth grade science teacher who referred to himself in third person, whose tests were all fill-in-the-blank vocab exams ripped from textbook passages, and who was having an affair with the English teacher. Yeah, these assholes exist, and it's a crime that administration was forced to allow them there.  But then, I despise cowards who manipulate the system for their own selfish reasons while harming kids and I'd never have the patience to teach, so there we are.  Getting back to the original article that started this whole discussion, however, I think getting rid of teacher certifications is ridiculous. Sure, let private schools do whatever they want with their kids, but how could people dismiss the classes that teach people how to teach? I'm a damn fine writer when I want to be, but past a tutored student or two, I don't delude myself into thinking I could teach an entire class with my current skill set. Bah.

The core argument seems to be the (rather obvious) statement that teachers need to be able to see what a student tried, to help them past their difficulties.  In my experience, though, there's another side of that coin.  Part of being comfortable with trying things and making mistakes, is understanding that it's possible to still put together a final product you can be proud of.  Particularly in math, too much emphasis on ""showing your work"" through their career leaves students not even understanding the difference between a stream-of-consciousness record of their work, and a final answer that communicates something to a reader without being a record of all of their missteps and abandoned ideas."

The simple reason that we tell the students is the one in this article: the teacher needs to see your mistakes so we can help you practice and get better.   The other reason it's that many of our students struggle with anxiety, a few in OCD territory, and once they start erasing, they get so into it that it becomes distracting and interferes with their progress. Either, they're focused on making it perfect, or hung up on being wrong, or they will keep rubbing till they get all the way through their paper.   Instead, we have the students circle their mistakes. This makes it a fluid movement as they are writing (many are dysgraphic, so we focus heavily fine motor skills and the mechanics of writing), it allows us to see repeated difficulties, and allows the students to move on quickly from their mistakes and continue their thought process."

If you do I think you have a screw or two loose. The problem isn't the students, it's the system itself. Administrators know students don't want to come to school. I feel like they voice that opinion enough. So what do they do? Create legislation that forces them to come against their will. Then everybody becomes ""shocked, shocked!"" that they don't want to be in this prison.  I hold the firm belief that children want to learn and grow as people. I think this is easily proven when you take a young child outside and see the wonder and curiosity, that spark in their eyes. The problem is we give them the absolutely shittiest environment possible to do so. This system among other things makes students take classes they don't want to take (and a lot of times will never hold any actual use for that person in any other point in their lives). Then people are shocked that they do poorly in those classes. Well idiots, if Jimmy loves Science and you only give him classes that aren't science, taking away the thing the person wants to learn, why is it a surprise that they hold no interest in it? Why is it a surprise that they don't want to be there? Instead of shoving our shitty model down their throats, how about we change the damn system?

Where I respectfully disagree is that children are all developmentally ready to know where their passions lie without exposure. The very idea of classical education is to learn about a broad array of topics to find your pain.  College is supposed to be where you focus more exclusively, hence having a major. Of course there are also magnet schools that are more specialized as well, but even in these schools there are core requirements.

Our wealthy students, our middle class students, and even our poor students outperform most of the world when compared to the same class of students around the world. In aggregate, we don't preform that well but that is more a function of the demographics of our country than the quality of our schools.  If one were to make the argument that more of the schools should foster the non cognitive skills you would only find agreement from a vast, vast, majority of educators.  That decision has been taken out of the hands of schools and individual teachers.  As for being a productive member of society, I was referring to an informed, educated, citizen of a free and democratic society. I don't see school before college as job training, and once again I would argue that it is outside influences that push education in that direction.  Hopefully this reply is clearer and more thorough."
education,37l5xs,ProClifo,6,Thu May 28 12:51:10 2015 UTC,"Do students go to this school after completing regular high school, or can you take a year-long ""break"" from regular high school to go to the Folk High School? Does going mean that you graduate from regular school a year later?  It sounds like a really good idea, to enable young people to develop their interests on their own time line, prior to committing to a full college (not just choosing a major, but also choosing where to apply to pursue that major). I feel like it would be looked down on in America if it extended your regular high school education time line, but if it were a substitute for what we call a ""gap year"", where students just take a year off to travel or work prior to starting college, it would be accepted."
education,37l5xs,aethauia,2,Thu May 28 14:13:43 2015 UTC,"The positive and negative aspects are person-specific, IMO. I agree that the U.S. analog is called a ""gap year."" For some students, I think a gap year is a bad idea, but for others it works out well. Mainly it depends on how the time is spent. If you spend a year sincerely devoting yourself to personal growth and better self-knowledge, I think you'll be better off. If you see spend it playing video games and browsing reddit, you probably won't get much out of it. A year of time won't necessarily help you figure out what you want to do with your life. I think people figure it out by experience (often trial and error). Simply thinking about whether you want to be a doctor won't be as helpful as spending time shadowing doctors or volunteering in a hospital or taking science courses."

Typically (in Denmark, at least) you would work for half a year and then go to a folk high school for the next ""semester.""  A folk high school counts on your CV the same way working experience would. If it is deemed relevant, it might help you get into university.  We also have something similar between middle school and high school, where you can take a year at what we call ""efterskole"" (lit. after school).   This can count for your final (9'th) year of elementary/middle school, or for grade 10, which is optional, but if you take it, you can take the 2-year version of our high schools (HF) in stead of the regular 3-years (Gymnasium)."

Most people go after graduating from upper secondary school though, which is normally at 18/19 years of age.

I don't know of any U.S. organizations offering something comparable to a ""folk high school"" experience, though. I don't know of any reason that an organization or company couldn't offer something like that. In the U.S., I'd say that a year of personal enrichment is more or less included in the ""traditional"" four-year experience. University students in the U.S. spend quite a bit of time on extracurricular activities (i.e. activities not at all related to their academic concentration). Similarly, it's not uncommon for U.S. students--at least the more affluent ones and students attending more competitive universities--to enroll at a university abroad for a semester and then spend most of their time traveling, rather than studying."

You learn so much about yourself and others, and at the same time do the things you love. I for example did a lot of snowboarding, travelling all around Europe, went on a lot of trips around the area where the school was, and just being there is so much fun because everyone at school is like one big family so there's barely any boring days there.

The other way that admin could suck is not handling discipline and following Ed. Code policies.   You might have a really toxic teacher culture too.   If I were in charge, first thing is get rid of the admin. Bring in some teachers fresh out of the class that get it still. Handle discipline to its full extent available. Offer consistently problematic students an application to nearby charter school. (Why not, they do the same to public school?) Get rid of testing and accountability measures for a year. Distribute veteran teachers to different grade levels so each grade level had veteran teachers. Distribute new teachers among grade levels.   Your school is in big trouble friend.

It's hard to understand just how powerful high school sports are, at least where I'm from. Extracurricular activities like speech and debate and others that are academically-oriented (many of them obscure and often unknown even to students at the school) are categorically left to chase the scraps of money left over after football and all the other sports have slopped at the trough. The dynamic of sports first, academics second, is alive and well.  Take coaches. Where I'm from, they carry celebrity status amongst the administration. Sure, there are inter-sports politics, but priorities lie with coaches at the top of the hiring food chain. Even if you're not a coach, to have credibility and even an iota of political power with admin, you must scrape your knees with plaudit-offering for sports and be friends with all the coaches. Then you might get recognized by the ""buddy-buddy"" in-group that the sports community forms. All of this is so ingrained as to be second nature, even for the principal--not reflected upon, but simply part of the world. Like breathing. You don't even think about not doing it. You don't think about it at all.   As the article pointed out, this means that coaching is prioritized over teaching. A coach, who has earned their keep on the field (or whatever) by maintaining a good team record, (or whatever) runs a basic classroom: sit down, press play on the PowerPoint, and chat with the athletes back at the desk for the rest of the hour.   The transportation budgets, activity budgets, praise, coverage, physical space, facilities, etc., go to sports.   Meanwhile, teachers trudge like overworked mice through the increasingly complex maze of testing and evaluation standards.    Coaches: extra-paid celebrities who have tremendous freedom to strive for their professional goals, with an inexplicable social foothold in the hiring process. Sure, they technically have to follow teaching standards, but they don't give a fuck because they're coaches, and they can afford that kind of attitude.  Teachers: paid a pittance, commoditized as cookie-cutter drones, slowly losing their freedom to teach. Sidelined by the spectacle of Athletics if they happen to take on an academic activity for smart kids, thanks to a vacuum of support from admin.    Scrap sports, scrap testing, pay teachers a lot more, give your now higher-qualified teachers (thanks to an actually professional pay grade, shocking I know) freedom to control their classroom in a TRULY academic environment, and good things will happen.   /rant"

I think sports are a part of American culture, and we shouldn't prevent that. The author also attributes the better education systems to the higher test scores and percentage of students taking AP tests, which I think is a poor correlation.  On my team, the coaches make sure you have a certain GPA and are not skipping school, which incentivizes lots of my teammates and classmates to do better in school. In my case and the case for my district (of 48.000) public school kids, sports supports academics.  Why is it always one or the other?

education,37i83d,Leifkj,14,Thu May 28 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"While I'm undecided on whether school sports teams are good or bad ideas, this strikes me as a particularly poor argument:   Sports are embedded in American schools in a way they are not almost anywhere else. Yet this difference hardly ever comes up in domestic debates about America’s international mediocrity in education. (The U.S. ranks 31st on the same international math test.) The challenges we do talk about are real ones, from undertrained teachers to entrenched poverty. But what to make of this other glaring reality, and the signal it sends to children, parents, and teachers about the very purpose of school?   They are trying to blame sports for poor test scores. It does not come to a surprise that they don't have any evidence that the two are related at all.   I also don't buy into putting so much emphasis on test performance. They cite several countries where education heavily emphasizes preparing for standardized tests. If anything, I think US education needs less of that!  They continue to make poor arguments by implying false dilemmas:   But as I’ve traveled around the world visiting places that do things differently—and get better results—I’ve started to wonder about the trade-offs we make.  Nearly all of Jenny’s classmates at Shawnee are white, and 95 percent come from middle- or upper-income homes. But in 2012, only 17 percent of the school’s juniors and seniors took at least one Advanced Placement test—compared with the 50 percent of students who played school sports.   Playing a sport doesn't exclude you from taking AP classes. Taking AP classes also doesn't mean you necessarily take the AP test.  Sports in school may or may not make sense. There are legitimate criticisms of including sports. However, this article conflates sports with the bigger issue of quality of education without making a case that the two are related at all. The one good argument the article makes is that sports teams are sometimes expensive and devoting that much money to something non-academic may not be getting the value that it would be if used for other purposes."

Student behavior on average was a ""night and day"" difference.  Students aspired to be part of the winning team. Classroom behavior and scholastic performance was part of that equation. Students did what was necessary to stay on the team, in the band, on the cheerleading squad, on the A/V team, etc. It was a total culture change. It was so drastic it changed my perception of sports in public schools. It's the carrot on the end of the stick for students that are not intrinsically motivated in school."

My first teaching job (school with poor sports offerings) had students that were  far less engaged.  It's a cultural shift that is real. How do you get students across the spectrum engaged?  (For the record I do think sports get far too much funding in proportion to classroom funding. Even at the first school, I was given no budget to outfit a computer classroom beyond the district provided computers while the athletic director got a very publicly acknowledged $100k salary and the team got new uniforms and a stadium.)"
education,37i83d,grendelt,2,Thu May 28 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"How do you get students across the spectrum engaged?   Exactly the reference I'm making. Kohn's Punished by Rewards takes a close look at the psychological research behind motivation (esp. student motivation) and the impact of carrot/stick systems for encouraging it. As it turns out almost all the evidence out there says that both punishments and rewards have a negative impact on student learning and motivation. The question becomes then how do we build education systems that tap into students' intrinsic interest and motivation to engage them in learning? From what I've seen of schools that accomplish that fairly well, I gather that the sort of academic engagement produced by that model far surpasses even the use of sports as a motivator. It seems we are in agreement about funding (too much!), I'm just suggesting that we should examine the whole carrot/stick concept in itself when we look for a better way."

That's going to depend on strong leaders locally raising the right questions and engaging in the right conversations with a wide variety of stakeholders to drive local thinking in that direction.

I am a instrumental music teacher (and this is not a music vs. sports comment), and one thing I noticed will all my students that also play some sort of sports that they see it as their most important activity (over music, friends, etc.) with maybe the exception of school depending on the student. Subjectively, I have conversations with parents all the time about how they don't think music is not that important b/c ""(s)he's not gonna be a musician"", but the same argument is not applied to sports. Obviously biased here, but there are proven studies of higher cognitive skills due to musical activity, so I don't see how sports is considered THAT much more useful.  Edit: spelling"

I'm on the school board at a school that is just expanding into high school grades, so we have this conversation a lot. We are not overcoming a specific mindset of ""At [school], we do this,"" but building the sports and extracurricular activities culture from scratch.  There is not an athletics-specific budget. I believe that it's important to school spirit to have strong clubs and activities, but I don't understand the common mindset that we're not a real school because we don't have a football team."

The mindset of this article seems focused around the idea that if the US can hit the highest test scores for the least money, then education has been saved, which is simply a misunderstanding of what education should be aiming for.  While there are plenty good debates on the emphasis put on sporting, the way this article twists this into another ""can we axe this to put more money into testing"" is fucking disgusting.   When will people realise that bettering education is not as simple as getting better international scores. One of the first points this article brings up is the way that South Korea has almost no in school sports yet the forth highest test scores. This is for one, a baseless correlation, and for another way to narrow an observation.   Every time anyone brings up South Korea's education and starts praising their numbers, I immediately dismiss their opinion. One stat that every one seems forget South Korea also holds is some of the highest depression rates and a significant lead on suicide per captia in developed countries.   Even if you could get higher test scores by draining money from aspects of school that engage kids like sports, then you would only be solving one problem with another, and education is not as simple as one problem.  edit: removed last part to sound less angry"
education,37i83d,ThyMightyThigh,5,Wed May 27 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"They talk about a school that removed sports:   That first semester, 80 percent of the students passed their classes, compared with 50 percent the previous fall.   Edit.   Andreas Schleicher, a German education scientist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ... “Our analysis suggests that the most engaging environment you can offer students is one of cognitive challenge combined with individualised pedagogical support,” he told me in an e-mail. “If you offer boring and poor math instruction and try to compensate that with interesting sport activities, you may get students interested in sports but I doubt it will do much good to their engagement with school.”"
education,37i83d,thisbitchneedsreddit,0,Thu May 28 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as remove sports and improve numbers. The emphasis placed sports may be too great yes, that I never argued, but the claims here are just to baseless to be taken seriously.   At the end of the segment you quote they also mention   Suspending sports was only part of the equation...   I never disagreed with the fact that there may be to much of an emphasis on sports and I likely should have read farther into the article, but the claims here are so all over and baseless that you cannot take them seriously.    “If you offer boring and poor math instruction and try to compensate that with interesting sport activities, you may get students interested in sports but I doubt it will do much good to their engagement with school.”   This while true, doesn't just magically happen when you remove sports. Removing sports doesn't teach teachers how to be more engaging, it frees up more money and resources which will obviously help but even then resources don't directly translate to performance.   The US spends more per student then any other country, and the money is not reflective of the results.   Again I never argued that there is to much of an emphasis on sports, more time to focus on school would likely be a good thing, but the point here that the article ties in two issues unrelated with very little actual proof and gives mixed messages.   There is no correlation here, the article points out in the quote you gave that boring classes and engagement are the issue here, and the article seems to make the claim that removing sports will magically make these things happen, which is simply not true.   The issue that should be addressed here is the quality of education, and the idea that removing sports magically makes class engaging and that the extra resources will make test scores go up is just ridiculous."
education,37i83d,ThyMightyThigh,7,Thu May 28 02:44:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with nearly everything you said.  This stood out, though:   The US spends more per student then any other country, and the money is not reflective of the results.   This is an incredibly misleading statistic that's cited over and over by opponents of public education, so it's worth debunking.  Aside from not really being true at face value (the U.S. is well behind Switzerland and Norway, for example), it compares apples and oranges, for two reasons:  First, the value of a US dollar is vastly different in countries with different economies.  Spending in a wealthier country must be higher, because everything - land, buildings, supplies, and labor - is more expensive.  Many people assume that because numbers are quoted in US dollars, we're considering equal purchasing power.  We're not.  Currency conversions account for equalizing value on the international market, but not for the differing opportunities in different places.  An acre of land in the U.S. goes for a lot more than an acre of land in Ethiopia, because there are a lot more profitable things you can do with it.  The same with an hour of work; in the U.S., you're competing against other higher-paying jobs.  So comparing educational spending in US dollars is meaningless at face value.  If you compare education spending versus GDP, the U.S. is slightly below average.  Second, there's a fairly arbitrary line in what challenges different countries accept, and how they divide spending between schools and other services.  Unlike most other first-world countries, the United States chooses to watch children grow up in two-income families with parents rarely at home.  Parental leave is a pipe dream for all but the most affluent.  Poverty and lack of access to health care literally stunts the development of many American children, leaving them needing a remarkable effort to catch up later.  But at the same time, the United States faces waves of immigration that many other developed countries don't.  Many of our children don't even speak the same language.  On top of this, one of our biggest remaining anti-proverty programs, free and reduced price school breakfast and lunch, is counted as education spending even though it has little or nothing to do with education.  This country has to pay more for education (but less on general social services, universal health care, etc.) because our schools are doing very different things from other schools.  Comparing these numbers without an eye to making sure they are at all comparable is in the end nothing but sleight of hand."

education,37gjd5,kaosotis,1 point,Sun May 31 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"It's safe to say that a lot of people are unsatisfied and even frustrated with the current educational paradigm of western society. The focus on grades, tests, competition and even subjects that are irrelevant and have little real-world application to a lot of people, to my knowledge, are the dominating issues.  While contemplating this, i have been trying to figure out exactly what would be the best possible system an educational institution could have that serves and prepares people for life. Children and adult alike. Which brings me to my question(s).  What would you say would be the optimal system?  * What subjects would be taught? Why? * How would these subjects be taught? * How would progress be tracked? * How would the classroom be formatted? * What would the underlying philosophy of the method be?  I know this is a big, complicated question. But I'd love to hear what other, more educated an experienced people have to say on this. It's a very interesting discussion to have, and I'd love to learn more.   I'd love to know what subjects people learn in school that have little real world application.  The argument that students should pursue their passions only presupposes that students know enough about different areas of study to choose. Hence a classical broad based liberal arts education.  K-12 education is not job training, nor should it be.  One could reasonably argue that offerings should be more diverse, even in elementary school, but resume, writing, math, and problem solving skills are life skills no matter what your career.  In addition, schools should be helping create an educated population so they can meaningfully take part in both economic and political life."
education,37gjd5,kaosotis,1 point,Sun May 31 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"Thinking it over while formulating my response, i realized that i should have formulated myself differently. All the subjects are important and have real world application, but the level of which depends on each student and their goals. Overall, the focus there is on math and sciences and lack of focus on the arts is imbalanced and presupposes that all students are going to continue science studies in college, which isn't always the case. Arts and scinces are just as important as one another. Also, there should be more focus than there is on health. Being able to take care of oneself and leading a healthy lifestyle (physically, psychologically, socially, sexually) is needless to say important.  I agree that it shouldn't be expected of young children to know what their passions are, but there should be freedom to explore different areas that they might find interesting (after the nessesary, core subjects)  I don't entirely agree. It shouldn't be the focus, since there is more to life than getting a job, but there should be classe(s)/course(s) about getting jobs in the last couple/few years in order to help the students get jobs, either after or during their education.  I agree with more diversity, as well as learning the mentioned life skills. But in my experience, Resume and problemsolving skills aren't taught to the extent they should. I personally cannot remember learning these when i was in school.  Yes, education should educate the population in order to meaningfully take part in economic and political life, but personal satisfaction and happiness is also very important.  Would you say that the education system doesn't need much improvement? I got that vibe from your comment.  EDIT: Grammar"

Granted not all subject have tangible material but I was always more interesting in school when I was physically interacting with the topic (science classes, history classes, math classes). Classes such as Literature class where harder (but still important) since we'd ether have a book on tape or just a boring book that wont help me later in life (my opinion).   What subjects would be taught? Why?  Mentioned some classes above but youd obviously want some sort of GYM class to keep the blood flowing. And what if more school had independent study? let a student explore an interest of theirs then make them reflect on it in some sort of report. How would these subjects be taught?  Group interaction was my favorite way in school. Instead of mindlessly listening to a lecture that I tend to space in an out of, an open discourse in the class engages all students. How would progress be tracked?  Now tracking is hard since there is a big split on the grading aspect nowadays but I fell based off of what the student contributes to the class.  How would the classroom be formatted?  it shouldnt be. everyday should have some chaos to it. I found that when I associate a certain setting with a topic I can get too comfortable and lose focus. What would the underlying philosophy of the method be? Keep the students engaged, the moment they are not, they are lost.

Further, (and especially relevant for colleges where young people are supposed to build their own value systems and interpretations of the world) if an idea is bad, or wrong, or in a gray area, it should be able to stand or fall on its own merit rather than be shoved into a closet away from rigorous debate or questioning.

BUT let's pretend for a minute that the Muslim students group was accurate in their assertion that American Sniper is a ""anti-Arab and anti-Islamic"" film which ""dehumanizes Muslim individuals, promotes the idea of senseless mass murder, and portrays negative and inaccurate stereotypes"".   Wouldn't that make it a great film for college students to study? Don't they go there to learn about art, and film, and history, and culture? Can you really say that a propaganda piece (as the Muslim student organization asserted the film was) can't teach our college students an important lesson about propaganda, hate, history, politics, civics, war, art, you name it?  The students weren't making that argument. They were arguing that the film created a ""dangerous climate"" which is patently untrue! What an unreasonable fear to think that other students would watch a film and all of the sudden become hateful, murderous bigots.   Further, if Muslim students are so afraid of a film and its message and the ramifications of that message, wouldn't the best course of action be to engage in dialogue that a campus screening would invite rather than to pretend it doesn't exist?  So, while they had an absolute right to protest the film's screening, it was most likely wrongheaded to do so and hurt their overall cause."
education,37c5rq,Patricki,2,Tue May 26 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Ok. I want to first reply to your comments on our American Sniper scenario, and then I'll address the examples you have cited.  The creation of a dangerous climate wasn't the sole argument against the showing of the film, only one aspect of many criticisms.  The others included marginalization, and the perpetuation of negative ideas and beliefs.  Those criticisms and their validity are debatable, I suppose, but it doesn't change the fact that they exist within the context of students self governing what values and morals are perpetuated through campus entertainment.  Which again, is exactly what you were espousing as matter-of-fact not so long ago.   Wouldn't that make it a great film for college students to study? Don't they go there to learn about art, and film, and history, and culture? Can you really say that a propaganda piece (as the Muslim student organization asserted the film was) can't teach our college students an important lesson about propaganda, hate, history, politics, civics, war, art, you name it?    Further, if Muslim students are so afraid of a film and its message and the ramifications of that message, wouldn't the best course of action be to engage in dialogue that a campus screening would invite rather than to pretend it doesn't exist?     These two statements are very related, so I'll address them both at the same time.  As far as I know, the film did spark a debate, and there was a panel discussion on the screening.  Also to imply that a group criticizing the content of a film equates to ""pretending it doesn't exist"" is a little disingenuous, don't you think?  If anything such criticism, in my opinion, belies an awareness of the social context of the film.  I really think the critical thing to consider here is the context under which this event was taking place.  You make a good point when you say that the film has value as an instructional tool.  I agree.  But the film wasn't being presented in an ""educational"" context.  This was a campus life event, not a class with dialogue being facilitated by a professor.  I'm not arguing that entertainment can't be educational, but the forum does color the information being disseminated to a great degree.  Ok.  The examples you've cited are legitimate, some more so than others.  However, those issues have always been a matter of controversy in academia.  There are countless scenarios that well predate the ones you listed.  The balance between individual rights, and the rights of institutions to govern what happens within them have always existed in a gray area.  They're nothing new.  Free speech has not ""fallen"", the controversies that exist now have been occuring since free speech was conceived.  The reason you're hearing so much about them now is due to a lot of different factors.  You have the accessibility of mass information (the internet et. al), the relative ease by which people can pre-select and manicure what information reaches them (consuming only websites that validate the user's own world-view), and (and this is, in my opinion, an important one) a concerted effort by the right to de-legitimize and undermine the validity of higher education, in the same way that they have undermined the efficiency and validity of other public welfare programs; in order to create a vacuum within which monetization can occur.  Edit:  Note that in none of your examples was legal action taken by the government against the individuals in question, which is what free speech protects you from."

Other things completely unrelated were posted, and after I had to insist they finally answer one simple question. It's a shuck and jive, plain and simple. The real problem is that people who want to undermine society want the freedom to rally hate on our campuses and we're getting in their way. They clamor and complain, citing high-sounding morals as excuse to perpetrate base and terrible things. If they werent allowed to discuss conservative approaches to economics, I'd totally agree with you. Inciting others to murder or to torture those who disagree with them is nothing like that at all.

With matters related to speech - where is the line - and who decides when it is crossed? Purdue has still allow censorship for several reasons.   However, they have made it clear that finding something deeply offensive is is still OK - so my guess is that most hate speech would be protected.  What is hate speech? Who is the judge of such speech? Can I complain if someone says something in public about a topic related to my gender, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, age, clothes, hat? What if they say those things about my classmates, roommates, friends, family, etc? It might not align with my values or yours or his or hers - does that mean they should simply be censored?  The classic example that I think of is local/state police separating and protecting the KKK or a similar organization from anti-KKK people. Deeply offensive as their message is - they still have the right to free speech and free assembly.  Another angle is that the right to free speech and assembly allowed the fruits of the civil rights movement in the and 60's - there were (and unfortunately still are) tens of thousands of people who found all of their efforts to be deeply offensive. They continued on because of the right to free speech and assembly."

This leads me to believe it is hate speech you are looking to have flourish on college campuses. Originally you said it would be educational but now you retract that.  Firstly, one person's ""enlightened discourse using diverse speech"" is another person's ""giving of a sanctioned platform to deliver hate speech, legitimizing said speech and potentially recruiting young people to the cause.""  Also, institutions get to decide on how hate speech is handled, public or otherwise.Wherever you work, you will lose your job if you call your boss racial epithets, for example. If you post even just disparaging remarks about any place at which you are employed, you can potentially lose your job. Unwarranted speech can earn you libel and slander suits. Your speech can be curtailed in any number of ways, in any number of settings, from not being able to speak your mind in the military without permission to insubordination in the work place to language permitted on television. None of this has anything to do with ""free speech.""  More often than not, this criticism is expressed by people who are deeply disappointed that they cannot use universities as their platform to recruit young people to hate causes. I suppose the counter argument you're presenting is that by permitting hate speech on campuses, students will learn from a bad example but I think that is not only wishful thinking but a disingenuous attempt to obscure the true intent. Hate speech on college campuses is a bone of contention today, to be sure. Some consider it within the bounds of free speech, others consider it ""fighting words"" which tend not to be protected. There currently is no blanket approach by the courts.  So, I could be off base, though. Specifically what speech is it you are referring to and, if it is not enlightening and educational, what is the purpose of said speech and its benefit to the student?"
education,37c5rq,ademnus,7,Tue May 26 21:44:05 2015 UTC,"I think the other commenter who replied to you answered back well with regards to a lot of your point about ""hate-speech"" (which is really just speech that you may not like, or speech that some arbiter of what is legitimate speech deems illegitimate).

Remember the whole: ""... shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, ... or the right of the people peaceably to assemble"".

We shouldn't suppress ideas, that's where discoveries are made! ""open discourse."" Also very useful in a university setting. No one should be afraid to bring ideas to the table. ""Controversial commencement speakers."" Oh, hm, that's a bit different. That's not ideas being discussed openly in a university setting so much as it is someone speaking at graduation, your one memory of the experience. I'm not so sure I'd be thrilled if Manson came to speak at my graduation and advocated rape and murder. So, I suppose it isn't the same as a discourse of ideas at universty, but ok. No one really wants Manson, I'm sure. So who do they want?  Ann Coulter springs to mind. I seem to recall she got the boot from someone's commencement ceremony once. Let's look at her ""discourse of ideas.""  ""We should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity.""  ""My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.""  ""I think the government should be spying on all Arabs, engaging in torture as a televised spectator sport, dropping daisy cutters wantonly throughout the Middle East and sending liberals to Guantanamo.""  So, the ideas we should be bringing to the diversity of thought include murder, torture and the arrest of citizens with different opinions? See, when we bring ideas to the diversity of thought, we are asking students to choose the ideas which best suit their needs. Maybe a university shouldn't be suggesting murder as a possible and sanctioned course of action for students. Maybe it's an idea we all suppress. I hope."

Also, there is a amount of problems when it comes to pushing trades.

This resulted in trade school being pushed onto an overwhelming about of black students and 4-year colleges being pushed primarily onto white students.

If you ask me, having 4 years of education from age 18-22 is the old way of doing it.

A town is founded way-back-when, and when there are enough kids in the community, the community hires a school teacher and has itself a real nice one-room school house.   Fast forward to modern times and there are a bunch of schools in the community that have a sense of connection... be it geography, city boundaries, or some social relationship. They've formed themselves into a school district to share administrative costs and pool state and federal funding. Basically, they file a request with their state to form a school district, or to break a set of schools out from an existing district to start a new district.  So, for example, my local elementary school district is composed of only elementary and middle schools in my town (ages 5 to 13). There is only one high school, and its district encompasses a second city that has a high school, too. In other communities, a district might include both elementary and high schools, or be spread out over several cities or towns. An elected school board is separate and independent from any city or county elected boards. A big city can have dozens of school districts within it.  Basically, how this woman got elected is that a majority of voters in her school district wanted her elected. If they disagree with her on this issue, we won't know until she runs for re-election, or someone mounts a recall campaign to kick her out of office.

First and foremost, the board sets the district's budget (each school's funding) and approves the policies that apply to all schools.

education,3730fk,UtzTheCrabChip,1 point,Sun May 24 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"Why would reducing black admissions result in more black ""rock stars""?   The way it is now, affirmative action results in a high number of underqualified blacks. All that does is create more examples of blacks who have a hard time. It literally gives racists fodder to claim that blacks aren't smart, because the average black performs at a lower level, thanks to affirmative action.  Eliminate affirmative action, and there will be fewer blacks, but they will perform equally to others, defying the stereotype.  Now -- I'm not advocating this! -- but if we could magically raise the standards for blacks above those of whites/asians, you'd see a very low number of blacks. But they would defy stereotypes by performing at a high level."

Mostly because at home they speak Turkish, Papiamento/Papiamentu, Berber languages or Moroccan Arabic. When the kids go to school they haven't been talking Dutch as much as the rest of the kids.

This starts around 10-12 years. Mostly boys. Well, they are very effective at this. Today it is very hard to get an internship or a job when you have a Moroccan sounding name. For the people that work hard to do well in school and try to fit in this is very frustrating. I feel for them. I had a few pupils that exprienced this. I feel very sorry for them and I know they can do the job well.  On the other hand. The kids that refuse to learn (the language) can go fuck themself. I hate the part of that subculture that is against learning, getting ahead and making something of yourself by working hard and treating other people with respect. They make education suck for everyone (teachers, other pupils and themself). Adressing the problem is rascist in their eyes. ""White man trying to turn us white"". Being dumb is being cool.

Teachers are perceived as the sole cause of precious little snowflakes failing (the message went from ""student fail courses"" to ""teachers failing students."") 5 years ago - mission accomplished Get rid of all teacher unions so that public school teachers don't have a common voice. 4 years ago - mission accomplished Glorify all private schools without any testing or evidence. 3 years ago - mission accomplished Make the public schools compete with one another due to school choice. Every public school teacher I know is not into competition - they would be elated if everyone in the world has an education. Now school districts are hoping neighboring schools tank so that they get their students. 3 years ago - mission accomplished Move to bring in unlimited vouchers (they were capped to 1,000 these past few years.) 2014 and 2015 - mission not actualized but also part of this funding plan De-professionalize education so that the market is saturated with people willing to teach for <$20,000 per year. On agenda for this coming year Bring in venture capitalists to hire cheap teachers, not take students with special needs, trouble students, or transient students, and can pick and choose any students they want. Additionally, they are not accountable for expelling any student they don't want. Approximately 2016-2017 Put most of the money into marketing on how much better they are doing versus public schools even though they have different populations, no required tests, and the public schools have regulations and laws mandated for them to take ANY student.

education,36vwkf,lofi76,2,Sat May 23 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"My heart goes out to union workers and all Wisconsin workers. It's not like they didn't try their damnedest. But when the financial flow of dark money from corporate interests outside the state rides right up Scott walkers asshole, it's hard to stop it.    MADISON, Wis. — A bill eliminating most collective bargaining rights from nearly all Wisconsin public employees passed the Legislature's budget-writing committee late Wednesday night despite two days of mass public protests.  The bill went through with all Republicans backing it and no Democratic support.  The vote clears the way for the Senate to take up the bill Thursday.  Thousands of protesters packed the Capitol Rotunda to watch the hearing on television monitors, booing and screaming when supporters of the measure talked. Protesters packed the Capitol all day Tuesday during a 17-hour hearing, overnight and again all day Wednesday.  But their attempts to change the bill proposed by new Republican Gov. Scott Walker were in vain. Republicans made some changes, but nothing that would keep bargaining rights intact.  School districts in Madison and other Wisconsin cities said there will be no classes Thursday as the state's largest teachers union called on all 98,000 of its members who could to attend rallies at the capital.  ""This is not about protecting our pay and our benefits,"" Wisconsin Education Association Council President Mary Bell said at a press conference on the Capitol Square. ""It is about protecting our right to collectively bargain.""  Wisconsin in 1959 became the first state to grant collective bargaining to government workers.  Walker is seeking passage of the nation's most aggressive anti-union proposal.  The Statehouse filled with as many as 10,000 demonstrators, and many Madison teachers joined the protest by calling in sick in such numbers that the district had to cancel classes.  As protesters chanted outside his office door on the second consecutive day of demonstrations, Walker insisted he has the votes to pass the measure, which he says is needed to help balance a projected $3.6 billion budget shortfall and avoid widespread layoffs.  ""We're at a point of crisis,"" the governor said.  In addition to eliminating collective bargaining rights, the legislation would also make public workers pay half the costs of their pensions and at least 12.6 percent of their health care coverage — increases that Walker calls ""modest"" compared to those in the private sector.  'Kill this bill!' More than 13,000 protesters gathered at the Capitol on Tuesday for a 17-hour public hearing on the measure. Thousands more came Wednesday. Some stood outside the governor's door, chanting ""Recall Walker now!""  More than 1,000 protesters, many of whom spent the night in sleeping bags on the floor of the Rotunda, shouted ""Kill this bill!"" on Wednesday.  ""I'm fighting for my home and my career,"" said Virginia Welle, a 30-year-old teacher at Chippewa Falls High School. She said she and her husband, who is also a teacher, each stand to lose $5,000 a year in higher pension and health care contributions.  Welle said she could never get that money back since the unions would be unable to bargain over benefits under Walker's plan.  There were some indications Wednesday that support for the plan may be waning among Republicans who control the Legislature.  Senate Republicans met in secret to discuss the bill. Asked where the GOP stood, Sen. Dan Kapanke of La Crosse told The Associated Press, ""That's a really good question. I don't know.""  On Tuesday, the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reported that several members of the Green Bay Packers — who are part of the National Football League Players Association — came out against Walker's plan.  ""As a publicly owned team we wouldn't have been able to win the Super Bowl without the support of our fans,"" reads a statement signed by seven current and former players. ""It is the same dedication of our public workers every day that makes Wisconsin run. They are the teachers, nurses and child care workers who take care of us and our families. But now in an unprecedented political attack Governor Walker is trying to take away their right to have a voice and bargain at work.""  Protests taking toll  The protests have been larger and more sustained than any in Madison in decades. Dozens of protesters spent the night in sleeping bags on the floor of the Rotunda. A noise monitor in the Rotunda registered 105 decibels at midday Wednesday — approximately the same volume as a power mower or chainsaw.  Beyond the Statehouse, more than 40 percent of the 2,600 union-covered teachers and school staff in Madison called in sick, forcing the superintendent to call off classes in the state's second-largest district. No other widespread sickouts were reported at any other school.  Prisons, which are staffed by unionized guards who would lose their bargaining rights under the plan, were operating without any unusual absences, according to a Department of Corrections spokeswoman.  Walker has said he would call out the National Guard to staff the prisons if necessary. A union leader for prison workers did not immediately return messages.  Democrats said the bill would be tough to stop. Democrats lost the governor's office and control of the Legislature in the November midterm elections.  ""The Legislature has pushed these employees off the cliff, but the Republicans have decided to jump with them,"" said Sen. Bob Jauch, one of 14 Democrats in the 33-member chamber.  While other states have proposed bills curtailing labor rights, Wisconsin's measure is the most aggressive anti-union move yet to solve state budget problems. It would end collective bargaining for state, county and local workers, except for police, firefighters and the state patrol.  Protesters targeted the budget committee's public hearing Tuesday to launch what Vos called a ""citizen filibuster,"" which kept the meeting going until 3 a.m. Wednesday.   Two floors below the hearing, dozens of University of Wisconsin-Madison teaching assistants and students poured into the Capitol rotunda late Tuesday evening, putting down sleeping bags and blankets. Many were asleep on the floor when the hearing ended.  Workers' rights part of state history  Wisconsin has long been a bastion for workers' rights. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees was founded in 1936 in Madison.  http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41624142/ns/politics-more_politics/t/thousands-protest-wisconsin-anti-union-bill/"

The article doesn't state that.  One of my best HS teachers was a janitor. He didn't finish college, but he was very active in electronics. He eventually became a shop teacher for electronics. Our auto shop teacher didn't graduate college, either and he is easily the most beloved teacher from that school.   For myself, I didn't finish college so I had to combine work experience and what I had done and get evaluated by the TEA (Texas) for my teaching credential. Again, I can teach.   The AA thing makes sense because nothing taught in 6-12 is going to be above what you'd learn in CC anyway. You don't need to know 300-level biology to teach HS biology, even AP Biology.  Where I think there's a hole is that in a teaching track at University is that you get good practicum time - teachers should have to apprentice in the public classrooms. You get psychology courses - teachers should understand some of that so an AA degree should still include certain core competencies. You need to pass classroom instruction - the state could have teacher certification as part of the AA.  To the latter part, I'm in favour of certain programs where getting your Bacherlor's (or Master's) automatically confers upon you a teaching credential/licence/whatever, but in lieu of that you ought to be able to take an exam.  And of course the pay thing is less, which is why many educators will shoot for a Master's degree so they can make more. If you want to teach with only an AA, expect to be paid less. I don't think the sky is falling, I think these teachers will work in the field and continue to improve their skills and education to be paid more. I think this will benefit stuff like PE and shop class. I don't buy the conspiracy that this is going to gut the education system just because Scott Walker is a shitty governor."

Then when the schools fail--and they're being set up to do so, by this and a variety of other measures--they can that much more easily be privatized.  It's probably on the conspiracy level to think that this is all a plot to have taxpayers fund religious education, or to segregate the wealthy from the poor keeping the unprivileged from getting a decent education and thereby maintaining the status quo, or to make it easier to eliminate critical thinking and other skills from the population at large so they can more easily be manipulated.

There are, of course, a variety of personal factors that go into being a good teacher, and some of them can't be taught.  But there are also a lot of skills that CAN be taught.  The subject area knowledge itself is a big part of that, and I think you're very wrong that an average community college teaches enough subject knowledge to be a very effective teacher at the high school level.  Then there's education classes, which absolutely DO help people become better teachers.  As you noted, people with unconventional backgrounds do end up teaching, even today... but it's unusual.  Which means you're considering the very exceptional teachers you remember having -- individuals who were able to prove themselves capable teachers despite their backgrounds.  Great... but if those baseline requirements are eliminated and for-profit charter schools turn to out of work community college graduates to fill warm bodies in their classrooms for cheap, most of those kids aren't going to be taught by exceptional individuals who have risen above their poor academic history.  They will be taught by people with no demonstrated competence in their field, marginal classroom skills at best, and a not particularly strong investment in their career as an educator.

Passing notes used to happen, but it's nothing compared to the level of obsession kids develop with technological devices when left to it without limits.  If a device is useful for collaboration in class, that's a different matter, of course.

But the other thing that's very often helpful to classroom collaboration is when kids put away the devices and pay attention directly to what's going on around them.  That you can incorporate technology into a lesson doesn't automatically make it the right thing to do.  Forcing collaboration through the mobile device limits it to happening only in the in certain narrow ways predicted by a software developer, and vastly reduces to amount of information exchanged.  Sometimes that's a justifiable cost because the technology is useful.  The majority of the time, it's not."

I am not saying, that there aren't vocations or situations where attention on one thing is absolutely necessary. I am also not saying,  that everyone should do multitasking which I also think is not really possible.

If it means quickly searching something up when it comes to a patient's symptoms, messaging/paging your internet/resident/attending about something important involving a patient, decision making regarding patient follow up, or whatever.  I've also seen patients take calls when they've been talking to doctors, sometimes shit is important and people have lives outside of what they're doing at that very minute, and need to address things. Sometimes things might seem to be mundane to you personally, but it's clearly important to the person using the phone for whatever reason, who are you to say they're wrong?  In our classes in basic science (first and second year) the internet was banned during non-lunch hours, and most students felt it was definitely damaging to your education. Hard to follow your prof when they're talking about a LBBB when you don't even know what a LBBB looks like on an ECG.  Phones are a part of our lives, even (and sometimes especially in work life), I've never understood the crazy authoritarian rules inside of schools, when the outside world doesn't function like that most of the time. Why not try to adapt to how the outside world works, inside of draconian rules banning technology which can be potentially beneficial?  Kids are going to use phones, so are adults, it's a fact of life. Sure there's a time and place for everything, but what we need is better teaching of that, not enforcing school wide bans of things like phones... or plastic knives.  Also, grades reflect performance in the classroom, and are a good metric to see if your kids are learning material, but they don't mean a whole lot (not nothing, but still not a lot) inside of a professional or life setting, and that's what school is supposed to prepare you for, anyway.

They are basically always playing games.  Middle school ages... 11 - 15... are the hardest, because there, kids certainly can make appropriate uses of technology on their own, but most of them still choose not to.  That's when you have the hard choices about whether to choose classroom management (take away the phone) or educational opportunities (let them do it).  High school and above...

education,36rm4n,bluefootedpig,2,Fri May 22 02:41:39 2015 UTC,"thing about medical is the majority of issues like you mention are simply memorization. Like knowing a formula.    Diagnostics is anything but memorization. The information you have are useful pieces of your tool kit, and form the basis for diagnosis, but you have to evaluate all of it to figure out what's going on. There's a general idea that nurses/PAs/mid-level workers work based on protocol, or defer to it, but it's often the job of a physician to think critically and figure out what's going on.  People don't present like they do in textbooks (pathognomonic), humans are very complex, and any number of things can point you towards a variety of differentials. If you see an acute illness and are 100% certain that you know what it is immediately, you probably missed something or didn't do nearly enough work. For example there's like 5-15 different things where people will present to an ER with crushing chest pain, not just a ""heart attack"" (MI), depending on the symptoms... your job is to figure them out based on all the other stuff you find out along the way. It takes a decent amount of problem solving to figure something out.  To relate to your analogy of formulas, it's more like discrete mathematics, where a variety of solutions/formulas can be used to lead to the same answer, but your job is figuring out which ones to do in a specific case, and which one is the most effective, fastest, and (because of the reality of the situation when it involves finite resources) the cheapest too.   That said, no amount of Internet will answer critical thinking problems.    Yeah, but it'll provide you the formulas you need to help solve your equation. After the diagnosis, you still have a crap load of choices for treatment in many cases, and you have to figure out which one might work best for your patient. Sometimes it's important to know when not to treat, as well. Treating something with something as simple as food poisoning could mean the difference between killing the bug causing it, or causing a huge terrible reaction depending on the bug causing it. Killing certain bugs causes huge amounts of inflammation, stopping the diarrhea can cause bacterial overgrowth and emergency situations). You often don't have enough time to wait for the cultures to come in, and you treat empirically, because waiting long enough for them to come in might cause the patient to end up in a much worse situation.   To relate to your field, imagine you have 3 patients with different issues but all must be treated quickly. Which one do you handle, which do you allow a nurse to do, etc. No amount of Google will solve that.   I didn't realize schools taught critical thinking skills at all. I didn't know there was grades or any correlation between grades and critical thinking skills? In all my years of school, I don't know how much of a correlation I've noticed between high performers and critical thinking skills.  In fact, I thought one of the biggest qualms that intelligent people who hate school had was the lack of critical thinking skills, or actually real-life relevant information. That's how I always felt, and I've heard that sentiment echoed by a lot of my well educated friends too, it's been a point of discussion before.  Sex ed is great (and possibly one of the more important things people learn in school), but there's not much in the way of financial planning skills, learning about job prospects/opportunities or fields first hand, how to be effective at your job, or even how to properly use google. People just sort of have to end up figuring that out on their own.  I don't know enough about being an educator myself, but I'd like to think I have a decent grasp on being educated.

Instead of students paying tuition directly, it becomes the taxpayer, as filtered through a wasteful government bureaucracy. Any time you introduce a middleman, things become less efficient -- even moreso when that middleman is the government, which has no incentive to spend money frugally. Student turnover. People value what they pay for. Make education free, and people will value it less. Grades will go down, and you'll see more people failing out of college. A Bachelor's will lose even more value. The job market will be flooded with college graduates, further diluting the value of a Bachelor's degree. Students will have to get a Masters to really distinguish themselves. Will that also be federally funded? Enrollment in useless majors will skyrocket. Students paying for their own education feel they need to ""make it count"" by enrolling in majors with a good return on investment. If that investment is zero, people become more likely to major in Medieval Poetry. Schools will endlessly expand enrollment in such majors, because it means more federal money. Employers will catch on, and they'll discriminate even harder against graduates with those majors. Who's going to pay for it? Free education would be colossally expensive. You'll either have to raise taxes, punishing the middle and upper classes, or you'll have to cut programs elsewhere, punishing the poor. I believe the phrase is, ""robbing Peter to pay Paul."" This is a critical point: it's easy to clamor for the government to fund something, but the budget is a zero-sum game. You have to ask, what is being sacrificed to pay for this new thing?   In closing, this is a bad, bad policy.  Government subsidies often have the effect of screwing up market forces. It happened to corn; it happened to fossil fuels; it happened to student loans. We would do better to eliminate federal student loan subsidies and let the market correct itself. If we fail to do this, we will see the student loan bubble burst in a decade or two, and it's going to make the dotcom crash look like nothing more than a seasonal fluctuation."

education,36no2r,citizenpolitician,2,Thu May 21 15:29:54 2015 UTC,"Titled the “College for All Act,” the bill would eliminate the $70 billion dollar tuition costs at all 4-year public colleges and universities.   So right off the bat, this is a lie.  The cost of JUST TUITION at all PUBLIC universities is not $70B.  So lets look at the real numbers:   Number of total students enrolled at 4-year public universities: 16,000,000 (this number excludes the 5,000,000 that attend Private universities).  Percent of 4-year students that are out of state: 13.7%   So based on the College Boards Tuition study we can determine the actual cost of paying for college.   Instate students: $9,139 (average tuition) * 13,808,000 students = $126,191,312,000.00  OutofState students: $22,958 (average tuition) * 2,192,000 students = $50,323,936,000  For a total Tuition cost of: $176,515,248,000 PER YEAR  To put this number in perspective, the normal 10-year fiscal planning cycle of the US government would create a tuition cost of $1.8 TRILLION dollars.  The entire Obamacare plan for 10-years is only $1.3 Trillion dollars.   This would make the Higher Education bill the 7th most expensive item on the budget, just above the Veterans Administration and health benefits and just below the payment on the National Debt.  BUT, all of this is ok because Sanders had decided to create a Robin Hood tax to pay for this and for most people this sounds reasonable because it is only going to tax Wall Street and the those filthy rich people.  And there is where you would be absolutely wrong.   How could one complain about this? the tax is only .5% on stocks and .1% on bonds .... PER TRANSACTION. That is the kicker. Based on statistics from the NYSE, lets look at a very simplified example of this .5% tax per stock transaction tax.    The average stock price on the NYSE is roughly $60 - $65.  However, the average stock on the stock exchange trades (transacts) 58 times per year. That would be a total tax of 290% or $188.50.  But lets be fair and say the tax is only on the net increased value of the stock, not its price.  Well even at that the tax is still close to 30%.  Essentially the Robin Hood tax would completely shut down the NYSE.    But again no one cares because that's just the rich people.  Except that 60 - 65% of all stocks and bonds are owned by .... YOU. Do you have a 401K? an IRA? a Teacher Pension Fund? a Union Pension Fund? You see YOU own the stock, not the rich.  The Robin Hood tax would essentially shut down your pension fund.   Whats even worse about this is that other countries provide free tuition and do it successfully, but they learned in the process that there has to be constraints on the colleges and enrollment to prevent the cost from exploding beyond their ability to pay.  The Sanders plan has put riders on the bill that ensure the failure of the educational system by exploding the cost beyond all reasonable ability to pay.    If we truly want a program like this to even remotely work, we should follow the Germany model."

education,36no2r,citizenpolitician,3,Thu May 21 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"well to put it simply:    Basically, grades 7-10 take tests. Passing tests puts you in the schools that prepare you for college.  Not passing the test means you go into vocational training and you can pretty much forget about college.  Germany has  2 tests at different levels of high school. Failure to pass one of these tests and you pretty much cannot qualify for college.  IF you pass the qualification tests, you still have to make it into a school. Each school has a minimum GPA. If you do not have that GPA, do not even think about applying to that school.  Once in the school, if you fail a class, you can take it again but you must pass with at least a C. If not you can never take that class again and if that class is a prerequisite to a degree program, then you cannot get that degree from any college in Germany.  Germany also has quotas for school, but not like America.  Quotas are designed to allow TOP quality students in before other. It also has quotas for those student who have been waiting the longest to get accepted to a school. Hardship and minority students only have a 2% quota where as Top educational students have a 20% quota. So if you don't have straight A's or B's you are in a world of hurt. lastly, Germany has less than 3% of the population attend college. America is closer to 10%. This is why universal college is more affordable to other nations: They restrict access."

Do you know if anyone in Germany feels that this system doesn't give students from poorer regions a chance to perform well?  That is one critique of the Baccalaureate system in France.  Some people feel that it perpetuates the divide between the poor and rich because the students from more wealthy families tend to perform better on the tests.  I would imagine this would be a problem in the U.S. due to how different student performance can be between school districts, but from what I can tell Germany doesn't seem to have this problem."

education,36molk,medikit,15,Wed May 20 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"FYI, many ivy league colleges offer free tuition if income is low enough. Generally, tuition is free if income is below $60,000, a few below $100,000, with families above the cut-off paying a percentage sliding scale based on income.  I suspect the $60,000 is for a single child home, if they calculate income status based on the number of dependents like most organizations do."
education,36molk,bookchaser,9,Wed May 20 20:17:53 2015 UTC,The big name schools often end up being cheaper then state schools because they have loads of scholarships using their huge endowments for targeting low and middle class students.
education,36molk,jwjmaster,-2,Wed May 20 15:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically, if they weren't wealthy enough already, they turned huge profits during the dot-com bubble... endowments that are worth tens of billions of dollars."
education,36molk,bookchaser,11,Wed May 20 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"This is likely a good choice, but I understand that some people take the calculated risk of going to an Ivy League school purely so that they can network. Networking is especially important in industries like investment banking."
education,36molk,poggendorff,7,Wed May 20 19:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. This principle applies regardless of college. Most of the time, getting a job is about who you know (references from people already employed at the organization, knowing someone on the search committee, basically having some sort of tie-in where they know about you before you apply).   Generally, you need to be 110% better than the competition to overcome that bias. I had the head of a university search committee call to tell me I wasn't selected for a position. He rather dangerously disclosed his boss selected someone different from the committee's choice. He made it pretty clear he was talking about me, which would have cost him his job if I talked.   The director ended up hiring an intern who was graduating a month later. The director was shown the door a year later (was never really qualified to begin with), and the head of the search committee left when he wasn't selected as the replacement. He's a sharp guy going places now. I did four more interviews at that university before giving up. Each time, the job went to a graduating intern or someone who was already doing the position on a temporary basis. The one exception was a guy who was released after his first year, managing to get into a public war of words with a newspaper editor, which is a bad thing because one of his duties was media relations."
education,36molk,bookchaser,2,Wed May 20 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"Unless his family makes a ton of money, most of his tuition was probably comped if he went to an ivy. I know at least some if not all of the schools offer aid as grants, not loans, so they don't need to be paid back. Also the ivies offer aid on a need basis, not merit, so again, unless his family was filthy rich, he wouldn't have had to pay that much to attend.  I don't think it would have been that risky to go to one of the ivies in this situation, but maybe I'm missing something."

I just want to make a plug for looking past sticker price, though. It cost less for me to attend an Ivy League school than it did to attend my state school. That was including in-state tuition, need-based financial aid, and academic scholarships at the state school, and only need-based aid at the Ivy. Basically their need-based aid was more than all the other discounts at the state school. And my parents are firmly middle class, not low-income. It was a surprise, but with their huge endowments these old schools have, they tend to offer great aid. So for those considering schools (and parents too) please keep this in mind!"

Without stasis, a consistent period of calm in young person's life, the brain does not develop important executive skills such as how to manage time, how to pay attention and focus, how to plan or organize, and other important life skills that are expected in educational success.

It's cheaper than in-home one-on-one instruction, not to mention the state doesn't properly fund such a thing, and it's really, really hard to find teachers who will take on that job because of the extreme safety issues working without support staff to protect you. But, some sometimes in-home instruction is the only option.  But you'll be happy to know No Child Left Behind now expects 100% of students to score as proficient in standardized tests, no matter their level of impairment and tragic home lives.

So, if every school did this then the market for that job would get saturated and they would stop making money.   If you looked at a batch of first years (and assume they had no goal but to get a job and we get to pick what they major in) then each one has a % chance to graduate and they % depends on the major. Afterwards, those grads have a % chance to get a job which depends on the market (supply and demand for that job) and the last factor is how much that job makes.  Notice how the supply and demand % chance of getting a job depends on the grads we put out. It would be in the schools best interest to figure put these percentages and maximize their profits by supporting students to graduate and to meet market demand.  A special case is teachers where for the first couple of years a teacher has to sub. Which means schools would not want to train them. Hopefully this would cause pressure to come up with a better system for subs.

I use my cell phone to set reminders, send and receive email, look up definitions, conduct research, contact parents, read, etc. It's an incredibly powerful and portable tool.  I wish my students would use their cell phones in similarly productive ways.  However, the reality is that they do not. To a student, cell phones are a source of entertainment and socialization. In a classroom, this equates to distraction.  The difference in our outlook on the technology is even illustrated by the products we buy. By and large, my students wield iPhones. The large screen, ease of use, media integration, and wide variety of apps and games fills their need for entertainment.  I use a Blackberry 10 device because the physical keyboard, unified inbox, and true multi-tasking capabilities allow me to get work done more efficiently.  A cell phone to a child is not a tool"

Full disclaimer: while I have studied statistics a fair amount in my life, it has not been in the recent past. It would be great if someone with more formal/recent training in statistical analysis could offer an opinion or two.  Some thoughts:   Compliance with a cell phone ban was determined through a survey of school administrators. The report authors essentially asked ""How well have you enforced your own ban?"" and used the answers to establish correlation. The news articles I've found all claim that test scores went up by 6.7%, but the report states that scores rose by 6.7% of a standard deviation. BIG difference. Even if the mean did increase by 6.7%, that would be equivalent to the average ACT score rising from 17 to 18. The results were only statistically significant for 4 of the 5 reporting periods, and even then, only at p<0.1 (the highest possible measure of uncertainty).   In the end, I agree with the conclusion that banning cell phones leads to gains, but those gains are incredibly small. So small that it begs the question if enforcement of such bans is worth the time & energy needed.  Personally, I prefer to manage cell phones within my room. I'll warn kids, and if it's clear that they're ignoring my warnings and not doing any work, I'll hold on to the phone for the period and notify parents if it's a recurring issue. Phones are generally only a problem for the students who've checked out anyway, so it's just about preventing distractions from effecting the whole class."

Today, the label ""failing"" holds no weight. It doesn't mean anything when successful schools are deemed to be failing. The designation has more to do with privatization than school quality.  California has avoided 100% failure by freezing the process. Schools in various stages of sanctions are frozen in those stages, and newly failing schools are prevented from entering the sanction phase (where so-called struggling schools are subject to increasing budget cuts while being forced to pay transportation costs for families who want to leave their district... it's a system that promotes the collapse of the public school system).

What if a student would be better served to spend one day focused on science? or half the day on science and half on math?

Facilitating requires me to react in real time to student questions, misconceptions, miscalculations, assumptions, and frustrations. I could NEVER do this for a history students. Even after years of practice in math and science I still get stumped once or twice a week.  Lectures and other teacher-centered methods allow complete control, which can often cover for small gaps of knowledge by simply allowing us to avoid the topics on which we know the least. Student-centered facilitation is MESSY and requires a content expert who knows how to anticipate problems and react to them. It also requires MORE attention devoted to individual students or groups of students to guide their individual struggles toward eventual clarity.

Another consideration is that most teachers are content-specific experts. It's a ton of work just to master teaching a single subject, let alone have the bredth of knowledge to facilitate meaningful learning in multiple content areas. I am dual certified in math and biology and I do what I can to integrate these topics.

And on average, if those students stayed home, there would likely be no one home with them anyway.  In the end, homeschooling is the answer to basically no big problem in the educational system.  It can bring families closer together, and that's a great and honorable choice.  But the kids it has the potential to help are going to be fine either way, and the kids who desperately need help don't have that option available."
education,36j5n6,DerpRush,1 point,Thu May 21 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"So I believe you: children who are homeschooled have better educational outcomes. I'm just skeptical that the homeschooling has as much to do with the educational outcomes as you think it does.   I'll accept your skepticism, if for no other reason than it challenges the efficacy of the public school system. Consider: if the parents are the predicate factor with everything else having little influence, how do the public schools rationally justify their cost? If the schools are just warehouse babysitting facilities unable to have a significant impact on educating the children, why are we spending so much money on them?  The City of Chicago spends $5.8 billion a year on the public schools. That works out to more than $14.6k per student. We're already spending that ""LOT"" more money you spoke of and getting pretty close to squat for it. It's time for our teachers to defend their value and for the community to look for an alternative to our current policy of doubling down on stupid."
education,36j5n6,Barking_at_the_Moon,2,Thu May 21 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"So... it sounds like you're saying that because it's difficult to meet the educational needs of children who don't come from upper middle class families and have well educated parents, it's of no value to offer them what we can?  That if a child doesn't graduate from high school, then their entire K-12 education was useless?  That in America, 10 year olds from poor families just have to justify why they are worth giving a chance at life?  Those are the implications when you claim there's no value at all to a school system just because the outcomes don't meet your standards.  It's often said, though, to create an environment where people can feel better about tearing down schools even further, and think they are doing good, instead of wrecking the futures of a generation of lower-income children."

In theory free education is doable, but in realistic theory that all depends on if the current budget can be restructured to fund it. My opinion for countries like America is, no, it can't (in the forseable future).   University should be subsidised by the government to at least make the fees reasonable, you silly yanks.

education,36dykf,Bokonomy,0,Tue May 19 14:34:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with college tuition being passed on to students is we end up with competing standards for access to college: academic achievement and money. So, college education becomes a ""game"" for high school students in that achievement is overshadowed by how much scholarship money they will receive. If we have a single criteria, academic achievement, there is only one means of entry to college and that's through academic achievement. At least, that's what we ought to hope for as educators.  Another aspect of this is that college-educated students will have the spending power to support their children after finding a job and starting a family. For those with student loans between $20k-$40k, it may not be much of an issue. But there are plenty of college grads with a mortgage-size of student loans who were academically qualified but lacked the money to pay tuition.   And then we hear the argument that goes like this: ""Well, if they couldn't afford college, they shouldn't have gone into debt to go..."" to which I say you have one life to live and living up to your highest potential matters - FUCK MONEY - go take your education at the highest quality you can get it because academically, you earned it! And then you hear, ""Well, then you should pay back your debt to society,"" to which I say... they never should have had to go into debt in the first place... if anything, the work they did for academic success is our debt to pay back to students anyway because WE benefit more from their diligence to become educated.   Also, I'm sick and tired of the money games in this country. I'm sick of seeing good people growing up in tough places being excluded from life experiences simply based on the money their family has earned. I'm sick of success being measured by the $$$ signs someone has received in the form of scholarship money that STILL isn't enough to pay full tuition of the college to which said person has been accepted to attend. It simply means ""less"" student loans they'll need to attend such a prestigious school to receive a world-class education - what a joke when it never should have been so prohibitively expensive.  But if I actually went into that, I'd be here typing most of my day away to explain. It's something you ought to look up and be more informed about if this interests you. At any rate, eliminating money as a qualifier (which most college students don't even have) and bringing us back to academic achievement as a single qualifying criteria can only lead us in a much better direction as teachers, at least as far as I'm concerned. Students shouldn't be treated the way they are treated when they work hard to be successful academically only to be straddled with debt anyway. If you earn admission to college, that should be it. Leave the money out of it."

And get neglected by politicians [and even parents] far too often.  Before a child gets to high school or even junior high school they are mostly defined academically.  If you can get a kid in kindergarten or first grade interested in reading and math it will pay dividends for years to come.  You usually are less successful trying to do that with older kids.
education,36dykf,staiano,1 point,Tue May 19 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"I think more attention to early childhood education would certainly eliminate some of the redundancy of education at higher levels like late middle school into high school. I don't think it's a lost cause if a child experiences neglect during early education, though. Check out Omarina's story from Frontline.   Would investment in early childhood education reduce the need for resources at higher levels to address students at risk? Sure! Would it eliminate the need for these resources? No. I think the culture of American education is where we start making improvements. When the culture improves, so many other problems start to fix themselves. IF we see a day where stories like Omarina's no longer happen, it will be a result of the culture of education improving, not just the money we throw at our problems for short-term gains."

The cost of college doesn't change; what changes is who's paying. Instead of the student, it becomes the taxpayer, as filtered through a wasteful government bureaucracy. Any time you introduce another middleman, things become less efficient -- even moreso when that middleman is the government. People value what they pay for. Make education free, and people will value it less. I predict grades will go down, on average. The job market will be flooded with college graduates, further diluting the value of a Bachelor's degree. A Master's degree will become the new minimum if you want to get a real job. The number of people enrolled in bullshit majors will skyrocket, as schools will suddenly be more incentivized to keep every student. Employers will quickly catch on, and stop pursuing candidates with majors that end in the word, ""studies."" Free education would be collossally expensive. You'll either have to raise taxes, further punishing the wealthy (who pay the most taxes), or you'll have to cut programs elsewhere, harming poor people. Essentially, robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Full disclaimer: while I have studied statistics a fair amount in my life, it has not been in the recent past. It would be great if someone with more formal/recent training in statistical analysis could offer an opinion or two.   Some thoughts:   Compliance with a cell phone ban was determined through a survey of school administrators. The report authors essentially asked ""How well have you enforced your own ban?"" and used the answers to establish correlation.  The news articles I've found all claim that test scores went up by 6.7%, but the report states that scores rose by 6.7% of a standard deviation. BIG difference. Even if the mean did increase by 6.7%, that would be equivalent to the average ACT score rising from 17 to 18.  The results were only statistically significant for 4 of the 5 reporting periods, and even then, only at p<0.1 (the highest possible measure of uncertainty).    In the end, I agree with the conclusion that banning cell phones leads to gains, but those gains are incredibly small. So small that it begs the question if enforcement of such bans is worth the time & energy needed.   Personally, I prefer to manage cell phones within my room. I'll warn kids, and if it's clear that they're ignoring my warnings and not doing any work, I'll hold on to the phone for the period and notify parents if it's a recurring issue. Phones are generally only a problem for the students who've checked out anyway, so it's just about preventing distractions from effecting the whole class."

Imagine the children in the current system, and how they will be ill prepared to help their own children. You can look back at previous generations and make a similar correlation.  Here's the part of the article I am referencing:   So there you have it; a combination of poor schools, institutionalised segregation, and minimal funding not only cultivated the deep roots of educational denial, but also strengthened the foundation upon which achievement gaps are built on today. The combination of all of these historical events led to what I call the Tradition of Failure. The tradition was not self-imposed. Obviously, African Americans can take some personal responsibility for the state of our race; however, many of us do not have a clue because we come from a tradition of people who never had a clue, leading all the way back to the day our ancestors left Elmina, the former slave port in Ghana that launched us on our turgid journey to this new world.  They did not have a clue what was waiting for them on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Perhaps worse, we entered America as the lazy, ungrateful, enemy without even knowing why, and it has been an uphill battle full of limitless racial and social restraints every step of the way. We didn’t invent the idea of race or conceptualise the theory of free labour and what it could mean on a global scale.

I tell them that when they tell themselves they are bad they destroy their own lives, because they make bad decisions constantly. All because they they think it follows that bad people make bad decisions.  Think about the people in prison.  Since first grade parents, teachers and administrators have told them that they were bad.  They believed it and started making bad decision over and over again.  And in the process they destroyed their own lives and many other lives.  I ask them if they're bad in any subject, like math, and they all raise their hands.  I tell them to put their hands down.  I ask them if they learned anything in math today, because if they did it mean they are better in math today then they were yesterday.  And if they learn one thing new in math tomorrow they prove that they are not bad in math, but have the ability to master math.    I ask them also if they no any one who is good.  They will usually point to one or two other students and tell them those students aren't good.  That people who think they are good judge other people as bad and therefore destroy their lives.  This is the philosophy for all my students.  Don't judge themselves by other peoples standard or let other people apply their standard to them.  That today they should just try to be a better person then they were yesterday and try not to make the same mistakes. I explain that they are young and will make mistakes like we all do.

I think solutions might come from understanding the climates which promote achievement, and those which discourage or are apathetic to it. I would want insightful people like you to be a part of the conversation.  I think children who need the most help, deserve the most investment: financially, emotionally, and physically. Their challenges are not the fault of failing schools, per se, but are not helped by them. They are surrounded by systems which fail them, and I know we CAN do better, but we have to admit there are problems, that they can be improved upon, and that there is value in continuing to try until we get it better."
education,36fvt1,adamwho,2,Wed May 20 04:07:04 2015 UTC,"I came across this article today about school segregation, and thought you might be interested. It offers some possible solutions at the end, but, oh what a mountain to climb! It says,   School segregation doesn’t happen by accident; it flows inexorably from housing segregation. If most black Americans live near other blacks and in a level of neighborhood poverty unseen by the vast majority of white Americans, then in the same way, their children attend schools that are poorer and more segregated than anything experienced by their white peers.  We could fix this. If the only way to solve the problem of school segregation is to tackle housing, then we could commit to a national assault on concentrated poverty, entrenched segregation, and housing discrimination. We could mirror our decades of suburban investment with equal investment to our cities, with better transportation and more ways for families to find affordable housing. And we could do all of this with an eye toward racism—a recognition of our role in creating the conditions for hyper-segregation.  To do this, however, requires a commitment to anti-racism in thought, word, and deed. And given our high national tolerance for racial inequality, I doubt we’ll rise to the challenge."
education,36fvt1,adamwho,1 point,Thu May 21 01:22:20 2015 UTC,"Sad that MLK's name has been flagged to signal black neighborhoods.  The question is not how to racially integrate the neighborhoods, because we both know this will never happen, but to strengthen the neighborhoods.  How? As Lawrence Fisbourne said in Boys in the Hood. Keep everything, everything black in the black owned neighborhoods. Black owed businesses with black money.  He goes on to mention several groups that keep their neighborhoods segregated with good results.  How can the neighborhoods be made safe? Here's a radical solution.  Gated black communities.  Why should it only work for white flight communities?  Zoning that would exclude liquor stores from the black gated communities.    Safe schools serving gated black communities would lead to greater community success.  Now the issue is how to reach black students? Is the solution positive role models in schools?  Our school has a Director of Student Achievement and Accountability who is a black , a PHD and 6 foot six.  He spends much of every day dealing with discipline problems and many times he is successful, because he can be very intimidating.  Our student scores are improving, but this could also reasonably be attributed to increase test preparation.   We have many black teachers as well and I do believe that this is a key in segregated schools. I am in IT and many times in the classrooms throughout the day.  Our black teachers are successful with classroom management and keeping students marginally on task.  Which isn't to say that many our non-black teachers aren't also successful with classroom management issues. The key which works with all students is never raising voices in anger and having a watchful eye to recognize and avert situation which lead to confrontations."

While it might seem unfair on the surface that some students get in easier because of their family's status, it's actually to all of the applicant's advantage that these students be admitted!   The advantage of the ivy league isn't the quality of the classes... What arguably sets ivy league's apart are the strong alumni networks and the other career connections that they provide their students with. They are what make the ivy league so valuable. Legacy students help this happen, because they help tie well-off and wealthy people higher up in the corporate ladder back to the school. Legacy students also pay the sticker-price a lot more often... which allows the school to be more generous with their financial aid to incoming minorities that come from lower-income families.   Basically, Harvard is the opportunity it is to minorities in part because of the students that are admitted on the basis of ""legacy."""
education,369vck,had3l,11,Sun May 17 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that Harvard doesn't pick students based on who has the highest grades. You need to have very good grades, but beyond that it's based on things like athletics, personality, sociability, leadership qualities, connections... Many of which aren't easy to measure. They don't want to just pick people who will do great in college and get good grades, they want to pick the kind of people that will thrive AFTER college, where grades aren't the best measure of success.  That method is actually the reason why Harvard graduates are so valuable. The education they get isn't THAT much better than at other top institutions, many times the curriculum is almost the same, and although they have prestigious professors, they aren't necessarily better at teaching that curriculum than your average professor at another non-ivy top university.  It is an unfair selection process, but it is what made Harvard what it is today, it's the reason why it's so desirable to study there and why so many of their graduates are part of the intellectual and business elite."

Would their nostolgia be re-kindled in quiet the same way if they weren't hearing stories from their college-kid that involve the very buildings and traditions of their own alma mater?   I mean, i'm not saying those alone are the reasons that schools that do the ""legacy"" thing are so successful at inspiring alumni-involvement.

education,369vck,waitwuh,1 point,Sun May 17 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"I can tackle at least one:   why the robustness of the existing alumni network requires legacy admissions?   I think part of it is because the parent is much more likely to want to get involved an institution when their child goes there. Firstly, their kid is a constant reminder of the college/university's existence and what they do. There's a point in your career where people stop asking you what school you went to and you stop thinking about it most of the time. But you know what everybody asks of a college-aged parent? ""What college does your kid go to?"" I think if you're a middle-aged or older person, you might not think much of your alma-matar much day-to-day, but you'll think of it more often if you're constantly thinking about your kid or grandkid who goes there. Because of that, perhaps you're more likely to donate. Related to this, perhaps hearing their kid talk about the very buildings and traditions of their alma-matar rekindles fond college memories in a special way - a way that can't compare to a similar college that they didn't go to. And perhaps they feel greatly indebted to the college, not just for their own success, but for admitting their own, perhaps mediocre, child as well. When it becomes a generational thing, I could see how it would inspire a sort of strong loyalty to the school. It becomes not just the school you went to, it become's the school your family went to. Playing on the relationship there definitely could inspire a well-off person to donate more of their time to alumni-events and to donate more money there as well."

Testing and ""Fight Club"" do share the same first rule; why can't I, as an educator, see a fully published version of every state test at some point? Why the secrecy? And when tests ARE published, errors ARE often found. It's sad and we clearly aren't doing the best we can or writing them in the best possible language.   They are also limiting in a variety of ways (for instance, why are they timed? why are no resources used? Is being resourceful not a key component of grade-level preparedness at the higher grades) in terms of what they actually judge. They don't show crucial project management skills, research skills, study skills, etc.   So, I think we need MORE. I don't think I, as a classroom teacher, should 100% control my student's grades. I don't even think my department should (though one great check is trading, say, papers and grading another teacher's papers when you've both given the same assignments - we do that at my school and it works well and removes any chance of bias; actually 3 teachers often individually grade the same assignment, for our very large assignments - 4x a year or so).

Tests don't give valid information if the exact questions are known in advance, every teacher knows that.  That encourages memorization. Also questions are expensive to develop, so giving them away every year just raises costs on taxpayers.  The errors you mention are expensive to correct. You catch errors by paying for more reviews.  Everything costs $$.  Why do we use multiple choice?  $$.  Why are their errors?  $$.  It all comes down to budget.  Most state tests are trying to do too much with too little money.  Vendors underbid each other until they end up signing a contract they can't deliver with any quality. States want to pretend like they got a gold-plated assessment and cut costs at the same time. It doesn't work that way.  Why are they timed? Because schools insist that they fit into class periods, and because 5% of students will take 10x longer than the rest, meaning you would need up to 10 hours for a 1 hour test.  No one wants to cut into class time that much.  Also you would be rewarding the patient kids who having nothing better to do than stay and maximize their test score, while punishing the kids who want to get on with life.  Why no project management, research, study skills? We'd love to measure those things but they are expensive and present lots of accessibility problems.  Like I said, cheap wins.  Also I have to tell you, we tend to avoid measuring things that are too hard.  If students consistently bomb on a skill year after year, it typically gets taken off the test.   I'm glad you are OK with accountability.  The problem is really just $$.  School psychologists have been administering high quality individual achievement tests for decades, states just don't want to pay for every student to be individually assessed.  A large team of school psychologists in each state could easily serve as the accountability system, a team of inspectors that could come in and sample a few hundred students from each school every year.  But no, that would require a whole new dept full of staff.  Instead they want a big cheap test.  We are currently discovering that they don't even really want a computer-administered test, they seem to want to go back to paper forms."
education,36ao0g,Arguebot6000,2,Mon May 18 12:44:04 2015 UTC,"I know the reason behind them and I know it comes down to money (as well as other bureaucratic, systemic issues) but I also know it isn't working.   Also, the rash of cheating on standardized tests is a symptom of how test-crazy we've gone. A student who is below grade-level in reading should be monitored, helped, etc, and a teacher who consistently brings reading scores down in some way should absolutely be addressed (if she/he is otherwise good by other measures, with training or perhaps proper class assignments, etc - you can tell a bad teacher by way more than her/his test scores) but the reality is we're using the data all wrong and collecting all the wrong data.   I disagree on why they are timed. I think it comes down to money as much as the other factors, not trying to not impede class time (block scheduling is often used during testing and honestly students aren't equipped to learn after the test, even if they were assigned to their normal teachers/normal schedule afterwards, which has never happened in a school I've worked in - it's usually babysitting the rest of the day anyway, with a mix of kids you do and don't teach since the same people do the testing as the teaching - which is another issue)."
education,36ao0g,berrieh,4,Mon May 18 13:19:10 2015 UTC,"And the #1 reason those tests have become pervasive in recent years is because schools have allowed this BS to go on for far too long. NCLB accelerated the decline though - if a school reports honest grades, then students won't graduate on time, the graduation rate will drop, the school will be declared ""failing"" and lose funding which makes it harder to educate the few students who are trying.   Standardized tests haven't really changed anything - now we just teach the test instead of content to make it look like we're making progress.

This problem comes from much further up - failing an ESE student is exceptionally hard to do, and it's not because teachers refuse to do it. It's not even because of Principals, really, except Principals needing to follow the marching orders they're given from TPTB.   In my district, which has the highest cluster of ESE between the districts in my area, because of the DISTRICT LEVEL (people who are elected to the schoolboard basically) and the rules coming from even higher government (state mostly but for ESE we're talking Federal too) and the way those rules are interpreted (which does vary district to district), we have truly bizarre rules on ESE students. They cannot be removed from the school setting (suspended) more than 10 days NO MATTER WHAT unless they are expelled; if they are expelled, it's for 45 days instead of a school year, no matter what the discipline issue EXCEPT sometimes (not even ALL the time!) in the case of a weapon or gang activity. If you want to expel them for something other than a Zero Tolerance offense (weapons, drugs, sex offenses, or repeated threats of violence against school members/teachers basically), you need A MONTH of data continuously from every single class. Miss one class period because there's a sub, and it will probably be thrown out. I've seen it thrown out because the kid skipped X class and no one was observing him that period. And that MONTH you invest in gathering and presenting data buys you 45 days (essentially TWO MONTHS) of expulsion. It's too costly to bother with in most cases.   Then, let's talk about failing an ESE student. You can do it (I have) but you need data. You need to save copies of failing assignments and get the student's signature or write a statement when they refuse to turn in work, to keep as records. You need a good ESE Coordinator to back you up regularly and check your accommodations and show you have meet the accommodations rules. You need a phone log to show you've contacted parents multiple times. You need proof above and beyond what makes any kind of sense basically. And, even then, if the district can find ANY measure to pass them up, they will because summer school costs money. Also, going to summer school = getting passed whether you complete the work or not. District rule.   All these rules are made by NON-EDUCATORS at the school board level based on interpretations of laws meant to ensure ESE students are not excluded from instruction and because they don't want to do different kinds of paperwork at a higher level."

They make you feel guilty as hell, even though you went through the ringer for those kids, and you'll probably end up having them the following year (in my experience) so it's even in your best interest to advance the student just to be rid of them."

At my school district we are on a 10 point grading scale. 90-100 A 80-89 B 70-79 C 65-69 D 64- Below F  Also we can not give below a 50 on any assignment.  It is school board policy.  We are also not the only school I know of that does this type of policy.  So for instance a student first semester, August through December earns an 80.  Then second semester,  January to May, they literally do nothing.  Turn in nothing or not even show up for class they earn a 50 average at the end of May for second semester.  Ok now compile the average of the two.  The student, who mind you did nothing I mean nothing second semester, has earned a 65 average. They have passed the course.  Failure rate is low and on paper it makes the school look good.  It is very frustrating as a teacher to deal with this."

Granted there are some students, those who don't come to school, that the teacher has little influence over. Other than those, students should not fail. Teachers who have low failure rates can actually be good teachers, not grade inflators. We can take a moment to watch their practice to discern the difference.  Hopefully we dont believe that students are destined for certain grades when they start a class. The grade they eventually receive is due to a complicated dance between the teacher and the class of students.  Grades are a sorting mechanism that occurs after learning has taken place. Research shows us that grades have very little impact learning and therefore should not be our focus as educators.  Let the admins determine grading policies. We should focus on what improves learning."

You create the field. You pick the ball. You can adjust any of these things for any kid mid game.  Most grades are much more dependent on a students previous learning than what they do and learn as the result of our classes. Grades self perpetuate. They correlate to future academic success but not much else."

If you see that a school has a low graduation rate, there are only two possible explanations:   The school is staffed by ineffective teachers & administrators The school is populated by apathetic students & families who refuse to put in even a modicum of effort.    With the passage of NCLB, we all collectively went with the first option and completely ignored the possibility of the second option. The best part is that by placing blame where it might not belong actually encourages the apathy of the students & their families - why should you bother trying when someone else is going to get blamed and you're going to get a diploma anyway?"
education,36ao0g,bfuller181,-2,Mon May 18 01:16:17 2015 UTC,"Grades are a sorting mechanism that occurs after learning. They have much more to do with the teaching and teacher than the learning and learners. Teachers assign grades. Students most certainly do not earn them. If they earned them fairly, then all students would be required to put in roughly equal amounts of work to receive the same grade. This is not the case as some students have to put in many more hours of work to earn similar grades as others.  Since grades do not have much connection to learning, we shouldn't really be concerned with them."
education,36ao0g,rheebus,3,Mon May 18 01:33:14 2015 UTC,"I see your point. But there is a difference between just putting in work and learning. Just because two students spent the same amount of time doing a particular piece of class work does not mean that they automatically learned equally from it. That's where the self-advocacy of the student and the (hopefully) attentiveness of the teacher comes in to help fill gaps, enlighten, and push students to help the learning happen.   Also, that's not how it works in the real world. If I am naturally better, more skilled, and come more prepared to my job than my coworker who doesn't (and hasn't made meaningful attempts to improve), and we make the same amount of money and hold the same title? You better believe I am finding a new job or bringing it up to the boss.   Since nobody has thought of a better alternative to ""grades"", then we have to work within the system we are placed. Apart from the teachers who influence grades with things other than performance and demonstration of learning, the student is largely in control of what grade they earn in any class. How much are they willing to work for it? That's up to the individual."

We should grade on learning which isn't dependent on the absolute achievement relative to other students. Some students come to us with nearly all the learning we aim to accomplish already in place.

I am wondering however, if it would be of value to get a BA within the Ed field as well, or if that could (or should) be in something more broad (such as the sciences, humanities, psychology etc), and only after pursue my MA in ed?  First of all, this is not necessarily true. You would need to make sure you are licensed in the state you would like to teach in. States with higher costs of living will pay their teachers more.... However, without experience or strong references you are less likely to get a first year teaching job with a MA or M.Ed.  This is because school districts are likely not willing to fork out the extra dollars to someone who has little to no experience.  The best way to get a job in teaching is to get a bachelors in the ed field of your content. Secure employment first, then increase your wages.   This is not all to say that you cannot do it, but I have seen MAT people turned away because they would cost too much with with no professional experience to back it up."

education,36bz7v,C_nnor,8,Mon May 18 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"Teachers need to be able to look at children's faces to gauge comprehension. You can't do that over a screen. Moreover, school is also about learning empathy, social skills, collaboration, problem solving, communication, dealing with people you hate, falling in love, falling out of love, accidentally letting a huge fart go in class, intentionally letting a huge fart go in class, blocking out annoying people, comparing yourself to others in healthy and unhealthy ways, joking around, exploring different people, being exposed to different people and different ways of speaking, and learning to deal with a variety of different people. You can't do that if you're sitting at home every day.    I will say, I hate that many teachers only send letters or emails to guardians if things go awry. It would be just as productive to celebrate than to criticize. I totally empathize with your desire to know what your spawn is learning; Don't you think that that's an experience he'll have to learn? Learning how to keep other important people in the loop without feeling dependent? Streaming classes also denies the opportunity to learn how to divide and unite school and residence.    At the end of the day, the loss of the school experience in terms of all the non-academic (and many academic) aspects would make the experience not worth it.

That way, kids would still be able to learn from the teacher face to face and also learn all the non-academic stuff you mention in your first paragraph, which I agree is vital, but there'd be an extra option available for parents who want to increase accountability or even, as you mention, have access to additional ways to celebrate their child's work in class.

education,36bz7v,abowlofcereal,7,Mon May 18 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"Only real concerns are that this adds one more headache to a teacher's work life. The small group of nosey and pushy parents would abuse the system to nitpick every action, inaction or reaction a teacher has during the school day.  Most parents are out working during the time their kid is in class anyway so the amount of users of the system would be quite low.  Also depending on the system implementation there are pretty serious concerns over student and teacher privacy. Not every parent needs to know every detail about the other students in a class. Certain family members may have court orders to avoid contact and having this kind of voyeuristic access could potentially endanger a student or violate court orders."

Many, many, many children's lives are improved by having teachers who discuss lgbt issues in plain, sincere terms, discuss race issues, or, if necessary, give children sex ed info that is denied to them by guardians who deem it inappropriate. These subtle or blunt forms of advocacy and social justice would be stopped and sanctioned, to the detriment of the students, if eyes were watching constantly."

One of the hardest things to do is to attempt something challenging in public and fail. Kids have to do this all the time in class, and teachers work to make the classroom a safe-feeling environment for intellectual (and interpersonal) risk-taking. Knowing your parents might be watching your every move would modify your behavior, but not necessarily in a way that would promote mental health in the long term.  I can see the benefit of the teacher occasionally having ""demo classes"" which are recorded and then put online (with permission) so that parents can get an idea of some of the teacher's methods, though."

It might not necessarily be that the extra support for women is causing the degree gap between genders. There are probably lots of factors that would contribute to less men getting degrees than women.  What about job opportunities? Many men I know are aware of job opportunities that pay pretty well and aren't that hard to get into. Such as logging, roofing, and transporting fuel to the north. All three of those pay well, and they don't really require more than some sobriety and a driver's license. A degree isn't fully necessary for guys to get jobs like that, and those jobs pay well over minimum wage. Those kinds of jobs pay well enough to fund a happy and healthy life.  There is also post-secondary education that does not require a degree of any kind, such as getting a ticket in a trade. If you look up articles about trades, they have a pretty dominant theme that it's a ""man's world"" and there aren't enough women in it.  It appears to me that men and women are deciding what they want to get their educations in, and follow those paths. There are men who want to do trades, so those men do trades. There are women who want to pursue a career in academia, so they do. There are also men who go to academia, and women who do trades; there are just less of them. Is that inherently sexist, or is there some kind of injustice causing it? Probably not.  Women's resources definitely shouldn't be cut just because men are the ""second gender"" in universities. That's just silly. There are more women, so there are more resources for women. That doesn't mean that there aren't resources for men. Not everything has to be 50/50 to be fair."

I ask this because my husband powered through undergrad and grad, then found a job. I finished undergrad and started working, was lucky enough to find a grad program I could pursue while working and supporting his grad program (neither of us were overly happy during those years, as we lived mostly apart and in tiny apartments without enough sleep or rest), and only now that he is working full-time am I going on to a PhD. So part of our decision about who was earning what degree when had to do with who could more easily start earning money in their career first, and part of it had to do with who was supporting the family, and part of it had to do with interest, part of it when we wanted to start having children, and part of it was identifying grad programs.

However, these technologies cannot live up to the hype and people wonder why the new tech fails to reach what turned out to be unrealistic expectations.

Why are you interested in this school's specific program?  What professors are you eager to work with?  What is your clearly defined career path?  The personal statement is an opportunity to make yourself stand out from all of the other applicants so a strong question you should consider when rereading your statement is ""could this be said by any generic student applying to grad school"" and try to specify your ideas more so in response.  And good for you.  I know many people in special ed and it is a wonderfully fulfilling career path with many prospective opportunities."

They can probably learn as much from reading the assigned text and filling in the gaps with wikipedia as they can from squinting at his self-admitted and outdated method of chalk-and-talk.  No student today wants to pay 500% higher tuition rates to hear some old shit drone on with the pedagogical methods from an era where women and minorities couldn't even attend the same institutions of higher learning.  He needs to get off his fucking ivory tower and recognize that times have changed.  The ""ancient"" academic culture he longs for no longer exists, and thankfully so, unless you'd rather women and blacks to stay on the plantation and not meddle in a man's search for truth and wisdom.   Get the fuck out of here with that drivel.  As a professor, I would be embarrassed if students were consistently not showing up to my class.  I would be embarrassed if a large percentage of my students failed my assessments.  A nonchalant attitude of not giving a fuck about how many people I fail would be a sign of incredible lack of professionalism.  Only a real prick out of touch with reality would come to the conclusion that everything wrong with the course is the fault of the students.   As an educator, you are a leader.  You are the senior individual in the room.  You are in a position of responsibility and when things go wrong, some self-reflection and analysis is required to come to the root of the problem so that it can be addressed and fixed.  In a centralized unilateral social network structure, it's usually the big central hub that's responsible for the degradation of subordinate nodes.    Maybe starting off on a different foot would be more beneficial when greeting freshmen into your ""hallowed"" halls of learning.  How about just saying ""hi"" and ""welcome to this class and to a very fun and rewarding next couple of years"" and ""university is a little different than what most are used to, here's how and why"" and ""here are the standards and expectations that I expect you to follow and meet"" and ""please come speak with me if something isn't quite working out, or if there is something that I can do better to help you learn.""

So, through this processing, analyzing, and questioning, you develop the ability to follow directions, process information faster, and formulate responses in short or limited amounts of time.

Purely a statistical analysis tool to try and spot trends, both spatially and temporally.  A perfectly justified measure.  Nice and open, should provide us with some decent data.  Actually used in the UK until we change it all next year.  However, once schools start actively seeking to GET that measure, it becomes pointless.  Leadership start to focus all money and resources on the kids who are predicted Ds, to try and get their grades up to Cs and increase their 'value according to the government's new measure.  Now, the E-grade kids who might get a D with a bit of effort are ignored.  Those A-grade kids who might achieve A* with some support get ignored.  Moreover, kids get pulled out of subjects and do double-time on the 5 they might get a C in, rathen than actually enjoying a nice spread of 10 subjects.  Therefore, this measure can no longer be used as an overall judge of effectiveness, which it was designed to be.  Now it's only measuring how good schools are at getting D kids up to a C.  It says nothing about how that school is supporting low-ability kids, nor does it show whether the school can stretch and challenge the top end.  So this measure has become a target and in doing so, been rendered useless.  None of this example is fabricated.  It's all stuff I've genuinely seen happening as a result of schools shooting to fill what was supposed to be an arbitrary, neutral measure.  And it doesn't just apply in schools, any industry can misappropriate measures as targets and negatively impact itself.  E.g. the police cracking down brutally on minor offences just to get the arrest numbers up, rather than going after organised or large-scale crime.  (For more on this, see The Wire!"

education,362i4f,bfuller181,2,Fri May 15 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"It would probably require changes outside their jurisdiction like how schools are funded and resources are allocated.   The whole point of organized labor is to confederate employees to resist arbitrary or unfair practices by management.   It's not automobile factory line workers' responsibility to both build cars and design their own compensation packages. That's why there are executives in the first place - to plan and design projects that the workers implement.   Unions are a response to executive mistreatment in literally hundreds of years of industrialized work environments.   Companies worked people to death in coal mines and steel mills, paid very young children very little wage to work among incredibly dangerous machinery - and gave them nothing when they lost limbs or abilities like sight or hearing. Sucks for you! See ya!   Occupational Health and Safety, Labor Relations boards, collective bargaining, liability insurance, unemployment/severance payment and many more safeguards are in place today (and we take them for granted) because of the work of so many people who risked their whole careers to unionize.   I know you were making a comment specific to teachers' unions. However, I try to put these seemingly petty disputes in a greater context and try to remember that executives - in this case school administrators, school districts/boards of education, and state education agencies - would likely chip away at teachers' hard fought contracts.   But quite simply, it's up to the leadership to lead - both political leaders and superintendents - and it's up to teachers to teach. I'm not a teacher nor a union member myself but in my view unions exist as defensive measures to protect what is already in place - exactly the status quo you're referring to - not to design reforms, especially those that would jeopardize agreements they've already established."
education,362i4f,breadbeard,3,Sat May 16 05:33:51 2015 UTC,"Unions keep passing the buck and refusing to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions and unions keep losing power and membership. It's not a coincidence.  Those automobile factory line workers designed their own (very generous) compensation packages and refused to adapt when their company's profit forecast changed and directly contributed to the bankruptcy of the Big 3 automakers. Once that happened, those unions lost more than they needed to had they simply agreed to reforms before the situation became so dire. And the unions blamed management while the ship sank.   Teacher unions love to blame administrators for failing to remove bad teachers, but unions have put restrictions on the administrators' ability to do their jobs. Teachers in my school can only be evaluated by an administrators twice per year and both meetings must be scheduled in advance. It's never allowed to have more than one administrator in a classroom at a time. Unions have fought against any form of objective evaluation metric without ever proposing their own evaluation system. And because of the high salaries negotiated by the teachers, there isn't enough money to hire an adequate number of building administrators, meaning each is overworked and barely able to keep up with the workload. So the union has created an environment in which a bad teacher can't even be discovered, let alone dealt with. If a teacher is discovered to be ineffective, they are required to be given two years to correct problem behaviors BEFORE a year long termination hearing begins.   If teacher unions continue to sit back and blame everyone without taking any responsibility, they'll continue to lose public support and will find themselves forcefully removed from public schools while the profession becomes a shell of what it used to be."

Teacher unions love to blame administrators for failing to remove bad teachers.   Is this a thing? I've not heard of this.

You write that   because of the high salaries negotiated by the teachers, there isn't enough money to hire an adequate number of building administrators   But that's based on some assumption that more money couldn't be acquired. It's a political decision at the state and federal level, but that money is out there. Shit, our nation has spent over $700Billion ($700,000,000,000) on war and development in Afghanistan.   Let's not pretend that there is insufficient money to spend on school administrators because of the teachers. There's insufficient money because as a society we've allocated only a tiny fraction of money for education, and the teachers have used their single source of leverage - their labor - to secure their wages.   While I acknowledge unions are all too often wasteful, inefficient, stubborn and expensive, surely the principals and superintendents could find common cause to lobby states and the federal government for more funding for the things you mention they need.   Side question, is your username based on Buckminster Fuller?"

education,3620ge,MrPants1401,21,Fri May 15 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"Another option is to have something that resembles an medical internship/residency. New teachers work in teams under a veteran teacher who regularly (at least once per week) observes them and discusses progress on their lesson. Those new teachers also go and observe the veteran teacher and each other and meet to discuss progress. The veteran teacher gets paid more than the average teacher because of the added responsibility, while the new teachers get paid less because they spend less time teaching. After a year (or two) of that, the new teachers move on to having their own class full-time while still receiving regular coaching, and the veteran teacher gets a new crop of people to mentor. I'm sure there are many holes with this system, but this is an idea myself and a few other teachers have batted around from time to time."

education,3620ge,Fuzzyluvkins,1 point,Fri May 15 16:44:38 2015 UTC,"Well yes, everything falls apart if the implementation is bad. Under this model, though, the new teachers aren't responsible for teaching all day -just part of the day. In middle and high school, this would mean teaching two or three periods of the day, while in elementary school this would mean teaching half of the day. The other part would be consulting with your mentor/observing/mastering the art of planning. The mentor teacher would also have release from their usual teaching time. Obviously this means a lot more people teaching part of the day, which can be confusing for elementary school kids, but as long as routines and systems are in place, I think it can work. If I were running things (which I'm not) I would pilot a program like this in a couple of schools (maybe one elementary, one middle, one high school) to see how it works out, then move from there, rather than try to implement this idea state wide all at once."

I'm working on my license now (switching to teaching from the corporate world), and I will hopefully have a job teaching this fall.  All I hear is how ill-prepared new teachers are because what teachers are taught is not enough—it takes some real-world experience to understand what it means to manage a classroom and how to differentiate a lesson.  I think a system such as you have described would help with this immensely."

Also, student teaching is not quite like the system that /u/ladywrists has proposed.  From what I know of student teaching (which is admittedly not everything as I am not getting an education degree), you are teaching someone else's class (and not necessarily a full day of classes, at that) for a period of time, and that period of time is at most one semester.  This is not the same as teaching your own class under the supervision and guidance of a veteran for one or two years.  I honestly think that teacher education should follow more of an apprenticeship model, and that is not what current education degrees look like (for the most part, although I acknowledge that there are a range of programs).  That all being said, as an answer to your question, no.  I am not getting an education degree.  I have a BS in mathematics, and I have been working in the corporate/business world for the last 10+ years.  I am following an alternative path to licensure, and part of that path involves me having a mentor my first year of teaching (for which I am incredibly grateful)."

If you have a low percentage of low income students, funds are earmarked for specific types of things to help low income students. If you have a high percentage of low income students, you have more discretion in how funds are spent toward helping low income students.   In both cases, how the funds are spent is decided by a Site Council composed of teachers, parents and community members, led by the principal. I believe in many/most cases, the parent representatives are elected by the parents of the school.  Generally speaking, Title I funds are not intended for training or classroom supplies. Our Title I funds, with discretion, were used on such things as a psychological counselor, classroom aides, and a part-time poorly paid librarian (without which, the library would be closed).   As for the size of our funding, we're greater than 50% low income/poor students. Ten years ago we received $200,000 per year.

I'm pretty strong headed, particularly in my teaching philosophy, and I have done my Masters (a legit masters with a real study I did, and thesis, and multiple classes on theory), so when she tried to question my beliefs with no solid theoretical back up, I wasn't having it. She sent me flowers during a particularly hard week, which I adored, but we couldn't see eye to eye.  My third is pretty great, but clearly over worked this semester. She teaches my ELD kids in their Spanish class, for native speakers, so we can discuss similar students. She helps me immensely, her being a world language teacher. She makes me realize more and more that ELD classes need to be reclassified as a world language course. SHE knows how to teach a language, I really know how to analyze context.

Also, they're playing a number's game - something seemingly insignificant might bump them from yale's list but then if Harvard takes them... well...   Also, colleges like rejecting applicants more than you'd think - their ""selectivity"" lets them get higher rankings and appear to be higher quality (whether they are or not). It's strategic.

It is completely in their interest to apply to all of the schools and keep their options open. Relatively speaking, school applications are cheap when they're considering how many tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dollars in scholarships they may get... not to mention the benefits and networking for their future.  If I was in that league in high school, you can bet your ass I would have applied to all of them... although, given my major, I probably would have ended up at MIT, CMU, or Cal Tech."

HOWEVER, If the motherfucking brochure for the University is littered full of diversity shots, where it seems like the photographer stalked all 12 persons of color to demonstrate a hetergenous learning environment, I would say that the advertising was disingenuous and the entry into yet another class full of not-your-people-or-anyone-you-can-easily-identify-with, is a micro-agression."

We've now reached the point where it's almost universally unacceptable in public to display obvious hostility toward a race or gender (with some unfortunate exceptions).

We still see girls drop out of math and science classes and majors consistently, and other unacceptable outcomes.  There are a lot of complicated reasons for that... but this article wants to answer ""don't blame me.""  It's not a question of who to blame - obviously, the racial distribution of a class isn't the fault of the students or the teacher - but rather a question of what can be done to fix it, so schools and colleges don't fail students who leave because they ""just didn't fit in""."

I left my doctoral program because I couldn't handle the pressure (real or imagined) of being the only minority and proving all negative stereotypes about my group wrong.   I had so much anxiety I couldn't speak up in discussions because it felt if I accidentally mispronounced a word or didn't have the most insightful remark, I would affirm that people like me were cognitively inferior. I couldn't go to office hours and form relationships with my professors.   You're this singular data point for people and its likely that the people you're around don't have much experience interacting with people of your race, and a lot of the information they do have is based on stereotypes, so the pressures on to dispel them. Don't fail your race.   That's part of being a racial minority: you don't have the luxury of just being yourself. You're thrust into a position to think (and act) on behalf of your entire race. The data people get from you is weighted more heavily, which is ironic because there are fewer of you. Add a highly competitive academic environment where imposture syndrome is already rampant and you got yourself a mess.   It's the worst when racial discussions come and you're severly outnumbered. The first time this happened to me, I was in 6th grade. The topic was affirmative action. I was the singular non-white student in a class ~30. The other students regurgitating their bigoted parents beliefs. The teacher didn't help either, he was against AA. He didn't moderate the discussion. At the time I didn't have the language to defend MYSELF. It was humilating and demoralizing. This was the only class I failed in my life.   Back to AA. You have more to prove. Many people mis attribute any success you've had, they believe meritt wasn't a factor. So you have to not only prove yourself as a student but its compounded by having to justify your existence. And as you can imagine is fucking exhausting, among other things.   I'm not a victim. These are just my experiences. I speak for no one else.

Claiming that the left and right have both had a hand in fucking things up might encourage people to think some sort of ""middle ground"" compromise between Dems and Reps is the solution, when in reality, the ""middle ground"" between those two would be far to the right and would appease only the capitalist class."

Unions have had stronger control over education than ANY other sector of our economy over the past 100 years. Their spending on political lobbying still absolutely dwarfs the spending of reform groups. And the notion that American education was ""quite well off"" before reform began is belied by virtually ANY statistic. Graduation rates improved tremendously in the past decade despite the recession, more black and latino students are on track for college today than ever before. The list goes on, but anyone willing to take even a cursory glance at data already knows the picture."

education,35vrml,kaosotis,2,Fri May 15 01:47:23 2015 UTC,"Truly public schools insulate educational decision makers from profit motives of all kinds. Unionized schools ensure even higher levels of professionalism by insulating educators themselves from the day-to-day pressures of financial performance. That’s not a bad thing. That’s a fantastic thing. Union protections reduce the incentives teachers face to give high grades just to keep everyone happy, to push “difficult” children out of their classes, and to teach to the test. Unions ensure that school districts provide appropriate professional training opportunities for teachers and administrators. And unions prevent favoritism in the awarding of raises and promotions, substituting instead the principle of seniority based on experience. In short, a unionized school may not be a perfect school, but it is a professional school.   It may be said that truly public schools insulate educational decision makers from profit motives of all kinds.  However, Unions are not public institutions in that sense. They are private corporations that exist in the interest of the teachers they represent as well as in their own interests - which are largely driven by market forces. If a union stands to lose money by a teacher being fired, then it is in that union's interest for that teacher to not be fired. For true insulation from market forces, unions can not exist, or at the very least, can not make money.    Is true insulation important? maybe. Can it be achieved with the existence of unions? no."

Forget the marriage part - you know how vastly different attitudes towards LGBTQ populations are now than they were 15 years ago?

So there are lots of problems that sure, in theory would be easily fixed, but won't be due to politics. Glibly dismissing the issue as ""oh, just fix the execution"" is practically insulting.

We took the pilot in California last year (that year I actually taught math, so I administered part of it, this year I teach science).  Last year the pilot test seemed incredibly short.  Some of my students were finished within the first period we set aside for it.  This year it seems that the test (at least the ELA portion, they are taking Math this week) has gone overboard and become too long for the amount of time they suggested we allot.  Regarding that suggested time, it is WAY too long!  The purpose of computer adaptive testing is to get to the student's true achievement faster, but this is taking longer than our previous tests.  Content-wise, I actually think the SBAC questions are pretty solid (at least the math is).  They go beyond simple solve questions and test that students understand the mathematics behind what they are doing.  There is some confusion from some students over the interface, but I think this is a matter of simply being used to bubble sheets and having not seen the kind of questions on the SBAC before where you sometimes have to click-and-drag, or click spots on a graph, or something different.  My wish: someone create software that allows a teacher to create their own SBAC-style test with click-and-drag elements and everything.

Regardless of pedantic arguments about what is and what isn't racism, can someone please explain how attitudes like these are productive?

education,35ju26,GimmeABreak_,2,Tue May 12 08:29:38 2015 UTC,This is exactly why a lot of nonprofits discourage anonymous donations (though there are plenty of reasons for that as well).  One large gift has the tendency to spur further gifts.  Great for the Donorschoose community.  I've had a few projects funded through the platform that would have never been possible otherwise.
education,35ju26,rharrington31,1 point,Mon May 11 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"Like anything else, there's definitely a whole bunch of pros and cons.  Both staying anonymous and donating publicly have their merits for different situations.  Here's a pretty good list of pros/cons of charitable giving.  For the lazy, I've copy and pasted it.  From a donor's point of view  Arguments in favor of anonymity:   You don't want your name associated with a controversial cause, either for reasons of personal safety or because the association might offend other people in your life.  You are making an unusually large gift and cannot afford to be perceived as rich. This "" I-am-not-a-Rockefeller "" concern is legitimate if you are able to make just one large gift, typically because of a windfall. You may not want to raise expectations (or hackles) elsewhere.  You don't want to be overwhelmed by requests. Toward the end of his life, the author James A. Michener gave $5 million to the libraries at the University of Northern Colorado, with the stipulation that the gift and his name not be revealed until he died. He had been inundated with requests when he had previously made sizable, public gifts.  You use anonymity as a shield against mischief. You may not want it to be known that you have ""deep pockets"" if you become engaged in litigation as a result of an auto accident or business situation.  You want credit given to those performing the services rather than to those providing the funding. This only works if all donors operate the same way; otherwise you simply give more visibility to the smaller group of donors who like recognition.  You may want to fend off even benign forms of attention , especially if you are a public figure. An actress whose name is well known regularly escapes to a small town whose name is not because she treasures the privacy it provides. She does her local giving through middlemen, an arrangement that spares her endless chitchat with the grateful.  You want hidden personal facts to stay hidden . For example, you may not want estranged family members to know your current financial situation.   Arguments in favor of making your charitable gifts known:   Your gift may encourage other individuals to contribute to the organizations in which you believe by publicly acknowledging your support of the organization's work.  You get the recognition you deserve for being a philanthropist.  If you are a Board member, it's important that you publicly support the entity, both with your time and your financial resources or others might question your commitment. More to the point, they might question the financial and administrative stability of the organization.  By publicly acknowledging that you engage in charitable giving, you inspire others to engage in giving. They might not give to your charities, but you are setting a good example in your community or business network.  If you are dedicated to a particular cause or geographic area and willing to support more than one organization working on that cause, open acknowledgment of your gift will bring you to the attention of similar organizations. You will minimize the amount of time you have to spend finding worthy charities to support!   From the Charitable Recipient's Point of View  Reasons why a charity wants you to be public about your gifts:   Being associated with a ""name"" donor can be very positive in terms of other fundraising . ""Jim"" (author James A. Michener) had been inundated with requests when some of his other gifts became known,"" said Gary Pitkin, the University of Northern Colorado's dean of libraries. ""But he also knew that his name would help us raise funds."" Two new, significant gifts to the libraries followed the announcement of the Michener gift.  Publicizing gifts, especially sizable ones, is much easier to do if the organization can name the donor(s). The press wants the personal angle; it makes the story much more compelling.  Charities are always looking for individuals who might become committed to their cause. They often review the annual reports and newsletters of other similar nonprofit organizations to identify potential donors. If most donors were ""anonymous,"" many charities would have significantly lower fundraising results than they currently do.  Charities know that giving stimulates more giving. They want you to ""stand up and be counted "" so that it becomes the norm for everyone to make charitable gifts.  It's extra work for organizations to make sure that they keep your name off every publication, including annual reports, since the vast majority of donors want to be acknowledged publicly. Of course they'll do this for you, but don't you want your charitable gift to be most efficiently used to deliver services or conduct research?   Reasons why a charity might want you to remain anonymous:   NONE"

EDIT: Holy hell. The class isn't even fucking required for graduation, and the Professor himself even confirmed that nudity isn't required either.  “The concerns of our students are our department's first priority, and I’d like to offer some contextual information that will help answer questions regarding the pedagogy of VIS 104A.    “Removing your clothes is not required in this class.   The course is not required for graduation.  “VIS 104A is an upper division class that Professor Dominguez has taught for 11 years.  It has a number of prompts for short performances called “gestures.” These include ""Your Life: With 3 Objects and 3 Sounds"" and ""Confessional Self,"" among others. Students are graded on the ""Nude/Naked Self"" gesture just like all the other gestures.  Students are aware from the start of the class that it is a requirement, and that they can do the gesture in any number of ways without actually having to remove their clothes. Dominguez explains this – as does our advising team if concerns are raised with them.  There are many ways to perform nudity or nakedness, summoning art history conventions of the nude or laying bare of one's ""traumatic"" or most fragile and vulnerable self.  One can ""be"" nude while being covered.  “There are many comments from former students that are visible online.  These comments clarify the matter quite directly.

I'm not being confrontational; I've been teaching outside of the country for the past 3 years and haven't noticed the overwhelming anti-charter discourse until I was offered a job at one.  To be fair, my charter school is joining the union this upcoming school year, so I keep on hoping my charter is ""one of the good ones,"" but I'm really interested in learning more about both sides of the debate. 5 years ago, charters had a lot of support, didn't they?"
education,35getf,cptcold,3,Sun May 10 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"The most tell-tale sign in that the state produces an annual list of the worst performing public schools and gives families at those schools automatic permission to leave those schools. Public charter schools are exempt from appearing on the list no matter how badly they fail, and they do fail at the same rate as traditional schools.  The subtle death knell for traditional schools is how school transfers are handled. If you want to attend an out-of-district traditional school, you request permission from your home district and usually go before the school board in private session to argue your case. If rejected, your last option is to appeal to the county office of education.  In contrast, if you want to transfer to an out-of-district charter school, you don't need home district approval. You don't even need to notify your home district. The only way your home district even knows you exist is if you transfer after already attending in your home district, because the home district has to transfer your records to the new school.  This creates a situation where a majority of transfers are to charter schools, with some interesting results.   Affluent families tend to transfer because they can afford to drive their kids to a school further away. This creates a groundswell of affluence at charter schools. Although illegal, a charter school can reject transferring students who have IEPs and SSTs (students with learning disabilities or a range of other issues that affect learning). How? If the student transferred from another district, or began receiving intervention services before kindergarten, these details are evident. This is a common criticism of charter schools not limited to this state. Traditional schools end up with a larger than average pool of IEP and SST students. State average is/was 9%.  My local elementary school has 25%. A lot of horrific things happen in that environment. My town is a bedroom community. Affluent families drive their kids to out-of-district charter schools on their way to work. Why the pool? A lot of negatives trend with poverty, and poverty pools in traditional schools as affluent families flee to charter schools. Negatives such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, malnutrition, psychological issues (aside from one caused by abuse), sensory issues, physical disabilities, learning disabilities, etc. If an out-of-district school (which is more likely to be a charter school) does admit an IEP/SST student, the home district is required to pay for the student's intervention services. So at the IEP meeting, you've got the principal from two schools attending.   Perhaps worst of all, the first charter legislation allowed charter schools to be created independent of geography. So, for example, the majority of charters in my county are all in a remote, rural one-school district that gladly approved charters because it receives a slight financial boost without any of the negatives of having charters in its own district.   In essence, charter schools invaded school districts without local district approval. The law was eventually changed, but those charters remain.   And on top of it all, there's the pervasive media message (fueled by think tanks) that creates the false impression that charter schools are more successful than traditional schools. The word ""charter' in a school's name is magic to parents (read: affluent parents) who view school enrollment as a choice, rather than a foregone conclusion that their kids will attend the closest school.  Schools still following No Child Left Behind are slated to all be pushed into failing status because the law requires proficiency among 100% of students... yes, even students with learning disabilities, abusive homes, just arrived in the country and don't know English, etc.  California recently froze Program Improvement (one of the steps in sanctioning 'failing' schools) so that schools currently in PI cannot leave PI, and schools (read: more likely to be charter schools) not in PI will not enter PI.  One of the sanctions of PI is that a school district MUST approve student transfers to a non-PI in the district, and approve out-of-district transfers when there are no non-PI schools in the home district. Worse, the home district can be made to pay the transportation costs of those families. Surprise, surprise... poor districts such as mine have all of their schools in PI, and if case families didn't know they can leave, the district is forced to send them a letter telling them of their right to leave and get paid in doing so."
education,35getf,bookchaser,1 point,Sun May 10 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks again for detailing that information for me! Based on what you've said, I decided to look up the API for my area, but I don't think that's the right information to tell me which schools must give permission to their students/families to leave their schools/districts. This is extremely relevant for me since in my interview, the administration kept on talking about how a majority of the students at my charter were not from the local district.   I'm assuming that a ""failing"" school isn't a school that has failed to receive WASC accreditation since the WASC website does list charter schools...Does ""failing"" mean schools that are in PI? Either way, I'm having trouble finding the list of these schools (obviously I haven't searched that thoroughly since I'm responding to you so quickly, but it didn't turn up in my first couple google searches.)  A question about point #1: You say that affluent families tend to transfer because they can afford the additional transportation costs, but you conclude by saying the ""failing"" school-district has to pay transportation costs. Do you think the influx of affluence into charter schools is additionally caused by lack of information given to lower-resource families, or is it more likely due to intentional discrimination determined by the students academic performance, or (most likely) some kind of mix?  Lastly, and a bit unrelated, if charter schools get to hand-pick their students, what factors do you think are causing charters to fail at the same proportion as public schools? It seems that (ethically or not) charter schools would be set up to perform higher.  Thanks a lot for taking the time to answer all my questions. I really hope I'm not coming off as confrontational -- I really am just curious and have a lot of research to do about all of this. It just so happens that I'm being pro-active about my research starting with this reddit thread :)"

My prior school had an extremely strong union (and I was a site rep!) and it honestly complicated things and made them considerably more stressful. Everything was always political. I hated it.  That said, the only reason I'm thankful to not have a union is because my administration, both on a site level and in our organization, is outstanding. My principal is absolutely amazing, and our charter org is very well-run. I was on an accreditation team a few years ago for a charter school with a toxic organizational admin, and those teachers unionized because things were so terrible. And I don't blame them a bit.  For my own school, my pay is lower than that of a teacher in our local district, and so is our administration's. But the significant increase in flexibility we have by not being bound to union rules is worth every penny of salary lost."

I'm just happy to not have one where I am now. I don't feel like we need one. We're fortunate in that our culture from the top down is one of respect and open communication. Also, principals have a great deal more latitude over their site budgets than in traditional school districts, and I think that removing a layer of bureaucracy helps teachers feel more supported because more decisions on spending are made at a site level, making the teachers feel more ownership of those things."
education,35getf,wildly_curious_1,16,Sun May 10 14:33:16 2015 UTC,not being bound to union rules   What union rules hindered your teaching?
education,35getf,bookchaser,8,Sun May 10 08:50:51 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, where to begin?  My previous school was so dysfunctional that we lost our accreditation for a year. This was in large part due to a literally decades-long war between the district and the teachers' union. It was like the book 1984--we were always at war, had always been at war, and would always be at war. In my six years there, we went through four principals and two superintendents, and the year after I left, the whole district was taken over by the state for fiscal mismanagement. Seven years later, the state administrator is STILL running things.  The union had the final say over everything on campus, including the master schedule. I pissed off the union one year (more about that in a sec), and the next year I found that the elective I taught had been scheduled against a required class that many of the kids in my elective needed to take, and my elective got cut for low enrollment. I was specifically told that that was done to teach me a lesson.  One of the union's rules was that students couldn't take a class through concurrent enrollment at our local community college's satellite campus in town (small rural farm town, and the main campus was 50 miles away) if it was offered at our high school, and really, they didn't want high school taking classes at all, because the high school had to give students high school credit for the college credits they'd earned, and the union's line of thought was that this took jobs away from high school teachers.   Unfortunately, most of the classes they offered at the satellite site in town were ones offered by the high school--the most basic college requirements like English and History.  I wanted my students who were interested to take community college classes, for several reasons. First, it helped them dip a toe into the post-high school world and see that college wasn't that scary. Second, they could get credits toward graduation. Finally, we had a VERY limited AP program, and if students took community college classes that were transferable to university, it counted as AP classes when it came time to apply for college, as well as giving them the college credit when they went on to college. I was in a small, low-income farm town. Concurrent enrollment community college classes cost my students literally $4/semester, and saved them hundreds if not thousands over taking the same classes in college.  In order for high school students to enroll at the community college, they had to get a school counselor to sign off on them. Because of the union's policy on students in concurrent enrollment, the counselor wouldn't almost ever sign off on students taking community college classes. So I started signing for students I thought would be able to handle a college class. And lo and behold, they started taking classes and succeeding in them.   I got away with this for a year and a half before the union caught on. They actually threatened to file a grievance against me, but my principal at the time took the bullet and insisted that I'd done it at his order. He was fired the following year.   Another issue was the union's insistence on keeping the salary pool ""small and deep"". Their opinion was that larger class sizes, one more class taught per day versus most high schools (everyone taught six periods a day) and fewer support staff meant that we had fewer teachers, and therefore a higher salary. Which was true. We were some of the highest paid teachers in the state. Classes were big. We didn't have a librarian. We didn't have a school nurse. We had one guidance counselor for 1100 kids, and he also coached football and baseball, so for 2/3 of the school year, he was out of the office by 2:30 so that he could go coach. This shit absolutely affected my teaching and affected the students.  There were a number of other policies, down to course offerings and graduation requirements, that negatively affected our students. It was a deeply entrenched system in which the needs of the students came well behind those of the union, and the distrust and animosity that the union fostered ensured that this wasn't going to change anytime soon.   Finally, I get that it is possible to fire tenured teachers, but to do so requires an administration that's around long enough to do so. Four principals and six assistant principals in six years doesn't lend itself to that. We had some some fantastic teachers, and we had terrible teachers that needed to be long gone. And yet they stayed. We'd get dynamic new teachers (like me!) and they'd spend two or three or six years pushing the system, trying to help it grow, and then they'd almost inevitably quit and leave the town, because when you're intelligent and energetic and driven, you can only handle so much constant negativity and resistance and pushback before you decide it's time to find somewhere where the students are just as needy, but the staff culture isn't so utterly fucking miserable and outright combative as that place was.  It absolutely fucking broke my heart to leave that school, and the programs I'd spent six years carefully building. But I knew I needed to find somewhere where I could help the most needy kids and do it in an environment that promoted growth and flexibility and put the needs of the students first. And I did.   I work now at an alternative school for at-risk youth who haven't been successful in traditional comprehensive settings. I teach seniors, and my average senior comes to me a year behind and with a fifth grade reading level. I love getting to work with the kids who fell through the cracks in traditional school settings, and I love getting to do so somewhere that emphasizes a culture of respect, success, collegiality, and flexibility. It's a culture that ensures teachers have what they need to best serve their students--in seven years, I haven't bought a single white board marker or box of kleenex. I've gone from spending $2000+/year out of my own pocket, to spending... I'm not sure. MAYBE $100? I can't remember the last time I told my boss I needed something and my request was denied.   I took a $25K pay cut to come here, and it was worth every fucking penny."

He didn't coach nearly all the sports--I'm not sure where you got that idea from. He was an assistant coach for both football and baseball. I don't see someone coaching two sports as being far-fetched at a rural high school. I coached track, was a union rep, class advisor, AVID coordinator, and spent two years as the Activities Director. All while teaching English (from honors freshmen to remedial juniors.)  There are no legal requirements (at least in CA) for gc:student ratio. The average in CA last time I checked was around 950:1. I ended up doing a significant amount of college counseling, to the point where I ended up getting a certificate in it, and there were times where, no shit, the counselor called ME for advice.  I took a $25K pay cut. Like I said in another comment, we were some of the highest-paid teachers in the state. At 6 years in, and maxed out in credits, I was making just under $70K.

This resulted in teachers actively refusing to answer the questions of the accreditation team. Guess what? Only about five schools in the state of California lose their accreditation annually. We were one of the five that year.  The union and the district ran into salary negotiation issues (yeah, the district fucked up on that, but the union knew they were asking for an amount that would break the district.) When the possibility arose that the district was going to have to go into receivership for being unable to pay its bills, the union's official line was, ""Bring it on."" The year after I left, the state took over, and the state administrator proceeded to try to break the union. From what I see in talking to friends who are still there, it at least partly worked. Not that this has improved things any--it's still a cesspool of negativity and misery.  It's enticing to blame it all on the administrators, and indeed they aren't blameless.

The big lie about teacher's unions is that bad teacher's can't be fired. The truth is the union contracts that districts sign spell out the fair and reasonable procedures for firing bad teachers. It requires administration to track problems, attempt remediation with the teachers, and fire them if they fail to improve. It turns out some administrators fail to perform the job for which they are so handsomely compensated.  The point of having the process spelled out is to shield good teachers from capricious firings because of personality conflicts. Teachers are in their profession as a career at one school district. Administrators climb ladders and jump districts and don't have to live with the repercussions of their bad decision-making, which leads to very bad things happening in non-union environments where employees lack basic protections.  If you want to improve the achievement gap, begin holding administrators accountable. Superintendents have that responsibility and they answer directly to their elected school boards.  One only has to look at what happens in charter schools. In my area, charters are populated by recent graduates who stick around only until they can land career positions at traditional public schools. Speaking as a parent, I'd never send my kids to a charter school.  A union's role in a teacher firing is to assure that the school district has lived up to the employment contract. Dot the i's, and cross the t's, when firing a teacher, and a union has no room to argue.  So when you hear about stories of 'rubber rooms' and such, blame inept administration. If you're a taxpayer in such a district, you should kick the school board to the curb and elect school board members who will hold administrators accountable, and in turn, hold teachers accountable."

Principals are paid way too well to turn a blind eye to such flagrant failure to do their job.   Lol, wut?    Ohhh, now I understand. Thanks for cutting to the chase so I don't waste my time. Tagged now so I don't spin my wheels with you again."
education,35getf,bookchaser,2,Sun May 10 13:42:27 2015 UTC,"Ok, but article was saying:   teacher Union = accountability (most specifically financial accountability)   I asked if any Union does this.  Your reply was:   Teacher unions = no teachers fired b/c of bad administrators   Which doesn't address my question or the article's argument.  Then you end with voters should elect a better board if schools need fixing, which was nearly exactly what I was saying:   if you want accountability: take action (like changing state law) from grass root level   So, we're, uh... in agreement with each other?  Yes?  Good."
education,35getf,zijital,0,Sun May 10 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"Accountability of teacher performance is assured by the union contract, or state law, that spells out specifically how teachers are fired.   The principal observes each teacher in the classroom and gives each teacher regular performance evaluations. Deficiencies are noted and remediation plans made to improve in problem areas. This is a core function of the principal. If a teacher does not improve after attempted remediation measures, the teacher gets fired.  The union exists to assure a school district follows the law. Bad teachers stay in the job if bad administrators fail at performing one of the chief functions for which they were hired."
education,35getf,bookchaser,3,Sun May 10 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but the article doesn't talk about any of that.  And none of that addresses the financial management of (charter) schools."
education,35getf,zijital,-1,Sun May 10 23:05:49 2015 UTC,"none of that addresses the financial management of (charter) schools   The article directly deals with this issue.  A teacher who isn't unionized is unlikely to speak up about financial mismanagement because he or she would get fired.  A unionized teacher can only be fired for performance-based reasons and thus is much more free to be a whistleblower.  The first example the author gives is the newly organized union filing an FOIA request, which speaks to accountability by shining a light on the inner workers of the school. The author then details 5 facts uncovered through the FOIA which would not be known without the union."
education,35getf,bookchaser,2,Sun May 10 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"The author then details 5 facts uncovered through the FOIA which would not be known without the union.   I don't see this as a union issue, I see this as a whistleblower issue.  Whistleblower protections need to be strong enough to protect any employee no matter their union status.  Further, saying you need unions so teachers can hold schools accountable is like saying this is what you think a teacher job posting should be:   7th grade American History teacher opening - Must be great at inspiring students, engaging with parents and able to audit 1099s of the contractors who installed the AC units in the library.   Teachers have enough responsibility with just running a classroom, let's not tack on FOIA requests & wading through big data.  If the issue is about holding charter school systems accountable lets be direct about that.  If whistleblower laws are too weak, let's be direct about fixing those.  Creating a union so that teachers can be secure when they're a whistleblower on lapses of accountability is such an indirect route to solving a very clear problem."
education,35getf,zijital,0,Mon May 11 04:06:13 2015 UTC,"I don't see this as a union issue, I see this as a whistleblower issue.    Same thing. Unions enable whistleblowing because the first issue deterring whistleblowing is job security. A teacher's union forces schools to only fire teachers for job performance, which is a whistleblowing shield.  You're trying to discount the effect, but it's one of the major benefits of unions. Something is wrong in your public agency? First step -- talk to your union. It's universal advice for any union employee. They do serve a check-and-balance role in government."
education,35getf,bookchaser,1 point,Mon May 11 11:28:47 2015 UTC,"While it is possible, it is highly unlikely a tenured teacher will be fired.  In actuality attempting to fire a teacher carries a heavy burden.  It takes tons of money in lawyer fees.  It takes a very long time. Years even.  Anecdote: a local teacher was a drunk. Like bringing beer to class kid of drunk.  The final straw was when she reported to the principal that she believed that a student  had been in her purse.  You see she had brought a six pack, drank one, went to have another and there was only four in there now.  Obviously this teacher had no business being in a school.  Unfortunately she was tenured.  Start the firing process.......  Years later she finally left. Not because she was fired though, she wasn't.  She resigned.  Though she resigned with a significant payout from the school to encourage her resign.  To say it's a big lie is really only a half truth.  With the current firing process, the level of accountability it's exactly how much the school is willing to pay you to leave."
education,35getf,Opertum,6,Sun May 10 12:31:20 2015 UTC,It is almost impossible to fire a bad judge or politician. They cause much more havoc to society than a teacher can.

education,35getf,doc58,2,Sun May 10 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"If there is concrete evidence of a teacher breaking the law or contract in an egregious way, which drinking in a school is, then it's not difficult to fire a teacher. Yes it can take a year, but the reality is the delays are almost always based on an unaware or inept administration.  The question at the heart of the tenure debate is how to revise the system so it still protects good teachers from bad administrators, while providing a path for firing teachers that do something wrong.  Keep in mind that teachers are hired and granted tenure. They can be fired for any reason before they get tenure.  There is plenty of research that shows that being a career teacher in one school/district has a positive impact on student learning and that high turnover rates have a negative impact.  While there can be a dead wood effect for some teachers, it's up to the school and union to make sure people are doing their job.  If the argument is that some aren't cut out to be teachers, make training and requirements more rigorous and make the job more attractive and you'll get better candidates."

But I think, at least in our case, athletics are just the most visible, quantifiable, and easily vilified example of a much larger problem.  Yeah, our football stadium is under construction right now. And yeah, they recently redid the entire sports complex and concourse between the various stadiums. But they also recently turned a parking lot into a vast green space for events (an annual concert in the fall, the university Relay for Life, etc.), built a brand new rec center where there used to be a power station, built a brand new power station across the street, gutted a pair of identical dorms and redeveloped one and started redeveloping the other, announced plans to rebuild a third identical dorm that used to stand adjacent to the other two, wrapped our student union in zinc, built an entirely new ""student life center"" that's about as thin as Paris Hilton's nondominant arm, redid a significant number of labs in the chemistry building, they're currently redoing the roof of our big A&S building, and all my education courses are taking place in semipermanent ""trailers"" located on the site of an auditorium they tore down in 2013 because they've blasted the walls out of the building adjacent to Teachers College (itself completely renovated a few years ago) and funneled everyone in the college of education, criminal justice and human services into trailers, which oh by the way are just across the street from our design, art, architecture and planning building, which just had its entire exterior redone.  And that's all on top of the private and public-private development going on around campus. The two blocks south of campus were almost completely rebuilt in the last few years and now feature all the shopping and dining a student could possibly want, as well as three brand new high cost apartment complexes, one of which was built on top of a university parking garage by a private company, but which is being block-leased by UC next year because their on campus housing stock is insufficient to meet the increasing demand. East of campus we have 2 more apartment complexes under construction, with 2 or 3 having already opened in the last several years. North has so far remained relatively untouched, but really only because that was already a part of town with quite a lot of money, and because there is already a fairly large apartment complex a mile north of UC, which is being block leased by the university for grad students next year. West of campus UC has a low density dorm complex that's basically a bunch of identical houses divided into dorms, and that complex occasionally gets lit on fire by a bunch of stupid drunk people. Speaking of stupid drunk people, since we're in the ""hood"" and college for a lot of students is the first time off the family farm, both Cincinnati PD and UCPD have increased their patrols in recent years, free shuttles have become bigger and more frequent, and, oh yeah, UC now owns a fleet of minivans that will pick students up and take them home free of charge.  Which is all just a long way of saying: of course our tuition is going to athletics. It's also going to improvements in architecture, infrastructure, campus lifestyle, and safety. It's going pretty much everywhere except academics, and as fucked up as that seems, as annoying as it is that all of my classes next year will be held in one of two trailers, the fact that we have such a housing crisis that the school is block leasing an ENTIRE 8 floor, 2 building apartment complex next year shows it's working. Not to overstep my area of expertise, but schools seem to be in a pissing contest with each other for tuition and reputation, and this is exactly how a school like UC steps out of OSU's shadow. Maybe nobody told CityBeat they chose UC because of athletics, but I guarantee you could spin around with your eyes closed and end up pointing at someone whose decision was based at least partly on the hype, the whole #hottestcollegeinamerica thing, the modernization that's touching every damn nook and cranny on campus - football stadium included."

Not only that, but they can access anything they do from school while at home - you just need a web browser and an Internet connection. I have athletes writing papers on their phones while riding the bus to games. But every time technology comes up: iPads.   The teachers don't use computers as a substitute for classroom teaching, back-and-forth talking, or workbooks / worksheets, nor would I want them to. I can't believe there's any cost savings or improved learning by moving workbooks online.   It depends on the style of class and a bunch of other factors. Standardized testing is not ever going to absolutely go away, at least in the United States, and all of that is done on a computer - so they need to be very familiar with doing the writing process on a computer; believe it or not, context and tools matter when you're wanting them to do their best. As another example, we have kids do ""accelerated reading"" quizzes on the computer, after reading library books, and they just click blindly without thinking about their answers - we have to untrain those bad habits before they take a multiple choice test online.  The structure of the modern classroom is changing. The ""bucket model"" (the idea that the teacher is the source of knowledge and the students the receptacles) is dying. Learning to research, to seek out information, is becoming a norm, and it seems to be a great way to help not just convey information but encourage participation and active interest. Because of this, the way a classroom runs is being remodeled to better suit these more effective learning styles. However, everything in the K-4 or so range needs to still be very hands-on, simply because that's where kids are in their cognitive development; unfortunately, school administrators often don't understand that."

The scam is that they own a for-profit educational company in parallel with their not-for-profit charter schools.  They save a bunch of money by not having libraries, cafeterias, and taking who knows what other shortcuts, and then they send all that extra money to the for-profit educational company in ""consulting fees"" and so on.  Then the guys at the top gradually collect a ton of money from the for-profit company.    And all this to get basically zero educational innovation - there's no great educational methods and we're not getting performance superior to public schools.  All that's happening is that the charter schools are carefully selecting the best students through various methods, leaving the most problematic cases in the public schools, and then claiming they're outperforming them.    I know hating teacher unions is all the rage in the United States, but charter schools are fundamentally undermining public education for the sake of private profit.  They're not a solution to our educational problems.  They're just shortsightedly ripping up more strands in the social fabric.

If a child was sent by a school, taxpayer money paid for it. The high school students sent there did not receive any credit toward graduation, because the school was not accredited. Those students lost a year of work, and had to repeat that grade in school, because there was no transparency or oversight.  There are many examples of other charter schools that were opened, got taxpayer money, then closed. Those students then had to return to their public school, only their public school got no money for educating them, because the tax money was paid to the, now closed, charter school.

EDIT: A quick bit about the 'Two Minute Hate' in 'Nine-teen Eighty-four':  The film and its accompanying auditory and visual cues (which include a grinding noise that Orwell describes as ""of some monstrous machine running without oil"") are a form of brainwashing to Party members, attempting to whip them into a frenzy of hatred and loathing for Emmanuel Goldstein and the current enemy superstate. Apparently, it is not uncommon for those caught up in the hate to physically assault the telescreen, as Julia does during the scene.  The film becomes more surreal as it progresses, with Goldstein's face morphing into a sheep as enemy soldiers advance on the viewers, before one such soldier charges at the screen, submachine gun blazing. He morphs, finally, into the face of Big Brother at the end of the two minutes. At the end, the mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted viewers chant ""B-B!...B-B!"" over and over again, ritualistically.  Within the book, the purpose of the Two Minutes Hate is said to satisfy the citizens' subdued feelings of angst and hatred from leading such a wretched, controlled existence. By re-directing these subconscious feelings away from the Oceanian government and toward external enemies (which probably do not even exist), the Party minimizes subversive thought and behavior.  In the first Two Minutes Hate of the book, the audience is introduced to Inner Party member and key character O'Brien. Within the novel, hate week is an extrapolation of the two-minute period into an annual week-long festival."

That's actually what the ""standardized"" in ""standardized testing"" means. It doesn't mean that the test is the same for everyone, it means that the score means the same thing for everyone.  Allow me to get technical for a minute. Suppose you and I take a test on a given skill scored 1 to 5, and you get a 4 and I get a 3. The simplest reading of that score is that you know more than I do. But wait, what if you go to a school where the average grade is a 4, and I go to a school where the average grade is a 2? It doesn't change the fact that 4>3, but in context your 4 doesn't mean the same thing as my 3. Your score of 4 is an average score in context, while my score is an above average score in context.   Adjusting scores along a univariate scale so that scores in different contexts have similar means and spreads is called normalization. And when scores are expressed not as a raw measure but in terms of how far it is from the average score for a given population, i.e. in a given context, that score is standardized.   I'm harping on the math because, even when I don't approve of the way testing is used, as a researcher I see some deep, deep misconceptions among educators with regards to what scores mean and how they should be used. Any competent statistical treatment of standardized test scores should normalize both within- and across- contexts, thus erasing differential effects on scores related to, among other things, poverty, teaching to the test... and pep rallies using dancing monkey mascots.  IMHO it's not that testing is bad or that Pearson is evil. It's that test scores are used in a statistically and politically dishonest manner. Standardized tests were never intended to regress on teacher effect, as in value-added modeling - that's statistically dishonest. Standardized test were never intended to compare school performance, and thus assign funding (among other things) through unnormalized scores - that's politically dishonest.

education,35014w,realchicagomama,4,Wed May 6 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Statistically speaking, every student that opts out is intensifying the effect of the remaining students' scores on the reference norm.   Assuming that kids being opted out are normally spread in terms of performance, then the effect would wash out, and opting out would have completely negligible effects.  But if mostly lower performing kids opt out, the higher performing kids are setting the bar that might higher for all kids, including the opt-outs.   Conversely, if mostly the higher-achieving kids opt out (which is my sense of what's happening in most places) then any value-added teacher- or school metrics would be lowerd, and contingent funding would take a major hit, thus decreasing the quality of education for all kids, including the opt-outs.  The critical mass of opt-outs required for the tests to lose validity even at a local level are pretty huge.

I have no specific information about Pearson's norm-referencing procedures... it may vary state-by-state or model-by-model.  And breaking the test-scores-to-funding mindset means revising the accountability movement. I would say this means getting rid of the anti-public-school GOP, but honestly, the teacher's unions could take a lot of heat off by agreeing to do what doctors do: police their own.

Patty Murray was the person carrying the water for the testeaucracy during ESEA renewal. The D's biggest contributors are pouring money into school privatization efforts and Ds are also the ones who are framing the opt-out debate as white suburban parents hate brown children.   Opt-out is having its intended effect. It is casting light on the corrosive effects of test-based ""accountability"" on K-12 education. Elected and appointed leaders who have alternately ignored and belittled parents are being forced to account (pun intended) for the policies they've implemented. What do you propose that parents should be doing that would be as or more likely than opt-out to get attention? Most voters are absolutely clueless about education issues and the money for buying political influence is overwhelmingly on the side of testing and accountability. I'm not terribly optimistic that opt-out is going to lead to substantive change, but it is at least forcing the public to begin to discuss issues in public education that have been ignored until recently.  The NEA and AFT are not the primary barriers to teachers policing their own. Barely more than half of all K-12 teachers are even covered by a CBA. The biggest barriers are money and social status. Teachers come up short on both.  Physicians have a rather poor record of policing themselves, public perception notwithstanding. It's one of the reasons why physicians are currently on the receiving end of their own version of government mandated accountability."

A test measures nothing more than their ability to take that specific test in a specific space at a specific time. The idea that we can extrapolate that to the content as a whole, and compare it to other students is ridiculous.  With this in mind. What do these test scores really tell us? What use do these tests even have?"

Before the creation of the common school, no “school system” existed per se. Education existed as a loose confederation of options based on the needs and goals of the student and the parents. No standardization existed. This lack of standardization meant that there was no system by which students could be compared or measured with respect to anyone else but themselves and their personal goals. The more structured and rigid a system becomes, the more likely it is that students who do not fit the structure will be labeled disabled or some other crappy label. Education should be about obtaining knowledge and skills that are deemed necessary by nobody but the student themselves, and perhaps the parent. Education, and possibly some form of schooling, should be about helping children and adolescents realize who they are as individuals and cultural beings in a diverse society. If we put the same confidence in all students and believe that they all want to succeed (however they define success), students will be free to learn without the restrictions of an oppressive system. Schools today use college and career readiness standards with the goal of giving students a target to aim for. I certainly don’t object to students having goals. However, it shouldn’t be the universal end goals for all students through standards. My philosophy of education is based on the belief in respecting self-actualization, the growth and uniqueness of each member of the community, and the reality of interdependence would be ideal."

Perhaps they answered it correctly because they just KNOW the answer because it's so common, but don't understand the process. Like, how someone knows E=MC2, but doesn't know what it means. Also, if someone may have just guessed.  On the other hand, just because someone got it wrong, that doesn't mean they don't know it. Perhaps they didn't understand the process of the actual test. Or perhaps they just don't see the value in the test and blew it off by guessing, so their is a cultural issue at play as well where scoring well on tests are instilled in them.

IDK if i'm convinced that the program itself is the cause, it hasn't been in place very long.  There is a fair amount of data that compares sexual education programs that include information about contraceptives and how to use them correctly to varying levels of abstinence-focused education, and, generally, the ""comprehensive"" programs which include contraceptive counseling have lower rates of teen pregnancy and STIs.

When I was growing up reading was my main source of entertainment. We only had 3 TV channels which were not 24 hour (this was in the UK), and video games and the internet had not been invented, so if you wanted to be entertained you read. I hated being told what to read by teachers (as do most kids), but my escape from reading what they told me to read was to read what I wanted to read.  Things are totally different now- if my son wants to escape from what the school tells him to read (and he does) he has: 24 hour wall-to-wall TV, video games, his phone, text messages, Skype, and everything the internet has to tempt him with. Reading for pleasure is just one of many options now, and because he is beginning to associate reading with unpleasant subjects he does not want to read about it is getting lower on his list. And before you tell me that as parents we should be controlling what he has access to- I agree, but if you think it’s that easy you obviously have not tried to raise a teenager lately!  Kids must read an awful lot of different things as they plow through the homework they are set, and much of it is dry, textbook reading. And while I agree that an appreciation of fine literature must be taught as part of their education, does the subject matter have to be so deep and meaningful all the time? By treating it this way we are producing a generation of kids who see reading as “work” or a “chore” as they associate it with homework and as something that has to be done before they can do what they want to do, probably  online.  I think there needs to be a radical rethink of the way “English” is taught to inspire kids to enjoy reading, to treat it as something they enjoy and want to do- and you don’t do that by making them read nothing but “worthy” books that will teach them other things. Teach the other things in the other classes, let Social Studies teach the history and Health teach the responsibility and the social justice. English should be about teaching kids to read and write, they should be taught to read for pleasure and enjoy the beauty of a well turned phrase and a ripping yarn. Only by reading good, gripping stories that they enjoy and they feel are relevant to them will they keep doing it for fun after the class and the homework is finished. And only by exposure to lots of reading will they learn to be effective and creative writers themselves.  If you do a little research online you will see all sorts of reports and studies that show that reading for pleasure is in decline. In a brief search I found a Time article that reports that 45% of 17 year olds admit to only reading for pleasure a few times a year, while a Huff Post poll found that 28% of Americans have not read a book in the last year… how freaking sad!"

Well, yeah, it's almost the worst in Europe, but taken in context it's pretty low to start with, and the UK's 24.5 stat was a record low reached last year. It certainly broadens the picture of how we view the birth rate in America.  For more context, here are the birth rates across Europe."

By the way, not only is the teen birth rate higher in Chicago, according to the CDC, Chicago ranks 1st and 2nd nationwide, respectively, for the highest rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia infections among young people aged 15-19 years.

Then, of course, there's Chicago, where the rate is 57.0 per 1000.   As long as we're guessing, I'm gonna go with the pregnancy rate in Chicago being far higher than Texas, if for no other reason than there is such ready access to abortion services here. There are at least three abortion clinics in the city and another several in the metropolitan area, as compared with eight in the entire state of Texas. Blame the Bible thumpers of Texas if you will but everyone agrees that lack of access to abortions leads to more babies and that means that Chicago has a truly insane teen pregnancy problem.  Accounting for socio-economic status, ethnicity and a wide range of other factors is well and good but the article didn't do that - except for the decidedly negative portrayal of the deficiencies of Texas.

Most of my best students end up going to a private or charter school because their parents are driven away by the public school's reputation.  Of course this has the effect of making the public school look even worse because they don't get the best students and the cycle perpetuates itself.    Just my experience that parents often draw the line at middle school as the time to self segregate their children.  Would be interested in seeing more research into this idea.

At my school, there are elementary students who have personal staff attendants who exist to protect other students and staff and prevent damage to property.... due to radical mood swings, happy child one second, violent child the next, or children who ignore instruction and do as they like.   One student gets up and walks out of class when he likes, screaming down the hall (at nobody and nothing in particular), standing on playground equipment shouting, etc. Classroom doors are locked by default. When he walks near the office or library, staff run ahead to lock doors. If he gets into, say, the library, pencils and scissors are immediately seized to keep them out of his reach.   He pretty much can't be expelled (no where to go) and suspending him is big trouble. The district has 3 kids suspended at the same time which was justification to trigger a state investigation. We're not supposed to suspend more than one. There was an extra workstation in my office used by various people throughout the day. The computer has been removed because it was immediately accessible when out-of-control students enter the office.  All of the attendants (and other staff) wear radios and those that can run to a scene when a particular student has become violent and cannot be contained.  Also, teachers are required to document 10 positive comments for every 1 negative comment said to a student. Asking, ""Did you have your homework to turn in?"" is a negative comment.  Basically, schools are zoos because a great many children today are broken. Half of all Americans are low income or living in poverty, and a ton of negative things trend with poverty... physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental abuse, neglect, malnutrition, mental illness, sensory issues, learning disabilities, physical disabilities, vocabulary/lack of enriching environment at home, etc. People don't realize how quickly America is gong to hell in a hand basket because of the rise in poverty and loss of the middle class."

For people saying they're about absorbing content, thanks for researching the original iPad and sticking with your opinions since 2010. Physical keyboards affect people 25 years old+ because we're used to physical keyboards. After using a touchscreen for 3 years I'm no slouch (but my PERSONAL preference is physical because that's what I grew up with).  Things have changed massively with Apps such as Explain Everything allowing students to create easy to follow guides for themselves, or most importantly, for others. I've seen 6 year olds helping each other with using the device, collaboration is a powerful tool in a persons arsenal against the world so imagine 10+ years of it before you get to college/University.  I'm not advocating Apple over other providers, as I look to many for inspiration such as Dave Coplin, Microsoft's Chief Envisioning Officer, who says that the word 'Digital' will disappear in our professional lives in 2015 (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30442178). We adults stick the word digital onto anything tech based to treat it differently, but todays children don't separate art from digital art. It's just art. I don't send you digital letters, it's an email. We will grow and become familiar with this format because that's what we do.  Frasier Spears started the world's first 1:1 iPad school and quotes Douglas Adams very well in discussing iPads vs Chromebooks: http://www.speirs.org/blog/2014/12/17/the-post-mobile-era. I'd suggest keeping an eye on his blog as his goes through ALL types of tech.  A device with camera, microphone and varied Apps offers huge potential to all learning types (auditory, visual, kinaesthetic). Think back to your personal experience of learning/revision. For me it was black ink until an important word pops up where I would grab a coloured pen and write IN BOLD before returning to black pen. These lines of information have not sunk in further than quotes from movies. Why? Because I learn better from discussion than reading.  Management is key and if you look around there are hundreds of schools and colleges with successful use of iPads, the key is having 100% of the staff on board. ""I didn't learn like this so why do kids today need to"" is an incredibly shallow view on learning. If we stuck with that mentality we'd have textbooks from the 1700s and still speak Latin.

I believe my teaching peers and I have benefitted from teacher prep programs that foster dynamic interaction with students and encourage reflective use of a range of methodologies that bring the world into the classroom.  The two biggest differences I've seen since my own children started school and later across my own experience as a teacher in the classroom are: 1) Electronic devices have added boatloads of distractions and conflicts in addition to being potentially valuable tools in the classroom. 2) Teachers, particularly those in standardized/state-mandated testing environments, are stuck between trying to teach set content and trying to incorporate skill building for critical thinking, creative problem-solving, communication and collaboration in a way that is engaging and useful for students' long-term growth.  For#1 I built into the structure of the class and enforce a ""no devices in sight"" unless they will be incorporated into the lesson....I spell out what's happening each class, so the kids know when they can expect to use their phones, have a break and switch activities.  For #2: I cannot tell you how many kids announce in the first week of class that they don't have to pass my class to graduate, and they could give a rat's ass about the state tests.  I let them get it off their chests and move on knowing that I can teach the hell out the subject in an interesting way, so that they almost forget that they're learning.... That being said, I still worry and get burned out toward the end of each year, knowing that they ""need"" to pass those state tests, but that's my shit not theirs.  Why sit in a class if you're not interested in learning anything? I show them how to manage the hateful shit, and if all they're interested in is getting by, I accept it. For the most part, even older students want your respect and guidance, and they know when you care about them as people and are willing to try - families can see this too.  I don't need to be their friends, and I'm not their babysitter: I am their teacher, so I teach....and most of them learn how to be better learners if I can show them a little and move forward. My job isn't easy, but I dig it, and I want the students, particularly those who struggle, to be able to live through their struggle and to find something they DO care about."

If the parents aren't going to make their kids sit and read for 30 minutes every night (or other homework/projects) why do I need a bunch of paperwork to check up on them?  I send home every test/quiz I give, but the parents don't review it with their kids, they just sign them and send them back in.

education,34pih0,RODAMI,3,Sun May 3 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that parents need to be the most important and active influence in their children's intellectual development. Keep in mind, though, that there's often more to the story (especially in low SES schools like yours), which may not have occurred to you-- the vast majority of public school teachers, even in the poorest schools, are white and middle class and haven't had the challenges their students face. A lot of kids, especially as they get older, are extremely reluctant to share this. Some of my own experiences working in a Title I school: 1) A single parent might be working the late shift and getting home after the kids are asleep, and not have time to check their homework, or be home to make sure they're reading 30 minutes a night. And if it's an older kid, s/he might be responsible for taking care of their younger siblings while the parent is gone. 2) The parents may not speak/read English, so they don't know what you're sending home.  3) The family might be homeless (if they're living in a car, or had to move in with another family, or sharing a motel room with their parents and other siblings, there might not be a quiet place for them to read or do homework, and especially in high-crime neighborhoods there might not be a safe place for them to go and work)."

While there are many elements and dynamics that remain reletatively unchanged over a period of decades, there are also significant qualitiative differences between now and the not too distant past. Much of it is caused by the various movements and reform agendas designed to enhance the qualtiy of teaching by brining greater accountability into the process. Teachers in general have less freedom and greater scutiny than in the past. The new setting is likely to drive some out of the profession. Some who need to go, and unfortunately many others who are very talented but have no patience for the new limits placed upon them and their students. When I heard teachers thirty years ago complaining about the good of days, about kids and parents... I often thought it demonstrated a lack of understanding of our culture and the role teacher plays in it. When I hear the complaints today, I come to the same conclusion. One of the real changes, however, is the disdain many reformers have for taking into account the obstacles of poverty and culture have upon teaching and learning. The ""no excuses"" folks who just wan to set a high bar and demand that teachers and studetns reach it, and blame them when they don't are not being helpful."

Those in academia are liberals because conservatives don't want the jobs, not because of some left-wing shield."
education,34mkzf,jonivy,-3,Sat May 2 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, you've got the cause and effect mixed up.  Salaries are lower because they're liberals, not the other way around. It's basic economics. Those that don't care for money will accept less. The invisible hand isn't blind."
education,34mkzf,kaosotis,4,Sun May 3 02:22:51 2015 UTC,Isn't that exactly what the other person said? Or are you implying that they lower the salaries knowing they are liberal and will take less? I'd wager that is not the case.
education,34mkzf,jonivy,2,Sun May 3 08:43:21 2015 UTC,"The other person said   Those in academia are liberals because conservatives don't want the jobs.     He lists the reason for this being that the academic jobs pay less, and therefore only liberals, people who are passionate about academia moreso than a desire for money, are the only one's that would take the jobs.  I agree on three points:   *   Most people in academia are liberals.   *   Academic jobs pay less than other comparable jobs in the market that require the same or less education and experience.   *   Liberals will take jobs that pay less money than their conservative counterparts.    Where I disagree is on his finding of a causal relationship. Namely, he asserts that the reason liberals have those jobs is because conservatives are interested in earning more money, and therefore do not take those jobs.  In making this assertion, he's ignoring the question of ""How is the salary so low?""  I asserted that the reason the jobs pay less, is because they are filled with people who are moreso interested in the work than the pay. They are people that would work for free.    You seemed close to summarizing my assertion, when you said ""they lower the salaries knowing (the academics) are liberal and will take less"", but that's not exactly right.    There is no ""they"". We have a mostly free market for labor, even academic labor. The prices (salary) are set by the market. The agreed upon price for a teacher, for instance, is an agreement between how much a teacher is willing to take for a salary and how much an employer is willing to pay.   Teachers are willing to work for very little pay, and therefore the price will reach a lower equilibrium than if they were not willing to work for such low pay.    If everyone was equally driven by income (if more teachers were conservatives), then the salaries would be higher."
education,34mkzf,kaosotis,2,Sun May 3 11:18:51 2015 UTC,"You make good points but I think the causal relationship isn't so clear cut.  Plenty of my colleagues are conservatives, and not a small minority, and it's presumptuous to state that conservatives by nature are less interested in money. I don't believe statistics would bear that out.  If course the argument being ignored is whether the free market is always appropriate and whether some things, and I would argue education is one of them, should by their value to the society not be subject completely to the free market.  How do you attract the best possible candidates without providing incentive? Hence pensions, benefits, and at least reasonably competitive salaries like affluent school districts."

Not burdening them with all the ridiculous shit they have to do outside of class that don't actually help them teach better. Can you imagine if we had a draft like the NBA or NFL but for teachers and they were the ones making million dollar contracts?    Then those that want college should do it but we need to stop selling college, because right now that is what it is for loans and keeping workers out of the workforce, and build trades again.  College is not the magic fix all people think and most of the time it leaves you worse off, at least financially. We also need to get students to realize that college should spark interest and be a spring to start to learn on your own. Now many students just wait for teachers to spoon feed and wonder why they are useless after graduation when they never activated themselves. But they have the piece of paper right? They will got a job with the paper right?   Also a year of service in the community or abroad does wonders for sharpening direction for the future.

education,34if2f,CaptainGlobal,12,Fri May 1 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"That's an abysmally researched and written article. It makes it sound like the universities are collapsing due to now being free. This is misleading: the public universtities have always been taxpayer funded in Germany. Additionally, a bit over a decade ago,  states started experimenting with letting universities charge an extra ""tuition"" fee from the students in a misguided attempt to make the universities more student oriented (because - they were customers now!) To the whopping tune of a few hundred dollars a term. It is this additional top-up fee, which has been contentious ever since the experiment started, that has been dropped again in state after state over the last years.   Universities struggling to deal with demand was indeed an issue a few years back. But the reason had little to do with student tuition and much to do with states going from a 13 year to a 12 year primary and secondary education system, resulting in some years with double the amount of graduates qualifying to enter university.  Finally: yes, formal ""student housing"" and dormitories only covers a fraction of students enrolled. But that does not lead to armies of poor students living on the streets in Germany, and is misleading because most universities in Germany are not campus universities. Most students choose to rent regular apartments or flats - often sharing a multiroom flat. Think about how most US students would have no trouble renting a room if tuition was free. Organized dormitories in Germany are mostly popular among foreign students or those who want to ""avoid distractions"". Local students tend to see them as dull/boring. Of course a reporter will always be able to find one or two who haven't managed to find the accomodation they like - some perhaps didn't start looking in time - and then it's if course thenuniversity's fault for not providing enough dormitories.  Don't get me wrong: There are easily a number of things you can rightfully criticise about the German university system and its high share of tenured professors. But ""lack of student housing"" and ""lack of teachers"" (sic) are not among the top. And few of the problems are anywhere near what the US is doing in drowning its young generation in crippling student debt - with many colleges even having a negative ROI."

""Quantity"" is something I don't think you really want to argue, with China being at > 2500 higher education institutions and quickly rising, and let's not even get started on India where apparently you can set up a ""College"" in your garage using a bit of paperwork.  So let's look at quality. Yes, the US dominates many of the top spots in international university rankings, as well as lists of universities where foreign students want to study.   Is this proof of the overall superiority of the US system? No, it is simply an effect of having high numbers and high variance in quality. The US also has a high number of colleges that effectively burn your money.  In many other contries, the average quality of the education system may actually easily be higher than the average in the US and the latter would still have the top spots as long as their variance os quality is higher.

So compare the US college graduates with the college graduates from other countries. Now a blanket 16-65. IF YOU WANT TO COMPARE HOW GOOD THE COLLEGES ARE. YOU WORTHLESS FUCKING FILTH. The US does not have a good elementary or secondary system. But we have a great college system. Mmmmkay? Are you able to grasp this basic fact? We are comparing COLLEGES. So including 16-65 non-college graduates kinda skews the results. No?   The data you claim to be looking for is in the report I linked.   No it is NOT you worthless fucking filth. If it was, you'd be able to POINT TO IT DIRECTLY...   And there is publicly abailable research about which US colleges have negative ROI.   No shit moron. What's your fucking point?    But as it seems you are just here to shout ""Murica!!!""   Once again, you dumb worthless cockroach, I never said the US elementary or secondary system was good. So there goes your ""Murica"" excuse. I said our college system was great. Okay?   I'm sorry that our college produce the best and greatest scientists, nobel laureates, technologists, etc. The proof is in the pudding. I'm sorry everyone around the world wants to study at US colleges. Our colleges suck, so that's why people are so eager to pay hundreds of thousands to attend one...

You can point to a few university rankings here and there (i.e. QS, where MIT is top, followed by Cambridge, Imperial College, Harvard, Oxford and UCL), but then what makes up those rankings in the first place? Look into the methodology, and you'll see, 40% of that ranking decision comes from ""Academic Reputation"" based on globally surveying a number of academics. 10% is ""Employer Reputation"", another 10% is based on how many international students and staff these universities accept (Guess where most international students choose to study? Hint: It's also the same country most immigrants overall migrate to globally; and, unless you speak the language of many universities, you often can't study in those universities, so let's rule out non-English-speaking universities from this ranking). 20% on the staff-to-student ratio, and only 20% is based on academic citations of a faculty (this, the only real form of measurement of academic quality - and even that's a bit of a haphazard claim - simply innately benefits universities that produce research in a language that has the status as a common lingua franca, such as English, and English-speaking universities make up 36 out of the top 50 universities for that reason).  Other university rankings aiming to compare globally are, undoubtedly, the same - focusing on mere opinions of what university is the ""best"", rather than any sort of quantitative data. They don't attempt to measure entry standards, completion rates, honours degrees that rank 2.1 or above, the proportion of staff working in research roles, or graduate prospects in terms of employability (there's a difference between employers saying they'll hire people and them actually doing so).  In short, American universities - like British universities - are only really good insofar as they have a reputation. Oddly enough, for anyone who has actually studied in any of those countries, 9/10ths of the courses will involve studying influential theories or figures etc. from German and French academics etc., with only very rarely a British or American person being mentioned in passing."

Check out this graphic to see how the cost of education has risen much faster than inflation, hence my correcting your post.  Edit:  Check out this timeline of public funding of education in California. During the 1960s (when one of my professors went to school), tuition was still free for in-state residents.

In my state, Transitional Kindergarten serves kids who are a few months below the cut-off date, and a teacher assessment before the first day of school determines if they'll get K or TK instruction.  Meanwhile, a parent who wants their advanced learner to skip a grade is free to advocate for that move. But at the elementary level, don't confuse parents teaching their kid to read during the preschool years with the kid being an advanced learner.  Look to class size and paraprofessional coverage in a classroom as an indication of how well a teacher can cater to students who are ahead of the curve."

Testing server and network capacity at the Chicago hosting location still had ample head room at the time of the incident.  The perceived outage was caused this morning were related to unanticipated delays in the download of a client-side script that enhances the functionality of the browser.

education,34b4b0,WhaleMeatFantasy,6,Thu Apr 30 15:56:47 2015 UTC,Actually the problem is not that we teach kids to memorize but that we expect them to memorise without ever actually teaching them how to do it.   Our knowledge of how memory works is better than ever due to empirical cognitive psychology. We really should be teaching children how to memorise properly using this information.   Meanwhile thinking v memorising is a false dichotomy. You can't think anything interesting without memory and the more memorised resources you have to draw on the better you'll think.
education,34b4b0,internetnickname,5,Thu Apr 30 05:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a teacher and this is pretty much (and has been for quite a bit now) what we are told to do.  Teach them to think and find answers, not be able to memorize them.  Who cares when the Revolutionary War was fought as far as date goes, but rather why was it fought?"
education,34b4b0,gerkin123,4,Thu Apr 30 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My grandpa was in the Revolutionary War, and let me tell you- I have heard enough stories to understand why he and his seven siblings found themselves embroiled in the conflict. I believe it was largely due taxation, and was at least partially sparked over a tax for tea, which was I believe the English were transporting from India, who were under the Raj at the time. Note that this wasn't directly connected to the Lusitania, which was another British vessel that stood as a part of a very different conflict happening around the same time. Fortunately, his tour was over before King Philip's War kicked off somewhere nearby; I don't think he could have dealt with trenchfoot.  Seriously though, I take issue with the false dichotomy that is taking hold in educational discourse: our students can think about things, or they can retain factual information; they can innovate, or they can know. As if you can innovate in a vacuum. As if teachers have been demanding students memorize dates in history like they are the 7s row of a multiplication table (7, 14, 21, 28... 1492, 1612, 1776) for the sake of rapid recall and nothing else. At least in my neck of the woods, this reads like a decades old tract, its obviousness only overshadowed by its irrelevance. Those who have different experiences, I hope your education was conducted under a remnant of a dwindling breed."

The problems in urban neighbourhoods are so deep that it's a wonder ANYONE learns to read. School choice is not the answer. Desegregation, anti-poverty measures and opportunity are what is needed.

Most community colleges have partnerships with Universities in your area so credits will transfer if you want to go from an associates to bachelor's.  Avoid schools like ITT tech or Devry, they are not worth the money and many tech employers do not value them. Be sure to apply for finical aid, I bet you would qualify for a pell grant, http://www.fafsa.ed.gov.  Try and get any scholarships you can, http://college.usatoday.com/2012/01/30/the-10-best-sites-to-look-for-scholarships/.  School can get pretty expensive and the last thing you want to do is be in massive debt when you are finished.  Avoid campus book stores, or stores sponsored but the school like the plague.  Use http://www.textbookpricecomparison.com to find the cheapest option, if you dont want to keep the book sell them back on half.com."
