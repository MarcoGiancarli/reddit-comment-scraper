While you're in the process of making yourself eligible for enlistment, you could also have your college costs paid through an ROTC scholarship.  Your high school grades or GED status won't matter.  Community college is like starting over with a clean slate for your academic record.  You may have to take remedial classes based on your scores in English and math placement exams.  But nearly anyone who puts in a full effort to do their best and to seek help for any weaknesses should be able to do very well.

Or they would sell chocolate bars.   These kids would be out sometimes in the sun all day 8+ hours alone asking for money and then there parents? Would pick them up late at night in there brand new Chrysler 300s or big suburbans real nice cars. Nothing has ever made me so furious. I only mention the race because this part of corona is mostly white and I'm sure these kids rake in the money. These kids are often so young they have no idea what they are doing they just know to ask for money.   Nothing made my blood boil more then watching these poor kids out there every single day for hours sometimes just looking miserable.   There is also a group that has some sort of church (?) logo on it they sell this shitty candy and also ask donations. I take no issues with people who pan handle and are respectful but these women are sometimes extremely pushy and would hassle my customers who were walking right out of my store with there kids and stuff. They would sometimes make snide comments are get visibly angry when you would say no.   They would also hassle our delivery drivers. I have no problems with the guys who sit next to free ways and intersections but he people who pan handle inside parking lots are the worst."

InlandEmpire,3dp32a,happycheff,2,Sat Jul 18 02:59:31 2015 UTC,The dust warning is for joshua tree and yucca valley
InlandEmpire,3dp32a,TDTJman,-3,Sat Jul 18 04:29:27 2015 UTC,"Part of this has to do with the fire in the Cajon pass.   With the weather warm and dry with a breeze, the fire amplifies the weather pattern, and can actually begin it's own storm."
InlandEmpire,3dp32a,matt4500,9,Sat Jul 18 04:42:38 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with the fire.  Its from an outflow boundary due to collapsing thunderstorms south of Coachella.    Source: am meteorologist
InlandEmpire,3dp32a,klugerama,3,Sat Jul 18 03:17:38 2015 UTC,"Uh, no. The dust storm warning is completely unrelated. The warning is for the Morongo basin and Yucca Valley area.  A fire can change the weather; however, unless it's a huge fire (which the Cajon fire isn't) the effects such as wind, heat, and humidity are very localized. You're not going to see a dust storm unless you're within a mile or so of a gigantic, completely out-of-control raging inferno."
InlandEmpire,3dp32a,TDTJman,0,Sat Jul 18 04:36:30 2015 UTC,"The fun part is that the person  who originally called for the alert in  the Inland empire area did so based around the localized effects of the fire which, as I noted, were amplifying existing weather patterns.   Also, effects like a dust storm have little to do with the size of the fire. Even a fire less than one acre can begin to change patterns within a smaller radius. A ""raging inferno"" could have wind effects reaching well beyond a mile.   Edit: Hit post before I was done typing."
InlandEmpire,3dp32a,klugerama,0,Sat Jul 18 04:36:06 2015 UTC,"Again, WTF are you talking about? There is no way a fire in the Cajon pass is going to be in any way whatsoever directly related to a dust storm over 60 miles away that is caused by convective outflow. Even if a person called about dust in the Cajon pass area, that is completely different from dust 60+ mi. east. No meteorologist is going to say, ""There's dust being reported in San Bernardino due to a fire; I better issue a dust storm warning for a completely different place due to a completely different reason."""

InlandEmpire,3di152,Alcohooligan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:44 2015 UTC,"This seems to be the sentiment with warehouses in all of IE. We've seen so many warehouses built and are now really observing the real health and environmental impacts that they have as opposed to what studies said they would be before building. Even aside from pollution caused by trucks being decreased due to new exhaust standards, the area already has a horrible air quality problem.  Another major issue that's been pointed out is both the quality of jobs in term of pay as well as actual numbers of employment compared to estimates. We've seen these numbers fudged on some of these projects and although not all are faked we can't be naive to believe that they'll be able to supply the number of jobs they say all the time. I hate to be the naysayer or whatever but lets face it, ""the No. 1 logistics center in the United States."" as they quoted in the article is going to grow large enough to be highly automated sooner than most logistic centers.  I understand that the area needs jobs, and more importantly there needs to be logistic centers for commerce to work. One thing I've noticed is that most of the city councils around here that I hear about, mine included, seem to be talking about jobs only in turn of warehouses and major commercial retail. There's plenty of other routes to go for jobs though, and often times it sounds like they don't even want to venture from those two routes. The IE area has had somewhat of a population boom in the past decade or so, yet we haven't seen much of a localized economic boom since everyone came here to work in LA or the OC.

Low-wage jobs are better than none, and they don't even seem to be that low-wage considering the qualifications necessary. When I started out with a college degree, I wasn't paid that much better.  Other than being a reasonable place to live and convenient for everyday life (abundant shopping, fast-food / casual dining restaurants, etc.), Moreno Valley doesn't have that much to offer (no downtown, no breweries now that Kat Daddy is kaput, no arts scene, essentially no ""culture""). And I know from experience, living there for the last 5 years. Other than poaching ""talent"" from UCR, I'm not sure Moreno Valley has an employment niche other than logistics."

InlandEmpire,3d5nyl,mindfulmu,4,Tue Jul 14 05:02:11 2015 UTC,"yeah its pretty common to never hear from a company again if their not interested, not even a thank you for applying. What i find works is being slightly pushy/aggressive. Meaning call them and tell them you applied and never heard a response. The people who get hired sometimes arent the best candidates, but the ones who make it awkward/uncomfortable. Walk in person, ask to speak to the interviewer and have them tell you directly. Push the conversation/interaction versus being passive. As far as I know, its been like that here(and im sure everywhere) since the recession. Gone are the days of applying and waiting for a phone call and getting the job. Now its more like come in and have an interview and then at that point its on YOU to push further conversation regarding the job. I work in a grocery store(i know bad example) but the people who get hired are the ones who comes in every day and consistently ask to speak to a manager, always asking to get an interview in person, essentially being annoying, but demonstrates that they want the job, versus the over qualified college student who gets an interview and just expects they will get hired."

As for price matching, has to be the exact same item and the gtx980 had a few different versions so make sure it's the same one (or they can order they other ones), has to be in stock from whomever you are trying to price match, and a retailer on a list of websites they price match.

InlandEmpire,3bhftf,CAD007,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:14:16 2015 UTC,Eastvale has gotten pricey and getting to a freeway during rush hour (if you commute ) is a huge pain.

InlandEmpire,3bfd01,dubear,7,Sun Jun 28 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"I'd invest in a FasTrak transponder, especially since they're doing construction along the 91 and traffic can get pretty annoying. You can take basically any toll roads in CA with it and it'll show up in your account kind of like transactions on your credit card statements, and having the transponder will save you some money in the long run. Here's a few links to learn more/sign up! https://www.thetollroads.com/communications/fastrak_throughout_california.php https://www.91expresslanes.com/signup.asp (the 241 is what your wife would probably take to get from the Corona/Chino area to Irvine) Best of luck!"
InlandEmpire,3bfd01,Valuciano,2,Sun Jun 28 19:11:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except you still get bottlenecked when trying to enter the 91 East from the 241 from 3-630PM on most days.  You'll save some time with Fastrack, but it's not a magic bullet that has no slowdowns. If you live deep in the east side of Corona, you're screwed by the ""Corona Crawl"" created by the 91/15 Interchange/Construction, and there is no Fastrak that can save you from that.  To determine whether Fastrak is a good deal, you have to really figure out how much an hour is actually worth in monetary termes, then make your decision.  The bottom line is the 91 is an exclusive corridor everyone is forced to travel because there is no other route nearby.  Fastrak will save you a little time, but to think that using Fastrak means you'll never get stuck in traffic is wrong.  It just moves you past most of it but you still get stuck around Green River when the Fastrak benefits end long before the traffic is moving at a decent pace.  Also, Fastrak lanes/highways increase your chance of earning a speeding ticket if you have a lead foot.  It is no secret that CHP love to farm the traffic in these lanes for fines.  Thinking you paid a toll therefore can speed because of open lanes is a big, big mistake."
InlandEmpire,3bfd01,tekmonster99,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. We definitely looked into the fastrak thing, but we also noticed that there is a metro that runs from corona...

InlandEmpire,3bfd01,yuckypants,3,Sun Jun 28 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"Also, good point to make. The metrolink is not cheap. It costs about the same as gas PLUS FastTrack. And it doesn't always save time, and it can be late. Also, sucks to have to ensure you will catch it."

OC is not the most friendly city for public transport and the station is a bit out in the middle of nothing. A lot of larger companies provide transportation to and from the station, but not everyone does it.   I like the MetroLink because you can read or do whatever and do not have to think about the traffic or driving. It can be very productive time."

Supporting locally owned and operated businesses means your money stays here, further contributing to the local economy (as opposed to being deposited in a corporate bank account based somewhere else entirely).

I think the biggest issue is there are these huge cities that are inside of 100 miles (SD, irvine/OC, and LA) that become major anchors. Why build a huge plant or put jobs in Riverside if they can just be 65 miles west in LA - one of the largest metro areas in the US?  Living here has a price. And that price is commute. I used to commute from riverside to orange and then from riverside to Claremont. I finally got lucky and work less than 5 miles from home, but I don't get paid what I'm worth. And I know that.

Also you're always on guard because if your numbers start to go lower than what they want you will start to get warnings then infractions.   One thing that's nice about is the money and benefits, they do pay you well and if you're a direct hire and not through smx they give you some stock in the company.

It is vitally important that we maintain eye contact with each other to ensure everyone's safety on the road.  There is a very good reason for a legal limit on front window tint.

InlandEmpire,398d3u,Crayz9000,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:21:24 2015 UTC,"Nuclear density gauge:       A nuclear density gauge is a tool used in civil construction and the petroleum industry, as well as for mining and archaeology purposes. It consists of a radiation source that emits a directed beam of particles and a sensor that counts the received particles that are either reflected by the test material or pass through it. By calculating the percentage of particles that return to the sensor, the gauge can be calibrated to measure the density and inner structure of the test material.  Different variants are used for different purposes. For density analysis of very shallow objects such as roads or walls, a gamma source emitter such as 137Cesium is used to produce gamma radiation. These isotopes are effective in analyzing the top 10 inches (25 centimeters) with high accuracy. 226Radium is used for depths of 328 yards (300 meters). Such instruments can help find underground caves or identify locations with lower density that would make tunnel construction hazardous.  Nuclear density gauges can also be used to measure the density of a liquid in a pipe. If a source is mounted on one side of a pipe and a detector on the other, the amount of radiation seen at the detector is dependent upon the shielding provided by the liquid in the pipe. Tracerco pioneered the use of radiation to measure density in the 1950s and determined that the Beer–Lambert law also applied to radiation as well as optics. Gauges are normally calibrated using gas and a liquid of known density to find the unknowns in the equation. Once it has been calibrated and as long as the source detector alignment remains constant, it is possible to calculate the density of the liquid in the pipe. One factor is the half life of the radioactive source (30 years for 137Cs), which means that the system needs to be recalibrated at regular intervals. Modern systems incorporate correction for source decay.
