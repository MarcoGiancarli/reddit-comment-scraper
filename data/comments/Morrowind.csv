Morrowind,3e0wl8,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,13,Tue Jul 21 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"House Redoran became dominant after the Oblivion Crisis and managed to defend Morrowind, while pretty much all other houses disappeared. Their honor and tradition is what made them strongest."
Morrowind,3e0wl8,VigilantAlexius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:36:03 2015 UTC,"How did they become the dominant house, let alone survive? From what I remember, they resurrected the giant crab their capital building was made of to fight against the Oblivion invasion and they still got crushed. One would think Hlaalu or Telvanni would fare better."
Morrowind,3e0wl8,Axtlar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hlaalu was hated by the rest of Dunmer because it was oportunistic and pro Empire. Hlaalu and Indoril got the worst, actualy. Soon as the Empire retreated Hlaalu lost the power. Same happened to Indoril which was exlusively pro Tribunal house. So with the fall of the false gods fell the house Indoril.  Redoran and Ald ruhn indeed suffered a disaster but if you read the lore, you'll see that Redoran managed to reorganize and become the leading house of the dark elves. If i remember correctly even their city of Blacklight becme new capital of Morrowind. I can't check this right now I'm on the mobile.  Metaphysicaly, their scarab symbol is also somehow important. It is the symbol of unified dunmer. I'll have to reread  lore on this but overal I know that Redoran was the only truly triumphant house of Morrowind after the events of Nerevarine and Oblivion crisis."

Morrowind,3e20y8,Scrubnub,4,Tue Jul 21 10:14:07 2015 UTC,"Well, i only tried the (closed?) beta, and sadly my experiences were different than expected. I guess it's not a bad game, and if i had to choose between it, and WOW, then i guess i'd play this. The big problem is, that it's just not in the design of an elder scrolls game, instead quests are mostly set up in such a way, that they let you collect a number of random items, usually found in a specific area, and then you return, and maby get a little fluff text.  The other problem I had, was the world-design. What the elder scrolls usually shines at, is butchered in this game for size-sake. You won't find cluttered areas, or things that just feel natural at all, really. What you get mostly looks like pavement, since it's designed for hords of people, so you'll find your favourite places, and they look like a bad remake.  I don't want to seem bitter, but that's sadly the experience i've made with the game. That saied, i feel like i would still play the game, if they didn't want monthly payments (and i didn't bother to check if they changed that, since i barely have time to play morrowind :P)"

Morrowind,3e20y8,Nyarlantothep,3,Tue Jul 21 10:59:22 2015 UTC,"I would honestly say not to listen to the negative response ESO got at launch, as the game has come on leaps and bounds since then. I didn't enjoy it at launch and now I can't stop playing it. The stories are enthralling, the world building and lore is amazing. In my opinion it feels more elder scrolls-y than Skyrim. I'd say try it, personally, coming from someone who dislikes MMOs but loves the world of TES."
Morrowind,3e20y8,gingerdeer,3,Tue Jul 21 12:09:59 2015 UTC,"Now that's an interesting thing to hear. I find myself intrigued by this.  How is the population holding up? I know that it's buy and play - no monthly fee now, right?"
Morrowind,3e20y8,hircine1,4,Tue Jul 21 12:47:26 2015 UTC,"No monthly fee anymore, nope. The population is just right, IMO. Can get a little laggy in major cities, but out in the open you can play solo and just occasionally run into other people doing the same quests as you. People are also really friendly in this game, always looking to help others out. One of my favourite parts of ESO is when the dark anchors drop - everyone who was soloing in the nearby area comes along to help, then gets back to their own devices. I recently got involved in the RP community too on ESO which is thriving, events on every night."
Morrowind,3e20y8,letor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:39 2015 UTC,I was skeptical but I've really been enjoying it. You aren't forced to interact with anyone; I'm basically playing the same way I did skyrim. There's a lot to explore and tons of quests and interesting lore. Go for it.
Morrowind,3e20y8,MrTimmannen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:46 2015 UTC,"it is worth it, even though it is just another bad mmo. it contains some memorable quests (sidequests especially), and all of the leveling content can be done solo, just the group dungeons and endgame stuff that requires multiple people.  i leveled one character to vr5 and felt like my time with the game was done, after the leveling experience it becomes very lackluster, and felt mmo 'chorey'. i would return to do the other starter zone quests with other characters, but i've done my leveling with the game. feels way too chorey to return to once you reach endgame. but the leveling is quite fun, and there are some really memorable locations that haven't been visited before in elder scrolls titles. I'd definitely recommend trying it, and starting the Ebonheart Pact faction to begin in the Morrowind zone (most interesting obv)"

Morrowind,3dzblu,DawkTux,5,Tue Jul 21 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"Now with a better, reddit formatted, list:   No world map. (Or cloth map) No using enchanted items that you didn’t make (Aside from items you actually need to complete the main quest such as Keening, Sunder, Wraithguard, and you can use Trueflame). No trainers. No paid travel. No guild chest help (potions and what not). No store bought potions (you must steal them, find them, or make them yourself). No going for good “end game” gear at the beginning of the game (You must naturally stumble across such gear). No exploits or glitches. You can have ONE companion (such as Julan, but you can’t use them to get training/items). No cheats (This should go without saying… but just in case). Mods can be used but they must NOT be mods that give you some kind of starting advantage or otherwise make the challenge less… challenging (Mods like TR, Distant Land are okay, mods that give you super speed [a bit of a speed increase is alright] are not allowed). You can use scrolls you find (not ones for sale, but ones you actually find in caves). No grinding magic or other skills to get levels (I.E. don’t just cast a ton of fireballs randomly or sneak around towns all the time to get levels). No Creeper or Mudcrab merchant Bonus, use NOM, and the campsite mod, and keep a camp going. Tent mods are also alright so long as they are used for sleep/storage only and not fast travel. Extra bonus, restrict yourself to a weapon kind, such as chitin, silver, etc., and do the same for armor. Goals: complete all the GOTY main quests (Morrowind, Bloodmoon, Tribunal), complete one house quest, join at least one guild/temple, but do NOT join conflicting ones (I.E. Tribunal Temple and Imperial Cult, House Telvanni and Mage’s Guild). Role Play the whole way through (don’t do things out of character)."

Morrowind,3e10f6,MyrMindservant,3,Tue Jul 21 04:05:43 2015 UTC,"Do you know how to use Construction Set? It is fairly easy to revert this change.  Anyway, here are instructions: navigate to your Morrowind directory and open TES Construction Set; go to File -> Data Files, there select Morrowind.esm and BTB - Settings.esp, set the plugin (.esp) as active, then load them; after the loading has finished find and open Changes - Settings.txt file that should have come together with the mod, you will see info about changes to flee AI right at the top; now, in CS, navigate to Gameplay -> Settings and there to Gameplay tab; you need to find two records mentioned in the .txt file and revert them (press F2 to edit selected record), their initial values are also mentioned in the txt file; don't forget to save your changes.  Lastly, before you can use your changed plugin file, you need to clean it from GMST Contamination. You can do this with TESTool for example. You can read more about using TESTool here or here."
Morrowind,3e10f6,Liquidinfirmity,2,Tue Jul 21 06:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the reason for BTB doing that in the first place is to give those spells more use, Seeing as they're entirely missable normally. But nah, A cursory search around nexus and MMH don't show that much. There's a good chance that it wouldn't work anyway, Assuming that BTB accomplishes this by increasing the NPC's flee stat, any other .esm that altered it would turn up an error or just cancel one or the other out depending on load order.   I'd advise the official plugin ""Area Effect Arrows"" Some of the better arrows from there will drop ordinary enemies before they get too far away. Or paralyze or damage fatigue. Can't run if they can't move, eh? Oh, But I think you need a particular feature out of the code patch for damage fatigue to work, Otherwise I think absorb still does it."

Morrowind,3dusxh,tyruku,3,Sun Jul 19 19:20:05 2015 UTC,Not to mention that jumping over mountains once you get the levels is way more satisfying than a load screen
Morrowind,3dusxh,eugene171,15,Mon Jul 20 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just a fan of how open the game is. I love the graphics and combat of later games, but the open world and gameplay of Morrowind really make it for me. I love being able to go to Red Mountain at level 1. I love being able to go to Solstheim whenever I want. I love being able to go anywhere. I love every enemy not scaling to me.  Spellmaking/Enchanting is also another major reason I love Morrowind. Being able to make whatever I spell I want and enchant an item however I want (assuming the item can hold the enchant) adds so much to the game. Heck, even being able to rename my potions that I craft with alchemy adds something to the game (I once made a character who brewed tea as a profession)."
Morrowind,3dusxh,MrFahrenheit39,29,Sun Jul 19 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"No stupid levelled bandits in glass armour!  No ""here's that hidden item you never knew about"" quest markers!  Characters have more than 1 line of dialogue!  What little voice acting there is is done with gusto! Unlike some of the crappy, uninspiring voice acting in Skyrim. Seriously Bethesda, some of those voice actors need to be taken out and shot.  Because Guars! Because giant parasol mushrooms! Because there are more than two types of fucking chest/chair/table!  Because, without pre-made responses, you get to decide how your character speaks and what they say! RP done right!  TL;DR - because the developers actually put some fucking effort into it!"

Morrowind,3dusxh,SomeHairyGuy,4,Sun Jul 19 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"Oblivion and skyrim also had great lines like that, you can't discount them for that. Obliviona voice acting all sounded the same though. It was really just bad."

Morrowind,3dusxh,DungeonPlunger,8,Mon Jul 20 11:39:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, having every race of mer sound the same was quite annoying. Otherwise, though, the acting itself wasn't bad (I'm gonna cite the Adoring Fan, Lord Rogbut and Weebam-Na as my examples). That game had some brilliant humour. By contrast, I find Skyrim's voice acting drab and unenthusiastic."
Morrowind,3dusxh,SomeHairyGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:03 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I don't think one should ever insult the voice acting of Wes Johnson. Ever.  If I'm not mistaken, he was the default Imperial in both Morrowind and Oblivion, Sheogorath, Lucien Lachance, The Grey Fox, Hermaeus Mora, and Titus Mede II.  Insult him at your own peril. Some how, some day, no matter where you are, when you least expect it, a guard will accost you and demand that you stop right there, criminal scum.  To quote a guy I once encountered - He deserves awards simply for the passion he put into that single line."

They look like Earth while Vvardenfell, with the giant mushroom trees and Nix Hounds, Guars and Kwama workers, looks foreign and that terrifies me.   Also, it was my first."
Morrowind,3dusxh,SAMUELQQ,10,Mon Jul 20 01:51:11 2015 UTC,"What drew me to the game was that you can do TRULY anything! You can kill the main questgiver, and take an alternate path to beat the game! Like, you can wipe out an entire town without people becoming ""unconscious"" or gasping for air on the floor, both situations ending with the person recovering like nothing.  Eventually you come to realize they did this for ultimate realism; like, some factions actually conflict with each other! Others, disqualify you from joining certain rival factions.  And enemies don't level with you! You can beat the game and go back to the first town, wiping out all the weak animals nearby; or wander into a daedric ruin after character creation! Plus the music is perfect. And levitation/teleportation have me devoted to this game for life. Among too many other things to count..."
Morrowind,3dusxh,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,9,Mon Jul 20 02:29:09 2015 UTC,"It's the little things like the alien landscapes, the hollow, static world that makes me feel like I'm in a book, the ease of placing items, the lore and mythology of Morrowind, it's things like Hainab the pants thief and the poisoned Peek Utchoo. It's how it doesn't matter if you're the arch canon of the temple, you don't get special treatment if you just joined the Fighters Guild or any other faction. It's how you can collect things in the game, you can murder ANYONE including important NPCs. Morrowind will make you a god eventually, but you'll have to earn it."
Morrowind,3dusxh,dragonker,8,Sun Jul 19 19:34:34 2015 UTC,Because what it does right it really does it right. Immersion to another level.
Morrowind,3dusxh,Daaavde,6,Sun Jul 19 22:09:36 2015 UTC,"I love how alien the landscape is and how ""realistic"" the experience feels at the same time. You reach this island being no one. You're not special and no one thinks you are (they actually call you ""scum""). You can start exploring from the beginning the whole world, knowing that behind the next corner there can be a creature ready to kill you in one shot.  I love playing with maximum difficulty, where every stupid mistake makes you dead and you have to ponder every single action. Where even a cliff-racer can kill you in one shot if you're not careful enough and you can't simply storm a dungeon, rushing through the main door and fireballing everyone but you have to careful plan every single move, use every single potion and every drop of magicka left if you want to survive.  Incredibly enough, when you start to get more and more powerful the game doesn't lose interest but it just turns into a different experience.  There hasn't been a single game capable of giving me these feelings after Morrowind."
Morrowind,3dusxh,macbone,5,Mon Jul 20 13:13:32 2015 UTC,"I love the options Morrowind gives the player.  I love the lack of hand-holding.  I love finding a new cave I've never explored.  I love all the mods that have been made and are still being released, adding so many more places to visit and things to do to the game.  I love being able to come back after five years and discovering new secrets and new mods.  It's a great experience, and for me, it's only gotten better with age."
Morrowind,3dusxh,ButthurtSalamiHuffer,3,Mon Jul 20 04:52:37 2015 UTC,"It's open world in a different way than other TES gmes and I think in a truly RPG way. There are multiple courses of action (not necessarily in quests beyond maybe picking sides but it's more than other dynamic game shit where ""branching"" just means different dialogue) and you can actually truly play the game in different ""ways"" if you think enough about it. Like in the other games, it still comes down to fast paced action-y combat, but in Morrowind you can play as a ""glass cannon"" and rely on luck or tactics, a mage with low health can go towards restoration or levitation, both keep you safe. In other RPGs it feels like no matter what, it boils down to a ""numbers game"" and there is no place for strategy or truly doing things a different way. I think it stems from bringing in 'builds' and pigeonholing your character. Because the game doesn't set up so many rules to stop you from breaking it, it feels a lot more open, if your character has some deficiency, there's an item you can use, or a spell, or a potion, you don't necessarily have to rely on what numbers you have for stats."
Morrowind,3dusxh,DungeonPlunger,3,Mon Jul 20 13:21:42 2015 UTC,"Probably still my favorite because it has a unique flavor unlike Skyrim , Oblivion or Daggerfall, although I do still enjoy all of those too.    Also you are not patronized, hand-held or pandered to in the game.  You have to work for everything, even respect.  Finally - I just liked the story of the main quest."
Morrowind,3dusxh,HiImQpas,2,Mon Jul 20 11:47:53 2015 UTC,"I started playing this game when i was 7-8 years old, 10 years ago, and up to this day it's my favourite game of all time. It introduced me to the RPG genre, which i love. The open world and how you play the game, instead of being played by the game really is amazing. One of the things that make me love this game is the story line. I'm absolutely in love with it, the main quest story line is splendid, the backstory of the war of red mountain is breath taking and everything is really well done. Side quests are also amazing, the choice of guilds, and the environment. Many people complain about the graphics, but I find them fitting in the sad Morrowind mood. The land that is cursed, ancient and doesn't like outsiders. You will get called infidel, n'wah and other marvelous names. There's just so much to this game that I could talk for hours."
Morrowind,3dusxh,Nyarlantothep,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:19 2015 UTC,"Originality. Handcrafted world + lore usage makes Morrowind one of the most immersive experiences the gaming industry has ever created. The way the world is populated is in perfect tune with the world design and the populace is interesting and both challenging to deal with: from the factions to the lowest NPC - the web of links is alive.   A plausible, excellent planned and executed RPG mechanic that makes playing in this alien world a sort of bildungsroman. The Morrowind attribute/skill frame offers along with the magic system one of the most comprehensive, enjoyable and flexible gameplay formulas out there. Quests are intriguing and amplified by the lack of handholding. The player basically translated in the realm of the game by the commitment that the game evokes for doing things. Curiosity is naturally called upon because of this, in conjunction with the world design. Even a fetch quest becomes an adventure when dealing with spatial orientation and challenges along the way: ash vampires, tombs, shrines and general impending doom.  As a particular fact, I was always fascinated that Morrowind has a ton of references in game that mirror ancient cultures, various literal movements, archetypes and theories from the real world. Example: The lore presents a blend of world mythologies, sumerian cosmogony, alchemical thought, pagan ancestor worship, rosicrucian mysticism, enochian and goetic evocation and new age chaos magic that I find pretty much irresistible.    The major aspect for which I love the game, which may be seen as a synthesis of the previous points, consists in the fact that Morrowind has so many things to offer. The more you look into it, the more it looks back into you. As such, the ""abyss"" that it represents in terms of player freedom, content, tone, theme and mechanics evoke in the player something that is more than a simple game.   Morrowind is more than a book, or a paiting, a great musical score or an architectural piece. It's all of those and many more combined, which make in turn Morrowind as a mirror that helps us rediscover our own world, by means of exploring and uncovering figments of it in the alien setting of Vvardenfell."

Because I feel that Morrowind truly has the potential to become my favorite. I have not extensively played it, only like 10 hours or so, but even with the few I've seen, I understood it has everything. It has all of the things I loved in Oblivion, and more ; the atmosphere is breathtaking and the storyline seems to be the most solid of all TES games.  So, yeah : next month I'll take the time to play it extensively, and Morrowind will certainly become my favorite TES game."

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 42, I have never touched a cigarette.

Morrowind,3drlbk,Helldamnguy,2,Sat Jul 18 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"Starfire's NPC Additions. Dear god, that. It's like MCA, but better.  First off, it adds reasonable, rather than ridiculous, amounts of NPCs, so it shouldn't kill your framerate as much (though there is still a bit of a framerate hit, since there are a number of scripts to make the NPCs do stuff).  Second, the NPCs have names and are carefully designed to blend seamlessly into the world, so there's an actual immersion value that you just won't get with MCA. On a similar note, the spawn points are actually thoughtfully placed, and different types of NPCs spawn in different areas at different times and, again, never seem out of place; unlike MCA where you'll just be attacked by like a level 20 bandit in the middle of Seyda Neen in broad daylight.  The only real flaw is that hostile NPCs generated by Starfire's NPCs are a bit uncommon and don't seem to spawn in groups in my experience. The main focus is on non-hostile NPCs.  Also I'd recommend Wanderers of Solstheim. It's pretty good and adds random NPCs all over Solstheim (which seems to be a bit neglected by Starfire's NPCs), many of whom have quests or unique conversations, so it is like recurring random encounter scenarios. The only problem is that the NPCs don't have specific names like in SNPC. Rather, they have generic titles like in MCA.  I've never tried Rogues. I'm sort of split on whether to try it or The Hostiles."

Besides, absorb health doesn't get affected by racial destruction resistance since it's a mysticism school spell."
Morrowind,3dqiuy,Franco_Andres,7,Sat Jul 18 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"You should be aware of the racial differences relating to their resistances. For example don't use fire against dunmer or frost spells against nords.   If you're already does that, well. Spellmaking should do it"

Morrowind,3dqiuy,Soarel2,3,Sat Jul 18 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"Why use a fire spell against a flame atronach?  Fire against frost stuff. Frost against fire stuff. Check UESP for the resistances--Undead and Nords are immune to frost, but weak to fire. Dunmer resist fire. Shock is basically universal damage--very few things resist it or are weak to it, pretty much just Storm Atronachs.  You can also use the universal Damage Health, which nothing is resistant to. Just straight up damages them with pure magic, Magic Missile style. I usually end up with a flat 60 points of Damage Health in 20m on target in endgame when I use Destruction."
Morrowind,3dqiuy,livingDaed,2,Sat Jul 18 19:05:04 2015 UTC,I don't got the numbers but the greater fire ball should do more damage shouldn't it?  I normally play without destruction.

I used it to kill daedroth in Gnisis during that early legion quest for saving the orc. Not proud to say that, but I do use it while I'm a low level noob.  Edit: is it 80%? I could swear it's less.

It is basic game design that is not the player's responsibility."
Morrowind,3dh7p0,TheFlyingBastard,2,Thu Jul 16 15:31:36 2015 UTC,Having to decide whether or not you're going to use or not use an item because it is overpowered is going of your way to work around bad game development. Why are you apologizing for Bethesda's fuck up? It is not the player's job to deal with balance issues. How is this difficult to understand?

Morrowind,3dh7p0,celestial1,3,Thu Jul 16 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"Early, unpatched Morrowind was a bit ridiculous. One of the robes or shirts you recovered for a Temple quest has restore health constant effect instead of on use. A unique weapon you picked up in a House Dagoth dungeon did damage ability every time you equipped instead of drain. Then there was the fact that you could get rid of your bounty for free from the Thieves Guild if you asked to remove bounty and you had no gold in your inventory."
Morrowind,3dh7p0,thealmightydru,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting thing about that.  Like I said earlier, I tend to use Vampire Embrace which has a combat bite effect, which (among other things) removes the target's helmet so you can see the animation of blood trickling down the victim's neck.  The reason that's interesting is that when I combat bit the almost-invisible Tavynu Tedran her head appeared, but the rest of her remained hidden. Furthermore, after enslaved her and took the Amulet of Shadows away from her, her body remained hidden.  Which suggests that the real source of the lady's chameleon effect is not the amulet but an unplayable constant effect garment. Can't be the spell though, or it wouldn't partly fail when the headpiece came off. Probably just a robe and hood with a shader built into it.  Not of any practical use I don't suppose, but interesting nevertheless.."
Morrowind,3dh7p0,docclox,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the chameleon isn't due to the amulet. It's ability that is just constantly on, like the invisible person in Vivec. It probably failed on the head because the game doesn't anticipate the head changing, so it doesn't update."
Morrowind,3dh7p0,thealmightydru,3,Thu Jul 16 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"I only recently found it in my current playthough. It really does give a huge edge. I was level 4 when I killed these two. Also that daedroth is non hostile ( I killed it two, found out it was non hostile then felt so bad I used console commands to bring it back). I only use it for dramatic assassinations or ridiculous crime sprees.   A lot of people are discussing how broken this amulet is, and I agree it is broken. I don't really agree with the argument circling this post though about how its not balanced and its Bethesda's fuck up. Its an RPG, at the end of the day the goal of the game is to choose what you wanna do. For instance, I played a conjurer mage once and got the bloodworm helm, I didn't use it because it looks stupid. That's my choice. I wasn't criticizing Bethesda's decision to place this item. Use the amulet or not, use a spell or not, its the main goal of the game, do whatever you want... I like personally that Bethesda's included such broken items. I mean, it adds depth to the world. Of course some NPCs will have ridiculous items they don't know how to properly use. And besides this quest it quite hidden and on the northern edge of the map, its not exactly a reward from Fargoth for his ring. Its a ridiculous item but the aim of the game is do what you want... for me this amulet only heightens my enjoyment as it adds a different method of doing quests. If you don't like it sell it."
Morrowind,3dh7p0,Guerinus,3,Thu Jul 16 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's not like they placed the amulet around Seyda Neen. It's pretty far north and rarely anyone finds it early in the playthrough. Morrowind is such a game that you don't just wander so far away at early levels. So I agree completely that's it's not a mess up. But once you know where is it it's a different story and I used to get it before level 5. I wish unique items are randomized with each playthrough."
Morrowind,3dh7p0,MrMeltJr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I meant about how its not a reward for Fargoth's ring quest. I didn't go to Gnisis, my first playthrough till level 28 so... and if you actively seek it out to use it, you can't blame the game developers for it, you chose to get it yourself. ( I don't mean you specifically, no offence, I just mean people saying that its broken). It would be handy to have randomization but what can you do?"

Morrowind,3dh7p0,docclox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:20 2015 UTC,I head up that way as soon as I'm capable of putting up a decent fight. It's such a useful amulet.
Morrowind,3dh7p0,princerules666,14,Thu Jul 16 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is, they're pretty pathetic when you know what to expect. The first time I encountered them it was terrifying!  I mean, I expected a double cross, fair enough. But when it comes, I'm stuck in a pond that's not especially easy to get out of, Synette Jeline is throwing stars at me and staying out of range, and someone I can't see is hitting me with arrows. And because I'm in a panic, I can't even get out of the damn pond to engage with them. They damn near killed me!  I think that's why the amulet is so OP, incidentally. For that ambush to  work properly Synette's partner needs to be close enough to invisble for the player not to notice her. If you noticed the predator effect going in, the panic value would go right down.  Once you know what to expect though, they're no problem at all.  The last vampire playthough I did, I enslaved Synette, dressed her in a harem dancer costume and had her wait at the end of my bed in Tel Uvirith. Got to be careful feeding on her though - she's surprisingly fragile. I wanted to put her friend on the other side and have a matched pair, but she's one of these annoying NPCs who says ""goodbye"" in their greeting. I can enslave her, but giving orders is problematic.  Then again, there are command spells... maybe next time :)"

Morrowind,3dh7p0,docclox,2,Thu Jul 16 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"Your level really doesn't matter. It's what you go at them with. I absolutely slaughtered them with my level 2 mage. All it took was Firebite (starting spell), Frost Touch (200 gold), and some restore magicka potions (free from the mage's guild chest). If you're able to hit them consistently, they go down easy."

Morrowind,3djc88,raskolnikova,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"I have a couple bumpmapped retextures and all of them started out too bright for some reason -- the file in question is almost always some kind of ""reflection"" dds. When I downloaded the Hlaalu architecture bumpmap, the issue was with a file called ""tx_hlaalu_reflection.dds"" or something like that. I opened that in GIMP and turned down the brightness of the image by about 75-100%, overwrote it, and then the textures ingame looked exactly as they did on Nexus. Try and locate the ""reflection"" file for Cavern of the Incarnate and do the same."
Morrowind,3djc88,raskolnikova,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! Unfortunately it doesn't work. There are 2 textures named Reflection in the mod. I tried turned down the brightness, I even tried making them completely black and deleting the textures altogether. It still looks the same. It seems like it's not rendering bump maps correctly at all. Which is weird, since all the other features from MCP works fine. I have bump mapped Hlaalu installed as well, and it has the same glossy feel. Although not as bad as here, so I just assumed that this was how bump maps were rendered because of MW's outdated engine. But I can see now that there's obviously something wrong here, since the screenshots from Cavern look much different from mine. Well, thank you for your help. Hopefully someone else knows what's going on with my bump maps.  Oddly enough, bump mapped Vivec looks much better."
Morrowind,3djc88,raskolnikova,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:45:17 2015 UTC,The Hlaalu one you can definitely fix that way -- there may be a different texture controlling that overlay/glossiness for Cavern.
Morrowind,3djc88,cml33,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks :) I kinda fixed it, but it's a poor band-aid. I took all the _n textures, which are the bump maps, and replaced them with black textures. It looks much better now, albeit without any bump effect. I guess it's an acceptable loss.  Still looks amazing though. This mod, together with MAO which has unique music play in that place makes entering the Cavern a really special experience."
Morrowind,3dii51,Ch1m3r15,5,Thu Jul 16 15:25:49 2015 UTC,"Julan is not compatible with GHD and for a good reason. Julan, Ashlander Companion is designed to progresses alongside the Morrowind's main quest, while GHD is an alternative to the main quest.

Morrowind,3dipp7,chillianus,7,Thu Jul 16 16:21:18 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I would say the best thing to do first of all is give it a try first of all, see what you like, your weapon preferences, armour preferences, etc. Don't devote much time to your first characters, have a go with lots of different variations. After you have an idea of the game, what sort of character you would like, then have a look at mods relevant to that, instead of downloading every single mod there is out there, then finding you don't want half of them.   Bloodmoon is an expansion that adds an island, werewolves (you can become a werewolf with this expansion), lots of new creatures on that island, and a big quest for higher end characters. I would say it's definitely worth giving a go! Quite a few mods also require Bloodmoon to run (they should say what they require), so make sure to check that before downloading any mods. If you do get Bloodmoon, a key thing is to not go straight to Solstheim with a level 5 character thinking oh hey I can kill that scrib no problem, these other creatures will be fine. They won't, and you will die. A lot. Only play the expansion when you have a high end character, probably from level 20, with very good armour and weapons.   And here are some links, if you have the time to read through them.  http://www.moddb.com/games/morrowind/addons/galsiahs-character-development There is a description on there, but I would say this is definitely a must have mod. http://www.mwmythicmods.com/ This is a list which has all you will ever need to know about modding, which mods you need to get, what you should/shouldn't avoid, etc. Of course you don't have to read through all of it, but if you have time for a quick skim read I would say it's worth it. http://www.mwmythicmods.com/telesphoros.htm This is a list of all the mods you will ever need. (Ok, not all of them, but most of them.) It is the most comprehensive list of mods, and will be extremely helpful when you want to mod it. http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page This is the UESP wiki. This wiki will be something that you need quite a bit. But beware, there are many spoilers on here, so only look at the stuff you want to, unless you want spoilers!  So you don't necessarily have to listen to my advice, and I may not be correct, but hopefully this will give you an idea of how to start, etc.  My key tip: Watch out for cliff racers."

Morrowind,3dipp7,MrFahrenheit39,6,Thu Jul 16 17:09:11 2015 UTC,"If you own the game on steam, it'll have Tribunal and Bloodmoon (the two expansions).  Anyways, before you play the game I recommend upping the graphics. There's two easy options.    Download the Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul (overhauls all the graphics, view distance, resolution, bug fixes, etc) Just download MGE XE (resolution / view distance), Morrowind Code Patch, and the Patch Project   As for playing the game, here are some general tips   MAKE USE OF ALCHEMY - You can steal a master alchemy set easily from the tower in the Mage's Guild in Caldera, or you can just buy an alchemy set. In the temple in Balmora, there is a Dunmer merchant who sells Marshmerrow and Wickwheat (these ingredients make restore health potions). Ajira in the Balmora Mage's Guild sells Willow Anther and Saltrice (to make restore fatigue potions). These ingredients are cheap, so you can buy a ton from the merchants, make potions with them, and sell excess potions back to recoup the costs of the ingredients. You'll always wanna carry at least 5-10 health and fatigue potions at all times. I usually don't choose alchemy as a major/minor skill so that grinding it doesn't level me up too fast. Also, the alchemist Nalcarya in Balmora sells Daedra Hearts and Void Salts (to make restore magicka potions, but this is costly). Stick to skills you're good at. At class creation, don't pick longblade as a skill and then go use a spear as your weapon. You won't hit shit. If you're playing the game and decide you wanna use spear, then you can pay a trainer to level it up to a decent level. Do note that if you swap to spear and it's not a major/minor skill then it won't count towards your level up. KEEP YOUR FATIGUE HIGH - Your current fatigue effects your ability to hit opponents and casting spells. Low fatigue means you will barely hit. You can either down some potions or make a cheap restore fatigue spell (1-2pts for 15-20ish seconds is easy to cast). NOTE WHAT SKILLS YOU ADVANCED FOR YOUR LEVEL UP - Look at the attributes of the skills you've advanced for your level up. On a level up, you can always place 1 point in three different attributes. Leveling up skills under a single attribute ten times gives you 5 points instead of 1 point to put in that attribute. So, if you level up from a bunch of endurance governed skills, have a trainer train you in alchemy and restoration or something ten times each (so you can get 5 points in intelligence and willpower as well). If you are getting your ass kicked, RUN! A good portion of enemies aren't scaled to the player. You can walk into a dungeon with a level 30 vampire easily. If you see that an enemy knocks out a big chunk of your health in one hit, RUN. Also, try to avoid Daedra until your level is higher. If you see scary guys like Ogre-looking-things, crocodile-looking-things, golden women, etc RUN FROM THEM.  Speaking of these Daedra, be careful casting spells on them. Most stronger daedra have a reflect spell on them (which has a high chance of casting your spell right back on you instead of them). The easiest way to deal with them is to conjure your own summon, resort to melee weapons, or using an absorb health spell."
Morrowind,3dipp7,DungeonPlunger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:28 2015 UTC,Thank you!! :D
Morrowind,3dipp7,MrFahrenheit39,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:19 2015 UTC,Will Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul work okay with the Steam version?  I heard it can be awkward to add mods or use the editor.  I'm normally happy with vanilla but it would be nice to Balmora in HD.
Morrowind,3dipp7,DungeonPlunger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:11 2015 UTC,adding mods to steam is super easy. MGSO will work with steam (but it disables steam overlay. worth it imo).   Using the mod editor to make your own is pretty easy when you have the hang of it. Making items/npcs/spells is very easy. I find scripting to be easy (past programming experience). IMO the only hard part is making your own maps cause the editor can be a bit clunky.
Morrowind,3dipp7,TheFlyingBastard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:57:38 2015 UTC,I've used the editor on the CD version before.  I'm kinda the opposite to you though.  I've not got the hang of scripting or quests but I'm not bad at landscaping (although it is a bir clunky).
Morrowind,3dipp7,TheFlyingBastard,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"Are there additionally any mods I should install/ expansion packs or whatever?   If nothing else, install this mod. Your Steam version comes with both expansion packs. One of the expansion packs kicks off immediately, which either gives you OP gear or leaves you dead eating your own guts. With this mod, the expansion pack will start at a time that feels right, and when your character is actually ready for it.  Also might want to grab this mod. It stops the game from spamming ""HAY YOU CAN GO TO SOLSTHEIM NAO"" every time you ask someone for rumours.  Other than that, you're pretty much good to experience the vanilla game.  If you want to deviate from vanilla, someone else recommended Galsiah's Character Development mod. Toss the download he gave you and get this one instead. It fixes a whole bunch of bugs with the original including one that causes crashes or corrupted savegames or some shit."

There's also an ess importer to import save games from Beth's Morrowind engine, so you don't need to abandon the character.  The main drawback is that MWE and MWSE mods won't work, as well as some others. But balanced against that, you have a native game engine."
Morrowind,3dhleg,docclox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:28:44 2015 UTC,How does the import save games from Bth's Morrowind engine work? Like how would it pick up my save file from my seemingly broken Morrowind file?
Morrowind,3dhleg,docclox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:37:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't check right now, but I seem to recall that there's an openmw-essimporter program that comes with OpenMW and which will read a .ess file (Beth's save format) and output the one used by OpenMW.   I can't be much more specific than that, since I never actually tried it.  Are you sure the problem is with the save file? It could be a wine bug, for instance. Can you play an earlier save without problems, for instance?  Even then it could just be a memory issue, which might go away with a native engine.  Another possibility is using Wrye Bash to repair all which will cut down on save game bloat."
Morrowind,3dfoqy,LobstrThermidor,3,Wed Jul 15 22:19:37 2015 UTC,I think most ppl just wait all those days away. I would try to Google if this is a common bug and the console commands to advance the quest.

Morrowind,3ddnfp,TeraOfLoki,4,Wed Jul 15 13:25:27 2015 UTC,Sneaking is actually really fun on morrowind because stealing things for money is extremely lucrative in morrowind since you do not need a fence to sell stolen goods.  Check out the code patch and maybe MGSO but if you install MGSO do NOT select the option to animate containers as it causes many issues in the expansions.  There are not any stealth related mods that I know off the top of my head. You may consider getting the fair magicka regen mod if you are used to magical regenerating BUT I encourage you to eventually embrace Morrowind fully and play without magicka regen.
Morrowind,3ddnfp,deaf42,2,Wed Jul 15 22:00:50 2015 UTC,I think I'll dive in and embrace morrowind without the regen and all the sneaking then thank you

Sneaking is OK, but you need to get some skill before it's reliable. A bit of illusion early and a hide spell will save a lot of grief. Backstabbing works out of the box, and with a bit of marksman skill the game already comes with all the throwing stars, darts and what not you might want.  I'd say just go for it."

Morrowind,3da9sd,OringarTheWicked,26,Tue Jul 14 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"I'll bite with the last character I finished (on a new character now).  Anyways, he was an Altmer Sorcerer named Sauron born under the sign of the Atronach. The Atronach sign means stunted magicka. I opted to quickly join the Mage's Guild on this character. I was casually completing the Blade quests on this character. As the story progressed, I accidentally contracted vampirism. As a result, (using vampire's embrace) my character had a pretty pitiful streak. He was feeding off of bums and drunks in the streets of Balmora. After enough feeding and learning to be a vampire, he became powerful. He took over the Mage's Guild, stole the Necromancer's Amulet from the deceased Arch Mage, and began to spread his influence across Morrowind. Thanks to the Vampire's Embrace mod, my character could get NPCs addicted to his blood and make them slaves/thralls.  I used this ability to subdue the Duke of Ebonheart, Saryoni, and King Hlaalu Helseth. I also converted many members of the Balmora Mage's Guild into my followers. One character of interest who I converted was Divayth Fyr. I used the placeable furniture mod to rearrange the Mage's Guild. I gave myself a nice throne in the back room with some crystals. Ajira was my servant vampire. Divayth Fyr, a Buoyant Armiger in glass armor, and a powerful nord vampire in ebony armor stood watch in my antechamber. The base was loaded with npcs addicted to my blood and thralls. I made the female dunmer mage a vampire as well.   Outside the base, I placed several thralls on duty to protect the base. I also sprinkled a few more vampires around the town.   Vampirism aside, my character became angry with his vampirism. He decided to seek solace with the divines and he joined the Imperial Cult. He found no solace even though he advanced to the top rank in the cult. He searched out other methods to end his suffering. In desperation, he decided to become a lich (lichcraft 2).  My character had a powerful amulet made, gathered ingredients for the lich ritual, and performed the ritual at the stroke of midnight. He was turned into a lich. However, lichdom proved to be an even worse curse than vampirism. With remnants of vampirism still affecting my character, he still had to feed and he took damage in the sunlight. His lichdom prevented him from regenerating health. He could steal the bodies of NPCs to replace his own.   Also, as a lich, he had to disguise his true lich form or otherwise NPCs would attack him. The spell to disguise a lich breaks if the player takes damage. So, it was impossible for my disguise to work in daylight.  At night a few weeks after becoming a lich, Sauron is told from an NPC that the Temple is desperate and needs Dagoth Ur stopped (I had a ton of rep because I completed Tribunal earlier). Sauron talks to Saryoni, talks to Vivec, retrieves the heart tools, and marches on Red Mountain. Retrieving the heart tools and assaulting Dagoth Ur was easy for Sauron. Normally, he'd have to worry about NPCs seeing him transforming into his Lich form. At Red Mountain, he could reveal his true power without fear. Sauron destroyed the Ash Vampires, Slew Dagoth Ur, and stole the power of the heart for himself (using my mod to become a god).  In the end, Sauron became a cursed vampiric lich god. His vampirism made it impossible for him to conceal himself during the day time. His lich form gave him incredible strength at the cost of a constantly deteriorating body (needing to steal a new body every few weeks). His powers stolen from the heart gave him incredible power, and resurrected him in the Heart Chamber when he got close to death."
Morrowind,3da9sd,MrFahrenheit39,2,Tue Jul 14 19:18:01 2015 UTC,Wow . Very nice character . What level was he ?
Morrowind,3da9sd,MrFahrenheit39,5,Tue Jul 14 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"I think around 35 in the end. I grinded him up to 65 to be able to embrace Divayth Fyr with the VE mod. However, the lich mod lowers your level back down to 30 for reasons.  You don't have to make some op vampiric lich god character to have fun though. One time, I made a moon sugar addicted acrobat bosmer. He specialized in marksman and jumping around on moon sugar. Using Morrowind Code Patch, I was able to enchant my throwing weapons. This guy was really fun. He'd scope out all the moon sugar in Vvardenfell. Then, he'd take it home and consume it all. After that, I'd always go on crazy adventures with him.   On his final moon sugar / skooma  binge, IIRC he ended up jumping all the way to Red Mountain, blitzing through the citadels, grabbing the tools of Kagrenac, amping up on more drugs, jumping to Solstheim, chilling with Uncle Sweetshare, hopping across the map into the ocean, dropping one of the tools into the random depths of the ocean, and spent the rest of the time chucking throwing stars at cliff racers. He met an untimely end when he equipped Keening..."

Morrowind,3da9sd,William01833,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:28:40 2015 UTC,"Most of my recent builds have been variations on the theme of Vampire Mountebank. Generally with Madd Leveling and Vampire Embrace and Hunger.  The best of them was probably the original Moriarti. By the time he retired he was around level 45 with a speed of around 405 (including BoBS) a strength over 200, unarmed combat around 170, and more than 140 in acrobatics. He unified the Mages' Guild and the Telvanni, gave Dagoth Ur a good smacking, before bogging down under the complexities of Rise of House Telvanni and Uvirith's Legacy. Eventually I left him in a save game, sat on his throne surrounded by adoring Thralls.  Probably his most memorable fight was outside Tel Branora. I should state at the outset that I play with Clothiers of Vvardenfel loaded. So this particular Tel Branora has a large Telvanni Pod outside the tower, which houses a lingerie shop.  As it happens, I wasn't there for the shopping. I'd turned up to investigate the Dremora female in the basement of Tel Branora (not sure which mod adds that one); I'd been up into the tower to search (unsuccessfully) for a key; and I ended up agreeing, (as you do) to murder Trerayna Delen and her friends who were protesting outside Therana's tower.   So, purely for the hell of it, I thought I'd use the old vampire wiles and even the odds a little by seducing the females away from the group. So I managed to get Trerayna enthralled, stashed her in the shop, and went back for another one. In the meantime however,  MCA spawned a load of outlaws just behind the shop. I must have wandered close enough to trigger them, and they charged. Which wouldn't have been so bad except that whatever I did to Treyrayna Delen must have counted as an attack at some level, because the bandit attack set off the protester group as well. And as if this wasn't bad enough, there were a pair of blighted shalks kicking around who decided to join in the fun. Azura only knows where they came from.  Anyway, I'm fighting three groups, many of them armed with spells or exotic arrows.  Standing still would have meant getting skewered, so I chug a strong restore fatigue potion, hit ""always run"" and basically start circle strafing around the lingerie shop, spells and arrows streaking off into the night behind me.  I loop round until I catch the back of the group, land a few punches on Tail End Charlie, and then zoom off again for another circuit.   I keep on doing this, circling round the shop at high speed, stopping to go paf-paf-paf whenever I find one of them that seems isolated from  the group, and leaping right over everyone's heads if a group blocks my way. It's a fun tactic because the AI can be quite reassuringly slow to react to high speed or mid-air maneuvers and you can often run up behind someone and land a few blows while they're still thinking ""where'd he go? where'd he go?""   Slowly the mob thins out until what remains is scattered thinly enough for me to deal with them normally. Then I go back into the shop. The plan is to pick up Treyrayna Delen, march her up to see Molimo of Cloudrest, and then drain her dry while he watches. (Just a bit of RP - that way he knows the job's been done). However whatever script triggered the protesters outside has undone my thralling and the moment I enter the shop, Treyrayna goes for me. I could probably subdue her and get her back under control, but it's been a long night so I just kill her. Sometimes simplest is best.  Of course, then I had the rather harder job of collecting up all the armour and weapons and carrying them to a buyer. Time for a super-strength potion then off to the Zainab camp again..."

Morrowind,3d9upj,MrFahrenheit39,6,Wed Jul 15 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"What class did you choose? That'll help us give you advice.  Regardless of your class, you need to pick up alchemy.  If you go to the Caldera Guild of Mages, there's a set of master alchemy equipment in the tower. You can get to the Caldera Guild of Mages by foot or by using a Mage's Guild teleporter. Steal the master alchemy set. Now, go to Balmora. In the temple in Balmora, there's a merchant who has a restocking supply of Marshmerrow and Wickwheat. Keep buying these ingredients until you run out of gold. When you run out of gold, it's time to make some potions. Equip the Master's Mortar and Pestle. Select Marshmerrow and Wickwheat as your ingredients. Mash the make potion button until you run out of the ingredients. Sell as many potions back to the merchant as you can to recoup your gold loss. After that, your alchemy skill should be at a decent level. Now, you can buy more Marshmerrow and Wickwheat. You can sell off some of the potions you make to the merchant in order to mitigate the costs of the ingredients. I always keep a big stockpile of both ingredients (500+ each) in my house and use them to make potions when necessary.  From your character, it sounds like he's more combat based. So, you shouldn't have to worry about making restore magicka potions (they're costly to make anyways). Just in case, you can grab Daedra Hearts and Void Salts from Nalcarya, the alchemist merchant, in Balmora.   Ajira in the Balmora Mage's Guild sells crab meat and eggs. These can be used to make restore fatigue potions.  Since your character seems more combated based, you should just focus on nabbing the alchemy equipment in Caldera, getting ingredients from the Balmora Temple, and from Ajira. That'll give you a supply of health and fatigue potions.  Now for general gameplay tips   Try to max out endurance as fast as possible. When you level up, your health bonus is determined by your endurance stat (health raise = endurance/10). Meaning, a higher endurance stat means more total health gains. Sucking in a fight? Get drunk. Most taverns have a restocking supply of Sujamma. This wonderful drink boosts your strength by 50 and lowers intelligence by 50 for 60 seconds. The great part? You can drink as many as you want and get the buff each time. If you're facing a real tough enemy, pregame with some booze. Drinking five or six Sujamma will net you around 350 strength. On the downside, you can't cast magick while drunk because your intelligence will be 0. Only use weapons that you have high skill in. If you're good with long blade, don't use short blade. It's not gonna end well for you. If you really want to use short blade, have a trainer level up the skill for you. Make use of enchanting! You can get some pretty dangerous enchants on your weapons. Paralyze is a great cast when strikes effect. Make sure your fatigue isn't empty! Your fatigue factors into your ability to hit npcs and your ability to cast spells. If it's low, you've got a significantly lower chance to do both of these things. Keep it raised with potions, enchants, and magic. A restore fatigue 1-3ish pts for 15-30ish seconds isn't too hard to cast even if you are a warrior type. Worst case, throw that on an enchanted item."
Morrowind,3d9upj,dylanrush,2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"I'm on my first play through. I'm a level 13 or so nord barbarian but I never did any of this stuff. So some of my major/minor skills are almost maxed out, and it would be hard to level if I'm sitting around making potions all day. Any tips on how I can level efficiently, increasing my INT, END and maybe Willpower? My axe skill is maxed but maybe ill take up blunts."
Morrowind,3d9upj,MrFahrenheit39,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:00:19 2015 UTC,"maybe ill take up blunts.   Face those blunts  Anyways, alchemy isn't hard to start. It takes like five minutes to steal the gear, five minutes to get a good amount of ingredients, and then it's just mashing the make potion button. You could set up your health / fatigue potion making in under 20 minutes.  My easiest level up advice is to raise one major/minor skill by ten levels. Then raise two misc skills by ten levels. Pick the correct skills, and you'll get 5x in 3 attributes on level up."
Morrowind,3d9upj,docclox,2,Wed Jul 15 03:10:24 2015 UTC,"It's worth spending some money and training alchemy up to 25 if you're not very good at. The training is cheap and you'll level a lot faster. After a certain point you can sit down with Ajira and buy training, and then buy crab, hound meat, cuttle and scales and pay for it by brewing either Restore Fatigue or Water Walking potions and selling them back to her. That's also a good way of getting competent  with conjuration and enchanting too."

I know a lot of lore so that won't cause any issues with my understanding of the game.  I'm just new to Morrowind, but I know the lore behind it."
Morrowind,3d9upj,AtomFlower,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"Tips specifically for someone coming from Skyrim:   Fatigue affects EVERYTHING you do, including combat, spellcasting, bartering, speechcraft, alchemy, enchanting, jump height, etc.  And the effect is extremely high (you can go from around a 75% chance to hit with full fatigue, to a 25% chance with empty fatigue).  Carry restore fatigue potions and keep the bar full at all times. Enemies don't scale with your level in Morrowind.  That means, until you level up some areas are going to be just plain off limits until you get better skills/stats/gear.  In general, difficulty follows the general trend: animals/surface enemies <  dwarven ruins < bandits < ancestor tombs  < sixth house bases < daedric ruins.  There are some exceptions to this, but if you follow this trend you should be ok.  If you can't kill something, it's usually best to leave (teleport out if you can) and come back when you've leveled up a bit. There's no fast travel, so you should learn the basics of travelling in Morrowind.  Silt striders, boats, and Mages Guild guides will take you where you want to go, for a price.  Almsivi Intervention will teleport you to the nearest Temple shrine, and Divine Intervention will teleport you to the nearest Imperial Shrine.  Mark lets you set a custom destination, and Recall will teleport you to the spot you marked.  Using these effectively will let you travel pretty much anywhere quickly.  Additionally, if you're a skilled mage, Jump 100 pts for 2 seconds + Slowfall 1 pt for 20ish seconds will let you launch yourself great distances."

My character had alchemy as a major skill, so I decided to have some fun with my potion creation and naming. I ended up with all these oddly named teas. It was fun selling them across the land and having a massive stockpile."
Morrowind,3d83u6,lame_corprus,3,Tue Jul 14 16:10:44 2015 UTC,"That looks like a fun build.   Thoughts: Are you a scholar first and foremost or a trader?  Trader is going to be tricky. You can make a profit trading with the merchants if you get your mercantile up, but you're just shuffling the existing stock around.  Nothing wrong with that from an RP perspective, of course, but the danger is that you'll end up either stealing books and going the full thief route, or do a literary Indiana Jones and start raiding tombs to rescue the books in there.  Actually, both of those sound quite fun, but anyway...  If you're thinking more scholar, then you're probably more interested in reading than owning or trading. In that case there's a good argument for doing the main quest. I've often thought the overthrow of Dagoth Ur was as much a feat of scholarship as it was of valor, might or magic. The Mages' Guild  has a lot of scholarly quests as well.  In fact I'd join just about every faction going, just to get access to the libraries. (I mean you can walk into most places and start reading anyway, but that's not really the point :)) The main exception is probably the Morag Tong for obvious reasons. And you probably wouldn't progress in the Fighters' Guild since that involves far too much unnecessary killing.  Great Houses is a tricky one. Telvanni would be good so you can cultivate the likes of Dyvath Fyr and Baladas Devnamenni, but they're somewhat less academic than the MG and I can see that being off-putting. I could see the piety of House Redoran appealing, but they're also the most martial of the Houses, so probably not a good fit. In fact, probably Hlaalu with their mercantile focus is the one to join."

Occasionally she turns to me and asks if she can help me.   -After awhile I summon the nerves to explore around ugly little rock town.   -Whenever I find cool shiny trinkets I leave them on Galbedir's desk.

Still she stares blankly ahead as if she cannot hear me.   -Accidentally pick up a limeware platter without moving the stuff on it.  -Excitedly try to show Galbedir my skillz  -Galbedir is screaming and throwing punches.  -I've been expelled from the Mages Guild.  -I've got a 40 gold bounty.  -Enraged, I cut the stupid bitch with my Fang of Hynakhemetakhanakulaket  -She lets out a final OOF as she falls to the ground.  -I grab the rest of her shit, loot her corpse and bail.

Morrowind,3d4rds,Soarel2,2,Tue Jul 14 04:35:55 2015 UTC,How did the Chimer survive? Azura's curse was pan-Chimeri.
Morrowind,3d4rds,KK-Rider,2,Tue Jul 14 04:29:33 2015 UTC,"Good question! The Chimer in Lyithdonea are part of House Azura which is the modern manifestation of the ancient priestly tribe which led the Velothi in worship of Azura. They were spared from the curse as an example to the new Tribunal-led nation. This led to House Azura being severely ostracized by the Dunmer above simply being a representation of the old ways. This is when Azura helped them make the move from Morrowind to Lyithdonea to await a time when the Dunmer would be ready accept the Daedra again (Reclamations).    As a side note, in the lore which I have created for this mod, there was also House Mephala and House Boethiah. The former eventually evolved into the Morag Tong and the latter has faded into obscurity, but some speculate that they infiltrated the highest echelons of Dunmer society to stir up change through deceit and conspiracy."
Morrowind,3d4rds,MrFahrenheit39,2,Tue Jul 14 12:21:37 2015 UTC,Were these Great Houses or not?
Morrowind,3d4rds,dreaddy,2,Tue Jul 14 12:53:44 2015 UTC,No. I've tentatively called them Minor Houses. But I don't like that term so much so I don't always use it. They were more like the Tribe of Levi from the Old Testament. The Priestly Houses.
Morrowind,3d4rds,pianobadger,2,Tue Jul 14 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"Also note that if you subscribe to MK's lore, House Azura isn't the only group of Chimer out in the Padomaic Ocean.    http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1327126-towards-a-dragond-sea-cathnoquey/"

Some textures can still be optimized which should improve performance further.    This mod was playtested with a MSI GE70 Apache Pro-012 (laptop) and I got playable FPS.

Morrowind,3d4rds,crucifigo,2,Tue Jul 14 12:59:47 2015 UTC,I'm hoping to optimize the textures ASAP to reduce the file size and improve performance (most models have already been optimized). I was planning to post an update when that goes out.

What gets me excited is the effects if you fail to cast. You can really expand on this. I come from a 'roguelike' background and think you could draw some great inspiration from these kinds of games. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has some great miscast effects that you could implement:  -Confusion would be an interesting one to play with (randomly moves you, inability to direct spells/attacks) -Glow/Magical Contamination (short term attracts more aggro, potential here to fit in with your diseases system via mutation) -Random teleport (scalable so anything from short range uncontrolled 'blink' to random dungeon/worldwide teleport) -% chance to summon hostiles instead of friendlies  I really like the idea of opposite magnitude but on it's own, this could become a little predicable. I think it's always more fun when you don't quite know what the result will be :D  Looking forward to further updates from you on this project!"

Morrowind,3d6hyr,caniculaprioralba,3,Mon Jul 13 22:18:03 2015 UTC,GCD is probably the cause of many of your crashes. Even the optimized versions of it aren't totally stable.
Morrowind,3d6hyr,JadisGod,2,Mon Jul 13 23:27:10 2015 UTC,"GCD is specifically script-heavy.  After external executables, script-heavy mods are the highest source of crash"
Morrowind,3d6hyr,Kramalimedov,3,Tue Jul 14 00:14:55 2015 UTC,Mods with poor scripting are the cause 99% of the time. MGE (XE) is extremely stable. MWE unfortunately not so.
Morrowind,3d6hyr,JadisGod,2,Tue Jul 14 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, so would Madd Leveler be the best alternative then? (I just can't handle the default leveling system).  I will mostly likely use MGE-XE, so that includes MWSE. Although, I've heard it might be better to use MWSE separately and disable the one in MGE?  Also is MWE v1.6 ok (the ""latest""), or is it still pretty wonky?"
Morrowind,3d6hyr,MehraMilo,3,Tue Jul 14 01:57:39 2015 UTC,"Although, I've heard it might be better to use MWSE separately and disable the one in MGE?   MGE XE's version of MWSE causes crashes for some people, but not for others. (I've never had an issue with it, for instance. My theory is it's not MWSE itself, but some mod or other that doesn't get along with MGE XE's version of MWSE. Which would explain why it's not a universal problem.)   So if you think it's causing CTDs for you1 , then yeah, give the standalone version a shot.   Personally I don't recommend MWE at all; some people have had good luck with it, but the general consensus is it causes more crashes than it's worth.  1 Best way to test this would be to disable all mods that require MWSE, disable MGE XE's internal MWSE, and then start a fresh save and run the game for a while. See if the crashes stop."
Morrowind,3d6hyr,docclox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:12:03 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'll have to try using the non-MGE XE version and see if that reduces my problems
Morrowind,3d6hyr,Kramalimedov,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:29:08 2015 UTC,Avoid MGE-XE and any external executalbe is the first step to optimize stability
Morrowind,3d6hyr,MehraMilo,3,Mon Jul 13 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"MGE XE is perfectly stable, so long as you don't go beyond what your PC can handle in terms of shiny graphics. And other external executables like the Morrowind Code Patch actually improve stability. In MCP's case, by leaps and bounds. As in your install's far more likely to crash without it.  The 4GB patch is the only one I'm not sure about, and that's only because I've never run into a scenario where Morrowind's gotten anywhere close to the default 2GB RAM limit. And I use enough mods to make Todd Howard cry.   I do use it for Oblivion though (where I actually need it), and it certainly improves stability there. I'm just not convinced that it's really necessary for Morrowind."

Morrowind,3d6hyr,docclox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere on here that MW just leaked memory and was going to crash sooner or later whatever you did. So I found an auto-save launcher.   I also turned the MGSO plant life right down (all that Vurt ground cover just got in the way anyway), got rid of animated morrowind and pulled teh scripting mods back to the essentials. Still crash, but the game went from ""unplayable"" to ""mildly annoying"".  I find sleeping (in game) seems to help. Maybe the game does some cleaning up around then.  I've also seen suggestions that staying in one area during a playthough will help. It's probably true: I tend to use fast travel and teleportation like a rapid transit system and the more I zap around the place, the greater the chance of crashing when I stick my head out of doors."

Morrowind,3d46bl,sklopnicht,12,Mon Jul 13 11:24:06 2015 UTC,"I mostly enjoy cRPG of the types of Baldur's Gate, Wasteland 2 or Shadowrun: Dragonfall. I haven't played much first-person RPGs. I have a good deal of hours in Skyrim which I wasn't overly impressed with and from what I can read it seems like Morrowind might be closer to others cRPGs.   Probably. There's a lot of old pen-and-paper RPG mechanics under the hood with Morrowind.   Combat was a bit too much of a hack'n'slash feel to it for me in Skyrim. Even as a spellcaster. While it seems many people hate the combat system in Morrowind, is it correctly understood that Morrowind has more complexity going on behind the scenes?   Oh yeah. Most of the complaints are about the fact that you can swing and miss. Because your hit chance depends on a number of factors. That said, Wearing heavy armour and slugging it out nose-to-nose can get pretty tedious - a fighter in Skyrim has more options. On the other you can have a lot of fun with a skirmisher/monk/nightblade build.   The quests was boring, unteresting and most dialogue was very poorly written in Skyrim. Is Morrowind better in this regard? Is it on par with Baldur's Gate writing or close?   It's a while since I played BG, but I think you'll have a good time with the quests and dialogue. Lots of cool stuff to do.   I am sort of alergic to storylines of you being ""the chosen one"" and of course Skyrim was very much that. And the main story was the least interesting. How is the main story in Morrowind - without too many spoilers?   Well ... all TES games have you as the hero of prophecy, and there is a certain prophesied role for the PC. But the game leaves you free to embrace that role, reject it or ignore it. You're never told who you are, just who the world the thinks you might be. At the end, even the Big Bad isn't sure.  The main story, apart from that, I always found interesting. It's pretty relaxed about pacing; you're encouraged to do your own thing and let the story emerge as you play, rather than being constantly spoon fed. The stages are well written and varied and I found the eventual resolution satisfying.   It's also got a bit of a learning curve to the game; a lot of different ways to play through the game; no quest markers (just directions which vary immensely in quality) and lots of excuses to get lost or stumble across interesting caves, ruins, shipwrecks and the like.  From what you say, I think you'll probably like it."
Morrowind,3d46bl,docclox,8,Mon Jul 13 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"Your post makes me think that you will love Morrowind if you can get past some of its quirks. It even feels like you already know what you are getting into because I would answer ""yes"" to all of your questions.  Edit: And since other people have specifically mentioned the ""chosen one"" thing, I want to give my take on it. The answer to this question is both yes and no at the same time. You are told that you are the one, but most characters in the game do not treat you as such. By this I mean that you don't get recognition out of thin air, you have to earn it. And even at the end many things remain uncertain and open to interpretation. The game's world and its story are not back and white, rather there are many viable points of view on past events and your role in the current affairs. That's one of the things I like the most in Morrowind."
Morrowind,3d46bl,MyrMindservant,3,Mon Jul 13 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"I played the game for the first time yesterday and I had the exact same thoughts as you, I just had to buy the game and force myself into it. If you don't like hack'n'slash I would not recommend playing a warrior in morrowind since that is very much of a hack'n'slash.   The story is very well written and the dialouges are quite funny and unique, and you aren't playing as the ""chosen one"" like in skyrim. I mean you have been chosen but it isn't like everyone praises you, you're just some random and nobody seem to give a fuck. Correct me if I'm wrong tho since I've only played the game for about 8 hours.   But I love it and would recommend you to just give it a shot. If you wanna get it for steam I would recommend getting it from kinguin instead of steam since steam thinks that it's resonable to sell a 13 year old game for 20 euros."
Morrowind,3d46bl,Xillio,5,Mon Jul 13 11:59:31 2015 UTC,theres WAY more dialogue. but you have to read it all.  in a way that shows how much more in depth the game is.  theres like 3 or 4 times the amount of joinable guilds / factions  And they each have questlines over double the amount of typical guilds in skyrim (or at least it feels that way)  if you can get past the old graphics and the oldstyle combat its a much better game.  Its just frustrating when you dont know what youre doing (me still after playing casually for over 10 years)
Morrowind,3d46bl,JoEyyB,2,Mon Jul 13 11:46:10 2015 UTC,you are the choosen one in morrowind but you have to become the choosen one which is actually a rather interesting thing to do because you never quite know if you're really fullfiling a profecy or if you're just some random dude who had the luck of being perceived by others as the choosen one  morrowind's world is far more diverse and cramped with stuff than skyrim.  combat in morrowind sucks. playing pure mage can be mechanically entertaining sometimes though  quests aren't much better than skyrim's/ there's a lot of fetch quests but there's also a lot of interesting and unique things to do
Morrowind,3d46bl,asdknvgg,2,Mon Jul 13 17:23:03 2015 UTC,"Morrowind ""chosen one"" story is much more different than Skyrim. Morrowind's is far more in depth and, in a way, believable, than Skyrim's. It follows the more traditional messiah story, think of Jesus in this way.   It's far more interesting than ""I'm the chosen one, kneel before me""."
Morrowind,3d46bl,Sigourn,2,Mon Jul 13 18:37:53 2015 UTC,"Morrowind is different from other cRPGs like Fallout and Planescape: Torment (if you haven't played FO 1 & 2 and PS:T, you owe it to yourself to do so ASAP), but I love the world that it creates.  As others have said in this thread, the main quest is complex and open to interpretation.  The great thing about MW is that you don't have to follow the main quest if you don't want to.  There's all kinds of quests to do for your great house and guilds, or even from travelers on the road.  (If you do any modding later on, check out the Less Generic NPCs mods, LGNPC, but do play the vanilla game first).  The combat isn't very exciting, but it is skill-based in that your PC will grow in prowess throughout the game.  Combat is one of MW's weak areas.    MW does deal with the Chosen One trope, but again, are you really?  Maybe so, maybe not.  There's ambiguity there.    The writing is not as good as BG, unfortunately.  It's not bad, really, and because there's very little voice acting, there's a lot more dialogue, but the best writing is found in the gamebooks.  I don't know how many you read in Skyrim, but I highly encourage you to read the different books you come across.  For good or ill, the best stories in MW are in the in-game books.  One of MW's strengths is the diversity of environments and the feel that you're in an alien environment.  Mushroom houses, flying jellyfish, swamps, grazelands, mountain peaks, the winter of Solstheim - the islands, though small, are quite diverse.  Give yourself a good 5-10 hours to check the world out.  Explore Seyda Neen, or take a silt strider to Balmora, or head off cross-country.  Stock up on Almsivi or Divine Intervention scrolls in case you get lost.  Talk to people, join some guilds, do some quests.  It's a world I find myself returning to again and again."

It sounds like Morrowind may be the game for you.  You will have to be patient at first (while you struggle to get your skills up) but you can really do almost anything you set your mind to.  It's probably quite cheap on Steam by now so it won't hurt to try the game anyway.  Good luck, outlander."

If you exceed Level 20 AND have 50 reputation or more (which is very much achievable by sidetracking the main quest) you'll bypass two stages of the Main Quest. If you've haven't finished the Main Quest once, then I recommend watching your reputation points to get the full experience. If that's not the case, then feel free to do what you want. It's perfectly fine. The bypass really saves a lot of time for powerful characters at that point."

Morrowind,3d1q3w,MrFahrenheit39,3,Sun Jul 12 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks to input from you guys, I've decided to rework the mod. Now, it will feature two paths. The first path is to steal the power of the heart for yourself. The second path optionally occurs once you steal the power of the heart. Dagoth Ur will bow before you in service and ask that you spare his life and he will help you create Akulakhan.  The God Path  This path focuses on your powers as a god. When you follow this path, you become powerful and the center of attraction.  +200 health  150 in all attributes  Access to the God-Place  Ultra powerful god spells  High Resistances (35% to elemetnts, 20 pts reflect, etc)  The God Sword and the God's Mortar and Pestle  Craft your own artifact (greatsword/bow/staff)  Powerful buffs in the God-Place  Clear your bounty and conjure gold  Be loved by the temple  Travel to the God-Place upon ""death""  Many other bonuses  Akulakhan's Path  This path focuses less on your own divinity and more on using the divinity as a tool. Down this path, you receive less stat bonuses and less powerful items. However, you are able to resurrect Akulakhan, create powerful minions, and perhaps even your own Heart item.  +200 health  115 in all attributes  Access to the God-Place  Powerful god spells  Resistances (15% to elements, 5pts reflect, etc)  Weaker God Sword and weaker Mortar and Pestle  Learn how to create powerful ash and dwemer minions  Very weak buffs from the God-Place, but powerful buffs when you touch the heart of lorkhan.  You are vilified by the temple! But who cares when you can teleport Akulakhan to major cities and call down an orbital strike.  Travel to the heart upon ""death""  Misc Random Feature Ideas  When you take the soul of Vivec/Almalexia to a shrine in the God Place, a permanent buff is applied to your character along with access to a special spell for each.  The ""God-Place"" is going to be a weird, mish-mashed version of the island. You're gonna always be levitating in the God-Place. There's fragments of the island scattered around. You'll see a canton from vivec, telvanni towers, maybe a silt strider, the balmora watch towers, the seyda neen light house, and you'll see ""ghosts"" of some famous npcs. Exploring the God-Place will give buffs to your character.   Be back in a few months I suppose :p  The God Path won't take too long to finish. It's already mostly done since I just have to make a few tweaks to it. The Akulakhan Path and the God-Place are going to take a bit longer though. I can probably whip up a nice God-Place in about a week. The Dagoth Ur quests shouldn't take more than a few days. Minions and Akulakhan are going to be a bit of work though.   Edit: To give a idea of how the minion crafting for the Akulakhan path is going to be, this is how it will work. When the player activates the Heart of Lorkhan after activating Akulakhan, there will be an option to ""create minion."" The player will be able to select one of the following minions provided they have the proper items.  Ash Minion  Ash Salts x5 Corprus Weepings x3 Lesser Soul Gem x1 Bonemeal x5  Greater Ash Minion  Ash Salts x10 Corprus Weepings x5 Common Soul Gem x1 Bonemeal x5  Ash Vampire  Ash Salts x20 Corprus Weepings x10 Greater Soul Gem x1 Bonemeal x5  Greater Ash Vampire  Ash Salts x30 Corprus Weepings x15 Grand Soul Gem x1 Bonemeal x5  Heart Dwemer Spider  Scrap Metal x5 Emerald x1 Lesser Soul Gem x1  Heart Dwemer Sphere  Scrap Metal x10 Emerald x2 Common Soul Gem x1  Heart Dwemer Centurion  Scrap Metal x20 Emerald x2 Greater Soul Gem x1  Heart Dwemer Archer  Scrap Metal x20  Emerald x3 Greater Soul Gem x1 Steel Arrow x20  Heart Dwemer Steam Centurion  Scrap Metal x30 Emerald x5 Grand Soul Gem x1 Diamond x5"

Constant Effect levitation, which you can toggle on and off (cast and dispel). CE Water breathing.  I don't know if this is possible, but a spell that can resurrect dead NPCs.

Yeah, it's by all means going to take away most of the difficulty. I'm tweaking the resistance perks so that the game is easier, but that it's still possible to die (well be teleported to the heart chamber since the player can't really die).    Constant Effect levitation, which you can toggle on and off (cast and dispel).  Constant Effect levitation, which you can toggle on and off (cast and dispel).    This is a really good idea! Currently, I just have a high power 60 second levitation spell on the player. Making a toggleable levitation would be doable and better alternative.    I don't know if this is possible, but a spell that can resurrect dead NPCs.    I don't think this is possible without MWSE. Every mod that I've seen which involves resurrecting dead npcs has used MWSE.    All Temple-affiliated NPCs have 100% disposition no matter what you do. This is another good suggestion. I could make it so that when you become a god, it automatically raises your rank in the temple / your disposition with the temple to the max.  All animals are non-aggressive.    Another interesting idea. I'll have to look into making this one happen.   Thanks for all the input you gave."
Morrowind,3d1q3w,MorrowindVoiceActing,2,Sun Jul 12 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, Vivec isn't really all that powerful. He's relatively easy to kill, except for a having a ton of live. The thing about that is, that if you kill him (lore wise at least) he has the option to respawn, until which time he is in some sort of god-state. If you want to keep the game playable, I'd really like to see some possiblity to go into this god-state, and flying around a frozen-in-time Vvardenfell, where you can't do anything, without anything on you, and when you decide to return to live, it could load a save you created when the player died, create a body WHERE he died, which holds all his stuff, and spawn him back at red mountain, with some ""basic"" stuff. It would really make the game feel very darksouls-like. Idk if loading/saving is possible through scripts, and stuff like that, so that part might be hard to implement, so you might just send the player to a ""timeless chamber"" where he just had the option to stay there, or respawn. The reason Vivec isn't as strong as one might think, is of course, that he's protecting the Ghost-fence. But you could make the player swear an oath to Dagoth Ur, so that he lends HIM his power, to bring down the fence, and stuff like that, therefor making the player more powerful, but not really give him god-strenght. So you could make it possible maby to change what you wanna be powerful at, by going to the hearth, and choosing an attribute, which would then give you a blessing. You could also maby make it possible to set respawn locations, where you just wouldn't get any stuff, and give the player a spell, that is a modified version of Devine Intervention, that teleports the player to Dagoth Ur, who could be a quest giver, to build the Lorkhan robot, and find recruits or something. I think that would be really cool, and should also be possible modding-wise, and would keep the game playable."
Morrowind,3d1q3w,MorrowindVoiceActing,2,Sun Jul 12 20:52:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to keep the game playable, I'd really like to see some possiblity to go into this god-state, and flying around a frozen-in-time Vvardenfell, where you can't do anything    Gah, I really like this idea. I was thinking of something similar to this actually. I was thinking of creating like a chamber for the player to spawn in instead of the heart chamber when he dies. However, your idea is great. It'd be way too much work to create a ""ghost"" version of the entire island of Vvardenfell. However, it would definitely be possible to create a wacky god world based off of the island. It would be pretty easy to make a dimension-like area, add famous morrowind buildings/npc ghosts, and add a constant levitate to the player while there.  One of my ideas for the god-state area was to harshly cut the attribute bonuses I have initially given to the player. Currently, the mod raises player attributes to 250. I might change it so that the mod raises the attributes to only around 125. The player could then find a shrine / npc ghost in the god-place to talk to that gives a temporary (24 hour) higher bonus to an attribute.   Also, I could definitely place a version of Vivec in this god-state.  Having the player go to the god-state when they die or when they cast a spell would be pretty simple. Maybe also give the player the ability to mark a custom location to go to once they leave the god-state.    create a body WHERE he died, which holds all his stuff, and spawn him back at red mountain, with some ""basic"" stuff. It would really make the game feel very darksouls-like.    I'll have to think about this one. I rather like the idea of the player's body being gone. As in, if I get killed, my loot stays on my body. How far should this be taken though? Should the player keep their currently equipped items? Should the player forget their spells? Either way, I'll always have the player spawn with their god spells and god sword.    But you could make the player swear an oath to Dagoth Ur, so that he lends HIM his power, to bring down the fence, and stuff like that,     This would be something interesting to look at further down the road for the mod (once I get god powers, spells, perks, and the god realm all set up). Interactions with the gods would be interesting. Perhaps when the player subjugates the heart, I could make it so that Dagoth Ur throws himself before the player and begs for mercy. Dagoth Ur agrees to serve under the player. I could make a short few quests involving him where the player completes Akulakhan. If I do go this route, it'd take some time. The only way I can see myself making Akulakhan doable is by placing him on top of Red Mountain. I could give the player a spell to teleport to the center of Akulakhan. There could be a few buttons on Akulakhan by the heart. Buttons to teleport him to the major cities, to launch an attack, and to give the player a buff. It'd be doable to turn Akulakhan into a machine that can teleport to the cities (and most likely) doable to have him launch blasts at the cities.  Edit: Assuming I do make the Dagoth Ur / Akulakhan thing an alternative you're right - there'd definitely be some nerfs to the player's godhood.  I'd still allow the player access to the god-place, but they wouldn't be as powerful. Most of the heart would be used  by Akulakhan. The player would get less powerful god spells, less powerful attribute buffs, and less resistances. However, the player would have access to a giant teleporting robot which can nuke all the towns. I'd also probably add a power to the player ala fallout new vegas which allows the player to call down an orbital strike level blast from akulakhan once a day. The player could also get a temporary power buff by touching the heart (I'd make this a layer of effects actually, one that lasts ~12 hours, one that lasts ~24, and one that lasts ~ 72 that way the player's power buff seems to ween over the days)"

However, MacKom has yet to upload Bosmer Redone, so I recommend using the Female Bosmer and Male Bosmer plugins of Better Heads for that. Instead of CanadianIce's Robe Replacer, use Better Robes.

Spoilers past the fifth prophecy: Meeting Vivec is ridiculously awe-inspiring the first time you do it - you, once a nobody, meeting a living god. Having had Almalexia as a questgiver will lessen that.   Also the final battles in the Morrowind main quest are considerably easier than those in Tribunal, so it may feel like a let-down. Lore-wise you can play Tribunal until you've completed the Barilzar's Mazed Band quest: after that events will not make logical sense."

Morrowind,3cze8w,Fjoergyn_D,5,Sun Jul 12 07:16:06 2015 UTC,"I actually don't know any people from Macau.  It's far more common to meet someone from Singapore, Korea, or Japan.  People from Macau share a similar background with people from Hong Kong.  Both places are former European colonies, both use Cantonese, and both have their own laws separate from the mainland.  It seems like people from Macau and Hong Kong are very similar, although Maucanese are more laid back.  They'd definitely find it easier to gain acceptance in Hong Kong than almost any other group, including Singaporeans.  It seems to be far harder for mainland Chinese."

Morrowind,3cy5cp,insidiom,4,Sun Jul 12 20:41:24 2015 UTC,PC is best for the creation kit but I think there's some issues when using 360. Original XBOX is what I played on 12 years ago. #Nostalgia.
Morrowind,3cy5cp,nmagod,0,Sun Jul 12 01:48:12 2015 UTC,"The Xbox version I played for a hundred hours or more.  It's been awhile.  I recently got it again and it plays just like I remember.  I played the 360 for around ten hours, about 6 months ago.  The Xbox has better gameplay performance, meaning the Xbox is smoother.  Overall gameplay is good because the game is made for the system.  360 is slightly more choppy - but I really saw that more in objects drawn in the distance and moving.  However, it has slightly better load times.  It's distracting to me, too.  Distracting enough, anyway.  On the Xbox, after a lot of gameplay, the initial save loading time gets really long to correspond with the size of the save file, I guess.  Loading zones also becomes really dicey as the game freezing happens a bit as the hours stack.  If I had the choice, and I do, I'd play the Xbox version.  I've played the PC modded version for about 5-10 hours - my old gaming pc was an older P4 and it struggled, so I didn't stick with it.  I hear it's great, but that's not on your list.  So Xbox.  :)"

To my eyes, it was rampant brown, ugly character models, and lots of jagged edges.  It was one of my barriers to playing the game, along with the combat--and remember, this was before Oblivion.  I'm a Nintendo gamer at heart so when I think 2003 graphics, I think The Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine, Metroid Prime, etc.  Morrowind was a shock to the system, in that it looks ""worse"" to my eyes at a very basic level.  I can still see why I thought it was muddy and lacking in clairty.  At this point, while I do use MGE, I love the vanilla graphics as well.  Not really sure what time did for them, but they don't look ugly for me anymore and it's very easy for me to get drawn into and lost in the world when I'm playing vanilla.  I think actually playing the game and delving into its lore gives you an appreciation for the world design which you can't have by just playing it for a few hours.  The water always impressed me, though."

These go great with Rise of House Telvanni (following the literary convention of italicizing major works) to take over Morrowind completely. And then (being Telvanni) you'll have to to do the whole Uvirith's Legacy/Building Up Uvirith's Legacy thing. And if you're fairly proficient at installing mods, you gotta try The Underground (with its various fixes).  Further ideas along similar lines: http://www.mwmythicmods.com/evil.htm#Vampire%20Mods.

If your system isn't monster like mine choose NO MGE option and you'll get the aforementioned enhancement and high resolution but just miss out on some performance eating mega graphics.  Edit: If its honestly just resolution you want, you can do that in your registry with no mods, just Google it."

Morrowind,3crs1v,shelbon22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:28:46 2015 UTC,I tend to just think of it as part of the roleplay experience.  That's probably what your character wants too and can't understand the attitude of his fellow dunmer.    Eventually you can earn their trust and respect but like everything in Morrowind it takes some work.

Morrowind,3cnzvn,refrigeratorbob,7,Thu Jul 9 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"I'd take the suggestions from other players here. Make it so that you have to ask a certain amount of NPCs about the guar. Once you've asked enough npcs, you can begin to track it down.  Also, maybe make it so that there is a reputation requirement before being able to fight the guar. People won't want you to go fight it unless your reputation is high enough because this is the evil guar which ruins boots and summons cliff racers.  I'd make the reward for killing the guar something silly. You know, like an item called Runed Boots with an effect like this:    Slowfall 1 pt  Fortify Speed 20 pts  20 pts jump  Restore 1 pt Fatigue    You could also make it so that the Guar drops a couple unique guar skins with like 4x the normal alchemy strength value."

There are two named Guar ingame who are involved in two different quests, A house Hlaalu one, Rents and Taxes and A Man and His Guar. I think. Maybe, later on in the quest people will tell you to seek out his two lieutenants who maybe turned their backs on him because of how corrupt he was becoming, they could give you info themselves (via dialogue if that's possible? - Rollie can be talked to in vanilla) and you could persuade them to join your cause ( although they're weak as hell so maybe a stat boost) .

You come across unique NPCs that just hate that guar, you find strange pairs of dirty ruined boots around town.

Not as complex as it might look and certainly worth your time.  Morrowind is (at first) harder than Skyrim and not as dumbed-down, so there'll be a bit of a learning curve, but just remember to grab some healing potions ('restore health' potions), watch your fatigue and keep a scroll of Divine intervention handy. Feel free to ask us any questions!"
Morrowind,3conpw,SomeHairyGuy,4,Thu Jul 9 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"Use weapons and spells that your character knows how to use.   Keep your arms and armour repaired.

Don't be afraid to buy some training."
Morrowind,3conpw,docclox,3,Thu Jul 9 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"These are all excellent tips.  Just to add one more:  Keep your fatigue bar full! Fatigue affects everything you do, from landing a swing, to spellcasting, to persuasion, to lockpicking.  The main reason people think Morrowind is so hard is because they try to get in fights with no fatigue, and they can't land a hit to save their lives.  Rest up, and carry restore fatigue potions."
Morrowind,3conpw,tman_elite,6,Thu Jul 9 22:04:51 2015 UTC,"Pick from the class list, as they're more balanced and probably would be more beneficial for a new player, instead of making a custom one. I'd advise choosing a class and race that fit together. For example, a stealth Nord build won't really go hand in hand. Also, choose a play style you want to use the whole game, because it's difficult to level your minor skills if want those up (trainers could help, but are expensive early on)."
Morrowind,3conpw,StarBat57,6,Thu Jul 9 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"Picking a class with synergy is best for a first playthrough. You can get creative, but try to take advantage of the classes.  High elves make excellent mages. A High Elf with the Atronach birth sign and a proper class starts with ~300 magicka. Plus, you automatically get 50 pts of spell absorption with the Atronach sign.  If you want to do something more obscure, like a nord mage, use the advantages of your race. Nords have a natural resistance to frost, so you should try focusing on using frost magic as a nord. Some enemies have an effect on them called reflect which has a chance to knock a spell right back at you, so playing as a class with a high resistance to the element you're using is smart.  I'm going on and on about mages, but if you do choose to play as a mage, you're gonna wanna level up your alchemy skill fast. Health and magic potions are essential. The dude in the Balmora Temple sells both ingredients for health potions.  Weapon-based classes are much easier. Just stick to your major/minor skills. If you are proficient with long blade and heavy armor, don't try using light armor and daggers. It won't end well."

Morrowind,3conpw,MyrMindservant,2,Thu Jul 9 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"Something no one else has said yet is that fatigue (or stamina) is much different than in skyrim. It affects nearly everything you do and when your fatigue is low, you suck at everything.  Also, running depletes your fatigue so if you're having trouble, have some patience and walk a little bit."
Morrowind,3conpw,deaf42,3,Thu Jul 9 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"Also, no matter your class, a restore fatigue spell is cheap to make an easy to cast. If you're a warrior, you probably won't be using magic much, so casting a restore fatigue before combat is easy.  Just make sure the duration is 15+ seconds. The restore value doesn't have to be too high. Just make it so that you're about to cast it and so that it can last."

Carry healing and fatigue recovery. Watch your fatigue. Use equipment and abilities that correspond to your skills (or acknowledge that you're a newbie and expect those results).

The mod gives you abilities in factions when you rank up. Ie in the mage's guild you can order people to go collect ingredients for you. In some guilds you can request guards. You can expel and promote guild members. You can train guild members for gold. You can hire thieves from the thieves guild to steal for you. You can hire DB assassins. As a high ranking temple member you can have people arrested and executed. As a high rank in the imperial legion you can make arrests and request guards. Completing the Main Quest, which bestows a title upon you in the base game, comes with perks in Antare's Big Mod as well.

Morrowind,3conpw,MrFahrenheit39,3,Thu Jul 9 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"Well, Antare's Big Mod isn't too game changing. It just gives meaning to factions outside of completing quests for them. If you join a faction and feel like it's lacking after finishing the quest line for a faction, try out Antare's Big Mod. It'll keep you interested in the faction because you'll actually be running it a bit (promoting, sending people on errands, etc).  Anyways, if you're looking for graphical mods then you can go two ways. The first way is MGSO. It really ups the graphics, but you sorta need a strong computer to run it. I've used MGSO a few times, but I tend to uninstall it because it changes the graphics too much for my tastes.  The second option for graphics is to go get some graphic/model enhancing mods yourself. This way, you can keep the art style closer to the original game if you're so inclined. If you go about things this way, I'd recommend downloading the Morrowind Graphics Extender. It increases your view distance and resolution. It's included in MGSO. If you don't wanna go MGSO, the easiest way to find graphic mods is to just look on the Nexus."
Morrowind,3conpw,shiftplusone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:01:59 2015 UTC,"Counterpoint: There's no reason not to use MGSO as it is an installer for a collection of mods. You can choose what you install or don't install. You can also install mods on top of MGSO. The only drawback is the initial overwhelm if you aren't familiar with the mods you are being asked to select from.    If for whatever reason you don't download and run the installer for MGSO, at least download MGSO and see what it installs. At the very least, install the bug fix mods and MGE. There is no advantage to playing Morrowind using its default resolution options.  From the heart, there is no reason not to use MGSO.    I would also write that there is no reason not to use Antare's Big Mod. I understand what you mean by wanting to play the game as the developers had intended, but this is probably better described as, what the developer had time and budget for. Morrowind has been around for an extremely long time and, within that time, advances have been made that probably would have been included in Morrowind had it been possible.     Generally speaking, the Morrowind/TES community respects the original intention and vision of Morrowind and has no desire to make profound changes. The effort is mostly focused on improving the experience while having a deep love and respect for the vanilla game.    This is an excellent description of Antares Big Mod from /u/NamelessWastelander:    This and I'd like to add that privileges and services you're offered make game much less tedious and easier to play while at same time boosting roleplaying, immersion and believability. That's what makes the mod so good IMO.    From this thread:    https://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/2qs6k3/whats_the_big_deal_about_antaress_big_mod/    I would also download the Morrowind Official Add-ons:    http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Official_Plug-ins    I also want to add that there are many exploits to be had in Morrowind that do not require mods. A big part of the fun of Morrowind is discovering and using these exploits. I won't spoil them for you, but they are there waiting for you to discover them.    You will probably encounter some initial frustration with rolling a hit on enemies. Welcome to classic RPG gameplay. You might be a bit frustrated with it at first. It's a very old-school approach to RPGs. Once you understand the game and its mechanics, you can roll a new character that rarely misses, from your first moments stepping off of the boat in Seyda Neen.    Many parts of the game aren't leveled, so, expect to take some punishment. You'll eventually level-up and leveling-up is extremely rewarding in Morrowind.    Your initial walk-speed is tediously slow. You can take the Steed sign if this is an issue for you.    Morrowind has great replayability. With each new character build, you will have a new experience. More so than in newer TES games, such as Skyrim.    Aside from the AD&D roll to hit style combat (which I personally love), the terrible journal system, and the multiple Fed-Ex and escort side-quests, Morrowind is a fantastic game. You can easily end up playing it on and off again for a decade or more."

Morrowind,3cn8iz,luckadletz,4,Thu Jul 9 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the layout is pretty good. Only problem is when I'm using the item menu because the mouse is kinda weird when being emulated by a joystick."

Morrowind,3cji59,MrFahrenheit39,2,Wed Jul 8 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"Doing such a thing seems possible in the current engine, but it would be a boatload of work, most likely wasted - you'd need to create several copies of every single enchantable item in the game and have (quite possibly) hundreds of scripts running all the time, checking your items and stats, while slowing the game to a crawl (or simply crashing it). And of course every gear-adding mod would need to have a patch to work with the system."
Morrowind,3cji59,Mordimer_Madderdin,3,Wed Jul 8 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, peeking around in the OpenMW code, setting the enchant success to always being 100, and setting the number of available points for an item equal to the enchant skill would be pretty easy.  Beats overly-complex workarounds with the CS."

Morrowind,3cji59,Mordimer_Madderdin,2,Wed Jul 8 20:32:40 2015 UTC,With the new MWSE updates a mod like this is quite doable and wouldn't have too much of an impact on performance.  Enchants can be modified in place and GMSTs can be modified on the fly as well. It would only need to run when you first initiate the enchanting process so it wouldn't even make any noticeable lag.  That's not to say there wouldn't be a lot of effort involved. :)
Morrowind,3cji59,JadisGod,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:36:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer, I think that in the meantime I will just create a fortify enchant 100 ring to wear when I enchant stuff, and I will impose myself not create anything whose enchant level surpasses my enchant skill.  A little bit more complicated, but would still do the trick."
Morrowind,3cji59,LynxOfTheWastes,2,Wed Jul 8 23:29:02 2015 UTC,"Still won't be able to enchant jack shit. 500 minimum for low end enchantments. High level enchantments require you to buff int instead, up to around 1200. Note that having your enchant skill at 110+ causes all enchanted items to cost 1 point per use, regardless of its strength. This could potentially lead to you being able to rapid fire 600 spells, each with enough power to kill a room full of ordinators in less than a second."
Morrowind,3cji59,CycloneX5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:37:55 2015 UTC,"Not exactly what you want, but have some mods which make enchanting a viable skill.

Morrowind,3cg556,Magnusc0r3,4,Tue Jul 7 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if you check out any other conversation, that adds/changes a quest, you'll see how that works.

He's a Dunmer, which I love and are very rare in Skyrim (same with Altmer: I only kill bandit mages and Thalmor, every other Altmer is a precious treasure), and he's a proud Imperial (as am I). Plus, he's pretty useful with a few of the mods I have for the Grey Quarter"
Morrowind,3cha6k,Soarel2,2,Fri Jul 10 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I knew that was the guy you meant. Just taking the piss as I find it ironic how people love to use Rolf & his antics as an example of how all Nords are racist, while blatantly ignoring how some of the Dunmer (Ambarys comes to mind, guy can't stop mentioning his hatred of all things Nord) are massive bigots.  Rolf is the sort of guy whose absolute dedication to drunken shenanigans is almost admireable. I can't simultaneously take the guy seriously and stay immersed when he spends literal hours every day yelling obscenities at the top of his lungs.  I wouldn't say Dunmer are very rare in Skyrim; they're one of the more numerous non-Nord races (especially if you include Solstheim)."
Morrowind,3cha6k,lapzkauz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't include Solstheim. I was talking about Skyrim the region, not the game + DLC.  Ambarys hates Nords due to what they're doing to his race. He's decrying a bigoted society by lashing out."
Morrowind,3cha6k,Soarel2,2,Fri Jul 10 03:15:28 2015 UTC,"Bit ironic of a Dunmer to be decrying a bigoted society, no? :)  And what exactly are the Nords (however we choose to use that term, as it includes a multitude of vastly different people) doing to his race?  Giving away a quarter of a major city to foreign refugees - in a medieval-esque universe with no UN, no refugee quotas and no international obligations, nonetheless."

It's kind of rubbish and if it means that much to him, he's welcome to it.  Mind you, lately I've been forgetting to even give it back. I find it in my inventory around level 12 and think ""I must give that back, the next time I'm in Seyda Neen..."""
Morrowind,3cha6k,docclox,3,Wed Jul 8 07:26:56 2015 UTC,"I'm probably too paranoid or overanalyzing things but sometimes I wonder is there a reason why did the developers forced player to a test of morality soon as he makes a first step in the game. Fargoth is everyone's first NPC and his question about the ring is first thing they hear. I don't count Census office of course.  Decision we make does not change any aspect of a game and yet, I always know that Divines do manifest on Nirn. Imperial Cult arc proves that."
Morrowind,3cha6k,StevenMulraney,5,Wed Jul 8 07:42:55 2015 UTC,"Giving Fargoth his ring back boosts Arielle's disposition towards you in the tradehouse, meaning he gives you better prices, which is useful if you're going to hang around Seyda Need a bit.   There's also the Hiriskar Flat-Foot quest that lets you rip him off anyway without losing the benefits. (I think... I know LGNPCs has Arillie tell you off if you take Hriskar's quest, but I don't think there's any negative effects).  So I guess they're trying to lead the player to realise that:   Being nice to people can have benefits If you're going to rip someone off, there's often a clever way to do it.   Of course, once you've played enough characters, the lessons get ingrained and you stop thinking about it."
Morrowind,3cha6k,docclox,2,Wed Jul 8 07:52:01 2015 UTC,"I def ripped both him and the guard off.  When my character gets balls ass rich, I'm gonna go back, put 400 in the hollow log, and trick the guard into a fight."

Hundreds, maybe even close to a thousand after all these years, definitely more than any other single-player game I've played, almost more than any game period. It may very well be, but I don't have the Steam version so it doesn't keep track for me. I wouldn't be surprised if I was pushing a thousand hours if I'm including the Xbox version and all the times I've gone back to the PC version over the years.  TL:DR Fuckloads   Also, how's the replay value ?   If you can't tell by the fact that many of us have spent literal weeks in the game, the replay value is about as good as it gets for a single-player game. Even after playing the game for more than 10 years, I'm still finding things I've never seen before and trying new play-styles that I've never tried out before. There are still things I haven't tried at all. And don't even get me started about mods.   The replay value of this game is just insane."

Imagine what they could have done with openMW. It doesn't have to be small to recreate the atmosphere, it can feel like MW without the fog of war. The fog of war just helped turn a small island into a massive country. Why not just have a massive country from the start?"
Morrowind,3cg5yd,baked_jedi,3,Tue Jul 7 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"Good point. But even if you have a massive country, it's still possible to make it feel bigger. I suppose I won't keep the view distance unnecessarily low: I can see how it can make the experience worse, and it's not really necessary to do it at this point because I've got a big world already. But if I get lazy, I've got a backup :)  One of the areas I have designed already is very mountainous and foggy -- it wasn't to make the world feel bigger but I suppose I can keep that :D"
Morrowind,3cg5yd,ThalmorInquisitor,3,Tue Jul 7 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"That's an old game dev trick. Silent Hill was pretty much built on exploiting that: they could only spawn monsters close to the player due to engine concerns, so they made this fog very close to the player, conveniently making the rather small and simply designed town confusing and large because you can only see a little of it at a time while outside."
Morrowind,3cg5yd,Nadarama,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:40:58 2015 UTC,"Why not just have a massive country from the start?   Because they had limited time to develop the game, and it already taxed most computers in its day. Remember, they first planned to make the whole province of Morrowind, not just Vvardenfell.

Morrowind,3cg5yd,tman_elite,2,Wed Jul 8 16:00:42 2015 UTC,"A word of warning: from what I've heard Unity has trouble with open world games. IIRC, it can't 'unload' textures, only 'delete' them. So, if you were to walk from Seyda Neen to Vivec, loading foliage and NPCs along the way, your options would be to either leave them loaded(gobbling memory) or delete them(they'll NEVER appear again).   Disclaimer: I'm not a Unity programmer, I only know this from reading the blog of the developer of FRONTIERS. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/railboy/frontiers-explore-discover-survive/posts/810403  Granted, this post is a year old, so maybe Unity allows unloading of assets now. Good luck to you, and I look forward to seeing what you come up with."
Morrowind,3cg5yd,MrTimmannen,2,Thu Jul 9 22:58:30 2015 UTC,"Alright, I've done some looking around and it seems that Unity does unload textures from memory. The condition is that textures will only be unloaded if they are not used, which means that the objects they are attached to are also destroyed. This shouldn't be a problem - if the textures aren't being used, that would imply that the object is too far to be loaded anyway, so I'd have the game destroy it."
Morrowind,3ciafm,nickthedrummer22,3,Wed Jul 8 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"Check your Morrowind.ini, make sure both Tribunal.bsa and Bloodmoon.bsa are listed under the [Archives] section. If Bloodmoon isn't there, that's an error with installation. Maybe adding it to the ini will work, I don't know, the install might have left out other things too, so maybe try installing outside of your Program Files folder (e.g. C:/Morrowind/).  If push comes to shove you could always extract the files from the .bsa and stick them directly in the Data Files folder (the ""folder structure"" of the bsa is the same as Data Files: a Meshes folder, a Textures folder, etc., it's just packed in an archive). Morrowind will definitely pick up on the loose files. If you have any texture replacers you will want to extract the bsa first and then overwrite the files with your replacement textures.  Also, not related to your issue here, but since you have 75 mods, I'd recommend running mlox to double-check the load order, and to make sure you haven't missed any compatibility patches or whatever."

Morrowind,3cexww,MrTimmannen,2,Tue Jul 7 13:05:49 2015 UTC,The importance of fatigue is lost on a lot of people. I feel like that's the majority of the difficulty most new players face.
Morrowind,3cexww,Sigourn,2,Tue Jul 7 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem is that running decreases it and in most other games running is the default way of moving.  As much as I like the idea of having to conserve your energy for battle and run instead of walk, I always get incredibly bored at how slow the walking is and how long it takes to up your speed.   I usually end up enchanting something with restore fatigue so I can run and jump everywhere."

Morrowind,3cexww,NEREVAR117,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:47:09 2015 UTC,"True story: I was working on a Death Alternative plugin for Skyrim a while back. So to test it, I had to get my character killed. You wouldn't believe how hard it can be to do that.  I'd start a new char with LAL, and walk into a bandit fort with armour or weapons. The trouble is, I seem to be pathologically unable to just stand there and let them kill me. So usually I'd end up walking back out again, with a load of loot. I tried setting the difficulty to Master - still couldn't get myself killed.  Eventually I set up a test cell with a Steam Centurion in it, just so I had something I was sure could kill me. I should have thought of frost tolls though. That one on the 7000 steps is a real pain"
Morrowind,3cexww,redditrules54,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"Really? I find those two (more so Oblivion) to be pathetically easy. I have to crank the difficulty to max to actually get a proper challenge out of them.

Morrowind,3cg0xl,HitmanQc,7,Tue Jul 7 16:59:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't like the overhaul. A lot of the textures are too heavy for my tastes. Vanilla is fine if you increase view distance.
Morrowind,3cg0xl,sennalvera,6,Tue Jul 7 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. Use MGE XE to increase the draw distance to 3 cells and set the fog end distance at 2 cells. Increased view distance, no enemies popping in view and still have the foggy Morrowind vibe."

Morrowind,3cdvzx,KingKaiGaming,8,Tue Jul 7 03:44:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the map scale really doesn't work well for this sort of thing. The city of Vivec takes up most of the sea it's built on, and it's more trouble to get from Sadrith Mora to Tel Fyr than it is to get from Vvardenfell to the mainland in some places.  But rescaling everything would be a massive job, and I don't suppose many want travel times on foot to increase. Just one of those things, I guess.  [edit]  Just to explain a little: Morrowind the province is supposed to be about the size of France and Germany combined if memory serves. But if you open TESCS and look at the map then going from the number of cells in the grid and from the scale of the actors, then Vvardenfell is about 12 miles by 12 miles. So the land in the game is a lot smaller than the territory it's supposed to portray"
Morrowind,3cdvzx,docclox,6,Tue Jul 7 06:02:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is true of a lot in the Elder Scrolls games.  What we're seeing isn't really the ""reality"" of what's there, according to TES lore.  For example, the Imperial city should be much bigger than the one we see in Oblivion.  There should be much more farmland everywhere.  This is what a ""realistic"" Balmora would look like..  And in every game, the playable area can be walked across in a matter of hours despite them ""really"" being the size of real life nations, which would take days to travel.  Basically we as players have to accept that the games show us not what's ""really"" there in the TES universe, but a version of what's there, put through two filters: time and resource constraints, and what makes for good (fun) gamplay.  Nobody wants to spend a full real life day walking through the countryside, and the developers can't realistically produce a ""realistic"" sized nation, with all its land, buildings, and characters."
Morrowind,3cdvzx,tman_elite,4,Tue Jul 7 07:43:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. Although I can't help but wish that one of the projects to create an up-to-date Daggerfall engine would bear fruit. That game was designed on a 1:1 scale. I'd love to explore that landscape with an engine that let me see what I was doing.  Also, slightly off-topic but I'll throw it in anyway:  http://www.projectmanager.f2s.com/morrowind/Tamrielx2/index.html  Basically doubles the size of the world in Oblivion. There are downloads to the tools used as well, although I doubt they'd work for Morrowind without some tweakage."

Morrowind,3ccy7i,princerules666,19,Mon Jul 6 23:03:49 2015 UTC,"I really liked how in the early game, there were certain regions of Vvardenfell that felt totally inhospitable. Every journey through these regions felt like a a dangerous expedition that you had to prepare for. Leaving town and heading into them was harrowing and returning to base a huge relief. Finally, once you levelled up, you felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that you had mastered the environment.  Skyrim (although an amazing game) lacked this element."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,threalseymourskinner,5,Tue Jul 7 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem with Skyrim is that most of the regions are too similar. I can tell where I am based on the weather, terrain, etc. but they are all just variations of ""Cold Landscape"". Even on my first walk from the starting town to Balmora, I quickly found out that I could easily fight off whatever rodents I encountered, but it was still terrifying passing through some places just because of how threatening the terrain was."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,Tofulord,5,Tue Jul 7 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"Morrowind rewards you for exploring, as opposed to Skyrim. In Morrowind, you can find very powerful items just because you felt like entering into that unassuming cave.  In Skyrim, only powerful items you will get for ""exploring"" (read: getting dragged into a quest for no reason) are Daedric rewards that basically are telling you before you do them ""this is going to be worth it""."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,Sigourn,4,Tue Jul 7 12:41:02 2015 UTC,Not just that but in Skyrim they punish you for finding such items early by giving you a weaker version that locks you out from ever getting the strongest version.

With Oblivion they horribly failed when trying to 'correct' this. To be fair it's not easy to balance an open game like tes."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,JCsquared2,12,Tue Jul 7 00:25:02 2015 UTC,"Many of us here love the fact that morrowind has this unleveled world, as it leads to a much greater sense of achievement. However, many more casual players dislike this and prefer the leveled worlds of oblivion and skyrim where anything can be beat at any time, because instant gratification is just much easier and sells far more copies."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,Soarel2,14,Mon Jul 6 23:08:53 2015 UTC,Morrowind isn't unleveled. It's just that Oblivion and Skyrim leveled everything while Morrowind only levels some things. Oblivion did leveling poorly while Skyrim and Morrowind did it well.
Morrowind,3ccy7i,DirtDog13,5,Mon Jul 6 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"Oblivion was definitely the worst at levelling, but Skyrim wasn't MUCH better. As a player you could still conquer ANY area in the entire game from level 1 and easily.  That's where Morrowind is different. There are areas that are designed to be reached by the player at later times. They almost want you to go and try at like level two. Get your ass kicked and come back later.   There was a sense of difficultly to Morrowind and exploring. There were kick ass items scattered throughout the world that were ready to be taken if you could get to them. Whether thay be a sword hidden in an alcove of a ruin in the ceiling or a piece of armor underwater after fighting some powerful enemy.  I remember one of the first times I played morrowind. I traveled to the Sheogorad region. Loved the city of Dagon Fel. Went to visit the Dwemer ruin next door. Got my ass kicked in. Went to the countryside. Ogrim. Ogrim Everywhere. And a golden saint or two.  Finding a way to complete the area or getting stronger to succeed were fundamental to Morrowind.  You can literally blow through Oblivion and Skyrim by refusing to level. As none of the games force you to level, you can avoid hitting the level screens (or sleeping) to keep everything at a certain level. With morrowind, refusing to level is going to put you at a disadvantage later in the MQ and also in factions.  Skyrim was closer to morrowind in the levelling style for the environment. There were definitely harder areas. But they also had a tendency to get harder with you...until you ""cleared them."" Once cleared they stay at the level you cleared.    The loot style in both Oblivion and Skyrim hurt. There was nothing better then finding the Sword of White Woe right off the go in Balmora or Suran in Morrowond. In oblivion and skyrim they handicapped exploring and what you could find.  Daedric enemies carried ""Dremora"" weapons instead of Daedric...until a certain level.  For me morrowind had a much higher risk - reward than the other two."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,docclox,3,Wed Jul 8 15:49:22 2015 UTC,"Many of us here love the fact that morrowind has this unleveled world, as it leads to a much greater sense of achievement. However, many more casual players dislike this and prefer the leveled worlds of oblivion and skyrim where   You reckon?  I've seen lots of posts lament the way Oblivion and Skyrim scale with you. Not just here but on boards discussing those games too.  I don't think I've seen anyone complain about the way Morrowind does it. (There's a few ""this game is hard"" posts, but that's rarely a complaint), and the only post defending they way Oblivion does is yours just now.   because instant gratification is just much easier and sells far more copies.   I mean I think you nailed why they made the change. I'm not sure that it worked all that well."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,MorrowindVoiceActing,11,Tue Jul 7 05:30:41 2015 UTC,"Well, that's not really true though. Morrowind is, to a large extent, leveled. There are, of course, parts that aren't, and those parts are much more extensive than in the other games (if they do exist at all), but the majority of enemies you will encounter are leveled. That's why you'll see atronachs and so on, as you level up, as just another random enemy, when wandering the world. What the unleveled parts DO mean, is that you can obtain quite powerful gear very early on in the game, with sometimes just a view enemies to pass by, or ones that are even leveled, to protect unleveld loot. So that causes you to be able to take this loot (as you would), and fight the LEVELED monstered with your UNLEVELED loot, giving you a huge advantage, and leading to the demigod you'll become sooner or later. I wouldn't call myself casual, and jet dislike this systhem, since it has many weaknesses. A full on unleveled world would feel underpowered though, after you've met the thousands cliff-racer, that you can beat up with one hit or zap at this point, and the mixtures isn't the holy grail eather. So I personally prefer the leveled world of skyrim, where only wit will give you the advantage over your opponent, and the leveling, in effect doesn't make you ""stronger"", but more specialized, in comparison to your opponents."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,sennalvera,3,Mon Jul 6 23:22:28 2015 UTC,"I will admit, the scaling in Skyrim is pretty well done.  The main issue I have with the way they did it in that is the dragons... the fucking dragons.  If there were ancient dragons flying around as frequently as pre-Jiub cliffracers, civilization would just cease to be.  There was a mod (mighta been just bundled with Skyre) that leveled Skyrim by region, which I thought was a cool idea."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,anteloop,3,Tue Jul 7 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, was that the one where the Rift was pleasant and fluffy but an Ice Wolf would shred you like paper? That was a good mod. I developed a real fear of snow."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,anteloop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:02:38 2015 UTC,But that hard work put into scaling was wasted when you encounter an Epic Master Super Saiyan Dragur in a tomb with a load of normal Dragur and spiders.

Morrowind,3ccy7i,Franco_Andres,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"There is no risk, like you said just reload the game. My point is that in Morrowind it was immediately obvious when a dungeon was going to fuck you up, but very often the dungeons in Skyrim were the same until you got deep, or until the mini-boss.  I self-impose restrictions otherwise there is no difficulty and your can just reload anything, that's a personal thing though."

Morrowind,3ccy7i,Shnatsel,4,Mon Jul 6 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"That's only a problem in oblivion, skyrim does have a lot of scaling but at the higher levels you end up very powerful and at level 1 you can't kill much more than bandits and wolves."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,Azkik,0,Tue Jul 7 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"However, many more casual players dislike this   Fugging casuels am I right"
Morrowind,3ccy7i,Shnatsel,8,Tue Jul 7 08:22:01 2015 UTC,"Morrowind is deeply flawed on a mechanical level (being able to exploit the game to become filthy rich within the first 30 minutes of gameplay, for example) but it is a clinic on world building.  Oblivion's world was literally created using a generator during development.  Morrowind feels like an actual believeable place.  Morrowind is great too because of the lack of required voiced dialog.  NPCs can have far more to say then just ""I SEE UR A FOLLOWER OF THE GRAY FOX!!!!1"" et el.  I love all the Elder Scrolls games, but Morrowind is my favorite just because of how alien and atmospheric the world is."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,tman_elite,2,Tue Jul 7 13:36:19 2015 UTC,Morrowind leveling system has its flaws too. On the higher levels you are pretty much a demigod and the combat becomes not challenging at all. Which is why really long playthroughs are rare - it's much more fun to simply start over.

Morrowind,3ccy7i,MyrMindservant,3,Wed Jul 8 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with both of you.  A lot of the fun of Morrowind is becoming a demigod in a variety of ways.  That's why I almost never play a pure fighter.  The magic system of Morrowind is where all of the player creativity comes in.  You can become a demigod swordsman, but there's nothing super fun or unique about that.  You just run around bashing things with a sword and killing them in one hit.  Archery can be a bit more fun, but it's still just ""shoot-and-kill"" gameplay.  After a while, the game becomes less about ""winning"" and more about shaping the world to your liking.  Magic helps a lot with this.  Dislike a particular NPC?  You could kill them, but where's the fun in that?  Isn't it more fun to command them to your dungeon, damage their speed and strength to zero so they're permanently frozen in place, and use them as a practice dummy for weapons and spells?  You could walk everywhere, but isn't it more fun to create an enchanting ring with Jump, Fortify Speed, Fortify Strength, and Slowfall 1pt, and literally fly across the world?  You get my point.  PS: you can always turn the difficulty slider up too, if you want a challenge at higher levels."
Morrowind,3ccy7i,crucifigo,3,Wed Jul 8 22:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean it's much like how GTA doesn't stop being fun after you get all the goodies or even if you cheat."

Morrowind,3ca01g,princerules666,5,Mon Jul 6 11:23:39 2015 UTC,Dagoth sort of reminds me a bit of Xerxes from 300.  So I wondered if he would have been slightly androgynous as a mortal.    Everyone's got their own ideas though - it was a long time ago!

I'm not sure how you can say Sotha Sil is portrayed as Hermaphroditic, let a lone Almalexia.  Only Vivec is.  In anycase, the more I see the artwork for Dagoth out there, and re-listen to his voice/narration, the more I can see this interpretation as being legitimate."

Morrowind,3c74k3,MrTimmannen,3,Sun Jul 5 17:22:07 2015 UTC,The Red Year never happened!  My Nerevarine never went to Akavir and so was on hand to solve the problem without noticeable loss of life. It's not my fault that Bethesda chose to set the sequels in some weirdo alternative universe.  (This head cannon is loaded and I'm not afraid to use it :))

Morrowind,3c74k3,Nymunariya,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, what would he do? punch baar dau into submission?   Well, possibly. My guy can do a pretty good Man Of Steel impression if he  cranks his intelligence up high enough, so I'd hesitate to rule it out. If Kal El was around, I'm he could push it back out into space. Lower it slowly at the very least. Maybe bash it into fragments and them use Super Speed to disperse the fragments and hence the impact.  As long as we're talking head cannon (as opposed to existing game mechanics) then there's no reason the Nerevarine shouldn't do something similar.  There's also a few other things he could try. He could maybe open a portal into Oblivion where the thing could land harmlessly; he could pay a visit to Sheogorath and persuade him to turn the damn thing into butterflies. (Would appeal to Sheo's sense of humour, but then so would having several gigatons of dead butterfly impact the ocean at very high speed ... so maybe not). He could try not killing Vehk in the first place (I tend not to) and maybe talk him into putting the rock down gently. He could try whopping Vivec or Almalexia with Sunder and Keening and see if he can slice off enough residual heart power to soft land the thing himself.   All of it would require some questing to work out how to do it ... but he's used to that."

Morrowind,3c74k3,Nymunariya,4,Tue Jul 7 01:13:52 2015 UTC,"Tell us a bit about yourself and what type of characters you like to play! That'll make it a lot easier to choose. Generally thief types go Hlaalu, warrior to Redoran, and mages to Telvanni, but if you hate slavery for example and you're a mage, it might be better to join Hlaalu because they're the most open minded and opposed to slavery of the 3 houses."
Morrowind,3c74k3,Nymunariya,4,Sun Jul 5 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I would usually choose some sort of elf or Breton and effectively become an archery spellsword, but this time I decided to do something different: be a khajiit. I suppose my khajiit is effectively what you'd expect from one."
Morrowind,3c74k3,SirKaid,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Hlaalu is one of the more pro-slavery Vvardenfell houses. The house is all about money, after all. The Caldera mines are run by Hlaalu, and their slaves are fed up to the point that they have their own leader for a rebellion. There were even a few ashlanders working there. On the other hand, I don't remember seeing a House Redoran plantation."
Morrowind,3c74k3,Landslide_Krag,2,Sun Jul 5 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"You're right, my mistake. I keep assuming that since Hlaalu is very accepting of non-Dunmer races to join that they don't like slavery. Bad assumption I guess. I don't remember seeing a Redoran plantation either. :P"
Morrowind,3c74k3,Mordimer_Madderdin,2,Sun Jul 5 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"Hlaalu has strong voices on both sides of the ""slavery issue"". The leading abolitionist is the niece of one of the most egregious slaveholders.  Telvanni, of course, are pro-slavery, or at least consider it a matter of choice for the individual (slaveholder). Redoran seems mostly slave-free, but the Caldera Mines have slaves. It's amazingly easy to screw up the Redoran House progression by freeing the right slave too early in the game. I've done it at least twice."
Morrowind,3c74k3,Landslide_Krag,4,Sun Jul 5 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"Hlaalu are the only House that doesn't have a massive stick up their ass about outlanders. Friendly, inclusive, and we make mad bank. Who cares if we're thieves? We're gentleman thieves."
Morrowind,3c74k3,NumberoftheJon,2,Sun Jul 5 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"I always think of Hlaalu as merchants rather than thieves. Admittedly, they're not above the odd corporate misdemeanor, but on the whole their fixation is on doing business.  Mind, it's a long time since I played a Hlaalu character - I may be mis-remembering things."

Morrowind,3c8c1t,tman_elite,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:15:43 2015 UTC,Funny thing is I did do that. But since I built a new PC I tried transferring them and none of the saves worked.

Morrowind,3c8c1t,JML_21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:16:07 2015 UTC,Yea I used a couple of the tools. None were successful. I believe the culprit was using a lot of mods previously. Along with some exploits then transferring the files to a new computer. Either way I don't mind starting over. Especially since I've never beaten the main quest or gotten very far in the game.
Morrowind,3c8c1t,crucifigo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"Dunmer are probably the Jack-of-all trades race so you can go with that. Restoration, destruction, plus weapon and armor skill of your choice as major skills. The rest depends on what you want. Birthsign of choice depends on your playstyle. If you'll focus on magic more then Apprentice or Atronach. If you want close combat better then go with Warrior or Lady (for added health early on) You'll also want Endurance and Luck as favored attributes. Get that Endurance maxed early and you'll be so tanky late game.  Also, try having multiple saves next time. I make it a point to rotate   between 5 save files so I have a safety net. Hope this helps! :)"
Morrowind,3c8j5j,ChaosWorshiper,3,Sun Jul 5 22:13:16 2015 UTC,"I will assume you meant to make the game more fun, in which case I can suggest a few mods that will immerse you further, add content, and make the game have more replayability! First and foremost, Abot's Scenic Travel Mods. They add in boats, silt striders, and gondolas moving around while you play, and you can ride them all real time! With Tamriel Rebuilt you can do the same thing with River Striders!  Julan Ashlander Companion is another great mod! It adds in a companion you find at the Ghostgate. You should go to him before you start the main quest, because if you don't (and you get to the Vivec informants quest), he won't be able to be your companion (no clue what happens to him after that). His quest line ties into the mainquest and alters it in an amazing way.  Morrowind code patch is a must, fixes so many issues! Morrowind Patch Project (if you can find it) is good as well!  Abot's fishing mod is nice, lets you fish, and works with NOM.   There are a lot more I could mention. If you're interested, I can link you to an article I wrote that details a lot of mods to improve the game!"
Morrowind,3c8j5j,Lingering_Trees_Gabe,2,Mon Jul 6 01:17:47 2015 UTC,Sure! Post it here so people find it if they run across the thread.

Morrowind,3c8j5j,VRichardsen,2,Mon Jul 6 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the ones I am running:  Morrowind Patch: a must have. Tons of things corrected.  MGSO - Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul: the game really loses a few years with this one, and certain places look really beautiful even today. The Redoran Council under Skar is one of them, and also the beautiful night sky: you can even spot Masser and Secunda moving across the stars. See here for a quick comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyU0GXw5fg It includes many mods, all packed togheter within an installer. Among other nice characteristics: new sounds, new lighting (now you need torches if you plan to explore a cave, and good luck travelling at night, outlander), new book jackets, nicer looking weapons and armor and much more...  BTB´s Game Improvements: huge rebalancing of the game. Makes the races more different from one another, with more pronounced advantages and disadvantages, meaning that your choice of race has more impact on your game. The more overpowered spells have been toned down, while the useless ones have been reworked to be a viable option now. Economic changes now make amassing a fortune something that actually requires effort; the prices have been adjusted thusly, and so were the merchants. You will no longer be able to trade a delicious doorstop for a crummy old Danish. Investing in Speechcraft and Mercantile is now more useful than before. And a bunch of other tweakings in line with those mentioned before.  Necessities of Morrowind: you need to eat, drink and sleep, just like regular men/mer. A bunch of recipes to cook, along with a lot of unique foods. Hunt a nix hound; light a fire; roast the meat; enjoy a tasty meal. Refill your water supply in wells and fountains; buy fruits and prepare delicious fruit juices. Bake bread; stew bittergreen; prepare a nutritious rat soup and much more. It really adds immersion to the game, and it makes those inns much more useful. Resting outside is a bad idea!  LGNPC - Less Generic NPCs: a mod with a lot of writing involved, in order to make the characters more unique, replacing generic responses with unique dialogue options. It also adds many new side quests."

Morrowind,3c4n9b,Akselmo,4,Sun Jul 5 17:01:56 2015 UTC,Cause the whole image is so full of texture and granularity. I don't see a single flat surface. There's no place for the eyes to rest.
Morrowind,3c4n9b,num1d1um,3,Sun Jul 5 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"Dunno man, I don't have that problem."

It's really close to the telvanni sector and far from the center of power of others houses  It's a city which are supposed to be controled by the temple because of the proximity of Mount Kand, but it's also not clear. Maybe some more pilgrimage orientied stuff"

Morrowind,3c4ae1,wildbane,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe something connected to the supply chain.  Molag Mar has to be horribly dependent on food shipments coming in. There's no farming around the area and hunting and fishing isn't going to supply an outpost that size.  We can assume that most supplies come in by Silt Strider. Boat is an option, but the wharf seems a little underdeveloped for freight shipping.  So there's scope for some quests around the food supply. The striders are probably difficulty to disrupt, but it might be possible to interfere with the upstream supplier. You'd get quests to maybe bring in supplies via an alternative route (maybe overland with a pack guar) and to find out what the problem and  get the food shipments resumed.  It's also likely that food shipments are either to the Redoran Outpost or the Temple with the tradehouse probably buying from the Outpost. So the tradehouse is probably paying over the odds and would welcome an independent supply"
Morrowind,3c4ae1,uhh_huhh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:07:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I've been scouting out locations and I think I've found a good place for a small port.  I don't want to go too crazy with it and make an entirely new city; but it makes sense there'd be some route to get supplies from larger ships.  These are good ideas and I'll definitely give it some thought.  I can already tell this mod's going to be a different type of trouble than Vivec.  There needs to be a reason to visit this lonely outpost, and that means quests.  The former just needed a lot of statics to fill it out and add in detail.  Questing, dialogue, and bug testing all take an enormous amount of time, so I'd expect Dramatic Molag Mar to hit a release date sometime mid august at the soonest.  Good news is I've rebuilt the entire canton from scratch now, so not only does it look slightly different, I can start weathering it and destroying bits of it."

Morrowind,3c3nn0,Nubtom,9,Sat Jul 4 13:26:34 2015 UTC,"More of a survival/life simulation emphasis at least. Have the world change over time, regardless of the player's actions (though they could have an impact over those too.)"
Morrowind,3c3nn0,lame_corprus,4,Sat Jul 4 15:07:27 2015 UTC,Would you have things like hunger and sleepiness?
Morrowind,3c3nn0,tman_elite,5,Sat Jul 4 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I always thought it was a bit ridiculous that you could never eat or sleep and there would be no ill effects.  Fallout New Vegas hardcore mode handled it pretty well.  You get gradually worse debuffs the longer you go without food/water/sleep, until you eventually die."
Morrowind,3c3nn0,lame_corprus,3,Sat Jul 4 18:29:06 2015 UTC,I like that.
Morrowind,3c3nn0,lame_corprus,5,Sat Jul 4 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Also with the second thing I mean stuff like scripted events that will occur at a set time, and the player may learn about them and influence them.  E.g imagine that you could hear a rumor that there will be a new mayor's election in Balmora at a date set 60 days after the game starts. You could then choose to work for the various candidates with mutually exclusive quests, and the winning candidate would have lasting effects on the city.  For example, one candidate would raise taxation which would add a fixed rate to all merchant prices, but also add new services like a library to the city, which would let you read and even steal rare skill books. Another potential mayor would in fact turn Balmora into a wretched hive of scum and villainy, and profit from increasing skooma trade etc, allowing the player to do some further illegal quests. There could be a third candidate too.  Now here's the thing. If the player does not do any of the quests related to the mayor election, a candidate is elected regardless, changing the city from its original state. This gives a sense of real life to the world.  And if the player chooses to kill all the mayor candidates before the election, Balmora turns into a police state. This would increase the amount of guards walking around the city, eradicate the Thieves Guild presence and introduce bounty hunting quests to the player."
Morrowind,3c3nn0,Vehk,3,Sun Jul 5 06:46:15 2015 UTC,That's a very nice idea. I would definitely put this in the game.
Morrowind,3c3nn0,m4050m3,3,Sun Jul 5 07:10:37 2015 UTC,"It's probably the thing that I would want most in TES. The world around the player changing on its own over the course of time. If I am right, the original Fallout did something similar but that was received badly because it was mostly related to the main quest (there was, in addition to an actual time limit, a couple of hidden time limits in the main quest)"
Morrowind,3c3nn0,War_Psyence,2,Sun Jul 5 07:16:08 2015 UTC,The mod Frostfall by Chesko in combination with disabling fast travel and expanding the carriage/boat service turned the good game Skyrim into a great game for me.
Morrowind,3c3nn0,4GrandmasAndABean,9,Mon Jul 6 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"What really makes morrowind, to me, is the tiny details. SO much hidden stuff. Cute little conversations with the odd creeper. Knives hidden under mushrooms. That kind of stuff. So if you manage that sort of thing in any universe, I'm for it."
Morrowind,3c3nn0,Sir-Berticus,3,Sat Jul 4 20:14:08 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I'd ask for that in any game I play.

They are my favorite type of dungeon in Morrowind, but most of them look the same and feel the same. The Dwemer ruins are worse, though. Not because they are repetitive, but because they feel kind of blank. The Dwemer ruins in Skyrim were a lot better imo."

Morrowind,3c3nn0,strummist,3,Sat Jul 4 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a sci-fi kind of setting.  Maybe exploring a space station or a colony on a alien planet.

I would still want to see interesting forms of fast travel, a journal/quest system that doesn't just have map markers, and the possibility to get some ridiculous powers."
Morrowind,3c3nn0,macbone,3,Sat Jul 4 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"I guess its not really morrowindish gameplay wise but have you played mass effect?

Morrowind,3c3nn0,TheFlyingBastard,2,Sun Jul 5 03:09:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I have played them and liked them but I would like the kind of open world and detail that only Morrowind has really been able to deliver.
Morrowind,3c3nn0,Axtlar,3,Sun Jul 5 03:25:58 2015 UTC,"Believability. What makes Morrowind for me is that despite the alien world, history and realities of the tes universe, Vvardenfell contains just the right amount of conflict, loss and triumph to make the world believable for me. In Morrowind we have religious conflicts (the Nerevarine Cult, traditional Velothi practices of the Ashlanders, the state-sanctioned Tribunal Temple who persecutes the former two, the Imperial Cult, a foreign religion creating tension through its missionary efforts in a foreign land), corruption, the fighting between the Great Houses and the Empire in keeping control of the island, economic inequalities, blatant colonialism, racism/xenophobia between the various peoples in Vvardenfell, etc. and yet in the midst of all this there are still those characters who still are righteous, those common folk just trying to make it through the upheavals of the land and just live their lives. That's what I think really made Morrowind in comparison to later games in this series for me."
Morrowind,3c3nn0,HonorableJudgeHolden,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:05:42 2015 UTC,Interesting. I never thought about just how much conflict there was in Morrowind.
Morrowind,3c3nn0,In_Medias_Res,3,Sun Jul 5 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"Game engine that supports a feel of a ""real"" world - weather that affects gameplay, so archery for example is modified when shooting with/against/across the wind; fire spells are less effective in rainstorms, and so on.  Seasons, so that ingame you may wait until spring before trying a mountain pass that would be fatal in the winter.  A biology engine as well as a physics one, so the world genuinely changes along with the seasons.  A proper hydrographic engine, allowing dams, flooding etc.  NPC's that progress (or regress), who join and leave factions, or form new ones.  As much life underwater as above - in ES games this has been slightly neglected.  Sailing, and shipbuilding, with wide customisation options for ships, and crew recruitment and training.  A large game world, without ""invisible walls"".  NPC retainers, and buildings to purchase or build and to upgrade- not just ""strongholds"", but inns, chapels, workshops etc.  Each developer to be given a specific cultural and geographical region to design, so that different places ingame actually feel different.  In general, a world that a player can look at and feel that events actually matter, one where each playthrough is substantially different. A place where, like Morrowind, a player can find something new after a decade of play. A world which has enough independent ""life"" so a player could just sit and watch, but has enough challenges to draw the player in."
Morrowind,3c3nn0,HonorableJudgeHolden,2,Sun Jul 5 09:07:40 2015 UTC,Totally agreed with everything you said. I would have all of this in the game.

The Atmosphere is destroyed when you can see Dagon Fel from Seyda Neen.  Morrowind was actually very small, landmass wise, when compared to other TES games. Developers got around this by using fog and making the terrain more Mountainous than the Himalayas. Factor in a walking speed that would make a snail trying to trek across a mountain covered in super glue look like a cheetah, and you end up with a world that seems as big as OPs mum. i.e. massive.   Never understood why so many people recommend playing with distant land turned on."
Morrowind,3c1mrz,Franco_Andres,3,Sat Jul 4 05:00:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  These pics look awesome, but it ruins the illusion for me.  When I was a kid, the world was enormous to me.  Now with these mods/pics, I can see how small the world really is.  Which is cool but also a little sad.  I can't say one way is the ""right"" way and the other is wrong.  But I like how massive the world feels when you can only see a small part of it at a time."

People never recommend to play with that much distance. Most people I saw on the Internet recommend to play with the distant land at 6 cells, so you don't break your denial about Vvardenfell being small, and at the same time you don't feel like playing Silent Hill. With the distant land at 6 cells, the atmosphere of the game is still there, and you still can change the distance to a lower number if it still does not satisfy you."
Morrowind,3c1mrz,ass2mouthconnoisseur,3,Sat Jul 4 13:01:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. For me the ideal number is somewhere between 4 and 10, depending on the region. Anything beyond that and it''s pretty much just for screenshots."
Morrowind,3c1mrz,Sheepocalypse,2,Sat Jul 4 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I don't find it immersion breaking being able to actually see farther than a blind cave rat, and I'm starting to find people that complain about it seem insecure about their 'nostalgic memories' of this expansive, millions of miles wide game that never existed in the first place!  The size of the game didn't decrease just because you can see realistically far, for fucks sake. The world still feels huge for me even though I can see Vivec in the distance from Seyda Neen - in fact, it feels better to me.  I think fixing the view distance does nothing but enhance the experience. Disagree if you want but I am sick of this rhetoric permeating this sub so completely."
Morrowind,3c1mrz,ass2mouthconnoisseur,0,Sun Jul 5 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"Filthy S'wit!   It has nothing to do with nostalgia. It's the same reason I hate MGSO.  The atmosphere of the game is broken if you change too much. I love modding. I use tons of mods. I'm simply stating that I dislike this particular modification and can't wrap my head around why people would recommend it, especially for first time players.   If you like mayonnaise filled Twinkies, that's your prerogative, but don't be surprised when people tell you it's disgusting.   And nostalgia has nothing to do with it. Once you leveled up your athleticism and speed, you began to notice how short the walk/run from Seyda Neen to Balmora actually is. The fog helps with keeping the illusion of distance even if you can haul ass like a cliff racer hopped up on skooma. Removing the fog of war does in fact decrease the size of the game. Games are artificial digital constructs. The same way a film uses angles and other tricks make things bigger than they really are, games do as well.   If you don't like Morrowind, n'wah, why even play it?"

I liked to think that his father had been a hunter and taught him everything about hunting before the naming day, and of course Hun-Tra wanted to be like his dad.

Not to mention that the extra 15 damage from claws are only useful in one very specific build that requires an enchantment that is only found in one spot (so it's easy to miss without prior knowledge). and 50 points of extra Magicka if far better than Nightvision (a useless skill).

Morrowind,3byvm3,docclox,2,Fri Jul 3 07:48:24 2015 UTC,"The easiest build to play is probably a Redguard heavy armour sword and board type.   To go one better on this: Redguards make AMAZING battlemages with the atronach birthsign.  Their Long Blade skill gets +15, and is fine to leave as a minor skill (starting skill is 30). Throw Medium (or Heavy, if you don't mind the weight) Armor in your major skills list, along with Armorer (for fixing your shit), and 3 of the magic schools (my advice is Destruction, Restoration, and Mysticism).   Round out your minor skills with Marksmanship (you'll suck at it with only 15 points to start, but it's a decent backup when your mana runs dry), Alchemy (more potions=better), Speechcraft, and another casting school of your choice (I like conjuration for the sweet bound weapons, but Alteration is also nice).  The Atronach, in Morrowind, gives 2.5x your Int score as additional mana pool, a 50% spell absorb chance, and no ability to regen mana by sleeping. Given that using the ""heal mana through rest"" mechanic is (IMO), annoying, losing it was never a big deal. And now, you have massively reduced damage from magic in addition to your armor buffing your physical damage resistance. And your mana bar will routinely be refilled mid-fight by the absorb, letting you fling fireballs, heal, and bind daedra to your will without concern."

You can level more than 10 skills without leveling up (sleep is required for that), so you can have up to 3 attributes (because you get 3 points to spend) x5 per level.

Morrowind,3byvm3,Sigourn,6,Fri Jul 3 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"Got some useful advice:    Pay attention. This is very important. Because you don't have quest markers, you need to read carefully, and think about what you are reading. Sometimes you won't get something like ""you need to go to this place"". Instead, you will get pieces of information you need to draw conclusions from and act accordingly. The world is not leveled. BUT, unlike some popular Skyrim mods, the game was designed with that in mind. So you won't get an impossible quest early in the game, allowing you to progress naturally instead of forcing you to grind to defeat an enemy. Unless, of course, you weren't supposed to face a certain enemy yet. Remember, the game works based on dice rolls. It will be frustrating at first if you don't use the weapons you are supposed to. But it gets much better. Also, try to keep your fatigue at full when about to start a fight. What I usually do is just run, and once my fatigue bar is empty, I walk until it is full again."
Morrowind,3byvm3,tman_elite,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:34:40 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, in Skyrim I would take every quest I came across and just deal with them in whatever order I felt like, because of quest markers and the journal.  I could totally forget about a quest, and then come back to it and the game would just tell me exactly what to do.  In Morrowind, it's much easier to focus on one or two quests/questlines at a time.  My usual strategy is to progress as far as I can in one questline without getting in over my head, then start another.  As I would level up I would cycle between them.  It made it a lot easier to keep track of what's happening and what my current goal was."
Morrowind,3byvm3,Morokite,2,Fri Jul 3 13:36:57 2015 UTC,Get a mod that lets you pick flowers directly instead of opening them like a chest and pulling out the flowers. Also consider setting luck as a primary stat. You can't apply leveling multipliers to it so it's one of the few ways to get some decent luck added. Also try and eventually get an enchanted item that will offset the fatigue you lose from running. Oh and find that graphics mod that lets you increase draw distance and set widescreen. MGE I believe

Morrowind,3byvm3,SmellyGoat11,3,Sun Jul 5 14:40:49 2015 UTC,"Always make a custom character.  Endurance affects how much HP you gain per level, and this is NOT RETROACTIVE. This means that, unless you're looking for extra challenge, you almost always want to make one of your two favored stats Endurance.  Always have a weapon skill in your Major (or minor if you're feeling ballsy) category, even if you're playing a mage. (For mages, from an optimization standpoint, spears are really good because leveling that skill helps you get your Endurance up faster. From a roleplaying standpoint, you'd want to choose Blunt because staves lie under that category. It really depends on your playstyle~)  You'll be missing a lot at first. Go to the Mage's Guild and pick up a Bound ____ spell that fits the weapon category you chose to use. These weapons come with a constant fortify _____ skill +10 enchantment that really helps you hit those f*cking cliff racers. It's a super nice bonus to have early to mid game.  Join the Mages Guild and/or the Fighters Guild as soon as you can and loot from the supply chests. They have potions that will save your butt! The chests respawn every 3 in-game months, so it's not super OP, but there is a separate chest in almost every city that houses these guilds. Do your best to loot them all so you have plenty of potions.  Explore everywhere! If a cave is too difficult for you, mark it down somewhere and come back to it later. I print out a map of Vvardenfell every time I start a new character, and I circle the general location of caves that I skip.  If you find an item that looks out of place, or a named item, don't be afraid to look it up! This item could be a very important part of a questline. You don't want to muck that up by picking up the golden eggs, and dropping them in a random spot in the mountains, only to find out that you can't continue in your favorite faction's questline because you don't remember where you dropped them!  You have no compass, so pay extra attention to the directions in your Journal, and familiarize yourself with how the system works so you don't end up lost in a sea of words later.  If you find an amulet of Almsivi or Divine Restoration: GET IT. This means that you won't have to be a mage to use these spells to get out of sticky situations.  Daedric armor is really REALLY rare in Vvardenfell. You can look up the locations of where to find each piece, but to be honest, that would ruin the fun and satisfaction of finding them yourself ;) (EXPLORE!)  The local map is super useful for finding entrances to caves that you otherwise would not have spotted. Check it often, especially when exploring little islands!  Morrowind has a lot of tiny little details that Skyrim and Oblivion do not have. This difference makes Morrowind by far the best Elder Scrolls game for someone with a roleplayers mindset. If you start roleplaying, you'll find yourself having a lot more fun!  Good luck! :D"

Morrowind,3byvm3,destroycarthage,2,Sun Jul 5 06:30:09 2015 UTC,"If you want to focus somewhat on spells, choose the atronach sign. Also, alchemy is very useful. If you try to hit something with a weapon you have low skill in you'll just not hit at all. Try using a trainer to increase skill in a weapon skill you intend on using if it's very low, and then training it up on enemies once you are actually able to hit them.   A bit out in the game you should get your hands on a ring or amulet with a constant levitation effect. (levitation 1 point is all you need) this is extremely useful, especially if you're not a mage.   Always have a scroll, potion, or spell of divine intervention. Nice for carrying out loot, and also since you can restore attributes and cure diseases at temples.   Get a mod which makes attribute gains based on skill gains, and not on how much multiplier you have gotten for your level up. This makes you able to actually play the game, and not force you to do cycles of potionMaking-creeperSelling-training to develop your character optimally."

Morrowind,3byvm3,TheStradivarius,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:12:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure of you have started yet, but this is one thing I warn everyone about. In Skyrim, your character can walk at a decent speed, so traveling isn't to bad. But at first your Morrowind character will be slow. Really really slow. So getting the speed up towards the beginning isn't a bad idea. Granted, try not to spread yourself to thin in other areas, but traveling can be a pain when you're not even going at a normal walking pace."
Morrowind,3c1b09,destroycarthage,3,Fri Jul 3 21:13:17 2015 UTC,"Bethesda is really bad at cache management.  It's true for all their game (at least with Morrowind Oblivion, Skyrima and Fallout NV), even in vanilla version. There is leaks everywhere.  Because of the small size of the vanilla texture it's less obvious if you don't mod but it's still present."

Morrowind,3bxiui,NikolaSule,22,Thu Jul 2 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"Missing is only a huge problem if you optimize your character very poorly, or constantly use weapons which you are not proficient with. By the time you reach about 65 in a weapon skill missing isn't such a huge pain, and it is possible to reach that level very quickly (depending on your race/class choice you may be around level 50 in a weapon skill at level 1).  I can't say it is more or less fun than modded combat, since I've never used a combat mod in Morrowind, but it really isn't as bad as some people make it out to me."
Morrowind,3bxiui,MurdochAV,16,Thu Jul 2 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that weapon skill in Morrowind only determine one thing : your chance to hit.  So if you always have 100% hit chance, your weapon skill does nothing. If your primary combat skill is a weapon skill, you will then have no evolution of the capacities of your character during your play, no sensation of improvement.  For me this sensation of improvement, to start like a peasant and to finish like a god, is one of the big fun i have with morrowind."
Morrowind,3bxiui,Kramalimedov,2,Fri Jul 3 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, agility determines chance to hit."
Morrowind,3bxiui,pROvAK,5,Fri Jul 3 05:34:47 2015 UTC,"chance to hit : Agi/10 + Skill  So skill is far more important for determining the chance to hit.  And it's the only effect on weapon skill, while agility has other effects also(as decreasing the chance to be hit throught dodge)"
Morrowind,3bxiui,Kramalimedov,5,Fri Jul 3 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"From the UESP:  Your chance to hit can be summarized as (Attacker's Hit Rate - Defender's Evasion)%.    Hit Rate    (Weapon Skill + (Agility / 5) + (Luck / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Current Fatigue / Maximum Fatigue) + Fortify Attack Magnitude - Blind Magnitude.    Evasion    ((Agility / 5) + (Luck / 10)) * (0.75 + 0.5 * Current Fatigue / Maximum Fatigue) + Sanctuary Magnitude  Besides agility and skill, luck and fatigue are also important, along with Fortify Attack, Blind, and Sanctuary.  The Accurate Attack mod makes combat less frustrating, but it removes the benefits of certain spells and the Warrior birthsign."

Morrowind,3bxiui,SerjoHlaaluDramBero,2,Fri Jul 3 06:29:30 2015 UTC,I would switch to the version that gives a 25% increase to hit chance. Keeps the vanilla progression in tact without breaking any enemies yet makes combat a lot less frustrating
Morrowind,3bxiui,spaceparry,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:54:35 2015 UTC,"The way the system works is suppose to balance things out. Having a 100% chance to hit is similar to making a dash for artifacts and daedric weapons at level 1, you really rob yourself of proper scaling. If you can never miss and you grab a very powerful weapon, you mine as well just go into ruins and other places where you have no business at level 1 because you, a random scrawny prisoner in an unknown land, can never miss a hit. Your weapon skill is a sense of balance so you can't just stomp everything in the game with random things you are unfamiliar with.  Honestly, how realistic is it that everything in the game cannot dodge or you can never miss? You are level 1 in a vast land with many powerful creatures and foes, with challenges that await you only at your physical and mental peek."

A huge reason I watch let's plays is to get some hearty laughs. I don't know what kind of vibe you're going for, but solid improv comedy, or just improv skill in general is a solid addition to any Let's Players' tool belt.  Find an identity for your channel. Are you informative (Chuggaconroy)? Are you hilarious (Gamegrumps, Beard Bros, Markiplier, and many others)? Do you make horrible jokes on purpose to make your audience groan (Chuggaconroy)? Do you always complete your games (Beard Bros)? Do you play through games casually (Gamegrumps)? etc. An identity for your let's play persona is key to making yourself more interesting than a normal person, which is what us viewers want to watch. Being yourself is awesome, but there is no reason you should not augment that, and have more of a presence just like a performer would. (I make note of very famous Let's Players as references because I believe an important part of being a performer is to study the works of those who perform the craft better than you. BEWARE OF COPYING THESE PEOPLE as they are widely loved by the internet, and you don't want to come off as a hack or anything :p)  Get a better quality mic/video-capturer. I know that this can get expensive, but with all of the other quality let's players out there these days, you need the equipment to stay in the game. As an average Youtuber, I'd see your Let's Play, hear the low quality voice, coupled with the low quality video capture (even at 1080p!), and I would decide to move on. I'd prioritize upgrading audio over upgrading video.  I know that this is a lot, and some of it might come off as discouraging, but you're pretty young (or at least you look it), which means that you have massive potential.

Morrowind,3bwwhv,SirBlazinGames,6,Thu Jul 2 20:40:29 2015 UTC,Random enchanting tip: NEVER use Almalexia's and Vivec's souls for a constant effect enchantment. Use them for a cast on use / cast when strikes because these two souls contain about 200 more points of charge than all other souls. Using these souls for constant effect wastes the extra juice.

Morrowind,3bwwhv,SomeHairyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:08:41 2015 UTC,I've been playing MW for years and I never even thought of soul trapping Almalexia...
Morrowind,3bwwhv,disintegore,3,Fri Jul 3 13:33:06 2015 UTC,What exactly do you have issues with?  Personally I avoid the skill and just pay an enchanter. At that point I'm usually loaded with ultra expensive items. If you get an enchanter that's also a merchant and buy/sell something to him before paying for your ultra expensive enchanted item then you can just sell shit back to him and get all your septims back.
Morrowind,3bwwhv,disintegore,3,Thu Jul 2 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"the problem I have with it is... I have no idea how it works and how too use it. So, any tips on doing it?"
Morrowind,3bwwhv,MrMeltJr,3,Thu Jul 2 21:15:08 2015 UTC,"Well, UESP is a good place to start.  There's really nowhere to begin. You have soul gems, that can contain varying sizes of soul. The ""stronger"" the creature you're soul trapping, the more potent the soul is. Items also have varying degrees of ""charge"" they can handle which essentially puts a hard cap on the magnitude of enchantment they can contain. All of this is thoroughly documented on UESP.  Enchantments can be active abilities (so basically any spell combination you can think of) or constant effects (permament +20 Speed, etc). The latter is only possible with Golden Saint  souls or better IIRC.  The usual tradeoff is you can either use your skill and suffer the chance of failure (which is pretty fucking high if you're doing anything remotely potent) or shell out some cash and pay an enchanter, recouping all your losses with the glitch I mentioned earlier."

Morrowind,3bwwhv,disintegore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"Well, you did get all those expensive items by yourself.  This is a grey area in my opinion. You gave the merchant a fuckton of gold. Why would he not want to spend that on a couple of daedric wakizashis?"
Morrowind,3bwwhv,destroycarthage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:13:22 2015 UTC,"I sometimes rationalize it by underselling to the Creeper, than consoling myself the difference with ~20% taken out. I roleplay that I found some rich aristocrat outside of Morrowind who wants to buy my super expensive stuff, and the 20% is a smugglers fee.   Then I started making a mod where you find some smugglers doing exactly that. Do a couple jobs for them and then you can sell to a guy with 200,000 gold. Then that computer died and I never got around to finishing it."
Morrowind,3bwwhv,NeroOfRome,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"I think it was a nice idea Beth had to make the ultra end game items more expensive than any meager merchant could afford. In Oblivion and Skyrim, merchants are just glorified item dumps with the occasional resource you might use. However there really should have been some kind of mechanism for offloading them because your only options ended up being showing them off in your house, exploiting buggy barter mechanics to generate a metric fuckton of gold or simply end up cleaning up merchants and getting even more clutter.  The Mournhold museum was a decent idea but with all the rich, eccentric great house moguls out there I'm surprised there isn't any special demand for artifacts and powerful items."

Morrowind,3bwwhv,SomeHairyGuy,4,Thu Jul 2 23:50:14 2015 UTC,"It's not worthless!!! A higher enchant skill drastically lowers the amount of charge spent when using a Cast on Use/Cast on Strike enchanted item. That is, you'll be able to use an enchanted item/weapon a hell of a lot more times before its charge exhausts. It's a great choice for a minor skill -- I nearly always give my characters some proficiency in it."

Morrowind,3bvhty,waktivist,8,Thu Jul 2 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"Doesn't seem possible by 'blanking' the bodypart slots on the item, but maybe I'm doing it wrong  Only idea I can think of is setting the robe bodyparts to corresponding armor parts (chest, groin, upper arms, upper legs, knees). I think it's limited to 6 though, so you'd have to drop the knees. Also since it's clothing you'd have to go make clone bodypart entries for the armor under clothing. In the end it would be much easier to go in the CS and increase the enchant points of an item."
Morrowind,3bvhty,dankedanko,4,Thu Jul 2 17:39:26 2015 UTC,You could just modify the fenchantmult in cs from .01 to like .015.    That'd raise the enchant value of all other items by a decent amount to mitigate the robe.
Morrowind,3bvhty,MrFahrenheit39,3,Thu Jul 2 22:58:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of mods but nothing like that sadly. I assume it's possible though, since jewelery doesn't show on your character."
Morrowind,3bvhty,crucifigo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"If it was doable, someone would likely make a mod for it over the last 13 years - especially since this isn't an uncommon request. Robes are hard-coded to replace the character's body parts (unlike jewelerly, which hasn't got any visible slots assigned (and from what I recall, won't render anything even if you assign it some parts in the CS)."

Morrowind,3bu94u,WombleCat,10,Thu Jul 2 09:50:18 2015 UTC,"Change is change. It doesn't have to be bad.   Change isn't all bad. I played Morroblivion for a while recently. I went into the Balmora guild and found everyone gathered in the lecture area having a discussion about something. That was a clear improvement. There was something going on. The place came that little bit more to life.  The animation and modelling has clearly improved. I wouldn't fight to keep MW animation if we could replace them all with Skyrim grade NPCs  Even the UI has been better. Oblivion at least is an improvement over vanilla Morrowind. Skyrim, not so much, although I'd love it if Morrowind could be modded to produce something like SkyUI.  No, what I lament is the loss of depth and complexity. The sense of alienness, the depth of history, the willingness to let the story emerge as the player plays the game, rather than compass pointers and artificial urgency. The fact that each iteration seems to require less engagement from me, seems to offer fewer ways to create my character even as it offers more customization in the way they look. The ongoing to race to the bottom as each new release tries to find a new lowest common denominator to which it can conform.  There are things that Oblivion and Skyrim do well, certainly. But they threw away so much more than they gained. YMMV, obviously.   Whereas in Morrowind, my first character was a wood elf acrobat/ranger. Caius or someone told me to hunt to make money, so I dutifully tracked and slew nix hounds right up to Ald'ruhn. Went to sell their meat. ""Waat, two measly gold for all the effort hunting them?""   I've yet to make money as a hunter in any Bethesda game, Skyrim included (unless you count hunting dragons and selling the bones, anyway). Best you can do in Skyrim is to hunt wolves and deer and craft and improve leather armour. But that's not hugely different from hunting mudcrabs and nix-hounds so you can sell restore fatigue potions.  I do agree with you that the weapon crafting system in Skyrim is nice. (I like the (SkyUI) interface for alchemy and enchanting as well, but the underlying system seems lacking somehow). That said, I would sacrifice weapon and armour crafting in a second if it meant we got spellmaking back in the game. Or proper enchantments."
Morrowind,3bu94u,docclox,6,Thu Jul 2 11:21:25 2015 UTC,What really bothers me is that you'll find thousands of gems and medallions in every single cave. Getting money is one of the easiest things in Skyrim. In Oblivion - at least at the lower levels it took some effort. I remember playing through the arena just to finally be able to buy that shitty house at the docks.
Morrowind,3bu94u,DawkTux,3,Thu Jul 2 13:23:23 2015 UTC,"Hah yes! I did the same in Oblivion. I was so cash strapped, each arena stage I could beat was a boon.   Then I'd invest the gold by betting on other fights!  Edit: I loved that shabby house by the slums. I collected all sorts of trinkets and strewed them across the floor. I'd be wading though Ayleid gems, Oblivion gate stones and all sorts of jewellery. Good times."
Morrowind,3bu94u,WombleCat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:38:21 2015 UTC,"Do you do the No Stone Unturned quest early, by any chance?  I know the Prowler's Plunder (I think) reward for that is supposed to give you a lot of extra loot like that. I can never be bothered with it, and I generally find I have to grind a bit to raise cash. Well, at least until my Alchemy starts getting good, anyway."

Morrowind,3bu94u,Kalk-og-Aske,7,Thu Jul 2 15:55:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you had to work for that shit.  Killing someone in armor like that was hard in the beginning.

Morrowind,3bu94u,DawkTux,2,Thu Jul 2 16:44:39 2015 UTC,You could always nab the glass claymore in the urshilaku burial grounds.  That comes pretty early in the story and it's worth more than just about anything you could ever need to purchase barring enchantments.

Morrowind,3bu94u,DirtDog13,3,Wed Jul 8 16:04:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed, you make some very valid points. Spellmaking alone offers an incredible strategic depth to Morrowind combat that the other games lack. Although having said that, I loved the blocking mechanism in Oblivion - especially with the Deadly Relexes mod.   I've recently been exploring the Skyrim mod that removes quest markers for more detailed descriptions (late to the party, I know). The developers have done a good job with fleshing out the quest descriptions, but I still miss flicking through pages in my MW journal to read up on the quest notes, or re-live my Dagoth Ur nightmares, or keeping a sharp eye out for key landmarks as I search for the Cavern of the Incarnate.   I think one of Morrowind's strengths is that it came at a time before consoles dominated the gaming market (and PC game UIs), before text heavy games faded away - at that time I used to regularly log into text-only MUDs to play. There's something about the written word that allows your imagination to be unleashed. Morrowind had that in spades, as well as eye candy and a great game engine.   Still, I do enjoy booting up Skyrim and running around with some survivalist mods - frostfall, iNeed etc. Never had that experience in other games."

That's a tricky one. Often we don't realise how much we value something until it's no longer there. But...   detailed character system. Attributes to reflect the areas where the PC's talents lie, classes to reflect their chosen discipline and offer some incentive to study certain skills beyond that offered by play style and simple minimaxing. Star signs to give a bit of spin to the characters beyond that offered by class and stats. Races because they add a bit of variety to the world Absolute minimum of game supplied characterisation for the PC. Give me a pointer to the MQ and ample opportunity to ignore it. I don't want to be told who I am, how I feel or what I want. I'm ok with the rest of the world telling me who they think I am when the plot requires it - just don't require me to agree with them No fast travel except by fixed point transportation services (boat, strider, guild guide) or by spells. A detailed, complex, colourful magic system. Magic should be fun and it should be flamboyant. Lots of spells, lots of spell effects, lots of ways to combine them and modify them. Let me be creative with my magic.  I don't want to be a mage just to find my combat options are limited to lightning-bolt-and-stun-lock or invisiblilty and backstab. (Mentioning no names, Skyrim) Detailed spellmaking, enchanting and alchemy options. The ability to overcharge these to gamebreaking levels if I so choose. (Maybe make it a little harder to get to those levels). Value player experience over developer convenience. Levitation and teleport spells should be available Lots of armor slots. None of this ""torso, boots, gloves and hat"" rubbish. I want to be able to mix and match.  Similarly with weapons. Let's have a lot of them. And make them look different. A wide range of skills. Preferably with numbers attached, rather than the Skyrim ""everything is a perk"" approach. Including athletics and acrobatics.  A sense of otherness, of something alien. Morrowind looks like another world. That's worth keeping.  Depth of background. Game lore is an important part of TES games, and Morrowind really submerges you (""immerse"" is overused) in that lore. Oblivion did that to an extent, if only with the Dremora heiracrchy. In Skyrim it was more like ""Oh, right. We have dragons now"". The lore about Alduin was there, but I never got the feeling of swimming in it the way I sometimes do in Morrowind. Mod support. At least as good as in MW.  Graphics at least as good as Vanilla MW. Stealth at least as good as MW.  Excellent music   ... and probably a ton of other stuff as well.   [edit]  Forgot skills and stealth - I knew I'd miss stuff out."

Morrowind,3bu94u,UsernameHasBeenLost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:15:11 2015 UTC,"Skyrim made the mistake of making everything seem urgent. Also the dragons were way to frequent and annoying. Oblivion was a bit similar with the gates but they could at least be avoided or closed. The story in both Oblivion and Morrowind starts of really slow. I mean yeah you're on the ship, you're off the ship fill out the documents and leave. From there on out you can forget Caius - or you can deliever the stuff to him and then go your own way - he even encourages you to do it. Oblivion is similar, apart from the fact that you can't 'accidentally' drop the amulett. You can walk to Jauffrey give him the amulett and leave - or go free Kvatch, bring Martin to the Cloud Ruler Palace and then leave. There is no real sense of urgency until the very end when you go through the portal to Mankars paradise - from there on out shit really hits the fan and stuff is getting 'urgent' in like the last 30 minutes of the story. I'm ok with that. The story was never what interested me. It was the people - that's why i LOVE Shivering Isles. It was such a magical place, with no urgency - hell i even took the time to read a book i found there - which later became my most loved book series ingame - Secrets of Princess Talara - read it if you haven't it is quite rare but really awesome.  Another thing that really made the difference between Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim was the variety of the world. Morrowind had so many different terrains even more though, if you include the addons. Oblivion lost a bit of that variety due to the more generic 'human fantasy' world - but it earned a great deal with Shivering Isles. Skyrim on the other hand wasn't all that varied. You basically have your icey coast, the tundra and the two different southern forests (Falkreach and Rifton). The dragonborn DLC tried to implement some of the elements of Morrowind but failed to understand why Bloodmoon was such a great AddOn. It offered something extremly different. Vvardenfell had temperate, subtropic and even hot climate, Solstheim offered a big contrast to that.  Skyrim did not offer that contrast. You know what i wanted to see after spending nearly 80 hours in the wilderness of Skyrim? Not more icey wilderness and moldy dwemer ruins. I'd prefer to see the deserts or jungles of Elsweyr or the forests of Valenwood. You don't have to add a whole part of the continent. Just add an island or a peninsula. It is not like there'd not be enough options."
Morrowind,3bu94u,DawkTux,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:41:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting insight. I'm considering that maybe, in my free time, if I really have the motivation to do it, I might make a game inspired by Morrowind with this in mind. I've been thinking a lot about what goes into making a game and it would be interesting to test out my theories.  I could add just what I think would be cool -- I would sit back and imagine what new creature or spell effect I could add, and maybe make them more interesting diverse than Morrowind (not that the magic system is lacking in Morrowind), and I could let my creativity go wild with making an entirely new and unique world. It would certainly be a way to spend my time. And since I'm not famous I wouldn't be under pressure from anyone's expectations.  I really like the detail that Morrowind has. I would certainly enjoy adding things like a journal kept by a miner assaulted by ghosts in a cave, or enchanted swords hidden under pillows. I could just keep adding things -- new creatures, new player races, new items, etc. for as long as I wanted because I'm not limited by lore; it could be established as I go along. I know I've always been slightly disappointed with games that have few items in them. Demon's Souls for example only has three great hammer weapons and like nine weapon types (don't worry if you don't know what I'm talking about), and it could do with a few additions. I could spend all my time just adding new things (without over-saturating the game of course).  The depth of character customisation in the game is really nice as well. I like that it has a good number of skills. I'm very good at math so understanding how to develop formulas for game mechanics would be easy. It's also nice that Morrowind is kind of hard -- that means that you won't get tired of it too quickly.  I would probably be able to do art. I would certainly learn as I go along. I'm good at geography so designing a realistic world would be easy. I would be hopeless with music though. I know music theory but I've never written a song in my life. It wouldn't be an issue though; Dark Souls has very little music but it has really intense atmosphere.  I might be getting in over my head here though. I'm only sixteen, and I've never made a game before (although I do know how to code, and I'm somewhat experienced with game development environments. I have tried to make games before but gave up early on, probably because I didn't have any reason to be committed to them. I imagine this would be different. It's safe to say I know how I would do it), and to make something akin to Morrowind in scale is a big undertaking (probably more than I realise). Still, I could give many people what they feel they lost in Oblivion and Skyrim. In any case, would you be interested in playing a game heavily inspired by Morrowind (and developed with the things you mentioned in your previous reply in mind), but in a completely separate universe?"
Morrowind,3bu94u,Nubtom,2,Thu Jul 2 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"That sounds really cool. I'd definitely be interested.  One thing you might want to look at is the OpenMW project. Doing game content on that scale is quite a task all by itself. You probably don't want to be writing an engine as well.   OpenMW are writing a replacement morrowind engine using modern renderers. They're aiming at complete compatibility with vanilla morrowind and the game is fully playable using their engine.  They're also looking for a non-morrowind flagship game, as there are a few legal issues around advertising themselves as ""open source Morrowind""  Anyway, it might be worth looking at. It could cut the amount of work in half."
Morrowind,3bu94u,docclox,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"I play Morrowind using OpenMW, so I have heard of it. It's probably a good idea to use their engine, although I was planning on using an engine like Unity (which I have some experience with already). I wasn't planning on writing an entirely new engine.  I feel as though I really should use OpenMW, because as you say they are looking for a non-Morrowind flagship game and I feel that I owe it to them because since I use a mac, I wouldn't be playing Morrowind without OpenMW. But I feel that Unity will be less effort because I have more experience with it. I'll start with Unity for the moment to play around but I will try out OpenMW once I figure out how to get the development environment set up."
Morrowind,3bu94u,Nubtom,2,Thu Jul 2 20:03:28 2015 UTC,"Well, they do have a game in the works already, so there's no pressure from that direction. The creator of Ashes of Apocalypse is looking at turning it into a total conversion too, just for that reason.  And Unity does seem to be very good. It's almost a decade since I last messed around with 3D engines and Unity was just barely started around then, but from what I've seen of it, it seems very impressive. Go for it!"

The only thing that messes me up (apart from MW crashing from loading too many cells) is Tamriel Rebuilt which I keep forgetting I have installed. My Intervention spells keep unexpectedly pulling me onto the mainland and I have to fly back, grumbling all the way.

Morrowind,3bu94u,docclox,0,Fri Jul 3 11:49:56 2015 UTC,"""Graphics at least as good as Vanilla MW"" That's setting the bar way too low, IMO. The graphics are one of the few complaints I have about MW, even if I'm prepared to let it off the hook due to it's age. I still think most of the animals and Dwemeri stuff in MW is ugly as hell.  I agree on everything else though, especially more armor slots and weapon types (I love all the different Japanese blades in MW), and the ability to wear armor AND clothes if I so desire. Although I'd insist on stamina being named stamina, instead of fatigue. That's something about MW that always annoyed me."

I had a character designed to create nuke spells. Levitate above a city and launch the missiles. Watch the fun. Same went for frenzy spells.
Morrowind,3bu94u,DirtDog13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:00:20 2015 UTC,"I really liked the seemingly-infinite nature of magic in Morrowind. You could pretty much make magic as OP as you wanted.  Enchanting items was limited solely by the enchantment points of an item. If you boosted your enchanting skill above 100, it was possible to make casting an enchantment incredibly cheap. This way, you could end up with items like a Daedric Tower Shield that launches a giant nuclear blast. Thanks to the rapid fire casting of enchantments, you could launch nukes instantly until the shield runs out of charge. It's always fun on an evil character to enchant a Daedric Tower Shield with a large AoE blast spell, equip levitate, and nuke Vivec.  Alchemy was fun because you could always just exponentially increase potion strength by brewing intelligence potions. While it's kind of exploity to make a potion that raises your intelligence by thousands, I enjoyed making less powerful intelligence potions which allowed me to make some ridiculously powerful (but still not crazy powerful) potions. Grinding intelligence potions to be able to make another type of potion was kind of rewarding.  My favorite part about the spell system is that it's so versatile. There's plenty of ways to refill your magic. You can make pretty much any type of spell to fit your needs. Investing in magic makes your character as strong as you want them to be."
Morrowind,3bu94u,MrFahrenheit39,4,Wed Jul 8 16:08:20 2015 UTC,"Something that took me a while to realise is that it you undersell, or push too hard for a bargain, that affects your relationship with the merchant. In vanilla the affect goes away when you close the conversation window and reopen, but I really like that connection between being a hard nosed trader and how well you're liked.   There are mods that make it permanent, as well as ones that make it easier to haggle over large sums of money etc.   If you get the mercantile skill high enough you can buy low and sell higher."

Morrowind,3bu94u,JML_21,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:00:31 2015 UTC,"The bartering and spellmaking systems made Morrowind (and even Oblivion to some degree) seem to have more of an old school RPG vibe than Skyrim or ESO. Not to say those games don't also do acceptable things with bartering and speech, but it's not the same feel IMO. I prefer the older stuff. Daggerfall does it very well, too."
Morrowind,3bu94u,Cyclenophus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"I only got MW a month or two ago, and I haven't put that many hours in. But still, I'm loving it. I'm indifferent about the barter system, but the GHs in particular fascinate me (I prefer Telvanni myself, although I free their slaves). I also quite like the way the factions work, where you need to have some level of proficiency in skill X to progress in the faction's hierarchy, unlike Skyrim, where you can become Arch-Mage of Winterhold even if you're an axe-dragger who only uses spells when quests demand it. And I've got to love MW's refreshingly minimalist intro. No having to sit through an hour of NPCs flapping their gums about shit you already know and starter dungeons when all you want is a new save to test your mod. And the greater flexibility it affords you in terms of character building is remarkable. Not to mention the wider variety of weapons and armor slots, something that I feel is sorely missing in Skyrim.  But - maybe it's just because I've gotten more into it, IDK - I still prefer Skyrim, because Skyrim has a few small, but IMO, important advantages over MW. Aside from the relatively minor problems poor graphics, and somewhat limited character customisation (MW obviously deserves slack on both counts due to it's age, but I still think pretty much everything Dwemer in MW is...well, hideous, especially compared to say, Daedric, Telvanni or Redoran architecture), one of the main things that I find lacking in MW's faction quests is the sense of really being able to change anything. Skyrim manages this with quite a few of it's questlines, especially the CW, Dawnguard and Raven Rock. In MW, you can assassinate rival guild leaders (e.g. for the Thieves Guild and Mages Guild) once you get far enough, but their deaths really don't seem to mean anything. Nobody seems to bat an eye if Orvas Dren dies, or even King Helseth, for the gods' sakes (nobody even bothers replacing him). In particular, killing rival guild leaders left me unsatisfied because it didn't weaken the guild in any way, nor do any of them try to maintain stability by replacing the dead leaders, which would either way have been acceptable outcomes. I also remember being disappointed once I got a Mouth as a Telvanni wizard, because I was still in no way able to participate in House politics, and I assume the same is true as you join the upper echelons of House Hlaalu or Redoran. I couldn't propose to outlaw slavery in Telvanni territory (and thereby perhaps improve relations with Imperial institutions). It's little things like that that made me feel my actions are futile, because none of it has a realistic consequence, and was a real immersion breaker for me.  IK SR isn't exactly perfect in this regard, but at least by completing the CW, you can emancipate Skyrim from the Empire or solidify it's membership of the Empire, and see this in-game, with new governments in every hold, and a new militia patrolling the cities loyal to them. You can restore the Thieves Guild to prominence, resulting in the renovation of the Ratway, more fences, and Guild influence restored in the major cities.  Nothing like that was possible in MW until BM and the EEC questline, and even then you could only build either a smithy or a general goods store, and a player house."
