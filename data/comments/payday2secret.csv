The Payday 1 ARG wikia has lots of information about the process everyone went through to get to the Overvault. Patch 13 was the Wolfpack DLC, Patch 15 the tester achievement was added, and it wasn't until patch 19 that it was solved. But it makes no indication if people had used exterior programs to view the maps (I assume that people tried once they knew a secret hunt was on.)  So, my question unfortunately still stands.

payday2secret,3cr1jb,Salazaz,10,Fri Jul 10 02:14:26 2015 UTC,It's very likely that the hallways and walls identified are left over from map development. The developers are fully able to make a space completely invisible until a trigger is activated.
payday2secret,3cr1jb,payday_finale,4,Fri Jul 10 06:27:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I considered that those spaces are just from development. Especially considering how lazy the devs are.
payday2secret,3cr1jb,payday_finale,5,Fri Jul 10 13:44:37 2015 UTC,It's not that they're lazy at all- the spaces are completely irrelevant to the experience of players that aren't using something to noclip around the map.

payday2secret,3cr1jb,Heroic_Sheperd,3,Tue Jul 21 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"The first image is the circle of slot machines. This is from my assumption that the slots may have a role in triggering the secret, considering their ability to be played with and have different states. The fact that they are usually grouped in fours and the pillar's rather interesting number of slots layed out in that circular format.  The second set of images are considering an interesting layout in the room before the vault. The carpet cuts off abruptly just here. While it may just be leftover from an early design of the casino, the strange way the carpet cuts off, including the actual tiny corridor and door shaped opening leads me to believe perhaps this could be an entrance needing to be triggered?  Finally (I hope I got the right wall) the infamous wall that will not retain bullet holes with the corridor behind it. Possibly another entrance that could be triggered?  Another area of interest (not shown in these images) that I saw in another post is the lights found in the roof of the overhang at the casino entrance and in the vault, which can be destroyed. Possible Trigger?"

payday2secret,3cr1jb,smitened,3,Fri Jul 10 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"actually its correct pls check both walls.  i noticed something about bullet holes and walls. Walls that cannot have bullet holes means its a ""potential element change"" for example: in Big bank try shooting areas of which the Normal vault door [ the other 3/4] may spawn. or the other potential security door spawn areas or the C4 tunneling wall..  all of these means that it has the element to change. thus we are not sure yet what is awaiting for us.

The painting in Rats day 1 is highly suspected to be related to Bain's Guide page 2   Original ARG   Several mask items including Ygdrasil, Golden Materials, and other patterns are similar or the same as those found in the required secret masks from the original ARG in PD:TH Radios are prevalent in Big Oil 1, the Safehouse, and Go Bank similar to those found in Counterfeit, which assisted in the sound file clue. Big Oil day 2 also has an empty pool similar to that of Counterfeit Big Bank has a shocking amount of similarities to First World Bank (PD:TH Overvault map) including similar time patterns possibly used in entering a tile puzzle for a secret vault   Possible trigger/suspicious activation   Using Debug mode in the Harvest and Trustee maps opening deposit boxes B A L D W I and N will create a ""Element code entered executed"" message.

It's also important though to take what the Developers say in tweets, and forums with a grain of salt.

payday2secret,3ba495,-PEves-,2,Sat Jun 27 07:34:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think they would require those masks, as they wouldn't want to limit the number of people attempting it (there was a limited number of completely overkill packs), and I'm sure they intend to make a large community event out of it like they did in PD:TH.They probably intend to give the game a grand send off when it reaches the end of its life."
payday2secret,3ba495,GhettoPenguin52,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:49:43 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem unrealistic to me that they would give people who cashed out a first chance at trying to figure out the secret.  In the first game the 4 masks that were needed were glorified versions of the original masks. This looks extremely on par with that in comparison.
payday2secret,3ba495,-PEves-,6,Sat Jun 27 08:01:18 2015 UTC,"Right, but the 4 masks in the first game were available to those who had cleared every level on Overkill 145+. There was no paywall, but a skill wall. If anything, they'll probably require a minimum infamy level. Or you might need to be 25. Or maybe have cleared everything on deathwish (which very few non-hackers have done, especially with them releasing new ones all the time). First chance, maybe. But with the nature of the first one being the huge investigation and riddles, even if they tried to keep it secret, it wouldn't last.  Edit: I guess my thought on the matter is that Overkill loves its big community events too much to restrict it to 50,000 members of the player base."
payday2secret,3ba495,GhettoPenguin52,0,Sat Jun 27 08:08:25 2015 UTC,I am starting to wonder why all of these pages in Bain's guide seem to reference the other levels if it's so clear that the vault is in Golden Grin.
payday2secret,3ba495,-PEves-,6,Sat Jun 27 08:20:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about Golden Grin having it. Personally, I feel there are too many things that feel wrong about Big Oil. The bank on Election Day day 2 also has a few oddities that just feel out of place. They're also the two least played maps, so I feel like if everyone is missing anything it would be on one of those two maps. I also think that the achievement for beating Election Day Plan C on Deathwish with no downs is rather suspicious. Almost hinting that there's a way to do it in stealth. Much like pacifist was an absurdly difficult achievement in PD:TH, and it led to the initial messages. Not to mention some of the first hints in PD:TH arrived in the DLC, and the actual thing was in the original game. Golden Grin may hold hints, but I doubt the actual thing is there."
payday2secret,3ba495,GhettoPenguin52,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:26:08 2015 UTC,Did the pacifist achievement lead to any messages? I thought the only two messages on Counterfeit were for listening to the radio and sitting at the chairs.
payday2secret,3ba495,pazur13,3,Sat Jun 27 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"Pacifist didn't have anything to directly link to the message, but it convinced people that you could complete the whole thing in stealth. This (at least as far as everyone knows) is untrue, as the stealth ends after the 2nd group of cops investigate. You had to stealth counterfeit as long as possible to get the message to play when you were on the chairs. Which is why I find some overlap with Election Day Plan C. They gave an obnoxiously difficult achievement, which might be in the same vein, getting people to think it can be stealthed, when in reality you can only stealth it up to the C4. So perhaps if you stealth up to the C4 detonation (when it is forced loud) something happens if 4 people are in the right positions (such as the weird security office)"

payday2secret,3b6omz,TheElo,3,Fri Jun 26 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but what use would blowing up the hotel doors have in stealth?"
payday2secret,3b6omz,Malcom347,-1,Fri Jun 26 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"You don't get the C4 if you're still in stealth. The C4 located on the map is purely for blowing up the casino floor to reveal the top of the vault.  I'm afraid people are jumping the gun and think that 'Shape Charges' and the 'C4' that you receive for this mission are the same. They are, in-fact, not. You can only blow open the doors using Shape Charges, AKA upgraded tripmines.  Otherwise, it could be possible to use the C4 from the locker room to blow open too many rooms and thus be unable to break the floor for the BFD to do her work."
payday2secret,3b6omz,minitrees,4,Fri Jun 26 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"The doors he are talking about are the upstairs rooms which are blown up using the retrieved C4 not the shaped charges.

payday2secret,3b6omz,Malcom347,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:10:23 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I initially didn't see where he said 'after you've placed the correct C4' That being said, the c4 is the only way to get into those rooms to get the loot items that are in them, since there's only one hotel key, so its still likely nothing.  Im not sure about the 3 'side hall' rooms, but I've never been in either of them yet, and they don't get c4 markers (even when I had enough c4 to blow all of the doors and got the vault correct first try.)"
payday2secret,3b6omz,minitrees,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:10:45 2015 UTC,Yeah there is only i think 8 doors you can open with or without keycard the others just dont have rooms behind them. But the 4 middle ones on either side do have the ability to be blown open and seemingly with no reason except from getting some jewelry which is worth nothing compared to the vault.

payday2secret,3b5r31,minitrees,7,Fri Jun 26 12:24:10 2015 UTC,"You do realise it could work like the original secret, so the vault would only appear after triggering it?"
payday2secret,3b5r31,pazur13,-1,Fri Jun 26 12:44:43 2015 UTC,The vault was always there but you could only enter it once you triggered it. Unless you teleport in of course.

payday2secret,3b5r31,minitrees,9,Fri Jun 26 13:02:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, but since they know lots of people search the maps with noclip, I doubt they'll just leave the secret there for everyone to see without any work."

payday2secret,3b8v9e,SirLoneWolf,2,Fri Jun 26 22:32:04 2015 UTC,Fire extinguishers are an added gameplay mechanic to add diversity to the game.  Possible it's apart of the secret but until we have theories or speculation about them it's nothing.

payday2secret,3b8v9e,PaperMartin,0,Sat Jun 27 20:25:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's very unlikely that the fire extinguishers are related to the secret.  However, for the record, shooting one in the real world shouldn't make it explode per se, but you'll get all the gas inside it rushing out to equalize pressure, making the powder/water in it rush out through the hole. If it's a CO2 cylinder, it'll also give you the dry ice mist and a nice loud bang, with some possible decompression of the cylinder itself.  Oh, the things you learn being an extinguisher service technician."

They also are doing the same thing as adding hints through out the development like the old game had,but the old game had much much more obvious hints through out to start to encourage the search for it and at the end of the game they released a dead a giveaway.  They know were are searching for it well this time,so they are making the hints are harder to crack  Sorry for length,but I had to back up with examples even though the fIRST made no sense probably,since some one told me this and these were the only examples that crossed my mind at the moment of typing."

So realistically, whilst there are a lot of theories (some of which do seem to have merit) there isn't really a way we can list evidence, as, well, we don't really have any.   Is there a Steam group for secret-hunting? That could be something we should set up if there isn't."
payday2secret,39s1iy,Garacesh,2,Sun Jun 14 13:12:51 2015 UTC,"there are several, this is the point I am trying to make. there are a whole lot of really smart people on this thing, but no real organization. The reason I want to get this setup is FOR GGC. I don't think they are going to make this easy, and a whole lot of the stuff we have already found is likely going to come into play. Just trying to plan ahead here"
payday2secret,39s1iy,CastrolGTX,4,Sun Jun 14 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"The problem that arises is that most people are here to criticize, so nothing is ever agreed on or suggested.  A master guide would have to be made by one person."

I think we should work on making a guide together, not just throwing ideas here but putting all the intel we got into one file."
payday2secret,37u1cz,The_zendman,6,Sat May 30 11:33:59 2015 UTC,"I know that this is just an example.... but it's not a very good one. I don't want to attack you but just some things that are causing most of the theories: The in-game image is a different one than the one at Place de la Concorde (look at orientation and objects in the scene) The connection between Marie Antoinette, Egypt and Freemasonry is base on Cagliostro. He spend some time in Egypt and got introduced to the egyptian freemasons before he came back to Europe, where it's said that Cagliostro/Kölmer/Falk (historicans are not sure if Kölmer & Falk really existed or if they where Cagliostro and a friend of him he met in Malta and which mysteriously vanished while they were visiting Saint-Germain) introduced Adam Weißhaupt to the knowledge of the freemasons which led to the creation of THE(!) Illuminati-Lodge that most of the modern myths are about: ""Die illuminierten Seher von Bayern"" (The illuminated seers of Bavaria). And this is the explanation why we have egyptian symbols occuring in some Illuminati/Freemason-textes. Egyptian freemasons also often studied the ""magic Kabbalah"" which also explains the alchemistic references. Almost 10 years later, he was involved in the diamond-necklace affaire....  I just want to point out that there's a huge amout of possibilities to interpret the data we have collected so far. I got lost in the rabbit hole just a few days ago ( http://www.reddit.com/r/payday2secret/comments/36rbpz/cagliostro_and_the_big_oil_theory/ ) and it took me some time to realizie that none of the specific symbols on the wheel of fortune at the""Tools of Trade""-Image from Bain's guide had a specific meaning, it's just a way to display the wheel of furtune that's not found via google image search but whith real research on the different usages of the symbol through history and societies."

In the beginning, when i started with the hunt i looked into the guide images as well. Found some interesting stuff, but in the end, like you said, its all multi-interpetable. Therefor i now work from in-game and then look outside of the game to see the ""lies""  Be carefull, do a step back so once in a while to see what you really have and were you going.

payday2secret,36rbpz,Gr3gHill,3,Thu May 21 22:43:57 2015 UTC,"While there're several loose ends and conclusions that don't sound like the best to me, I pay lots of respect to you and the effort you put into this theory.  In private, I'm following the trail on Illuminati and freemasonry through the game and there's some interresting information tieying in to your theorie:  While Cagliostro (aka Balsamo) was in several different 'guilds' of freemasons and Illuminati, there's one that builded the base of all his writings and alchemistic tryouts: the egyptian freemasonry. Their belief and society can be described as ""magic kabballah"". The interesting part of this is that if you look at ""Tools of trade"", one can argue that the letters are spelling 'YHWH' reffering to a VERY special part of the Sefirot called ""Tretragrammaton"". In Kabbalah, it is sayed that only few selected people in each generation will now the correct pronnouncation of the word ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton#Kabbalah ). The Tetragrammaton consists of Kether, Chokmah, Binah and Chesed. Moving those points of the Sefirot to the BigOil D2map gives some interresting options. The fourth player position could then be in the HotTub, which would also tie in the ressurrection or 'eternal life' theme.  Another thing is that I don't think that we have to look out for the direction the player has to look into. We can assume from some acheivements, that the game has a very good view on what we're actually doing ingame, so I believe the players have to take actions ingame that correspond to their ""role"" in the Tetragrammaton."
payday2secret,36rbpz,Gr3gHill,2,Sat May 23 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you posted this, the whole point of the guide was to continue discussions like this. My assumption regarding the direction was just an educated guess because of the Prisoner image. I think you're also right regarding the Tetragrammaton, it's definitely something I wanted to look into. Just out of curiosity, what options did you get using the map? I understand if you don't want to share, but this is cool to talk to someone else that has read into the clues more.  Also did you ever play the first secret? Some of my theory leading in this direction makes me wonder if I'm taking it too far..."
payday2secret,36rbpz,TheDutchUndertaker,1 point,Sat May 23 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"So If I put my understandings of the Tetragrammaton onto your BigOil-map, the positions would be #1Kether, #2Chokmah, #3Binah and #4Chesed. That doesn't makes much sense as Kether is inacessible for players Now the thing with freemasonry is the way their hierachy and passing of knowledge works. Only the very highest persons knew about the actual goals and secrets of the society and passed a mixture of truths and lies to the persons on the next lower tier, telling them that his is the final truth but lower tiers shouldn't know those persons did the same with those information and so on and on. When someone got ranked up in the society he was told the new ""final truth"". In order to keep the system structured and to control which tier is having which knowledge, there was a document of ""most holyness"" that contained the ""final truth"" for the respective tier. Since only the master of each tier was allowed to read the documents, most of the information in it were encrypted in different ways. Very often an information was decrypted several times so an adept could always see the same document but upon gaining more knowledge, he can decipher more passages. Egyptian freemasons have their roots in an pythagorean-jewish movement (in opposite to the christianity/templer-illuminati) so they focused on geometrical ways to understand the world and their codes often involved geometrical variables. One of the methods to obscure a position in an imagery was to include something that could be used as 'mirroring-point' (which of course only involved persons would recognize) and mark the positions at the mirrored spot. This mirror-point could be anything like a small symbol somewhere or the line on a building plan that sticks out to the receiver. If we use the split of the house as the mirror axis, those 4 Player positions would move as following:  1Kether ==> AncientTomb(?)  2Chokmah ==> Malkuth(Kingdom)  3Binah ==> HockeyRoom  4Chesed ==> Refrigerator  This led me to a loose end that I cannot connect anywhere except you brought them up too which made me post this.  Another option for obscuring a position on a map was to exchange the orientation of the map and have the secret position rotated around a fixpoint accordingly. An arrow or pointing finger on the document would indicate the true direction of north.  I haven't  tried but maybe you can create an image where you rotate your drawings to have the yellow arrow match north.  I actually didN'T played the secret when it was discovered and after several tries, I seem unable to find the full explanation of the riddles. Just as added info: I don't think that we can get any proof or solid information on the secret at the current state of it's implementation in the game but I also think that Overkill can't put in the secret stuff all at once but they need to built up the clues and information in the heists, which they have already started. We have some very strong connections between the secret and certain heists (Rats3-Picture, BigBank-mural, etc.) and a huge truckload of theories and suspiciouss stuff ingame. Theoretically, the theorie that has the most connections to ingame-stuff is the most likely one to lead to the secret."

I satiate most of my talking-about-the-secret needs done with my steam friends anyway.   Just about that mindset is what I'm sick of from a buddy of mine. I hope it is not the reason why we're not progressing: Everyone who found a piece of the actual puzzle too annyoed by the community to just share it and solve the whole thing within a day.   I'm planning on sharing something pretty cool soon, after exams.   Could you elaborate on what kind of thing?

payday2secret,33olix,riki7119,1 point,Sat Apr 25 03:01:28 2015 UTC,It was well known during PD1 ARG that people were keeping secrets but I think it was more of a big deal because there were extremely well known clues that literally the entire player base knew about.This time around things are different.  It was made extremely apparent that people are still keeping secrets this time around because when the news of debug mode with the safe deposit box combination came about there were a few people claiming to have known this already.  People want to be the first to have their names put in the game just like OK did in PD1

payday2secret,31vpcx,n8kb,4,Wed May 13 05:16:33 2015 UTC,"Just a question.  Why wouldn't paid DLC heists be included in the Secret itself?  I see no reason why Overkill should be confined to it being on a free heist.  The truly invested players typically have every DLC already, and even casual non hardcore ones have a handful of them, Big Bank being a very popular one.  Also everyone can still play Big Bank, they just can't host it if they don't have the DLC.  So where is the issue?"
payday2secret,31vpcx,Heroic_Sheperd,0,Thu Apr 9 07:34:40 2015 UTC,"True, there is no reason for that, but I made this conclusion based on payday: the heist's overdrill, not saying that it's gonna be like that, but it is just my opinion."
payday2secret,31vpcx,Heroic_Sheperd,3,Thu Apr 9 10:26:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't compare these 2 games on DLC.  Payday: The Heist had exactly 1 game DLC add on, The Wolfpack DLC.  As of now Payday 2 has 17, and continued support for another year and a half from now where they can and will no doubt sell more DLCs."
payday2secret,31vpcx,Figgis302,6,Thu Apr 9 10:32:41 2015 UTC,"I just needed to get this out of my system and share my thoughts with other secret hunters.  There's one problem, though. The Big Bank is a paid DLC, so I don't think OVERKILL would make their secret to be accessible to only the ones who bought the DLC.   You clearly weren't around for the ""hunting"" phase of the original ARG, because you've completely overlooked the fact that the secret could only ever have been cracked in the first place with information garnered from Counterfeit, a heist added by the $4.99 Wolf Pack DLC.  FYI, ""Jim Hoxworth"" is an alias, like Dallas and ""Mr. Steele."""
payday2secret,31vpcx,productfred,2,Thu Apr 9 01:24:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe his lawyer was going to call him Bodhi, as in Bodhi's Pool Repair from the first game?"
payday2secret,31vpcx,CastrolGTX,-1,Thu Apr 9 02:32:19 2015 UTC,"That doesn't seem plausible, that wouldn't make a lot of sense. What makes it interesting is the fact, that, unlike reused reflection maps and textures, this was deliberate. They wanted this little, tiny part to be there. What we do not know is why it is there. And this short question is the most useful thing with what we have right now. The question ""why?"":)"
payday2secret,31vpcx,EnderRay,2,Thu Apr 9 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"I listened to it again, it's definitely ""Bo-"" like ""bow"" and not Baw like Baldwin.  There's very little on who Bodhi is supposed to be.  All I can think of/find is Bodhi's Pool Repair, which was the fake company to scam the counterfeit people, Bodhi being a reference to the heist movie Point Break (""100% pure adrenaline"").  Then the name was reused for the safehouse Bohdi's Laundry Service.  That would just be a movie reference but...  What's weird is Bain's comment in the GoB under ""Finding a Sanctuary"" ""Bodhi never failed me -- you should be safe for now"" as if Bodhi were a guy.  It could be an alias, like George Kaplan from North by Northwest, a guy who doesn't actually exist but Bain keeps his existence up on paper, creating businesses and paying taxes etc.  That would be just fine but...  Then the lawyer almost calls Hoxton Bodhi, as if his paperwork read it.  If it were Bains phoneyman then Hoxton would never use it as that would get them all busted.    Most likely, they're just trying to drop the name Bodhi around to get our attention.  One can draw a lot of symbolism from having a safehouse named Bodhi, because of the famous Bodhi tree, especially in paydays context when theres so much ado about Yggdrasil."

payday2secret,30vdue,NotCobaltWolf,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"Seriously how the hell did the Firestarter thing ever become part of the theory. It was obvious from the beginning that its just a hard coded response to burning the weapons, having nothing to do with stealth."
payday2secret,30vdue,Heroic_Sheperd,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"Well at surface value it was suspicious as hell.  Firestarter is rare to stealth, at the time it seemed a lot tougher to do because how the gangsters and alarm were coded if things became uncool.  Also how often did people really burn the weapons even if playing loud.  Back then the highest difficulty was Overkill so you didn't need as many bags and it was a lot easier so less desperation to burn the weapons in favor of speed anyway.  When it first happened no doubt people jumped on it as a weird trigger, but a little further testing and playing would have shown exactly that it's nothing more than that code."

payday2secret,30vdue,RandomPixelTM,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:46:47 2015 UTC,"Great Idea on the Dillinger death mask. But ive been trying to take a different approach, ive been trying to tie current things of Payday 2 to Payday The Heist, such as, in Payday the heist you unlock mask for completing every heist on the hardest difficulty. Sound familiar? It should, by completing almost all of the heists on Hard, Very Hard, Overkill and Death Wish you unlock a special mask for that. I think overkill is playing there cards the same. Also Big Bank is most likely for the secret due to its resemblance of the world bank in PaydayTH. If anyone can think of more ties or resemblances back to the TH(The Hesit) Please tell me, thanks!"
payday2secret,30vdue,riki7119,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"I know this is harsh but I cant resist. This is one of the most useless theory I have ever heard. First of all, Baldwin and the trigger for wearing a mask is from pd:th. You must read the pd:th secret before starting on something new, or you will be showing fool of yourself to others. Secondly John Dillinger is one of the most famous bank robber/gang, there's absolutely nothing special about him. Thirdly, where did you get the idea of ""standing on a manhole""? What kind of clue lead you there? Like PD:TH, one thing must connect to the other to be a clue. Not some random idea of standing on a manhole for no reason. This is why you get stuck with a question ""which manhole should I stand on?"".  Finally, have you ever tried FS day1 in stealth? it is close to impossible or totally impossible to do. You should look it up on how difficult it is, considering all the cameras and the cops that shows up near the van after killing all the gangs.  You need a more connective theory and idea that points you step by step from clues to clues."
payday2secret,30vdue,Keeper3k,2,Tue Mar 31 10:32:42 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you on mostly everything, Firestarter Day One is very easily stealthable if you take the time to learn how.   However, there are no triggers or events that happen when you complete it in stealth vs loud (As it was never intended to be stealthed), so you are correct when you say it has nothing to do with the secret."

payday2secret,30vdue,Heroic_Sheperd,9,Tue Mar 31 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, dude. To be more constructive and less passive-aggressive, the ideas that you've put out here not only are false but are written as if they were true:   There were surely other people they could've used, but I researched. John Dillinger has a missing treasure which he left in a brief case... Breif case.... 50 Blessings suit case? Dillinger mask and Suit case? I don't know about you, but this wild speculation is making a tad bit of sense.    This is the purest of speculation. Not only is John Dillinger a very infamous criminal, who is in fact is in a game about criminals, there is no connection between him and the 50 Blessings in Hotline Miami. You can't connect the two if you are just referring to the briefcase. It's as if Dillinger killed someone with a barbed wire baseball bat, and you concluded that it is an ingame connection to the barbed wire baseball melee weapon. It's not because that melee weapon is related to a weapon used by a prominent character of the Walking Dead, not John Dillinger, even though there may be a coincidental relationship between the two.   Okay. First, I think that this might have to be after the Baldwin stuff. Baldwin often wore a mask to shield his Leprosey, so I think that we have to wear a certain mask to trigger it. I started thinking about what masks would make sense. Nothing made sense but the Dillinger Death Mask.   Again, how can you relate the two? Sure, they are both masks, but this is a game with a constantly growing collection of masks that could all be justified as related to Baldwin per your reasoning.   You know what seems to be convienient? By almost every tree, there is a manhole that, if you stand on it and look at the sun, a tree can be found almost directly underneath it.   I've just tested this and haven't found this to be true at all, except for only one tree found in front of the bank. Even with the perspective from that manhole, the sun is concealed partly behind the branches of the tree. Don't write what is false as true, you would have mislead all the people who didn't question the validity of your ""evidence"".   ""All I say... is that on top of my tree is a Star.""   Okay, here is where I blow my top off. How do you think this is related to the secret, at all? This is extremely overused in speculation to justify a lot of misconstrued ""clues"". Maybe if you hadn't known the context of this statement, you would think it's unique and a possible hint, but here's some context for you:    This was posted by Bo during the Christmas event (ha, get it, a star on top of a tree, like the holidays?) The entire thread was a parody of threads which begged for clues from the developers during the original secret Almir also contributed to the fake clues with another quote that was even more of a joke   Stop with the endless streams of obviously bullshit speculation. It's only contributing to the rotting of the subreddit's quality."

payday2secret,30vdue,Heroic_Sheperd,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"I really really don't want to sound like a dick, but if you are struggling to stealth H&T banks you really need to flesh out your skills in game before searching for the Secret.  Just for frame of reference, Payday: The Heist required every player in a 4 man crew to have completion of every heist on 145+.  Then once the drill was activated you had to survive 2 hours on 145+ until it opened.  This was no easy feat and there is a strong possibility the devs at Overkill will require the same perimeters when activating this Secret as well."
payday2secret,30cz8i,RedditOakley,9,Thu Mar 26 10:56:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel that you are finding the answers subjectively, rather than approaching this from an objective point of view. I say this because while it is true that there is the symbol for the alchemist's stone, there are also several other symbols and there's no reason to believe that symbol plays more of an important part than any other symbol up there.  Another reason I say this is because you are trying to justify a loose end from one of your previous posts, rather than approaching the issue from an objective, zero-sum point of view.  All that being said, the main issue I have with this whole thing is simply that the whole search for the alchemists stone is incredibly convoluted, complex and almost completely arbitrary. There have been hundreds upon hundreds of illustrations and texts that talk about creating the stone, and there's no reason to assume that one means anything more than the other.  Again, the issue is that you are trying to find an answer to a question you've created without actually referencing anything in the game. The green lion is just one of many intermediate steps named in one of a hundred ways. To be honest, you can find a reference that fits anything when it comes to green. Unless its explicitly linked to the secret, it doesn't mean anything.  For example, I could say that the green color is simply a representation of emerald, since its similar. Emerald, both the color and the gem, have several things linked to them, nothing that has any relation to any of this stuff.  Another example to do with color is the following: I noticed that Red, Blue, Green and Yellow are colors that are consistently repeated in Payday 2, and though I think that there's something going on with that, I don't feel that I have enough information to come and post anything here, because, as it is, it's just an interesting coincidence.  Now, putting all that aside, I'm not saying you shouldn't look for it, you should just be aware that there have been people around here working on the secret for over a year, and they've gone through hundreds of dead ends without any solid information. So when you post here, you should try your best to post a theory that has some kind of solid link or relation to payday 2, because as it is, it's just a fun fact and doesn't really give us anything concrete.  Oh and btw, there's Foie Gras paté in the Safehouse, on the kitchen tabletop :). So I actually think the most concrete thing you have there is the story by isaac newton and the whole ""green lion"" stuff is irrelevant. I will also probably say that the two most likely candidates for the ""Golden Egg"" (as I would like to call it) is either Nuclear Transmutation, or, more likely, Cold Fusion.   Edit* For some grammar and also to say this: Don't feel disheartened by what I say, I'm not trying to put you down or anything, doing your research on this led to the story of the Foie Gras paté, which I think is a concrete link. What I was trying to say is just that you have to put aside your personal opinions when it comes to something like this, simply because our expectations can muddy our work. You really have to be as objective as possible."
payday2secret,30cz8i,Lakitel,5,Sat Mar 28 10:10:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback, this is exactly the kind of post I was hoping to attract!  When you are trying to read up on things, compare it to items and patterns in-game it is so easy to suddenly find yourself in a position where you can't un-see those patterns you find, everything fits together a little too well from your own perspective and you start wondering if you're really just going crazy or if you have actually found something.  This is why I think it's important to post things under the Crazy Speculation tag since it lets you vent findings and then your peers can come in and say what parts if not all of them are actually complete bonkers, this lets people like me to get out of the crazytrail and start fresh, but as a side-effect of looking into the speculation some highly relevant info that nobody thought about before might come to light.  Even if my two threads do end up at the same point, and one attempts to justify the other, I decided not to combine the two as they are different types of speculation, the first one is based on observations in-game and this one is... entirely different.  I appreciate your opinion, we need more people like you."

If Overkill wants to make a proper secret they need to very slowly sneak it behind our backs and make adjustments when people aren't looking, or it's just going to get mined and discovered instantly. But I do think there are real hints already prepared for the eventual implementation of the trigger(s) so it's worth taking a look around and making your own notes of oddities and coincidences and save them for later."

payday2secret,303xgy,DarKobalt,2,Wed Mar 25 12:30:14 2015 UTC,"Sure you could skip from Diamond Store and directly to Car Shop but the only thing that would link those two is just the fact that there's a Falcogini retailer in both. I don't think that's enough to be honest, but if you make the detour into Big Oil we have the infinite energy engine which is a very unique item, creating a more solidified bridge over to Car Shop. The cars we steal also have the ""grenade repellant paint"" sign on them to reference the fact we as players always throw a grenade at the car in Mallcrashers, so it points to the beginning of the trail as well which is pretty cool.  _  I didn't want to add this to my trail theory because it's a bit wishywashy, but assuming that the 4 shirts represent the heisters and there's 6 items in total on the section, it could mean 4 (colors) of 6 (each), which would complete the link entirely to the carpet in the Diamond Store and thus make the link to Big Oil even greater. It could work like that as well as hinting us being able to drive, but as I was saying it's bending the meaning of ""4 of 6"" a little and I'm trying to avoid thinking like that in this."

payday2secret,301xlw,riki7119,1 point,Fri Mar 27 09:00:36 2015 UTC,"I have a strong suspicion there is no need for that. You have to think about how the map is programmed in terms of a level designer. While I may not be a level designer, I can imagine making a simple map where almost no one will know how its programmed should be like.   Firstly if you needed any prerequisite such as what you mention, you would need a trigger that indicates a failure. After spelling BALDWIN there is a code success that indicates something else is needed that we have to do. If it was something prerequisite it would of told us a failure right after loading a success. I may not be entirely right about how Payday 2 levels go but I assume its levels do not talk to each other unless something intermediate goes through. I assume so anyway. With the activation success code something should be triggered inside the map. Can be the deposit boxes, can be right after doing the code finish the level etc. I have a strong suspicion we just need to finish something IN that map or grab something which tells us the next clue. After I typed in BALDWIN I looked around that map for probably new level spawn or something but came up with nothing. Since maps have triggers that have to be programmed in, one can simply just decompile the map and look at what the trigger does, but that would be too easy and im sure people have tried this before."
payday2secret,301xlw,testingbeta123,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:23:22 2015 UTC,"But I'm basing the information requiring 4 players on the previous ARG.  In Payday: The Heist you could not shoot any cameras in the 2nd vault area, and you NEEDED 4 players to trigger it.  Perhaps in this ARG, the first step is no elimination of civilians, the 2nd step may be a code in the boxes as we are working out now, the 3rd step may be all 4 players standing around the table like I suggested. As it is now, the only area of suspicion I have where something could spawn is the building behind the Election Day 2 style gate down the street by the far Van spawn.  I imagine with the right trigger of events including all prerequisites met such as no civ killing and certain masks worn that gate will open up revealing a hidden building which you can now enter as it has now spawned successfully.  I'm not a level designer either, but I do know a series of events was required specifically to open the 1st ARG.  And until every part was met it remained not spawned."
payday2secret,301xlw,Heroic_Sheperd,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:53:55 2015 UTC,"I understand you reasoning behind it. I did the overdrill vault too haha. The thing was that that heist had clues that you needed 4 masks (you kinda had to since you needed to stand in that pattern) and you didn't have debug output telling you anything (not that the debug would tell you anything unless you had four players in that specific spot and the trigger hitting).  In any case, you may be right that we need 4 players but without a fail trigger that the baldwin code is giving there is no evidence to suggest you need four players or you don't need it.

I feel that just like with the first secret, there is some secret image that can be found by deciphering a audio trigger, and that we will have to stand in certain spots to open the secret vault / trigger an event. we know that there are radios all troughout the heists, so maybe one of them acts like the radio for PD:TH. It could also related to the fact that we never found the secret on the Diamond hesit. That secret could be the audio cue. Maybe you can change an audio tape thats in Hoxton Revenge.  TL;DR  maybe spelling baldwin is only the first step in unveiling this mystery, and a non-deposit box related event must occur. we may have to stand in certain positions like in the PD:TH secret, as there are many radios that could play and audio message telling us where to stand (like in PD:TH). maybe investigate Hoxton Revenge's audio tapes?

Don't forget the numbers!  Additionally, maybe the code is tied to the deposit box object itself, and not specifically to the map; remember that several other maps have these same deposit boxes (Big Bank being the biggest suspect for holding the secret, what with that door in the floor of the lobby.)

payday2secret,301xlw,369andy,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:40:23 2015 UTC,Do you know if its possible to dump the debug information into a text file? That would help sort through triggers that are not secret related and possibly any triggers that fly by with the multitude of other triggers activating.
payday2secret,301xlw,Goss100,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:30:07 2015 UTC,having it dump to a text file is inferior to having just a larger box area or more text displayed live. imagine trying to remember what exactly you were doing at which point just by looking at the timestamps. granted it would be easier if you had a recording to use with the text.
payday2secret,301xlw,stryka00,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:26:14 2015 UTC,Not really. If it dumped to a text file and you know certain triggers are not secret related then you can easily remove the line with a batch file. This will clean out alot of the mess through the dump and show triggers that you would be interested in and as you say with the timestamp you can get relevant actions related. If it is displayed live you have thousands of triggers happening at once in a very busy screen which can easily obscure the trigger you would be interested in. Dumping to a text file is NOT the same as making a larger console display. You can manipulate said text file vs a console display which you can not.

I've also held this belief, specifically that the real diamond was already stolen by someone else.  If you notice the room to the right (facing the Diamond entrance) before you enter the pre-diamond chamber there is an open window above.  This has been there since release and has continued to always spawn that way even after the host bug hotfix, the 20 preplanning asset hotfix, the Deathwish inner camera spawn hotfix, and possibly more JUST for the diamond alone.

payday2secret,2zp85u,IdekWhatToNameThis,2,Fri Mar 20 15:31:56 2015 UTC,It is to tell speed runners players how to unlock new characters. This has nothing to do with the secret.

payday2secret,2zjrh0,ViperiousFX,5,Thu Mar 19 05:36:35 2015 UTC,Hmm. Both reflections look like (despite me never playing it) the diamond heist's pre-vault room. Either it's just a basic cool looking reused reflection or it's a hint of both what heist to start on AND what masks to wear.
payday2secret,2zjrh0,Yeonus,4,Thu Mar 19 08:16:04 2015 UTC,The lights in the reflection are not used on any heist in PD2.  It looks to be a white box that hangs from the ceiling.  I also see wooden beams similar to those in the Big Bank managers offices.

This was also the first complete match to images in Bain's Guide, the Ressurection of Christ painting in Rats day 1 is similar to an image, but not near as close of a match as this one is.  Also Big Bank is the Payday 2 reenvision of First World Bank, where the first ARG was in.  2) Pandora's Box  Found in Big Bank as well, points slightly southwest, is a unique loot to only this map.  And in relation to the mural mentioned above if using that arrow as guidance immediately southwest of the mural you will find tiles on the floor which match those found in the first world bank tile puzzle, as well as the Benevolent Bank logo which has arrows that match the original style of the arrows indicating locations for players to trigger the 1st Overvault.  It also points to a multitude of odd light fixtures (depending on which mislead the Cagliostro is interpreted as) and in the image a key is hidden within the light."
payday2secret,2yeypc,Heroic_Sheperd,2,Tue Mar 10 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"This is an idea my buddy and me had for weeks or months now and no offense but I don't think you should do a vote on this. What we do is go through all the maps and look for things that are clearly off or directly link to Bain's Guide. For example the big artwork on the wall in Benevolent Bank. Or the classic, the roman 2 on the walls in Jewelry Store. Write all of these down in a systematic way. Have all of it in one place. combine, google, check facts. Don't let Pareidolia get the better of you. Do not ask Almir for clues on the secret, he won't tell anything. I'm not sure if he'll help at all but this is one excellent example of how not to do it. (Yes, I am aware that this most likely was not meant serious.)  I personally think that we'll only advance when someone has a big breakthrough with all the existing data or OVERKILL - a Starbreeze Studio wants us to progress."
payday2secret,2yeypc,nynyhox,2,Tue Mar 10 00:03:44 2015 UTC,"No offense taken, and while you may have a point, I feel that you are ignoring one main aspect of this whole thing: Interpretation.  See, where as you might say that page 4 is clearly referencing Big Bank, some others might say that that it's clearly referencing Big Oil. I personally would probably say that page 4 is a red herring, and that the whole ""Light is the key"" thing actually means ""Light WAS the key"" because the guy is looking away and the arrow is pointing in the other direction that he is facing, so it could mean that the it was in the past.  Now, how do you overcome the issue of differing interpretations? Well, if you look at Biblical scholarship, and specifically, the critical study of the synoptic gospels, there's something called Criterion of Multiple Attestation. What this essentially means is that when one or more gospels say the same thing, then it's very likely that it is ""authentic""  So, using a similar methodology, I am trying to see where everybody is generally pointing to, and trying to follow that. In fact, I think your system is worse, because it's trying to brute force the problem, rather than approaching it in a more targeted sense.  Now its my turn to mean no offense, but I don't know how long you've been here, but I've been around the payday 2 secret for a while, and that whole II on the jewelry store has been around from the start and there's been zero corroborating evidence that it means anything.   I feel the main issue your logic is that you assume there's such a thing as ""clearly"" and ""directly"" when it comes to searching for something we don't even know. You can't just claim that a systematic search of the whole game including game files will find something, especially because that's already happened. If anything its more likely that the secret isn't in there yet.  To add to all that, there's no reason why I shouldn't at least TRY asking Almir. Let me remind you that the Payday:The Heist secret was found primarily because of a developer comment. Ruling out the possibility that we will get an answer is just bad technique in my opinion.  And yeah, of course we won't advance until we have a big breakthrough, but we aren't going to have a breakthrough if we don't concentrate our effort. And we especially won't have a breakthrough if we shoot blindly into the wind or brute force the answer."
payday2secret,2yeypc,Heroic_Sheperd,2,Tue Mar 10 08:38:39 2015 UTC,"See, where as you might say that page 4 is clearly referencing Big Bank, some others might say that that it's clearly referencing Big Oil.    Yes, way back before Big Bank there were several theories as to where Page 4 fit, including Firestarter as well.  But it is undeniably linked to Big Bank after release/discovery of the mural.every piece fits it with no explanation needed.  Big Oil only had a tree, wow that's a solid link.  And Firestarter had an arrow, a airline lighthouse, and a fire with everything needing to stretch the speculation a little bit.     I feel that you are approaching the problem from your perspective, and ingoring the fact that there's no such thing as ""clearly/directly"" with the current information we have.   But there is, our 1 constant is Bain's Guide and that you use those pages to assist in the secret hunt.  We have 2 1/2 SOLID connections to that guide, the Mural in Big Bank, Cagliostro.txt in Hoxton Breakout, and the 1/2 connection is the resurrection of Christ painting in Rats.  I am only willing to give that one a partial, as it is very similar to page 2, but not as much as the Mural in Big Bank.  We do also have DIRECT connections to the original ARG in various heists.  These are a little more lenient to interpretation of whether they correlate with the Payday 2 Secret though.  The rugs in both Big Oil 2, and Rats 2 are without a doubt the same as those found in Counterfeit to solve the tile puzzle.  The radios found in Safehouse, Go Bank and Big Oil 1 are similar to Counterfeit (regarding the static sound clue) in that they play music and can be shot to turn it off.  Big Oil also has an empty pool, once again another connection to Counterfeit which was a very important heist to solving the ARG.  Big Bank floor tiles match that of First World Bank's tile puzzle, and is already widely accepted as the reimagination of First World Bank which we all know is where the 1st ARG was found in.  Big Bank is one of the only heists in which on Deathwish the cameras still can be destroyed, which we know from 1st ARG is important.  The Benevolent Bank's logo also matches the arrows found when player positioning to activate the original Overdrill.    So yes, there is such a thing as Clearly/Direct in terms of connections to the 1 official clue we were given from the start as well as assets which were important to the 1st ARG.  However their usefulness is still unknown as of right now.  But as you requested us in the OP to document, these are right now the only actual clues we have to work on."

You can start interpreting the moment you have enough solid material that you know can be interpreted. By this I mean: Don't start interpreting when you see there's a mention of ""Secret"" ingame, start interpreting when you are sure that this is indeed a clue and not just a regular line of dialog. (Referring to Hotline Miami day one.)   See, where as you might say that page 4 is clearly referencing Big Bank, some others might say that that it's clearly referencing Big Oil.   Nowhere in Big Oil have I seen a painting that this closely resembles the page itself. But in Benevolent Bank, it's plainly obvious right on the wall. Everything else you list is interpretation which I did not list as a clue. I must admit, it's quite obvious to read ""Light is Key"" from the Bain's Guide page but the only thing we know for sure is that there's a mural in Benevolent Bank that depicts something from Bain's Guide that clearly it can hardly be a coincidence.   I think your system is worse, because it's trying to brute force the problem, rather than approaching it in a more targeted sense.   Honestly, I don't get it. Isn't it rather the other way around? Targetted looking for the obvious instead of brute forcing your way through possible interpretations?   I don't know how long you've been here   Long enough, longer than this reddit account exists. And again, I'm not stating the roman numbers mean anything, I'm just noting it's there.   You can't just claim that a systematic search of the whole game including game files will find something, especially because that's already happened.   I'm not claiming that, I suggest to write it all together systematically so you have a good overview of what we have.   To add to all that, there's no reason why I shouldn't at least TRY asking Almir.   One might argue that it's just a waste of everybody's time but what I wanted to say is that you shouldn't ask him for clues. I have multiple times tried myself to ask him about specific findings and asking to confirm it's not Pareidolia. To be clear: Go ahead, ask for clues, hope for an answer. Don't ask for clues but show that you actually tried to find a thing and just receive a "";)"" or maybe even an actual answer."
payday2secret,2yeypc,nynyhox,2,Tue Mar 10 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one unfortunately :P  We simply have different approaches to addressing the problem, and tbh they could both lead to nothing.    I think Bain's guide is more than enough material to start interpreting, something that started day one, before looking into the guides. Big oil actually was the main target before the Big Bank Heist came along. A LOT of the discussion was around the possibility that day 2 of Big Oil held some aspect of the secret. The main evidence of this was the tree on page4 resembling the tree in the villa, as well as a graph on a screen in the lab. I also feel you kind of missed my point in this, which is that one person could say ""Light is key"" and another could say ""Light WAS key"". Thats what I meant by differing interpretations. I might have understood your method wrong, but from what I read you want to go through all the maps systematically and take a catalog of all things that are clearly/directly related to bain's guide. I will admit that maybe calling it brute forcing might have been a strong word to use, but the reality of the situation is that this is where the community is at: We have gone through all the levels and picked stuff that we interpret as being clearly/directly linked to Bain's guide. As you can see, it's just a hodge podge of things.   I feel that you are approaching the problem from your perspective, and ingoring the fact that there's no such thing as ""clearly/directly"" with the current information we have. What we do have is a few hints here and there that there might be something, but we don't have anything definite for sure. You can point to the mural in Big Bank, but for all you know, it could be a red herring. To be honest, considering the fact that the Big Bank comes almost directly from PD:TH is more of a reference to the past secret, then it is to the current one.   Fair enough, then you should be aware that Big Oil was the main suspect before Big Bank came along. Well, if you want to systematically go through every single file of the game, you're more than welcome to, but I doubt it will bring up anything. Consider the fact that the inside of the vault doesn't actually exist in-game until you open the vault door, whereupon it spawns. That means you could clip through the walls and find nothing where the vault should be. That, along with the fact that there's probably several layers of obfuscation going on, it's very unlikely that something is going to be found simply by doing that.  By taking what you said a bit less literally, we fall into the same problem as 2 and 3, which is what is clear/direct to you, might not be for others and vice-versa. I think if you read my original post, you'll see that I never said I asked him about a clue. I just asked him about the current state of the secret. So I don't think we have a disagreement on that one.     Ultimately, I think that you should sit and write down what you define as clear/direct evidence, and make a post about that, telling people to do a similar thing I did here. Or if you want, I could tack it on this post :).   Either way, my point is I want to galvanize the community and get us working on something, instead of just idle talking and crazy speculation."

I think Bain's guide is more than enough material to start interpreting, something that started day one, before looking into the guides.   It was there since the beginning and nowhere I remember is written ""Wait for the Baldwin search until I give the signal!"" so I guess I can only agree. The only question is really how to interpret (read: Methodology) and if we already have everything for the clues to make sense.   Big oil actually was the main target before the Big Bank Heist came along.   I remember that. ""The payout suggests there is gold to be found! There are mushrooms!"" - All I said was that the mural was directly referenced in Benevolent Bank, I totally agree that there are just as many good leads to be found in Big Oil.   As you can see, it's just a hodge podge of things.   I read ""hodge podge"" as a collection of information that is not written down cleanly mixed with a LOT of (wild) speculation. And that's why you started this thread I guess.   I think if you read my original post, you'll see that I never said I asked him about a clue.   Actually, you kind of did ask him for a clue. I tried that the last time we had an audience with the great bearded one, not very successful. You see why I discourage to ask Almir specific kinds of questions.   I think that you should sit and write down what you define as clear/direct evidence   I started a nice markdown-file with the Diamond Heist which I since hesitated to continue working on for a few reasons. One of these being some unconfirmed things that Almir has refused to answer on in a way that made me think and probably put way too much weight into his choice of words.   Either way, my point is I want to galvanize the community and get us working on something, instead of just idle talking and crazy speculation.   I'd love to see it work."
payday2secret,2yeypc,maimihn,2,Wed Mar 11 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"Heads up, this is mostly speculation. Largely influenced by http://www.reddit.com/r/payday2secret/comments/2c4x4y/page_2_does_it_relate_to_baldwin_or_cagliostro/    One thing that can't be denied, now, is the importance of Cagliostro. ""The Guide of Bain"", with a piece of tape covering Cagliostro. Cagliostro, who was referenced on the Dentist's portion of the corkboard in the Hoxton Breakout. Not only that, but the recurring trend of ""1792"", appearing in Roman numberals in the same book.    Hoxton, who's character pack brought about the Nova Shank, not unlike the nail transformed into a spike, completely altering it's appearance if not for the head of the nail, by Cagliostro, in 1792. Reference: http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/forum/f08n03p207_cagliostro.htm    Also, in 1792, the ""Hope Diamond"" (of which, THE Diamond is based) was stolen, in France. http://www.historyandheadlines.com/september-11-1792-famous-diamond-world-stolen-hope-diamond/    In Shadow Raid, when you steal a painting, Bain remarks ""That's an original Gustav!"", perhaps referring to the painter Gustav Klimt. However, King Gustav III had several self portraits, and was killed in March of 1792. Perhaps this is a happy coincidence.    So, what other significance is CGO and 1792? I'm not sure. Everything else that I've researched ventures too far away from anything game related. May have to wait for the casino heist to drop before we can piece it together."

Honestly though, I wasn't trying to skip anything that we've uncovered, I just think that a lot of people stand in a lot of different places. We have whole posts dedicated to each page of the guide and all the information is too spread out. For all we know, we could have already found a solid clue but it's lost in the noise. That's why I'm making this post, so we can re-focus, instead of get side-tracked.  I'm sure there's lots of valid and interesting ideas that are at the last few pages of this subreddit and while I would love to go through them all and collate all the information, I don't have nearly enough time :P.  As for your example of bain's guide, I'm not asking anybody to skip it at all. In fact, I'm asking people to pick a theory or concept that has been developed so far, as the one with the most merit. Meaning that instead of us having two sides saying ""The clue is in Big Oil Day 2"" and ""The clue is in Big Bank"", we have a vote, and we decide by numbers which one has more merit.  I should probably clarify at this point that I don't necessarily think that this is the best way to do it, but given the current situation, I'd rather look at what most of us agree on, rather than have a new theory/concept coming up every other day.

It brought all the crazy nonsense and forced it to a single concise/related stream of lesser nonsense.  This time around we have absolutely nothing concrete except bains book, which although is helpful with being the sort of ""funnel"" i described before, doesnt help a whole hell of a lot with limiting the possibilities of the secret.

A few possibilities based on Dasil's picture.    Perhaps the 4 characters have to stand in spots and/or wear masks that correspond to the player (I dont remember if its based on the character you pick or the order in which you joined, so meaning the blue, green, orange, and red that each player gets at the bottom of the screen. see here http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/payday/images/1/19/218620_screenshots_2014-06-29_00001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141004032301 ) Maybe you have to ""follow"" the path by movement in game or by passing a loot bag around in order to get to a certain point on the Kabbalah my guess would be either Crown or Grace. In the image I posted, there is the world of stars which is the area in between the paths The lovers, The emperors, Strength, and sorry but I cannot read what it says in that dark blue line, it is almost in the exact middle of the room.

The balloon quote so the Balloon image. 5. Cagliostro said to be prisoned for more than 5 years and died around 26-28 August 1795. Prisoner image.  The only image that's left out is the tree with the crown image, which I don't know in which place it fits. Also I wanna mention that all the BDN images fits perfectly with Tarot cards and even the alchemist image has nothing to do with alchemy symbols rather than Tarot card symbols.

payday2secret,2xno8g,TheDutchUndertaker,-1,Tue Mar 3 07:11:18 2015 UTC,"Uhmm... Fact 1: PD:TH Secret included a temple build l long before 1792.  Fact 2: PD:TH Secret included a historical figure long before 1792. Fact 3: PD2 Secret included 2 historical figures, Cagliostro and Baldwin. Fact 4: PD2 Secret contains images which you can easy see that it's not modern images rather than old. Fact 5: All my findings required the easiest google search because I don't believe the solution would be in the 99th page of my google search rather than the first 3-4 results. So go type to google ""Cagliostro 1792"" which is actually the only leads we have."
payday2secret,2xno8g,ViperiousFX,3,Tue Mar 3 12:04:15 2015 UTC,"Fact 1: No one has figured out why the temple was included, or if it had any significance.

Fact 3: For all we know they're just tie-ins and have zero relevance to solving the secret, much like the previous fact. Fact 4: As far as we're concerned, they might as well be from the goddamned future. Fact 5: Not actually a fact. Well, it is, but not of any import, because you sure as hell won't find an answer to the secret from a google search. As sebastian put it, everything required to solve the first secret was created and provided by Overkill. To think they'd do differently this time around is nonsensical and counter-productive."

Do I really need to make the conversation with you and point out why can't be from the future but from the past? Fact 5: Google search you say... have fun --> http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3266444 .   Now that I covered all that, can we get back to solving the secret?"

But, based on the ARG entry in the Payday wiki, I'm pretty certain no one actually properly figured out why the temple was significant. Then again all the threads from the last ARG are in the old Steam forums and searching those is an absolute nightmare.  Fact 2: The historical Baldwin never wore a mask. That part of the puzzle was based off of a movie where the director thought it would be cool if he did. Shit, some people even made the logical jump from just the Aurum X image meaning you need gold masks without even mentioning the Baldwin part.  Fact 3: See above. Also, people who tend to think of themselves as bigshots often refer to themeselves as ""the next ____"", yes? Probably the case here, except fully adopting the previous owner's name as a handle. This is the case until someone can prove otherwise.  Fact 4: I was trolling you because when the images are from is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT.  Fact 5: That was both incredibly lucky and a huge shot in the dark. It could have just as easily turned out to be nothing. I highly doubt Overkill is going to set up similar circumstances more than once, and we sure as hell won't find anything until they want us to.  Please, by all means, go back solving the secret.

If you don't have the time or something to investigate further, just ask someone on these forums if they can help you. But the most important thing of all is that we work together. If you do find something important and you post it here, we can all take a look at it from a different angle, which might help us get further. So stop fighting, and let's play together.

I agree that some theories are misleading but ALL the theory that has been posted in the past have absolutely no connection to the secret. Your theory is just one of those fact/speculation, but neither you or nor us can be sure if this will lead to the secret. Theres no point keeping a clue or speculation to yourself. The purpose of this subreddit is to simply share ideas of the secret. And ANY thoughts and theory should be welcomed to this. From there on, its up to the readers to decide if they can spread out the theory or just ignore it as mumbo-jumbo......Now moving on to your theory, it sounds very interesting, but again I dont see anything so special or golden in this theory."
payday2secret,2xno8g,Heroic_Sheperd,4,Mon Mar 2 13:24:03 2015 UTC,"Of course all that is just a theory, everything is just a theory until it's either proven or not. The thing is, that not all theories are the same. For example if you got a map and you see something that this something in your mind has a small connection to something you only think that has to do with the secret then it's bullshit. But on the other hand if you take the things you know so far and build on then you might actually find something, your chances are bigger. People are just going around maps looking for the weirdest crap ever and connect them to the secret in a crazy theory, that's not how you solve a problem. You have to follow steps. What we know so far? We only have the Bain's guide with the images, we have Cagliostro, Codex Raptus, 1792, etc etc. This is your first step. From there you begin to look for more clues, not from the last dlc that has a damn flickering light or a car sign has some numbers on it that might need for the secret. And no, not all thoughts/theories should be welcomed here. I did the same mistake in my first post, when I posted something known for a long time etc and I actually wasted peoples time instead of helping. If you find something interesting keep it to yourself until you can actually make a plausible connection with the secret, otherwise its a distraction. Sorry if I'm aggressive, I'm just fed up with all that posts lately.."
payday2secret,2xno8g,TheDutchUndertaker,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:16:52 2015 UTC,"You're not getting the point. Every theory is welcomed, however it is UP TO the people who reads it. If you dont think its relevant to the secret, just ignore it and stop winging about it. Starting from the codex raptus is coming to a dead end at the moment. Not only those ""crazy speculations"" but the ""theories that are based from codex raptus"" are also crazy... None of those theories have led us to any kind of hidden clues. So even if you start from codex raptus, people will eventually come to some crazy theory and sometimes waste peoples time. Another possible approach to a mystery solving is simply creating a two dot and making a line in between them.  For example you can create a dot of codex raptus, and connect it to the flickering light (maybe). We just have not enough information. Therefore I see that EVERY information is valuable to us. If you feel it isn't valuable....just leave it, go on to the next. Anyone who responds to those ""bulls**t theories"" are people who can't see whats valuable and not valuable to the secret. Also, some of the members who solved PD:TH secret are looking in to the flickering light from the diamond heist trailer. So, I think it's not completely foolish to look into the light thing as well."

My thoughts (and crazy theories too) match perfectly with what you presented with just one difference: I don't think we will be able find The Secret for now, for I believe it is not in the game yet, but I believe that we may trigger new clues.  And we might start with this search group thing, too, so, add me on Steam: Tempest. With a Gambit (from X-Men) avatar."
payday2secret,2vn401,tempestliar,3,Thu Feb 12 14:16:20 2015 UTC,"I think you've got some really good stuff but we can't activate anything without more clues. I wouldn't limit it to just Bain's contracts though ... Plenty of nods towards the Secret in other contacts.  The variables are way too wide right now for us to nail down anything. I'm not trying to discourage you one bit, in all honesty. Keep at it! Nothing will be learned, or gained, by accepting stumbling blocks for what they are ... Just part of the journey.  I also don't think we can find the Secret but for different reasons than tempestliar stated. I think we have most of the triggers figured out already but are missing a small piece or two ... Which would not allow us to activate it. If you look at the timeline from the 1st ARG in P:TH, people could have activated the first trigger but had no clue which tiles, or pattern of tiles, to press once they got into the 2nd room. It wasn't until the DLC was released with the 2nd part of the clue ... The rug pattern which matched the second room from FWB.  It could take a combination of positioning, skills, masks, weapons, & certain specific criteria, place a bag in a spot for example, to activate the trigger. We are going to have to do something out of the ordinary to, eventually, do something hard ... Essentially.  It's finding out that combination that is the struggle. I also don't think OK wants us to find it yet. I DO think the Secret is in the game but I think there are multiple ARGs also. Big Oil has the ""party"" on Day 2 that nobody has been able to activate yet ... While it could be written to throw off the people who dissect the actual coding of the game, I don't think they would leave that large of a chunk of ""junk"" for nothing. You're talking about coding for a full day's heist that's just sitting there for nothing more than to take up space ... Well, the coding for NPCs at least. The map is already done for normal BO Day 2 operations. It would be like OK coding the coke deal in BO day 1 but it never being used. but leaving it there.  My current line of thinking ... What's to follow is completely based off of my own personal opinion ... Take it with a grain of salt as I do. It's REALLY easy to fall down the rabbit hole heh  ARGs are in a Bank Heist map (for reasons you've stated), Big Bank, Big Oil, & The Diamond  Clues are in Shadow Raid, Rats, Firestarter, & Hoxton's Breakout ... Probably in Hotline Miami & others but these tend to stick out the most in my mind.  I keep feeling like we will have 2-3 ""clues"" per ARG that will give us the triggers to activate it ... Aside from that, I can't make any actual connections just yet."

I'm gathering from what you wrote that somebody went into the game code and found some unused code for some kind of ""party"" but what are the details exactly?

The only info I ever hold back is the REALLY crazy stuff in my head & I don't post it because ... Well, it's mostly drunken theory ... Or other leafy substances that may or may not cross my path. The multiple ARG thing is about as far as I would go ...  I'll give you an example that made me chuckle at myself & take a step back ... In the manager's office in BB, there are rafters that you can get to by via the roof skylight. If where is you spawn is the South part of the map & the vault is the North part, you would stand on those rafters & look South ... Even SSW if you are in the center of the room. When you do that, you would notice some boards that don't match up. I've tried shooting the area, tossing grenades, ecms, doc bags, ammo bags ... & nothing.

payday2secret,2vn401,CajunDeauxBoy,1 point,Fri Feb 13 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"Hahah, yeah I get you, I tend to come across leafy substances from time to time, although I consider that time as doing my best work :P.  Your right, it does look weird, but tbh, its probably just bugged textures or something like that. I had a similar thing with the reflections in the safehouse, I was convinced that there was a reason they all gave 2 specific reflections, but ultimately, they probably are just an issue with incorrectly done textures/reflections (as everybody at the time tried to tell me :P)  Tbh, the more I think about it, the more I think we're all going in waaaaay to deep to try and find the secret, and its probably looking at us in the face anyway.   4 things come to my mind recently to be honest:  1) In a recent AMA with the composer/sound guy of PD2 (His name escapes me) somebody had asked about a hint to the secret, and he just smilled and didn't say anything, which makes me think that he's involved or in on the secret somehow. This brings me back to a post I made 8 months ago about there being some kind of code in the music of PD2. Now I didn't go through every piece of music/sound in the game, but here's the topic in case you'd like to read up on the work I did: http://www.reddit.com/r/payday2secret/comments/278h4m/code_in_the_music/  2) The other thing which springs to my mind, is that I've noticed the smoke that appears in the bank heist vault is becoming much more pronounced, and it appears at times when there shouldn't be any smoke. What I mean by that is that smoke should only appear during Firestarter day 3, and it has no place being there during other heists where you are only stealing gold/cash.   This means either one of two things: Either there is some bad programming where a trigger for the smoke wasn't removed, and therefore it appears on all heists, or, there's something significant about that vault, possibly that something is happening ""behind it"" or ""below it"" if that makes any sense.  3) Trying to search for hidden rooms in any heists is inherently dangerous because all maps have built in empty spots for the RNG. Something like the vault in the bank heist for example can be in one of 2 places. So first, we would have to rule out which empty spots are for the RNG and then we can start looking for empty spots that might hide a secret. Although that brings another point, what if the secret spot is also RNG, meaning it could occupy one of several empty spots? That brings a whole new level of trouble to looking for it  4) Finally, I very much doubt that OVK would use the same tricks they used in PD:TH for the secret. This makes me think that a lot of stuff we are looking into are red hearings.   For example, I doubt the secret is going to be in a bank again, although, it may very well be in something related to money. One of the spots circled on the map in the safe house corresponds to the IMF in real life, some people have also said that the treasury is also a location that is referenced. This makes me think that the secret is probably NOT in a bank, but some other location that has something to do with money. It also makes me think that the secret is probably not gold in a vault, like in PD:TH, but is more probably a sarcophagus or some form of antiquity, a la dan brown style.   I'm also not very convinced that specific masks are required, since thats already been done in PD:TH. If anything, the masks probably hold a clue. In another post I made around 8 months ago when I was active here, posited that the trigger is actually the skill trees. Meaning that each person had to have all their points in one tree (Mastermind, Enforcer, ect.) and that each person had a specific action they needed to do. I mention this because on the second page of bain's guide, the 4 characters seem to represent the 4 classes in the game (Minus fugitive, which was just added recently). The guy in armor is the enforcer. The other three I'm not sure, but I was thinking that the guy in the back holding a flag pole is the mastermind, the guy on the floor is the technician, and the guy holding the sack is the ghost.  Anyway, I've gone on long enough with this reply, so I'll just leave it at that :P"
payday2secret,2vn401,Lakitel,1 point,Sat Feb 14 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"Well as time goes by, I'm getting more and more convinced that the PD:TH ARG has something to do with PD2 ARG. Maybe we have to apply the same method from PD:TH here to reveal our first clue?Or something like that. But I gotta run some tests first before I will be able to say more. Until then its just long shot theories."
payday2secret,2vn401,CajunDeauxBoy,1 point,Sat Feb 14 13:34:41 2015 UTC,"1) Simon Viklund is his name ... I've heard some other people mentioning that too. I haven't found anything timing-wise that seems out of place but I'm not a musical genius. I do play & can read sheet music ... Slower when I play some instruments heh. It might be something with the sound waves themselves. I have no clue how to dig into that stuff though  2) That smoke bugs me also ... The phone in the manager's office rings at :30 but you can't pick it up. Footprints that walk into boxes. I've always wanted to do speed ecm rushes to see if something happens ... Never have enough takers.   3) Totally agree ... Still plenty of spots though, even on the BHs. I think it would be on a handful of the RNG possible maps that the assets align. Might be too much work making variations of variations. Like the VIP lounge in BB & then having the vault in the right spot ... I wouldn't think the timelock door would figure in but who knows.  4)Maybe the BH's have a clue then ... Nobody has any real clue as to if you need specific masks or not. It easy to latch onto that thought, obviously, but you could be right. There are MANY more masks, & combos within, to make it a nightmare to find the match & especially for 4 different heisters.  The skill tree thing is something that's peaked my interest after the Tabula Rasa ach came out.  For some reason 3, instead of 4, heisters is what I keep seeing from Bain's second image ... There was another one that I thought we would need 3 people instead of 4. Highly possible it's another wild tangent but I wonder if we only need 3 people for some parts? Or maybe someone is supposed to be in custody"
payday2secret,2vn401,Lakitel,1 point,Sun Feb 15 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"1) Yeah, that's the guy. Although, he might just be aware of the secret, rather than taking part in it, so we might just be running up a dead alley here.   2) Its actually quite annoying because you can hear the phone across the map really, and that doesn't seem normal. The big problem is that with so many bugs in the game, you can't be sure of what IS a bug and what ISN'T a bug, which tends to complicate the issue immensly. Either way, I'd be more than happy to do an ECM rush with you if you like, you can add me on steam, my steam name is ""ominos"", and I have the vitruvian man as my profile pic.  3) Maybe. From what I was reading around this sub-reddit, the vault in BH only appears once the vault door opens, so a no clipping mod wouldn't help. This leads me to believe that all no clipping/teleport attempts at finding the secret and failing, hasn't given us any new clues. We actually have to trigger the thing to make it appear.   4) One suggestion that does spring to mind actually is the difficulty masks. Its possible that each person needs to wear a different difficult mask to trigger the secret. Although, I feel that this answer is a bit too obvious, and I don't really see a reference to it in bain's guide.  I'm curious as to why you think its 3 people instead of 4? There are 4 people in the 2nd image after all.   I also agree with you that it's highly likely that somebody needs to be in custody. In the 10th image, you can see several numbers, maybe this corresponds to how many times that character has to be downed. Either way, the person in the 10th image, corresponds to the person in the 2nd image, so I think its the Ghost character that needs to be in custody, at least thats the conclusion I came to when I was researching.  Another thing I considered as very likely, is that the person in the 4th image is an allusion to the mastermind. What he's doing looks pretty much like the spotter skill. So I think the 4th image is describing what the Mastermind has to do, and the 10th image is describing what the Ghost has to do.  I also somewhat feel that shadows has something to do with the secret, maybe some kind of clue. The shadows that appear in the guide are not representative of the scene they are in, such as in the 9th image, where the shadow doesn't correspond to the character drawn.   Another thing that's come to my mind recently is that this day/night cycle thing will probably play a part in the secret. The constant referencing of stars, as well as light being the key, I'm thinking that part of the trigger or some clue lies in a heist that takes place at night. It also helps that a quite a few of the scenes depicted in the guide take place at night.  As for the Tabula Rasa achievement, you may already know that it means Blank Slate, but it has another use in computing: ""In computer science, tabula rasa refers to the development of autonomous agents with a mechanism to reason and plan toward their goal, but no ""built-in"" knowledge-base of their environment. Thus they truly are a blank slate.""  This may very well be a tongue-in-cheek reference to people who hunt for the secret, since we are trying to reach our goal, but we have no references or understanding of our ""environment"" to actually do so."

Going all Jim Carrey here (Number 23 movie). Most of the stuff in PD2 adds up to 12. 12 in the dollar bill menu screen, Rats day 3 bus is 2316 (I dont remember the order of the numbers but I think this is it) which adds to 12, Firestarter day 1 max amount of bags is 12, Bank heists has 120 deposit boxes, Shadow Raid max amount of bags 24(two times 12) etc etc. I can keep up like this for over an hour and I will end up making no sense. :P"

But to find an actual clue and not just theories. About the BO Party and the code that is unused, I'm not sure if its connected to the Secret, well it could be, but my thoughts about it is that OVK is planning to release a new heist with it, like they did with Framing Frame and Art Gallery. So the party could be something like that, and possible 5 Euro expensive DLC ( :P ). And yeah possibly there are more than 1 ARG this time around. And I strongly believe the first clues will be found inside Bain's Job and maybe including the first ARG too that will guide you to the next, it is just theory though."
payday2secret,2vn401,DarKobalt,2,Fri Feb 13 08:15:39 2015 UTC,"As for the First world Bank papers, I'm sure it also spawns in the car shops from Diamond Store and Hoxton Breakout.

payday2secret,2vn401,tempestliar,2,Thu Feb 12 15:53:52 2015 UTC,"This is a very well researched and thought out theory. I'm new to the whole ARG game too, (but i have been playing pd2 since release). I think you have quite a lot of date here and it is quite clear that you are very thorough while gathering it. I think what you prepose is interesting, but obviously the connections aren't there yet. They probably exist we just need to find em. A lot of my research has lead me to believe that we should look closer at anything to do with diamonds or jewelry first. The other place i think you could log some time in is the safehouse! I'm sure there is stuff there that could help with your stuff. I'm really exited about your theory and I will be keeping a close eye on whatever else you find! The hunt for baldwin continues..."
payday2secret,2vn401,whiteyjps,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"Well I believe Jewelry Store and\or Diamond Store holds the first clues for the Secret but I can't seem to make the right connection so far. About the safehouse, well in the first place I thought the same, ""hey something must be here"", but now I'm not so sure anymore. They plan to add safe house customization so depending on the depth of the customization we will find out if there is something there, probably the things you wont be able to change. For example if you are able to remove the Lady's Justice statue then the statue has nothing to do with the secret and its there only for decoration."

It could do something like spawning a clue in those if triggers are matched... I'll try it on my next runs on the map. The boat picture on the side store on jewelry store is reused in Hotline Miami Day 2 (in the penthouse). About he compass things (both Fleur-de-lis and SSW compass from Big Bank), maybe we need to head SSW in the maps having Fleur-de-Lis, using these as the North origin.   I'd like to help you on your quest, feel free to add me on Steam (I'm usually playing only during the week-end, my steam pic looks like a distorted blue compass star)."
payday2secret,2vn401,whiteyjps,1 point,Thu Feb 12 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you. The footprints leads to 2 different Deposit Boxes letters (I think it was L and U or something like that, not sure though). And yes I tried opening only them but nothing happened, maybe other conditions needs to be met in order for something to happen. I 've got another theory for the Bank heists when I noticed something lately, Even if you choose Gold or Cash there is always gonna spawn one bag of the opposite. What I mean is if you choose Bank Heist Gold and open all the deposits, one money bag will spawn. And if you choose cash its the same, one gold bag will spawn. I found it really intriguing, I will see what I can do with it.  About the image I'm not talking about the big painting in the wall with the boat, I'm talking about the small black and white image about the door, so if we are talking about the same I will go check out the HO Day 2 in detail.   Well yeah I thought the same for the fleur de lis but some times it spawns vertically (In Jewelry store for example) so SSW would be underground. And it never spawns as one, it ussually is the whole floor or the whole wall covered with it, so even if you make a compass pointing SSW we need to find which Fleur de lis is the correct."

Maybe we need 4 people to stand on those footprints with certain masks, too.  And about the money bags spawning in Bank Gold and gold bags in Bank Cash, I've done a few Bank Cash and never got any gold bags, so I wouldn't trust on RNGness to create something out of it."

Number 1 i think we can all agree that it has to be Rats, due to the connection between the Bane's Guide image with a number one and the character looking like the reserrection of christ painting and the same painting showing up in the house in Rats.  Number 2 probably would be jewelry store or ukranian job, due to the roman number II inscribed in the wallpaper on the store itself.  Number 3 might be one of the heists with a sewers, like on the bane's guide image showing a sewer kind of thing with a roman number III on top."
payday2secret,2vceik,flyinghobo888,1 point,Mon Feb 9 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"I figure this is as good a spot as any to throw out a few interesting details I found. I actually worked an angle from Baldwin and King which gave me something relating to 1792.  Abraham Baldwin (half brother of Henry Baldwin, Supreme Court Justice and Mason) was among the signatories of the original US Constitution and there are archives of his correspondence with President George Washington in 1792 on the appointment of a Mr King to federal office. Prior to that he had been offering recommendations for the head of the mint. I dont know if it is of any relevance, but it has a large amount of confluence with things we've been looking for and doesnt seem to have been looked into much before.   Edit: A little further reading shows that the individual he recommended to head the mint did not receive the job, and in fact opted to work as an agent of the Scioto Company in France. This is interesting as it ties with the French royal details as indicated in the following excerpt from Britannica about Gallipolis:   The third oldest European settlement in Ohio, it was founded in 1790 by the Scioto Company for Royalists fleeing the French Revolution who had been deceived by agents of the company into purchasing land certificates that were worthless."
payday2secret,2vceik,fearghul,2,Mon Feb 9 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"Scioto Company   As a small thing to add on to that, I also found a guy named Joel Barlow who has a very similar background to Baldwin. Probably no significance, but the similarities are rather odd."

payday2secret,2vceik,fearghul,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the most important point there is that the Coinage act was passed in 1972 and established the US Mint. The other facts are potentially interesting, but they dont really relate to the Payday universe as they're of exceedingly limited concern to heisters. I think that the white house itself is out since there isnt actually much of value to steal and it would be more of a terrorist attack than one with potential profit motive.  This would tie in with Baldwin writing to recommend someone involved in a scam to head the Mint in this year. The fact that Baldwin is clearly linked with currency and a code in the lobby screens would go along with this.  I'd also have to point out that the Treasury building in Washington is directly adjacent to the Big Bank inspiration the Bank of America. This would give us another tie with it being within reach of a location we can visit."
payday2secret,2vceik,Heroic_Sheperd,1 point,Tue Feb 10 08:28:38 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the Hunt for Baldwin!  First off, Some good history and relations to Payday interesting read and some definate things to check out.  Now we must try to find an in game link to them though.  Regarding hacks not finding any hidden vaults, the way the Diesel Engine works this doesn't mean anything.  You could clip through First World Bank as well and there would be no sign or hint that there was a hidden vault there until the entire sequence was properly completed.  However the idea of a secret heist has been theorized before due to this sequel introducing escape heists and the Bonus mission Train Heist triggered after a subsequent picking up of a set item."
payday2secret,2vceik,fearghul,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the comments, guys. A few quick things. I don't want to act defensive or seem closed minded, so here I go (about to get defensive.) I think there are really a few important points that I would like to pull out as a conclusion of what I wrote.  First: Most clues that I have found leave a nod to Sweden or another game.   Second: The secret may have to do with the Masons/Templars. Maybe the lost treasure of the Templars (could be in foundation of whitehouse? It's a game, they can take creative licence.) It looks as if many people have commented on the appearance of the White House blueprints being in the main menu along with a set of numbers and the name Baldwin.  Third: I think we are looking for something to do with diamonds. All of my clues point to something relating to diamonds. In addition I know another community member asked about the secret and was given the reply ""no, ralf"". Ralph is the son of the CEO in the diamond heist. There also appear to be fleur de lys all over the floor in the diamond store heist. No clue if it's relevant but this game seems to about connections strengthened by smaller ones."
payday2secret,2vceik,KTSandvich,2,Tue Feb 10 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see possibilities there. I'd say the whitehouse is a contender, as is the national archive or the treasury. All three are in close proximity to our existing heists. I figure if its the whitehouse it's likely to be some secret templar treasure, the national archive might be the constitution itself, but I'm leaning towards the treasury for a few reasons.  The first is that stealing the printing plates would be one way to top the Overdrill, along with the mint being founded in 1792. There's various currency related tidbits relating to baldwin and in the game. For example, they say the fakes in the diamond will be worthless, and that you need to look out for the gensec stuff...but the only instant loot there (at least to my knowledge) is coins that lack a gensec sticker. Which could be that fake money is still worth something.  We really are still pissing in the wind trying to get a handle here so there's no reason to discount anything you've offered up, I'm just giving my reasoning on what I think might be stronger and looking for others to poke holes in it for me :P"
payday2secret,2vceik,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"I'm shifting my focus onto more concrete things now. I've looked into what other people are currently looking at. I doubt that we are going to be able to find it just by looking, so I'm looking for things that have connections to what we have here.  I still want to look into the boat angle, but the phone thing is interesting to me. Obviously the Doom number has been mentioned many times however I do think there is a reason for it. Obviously its not a code, but I think it is one of the many nods to other games! I think its tipping us off that the phone number given out at E3 is significant. Clearly there hasn't been much luck on that in a long time, but I think I'm gonna look into that now. I think the code to get to the mailbox message isn't random but is actually based on the number of beeps the phone makes when picking up and when it finally disconnects. no clue though."

Today I spend some time there with some friends building up a theory that these http://i.imgur.com/xeyOAm1.jpg http://i.imgur.com/8zOq9Zo.jpg may correspond  to some masks (Nun, Anubis, Pazuku or goat mask, Owl). They always spawn there. It also spawns there this http://i.imgur.com/O2k2BWL.jpg (sorry the screenshot is from another place, but the same artifact spawns in the pre-diamond room too). And today I got informed that Almir said this http://imgur.com/Alu3mad ""Just leave the children alone whatever you do"". Interesting huh?

Based on this, I can tell you that the four canopic jars correspond to ancient Egyptian gods, rather than being specific inventions for this heist. Similarly, the papyrus scroll is a reproduction of an existing scroll.  I really don't think they're related. You'd need at least one other source referencing them to suggest that their placement was meant to convey information for the Secret.  Like, I would have ignored the (I think Babylonian) winged statue, where it not for its triangulation with the painting and the etching from Bain.  On the other hand, any content that is clearly made specifically for the game, such as the alien skulls, may be relevant. It has occurred to me that there's an alien skull in that room, and one of the other etchings http://i.imgur.com/50O7ux4.jpg shows a skull with a bullet hole in it.  Regards the etchings, I think the ones from CGO are legitimate, and the ones from BDN are distortions. This is based on the plot of the Seventh Seal, that the etchings explicitly reference.

payday2secret,2v7xot,SuspectLeader,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:11:53 2015 UTC,"My point is that unless you have a reference point that correlates them to the Secret, we shouldn't assume they're automatically part of it. You need to triangulate elements.  Look, fundamentally there's an order that ties all of the disparate elements of the Secret together. We don't know what the order is, yet, so until we do we need working theories that take multiple elements we can be reasonably sure may be related to the secret and tie them together.  Alien sarcophagus? Noteworthy, because it is a unique asset made specifically for the game. Sarcophagus plus first etching plus painting from Rats? Working theory.  Winged statue? Not noteworthy. Winged statue plus first etching plus painting from Rats? Possible corroboration for working theory.  Ceiling glass? Not noteworthy. Ceiling glass plus multiple floor rugs plus position near sarcophagus plus Bain's comment about ""Keep an eye up for me""? Working theory.  Canopic jars? Not noteworthy.  Papyrus? Not noteworthy.  Give me something that ties those things into the Secret, and I'll sit up and pay attention to them."

I'm just saying that there are many ways to connect something, you just need to find the right one. And due to Overkill having a weird way of making secrets nothing should be overlooked. About the papyrus, it has a cursor on it, many people suggested that it is just a mistake from overkill, I can't argue with that but I need proof as I need proof that it connects to the secret of course but until then it's good to have it in the back of our minds."

payday2secret,2uiqbm,blynkzz,10,Mon Feb 2 14:52:27 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with the secret is that I feel we are being mislead all the time. Sometimes from ourselves , we notice something strange and then we spend a big amount of time investigating, sometimes from the community, someone else notices something strange and our whole investigation focuses on that, sometimes from even Overkill, with posts/tweets/comment that might actually mean anything, or from completely irrelevant easter eggs in-game.  And so far our only clues is the ""Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder where you are"" and ""In top of my tree, there is a star"". I can seriously explain both of them in more than 20 plausible ways in-game. This doesn't help us at all.   Also, I strongly believe that this time are more than 1 secret. Yes there is The Secret but in order to get there and find all the clues you would have to complete other smaller secrets. Not just decode a static message etc. I can only speculate at this point and create crazy theories in my head (Oh did anyone tried to open the deposit boxes under the letter B A L D W I N only?How many tiles are in the Diamond heist?Does it look like a chessboard?Where is the curator in the Diamond heist?Why the first image from Bain's Guide fits with the image in Rats and how do these connect?Christ resurrecting?Pistol Messiah?Does this goes that deep?Not just gold masks but skills also?Did you notice that the number 12 has some significance?Main menu there is 12 on the dollar bill, Cagliostro's book has 12 chapters, there are 12 engines in Big Oil, the bus on day 3 rats is 2136, 2+1+3+6=12, max amount of bags in firestarter day 1 is 12, or I'm just going nuts with the numbers.) Speculations, Speculations, Speculations. We need facts.  Yes I don't want Overkill to tell me ""Hey, look you just have to press F to unlock the secret"". But give me something to work on. I don't mind If I have to read the actual book from Calgiostro for example, but I wanna know that something lead me there and it's not just another waste of time.

"" You are the first one I see and I 100% agree with you, with all the heists, clues, the pages and everything you cant just fit all into one secret or heist.  My though is that there are small secrets spread across several heists, maybe the ones that the Bains Guide Pages and the 10 images refer to, and once you complete those secrets for example in 10 different heists, you have everything you need to find out where is the ultimate big secret.

Those 2 things are the only 100% clues we have from in game relating to the out-game Bain's Guide.  The ressurecrion painting in Rats is damn close to Bain's Guide too, but I'm not 100% convinced on that one yet."

I have lurked this sub for over a year and you have helped in the secret for at least that long if not more. There have been no triggers, confirmations, or any word from OK at all stating that we have found a single lead. Now that I think about it Codex_Cagliostro could just be a distraction to prolong us from finding out what the secret is.  Without a confirmation or an actual trigger that gives us a solid lead we are just searching in the dark. The best we can do is keep an eye out as Bain says for anything secret related. This should be a fun search and IMO anyone's ideas are welcome."

payday2secret,2uiqbm,Heroic_Sheperd,4,Tue Feb 3 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"There is nothing worse, in my mind, than a treasure hunt where you don't actually know what you are looking for. Of course we do know in the vaguest sense what the search is for, but we don't know what types of things could be related to this secret.  I'm honestly pretty new to the Payday 2 ARG, but I've been obsessed with it before I even got the game, a friend linked me to some info about it and I couldn't help but to invest my time in it. My opinion and some of my facts might be mixed up but I hope you'll think about what I say. I think we might be best off waiting for more DLC to come out and some sort of debate to spark in the Non-ARG community of Payday 2. I believe that is the way it happened with Payday 1, the wolf pack DLC and then Overkill saying people are missing something when everyone discussed the Pacifist achievement. Hopefully Overkill actually does want to give us some type of hint, but there isn't much for them to hint about yet. Golden Grin Casino is when I think things will start to take off. We've been waiting for it for a while and it'll probably be big. Almir even said in an interview we would be able to use offshore money in it I think? I could be wrong about that point.  Any type of clue we are likely to find will give us some form of unease. Wild goose chases do us no good yet they are what we are stuck with as a community. If we are patient, it will hopefully pay off. Still though, there isn't much harm in everyone jumping at what they find, it gives us something to do and possibly when we find something it will be bigger than the small things that we've all noticed and will clearly be related.  Good luck to all of course, and happy hunting."
payday2secret,2uiqbm,wtffighter,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"This sentence "" in my mind, than a treasure hunt where you don't actually know what you are looking for"" Describes exactly what this is coming too.

payday2secret,2uiqbm,dcpeon,2,Mon Feb 2 19:20:24 2015 UTC,"Guys, guys. Here's an odd idea: what if there simply is no secret yet?    The secret in the first game took 10/11 months to find out.    My point exactly. It's already been stated that Payday 2 will be supported until the end of 2016. This gives us plenty of time to find a/the secret, and coincidentally, it gives Overkill plenty of time to actually make the secret. I'm willing to put money in the assumption that nothing has even been done with it as of yet, and that all the things we've thought were secret-y but actually weren't are just precursors to the actual thing, setting the stage for the real deal, etc, and that Overkill is currently sitting on their asses laughing at us as we chase our tails aimlessly, looking for something that doesn't exist yet.  Think about it. In TH, the secret was teased with forum posts and tweets from Bo before anybody actually found something. It is my belief that if we keep trying to jump the gun, Overkill isn't gonna throw us a bone. I think we all need to take a step back and both evaluate what we've found and wait for Overkill to give us a hint."

I mean, it's not like we have any big clues or leads as of yet, so anything could be something. But yeah. I actually never thought about the ""Police have been alerted"" thing. Also... Why would a car have gold rims? Seems kinda odd to me. Overkill likes gold though, so who knows. Might be something. Let's see what the secret hunter veterans have to say about this."

We could use a bit more of this mindset I feel, we've gone somewhat down in hype since release out of discouragement; possibly out of a lack of hints (in comparison to The Heist) leading us to think that it isn't even in the game yet, similar to Wolfpack.  I do remember though that ATV (I think?) said when he visited OVK that he got to see some stuff, thinking they were clever. SO THERE'S SOMETHING GODDAMMIT. They may be gradually adding stuff in as they go on.  As for your thoughts, I like the parallels (never watched 9th gate) and seeing as OVK is definitely parodying it in a way, they may decide to switch up the order.

Disagree with me all you want, tell me to find it and keep hope when I don't find it, feel free to waste time like I did and am currently.  I'm only here now in hopes that it was silently added in the last 10-11 months with one of the dlc's.  Also, you should totally watch the ninth gate.

I have to imagine that'd be part of the secret if they're really basing it on The ninth gate.  Of course, that also wasn't the proper way to complete the ritual, so idk. The fourth card in particular and a few other places seem to hint about light being important in some way, and since this is the only time you literally see nothing but light, I find it suspicious."

payday2secret,2twunc,Yeonus,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:20:23 2015 UTC,"Dear lord.... I had a theory a long time ago involving Watchdogs day 1 and exploding the truck and throwing the bags in the fire which then teleported behind a cop car. Everyone, eventually including myself, attributed this to a bug. IIRC this behavior wasn't observed elsewhere (in nightclub the bags sit in the flames). Some said this was because the money is critical to success in Watchdogs but not in the other heists.  But when you consider the connection to the ninth image of Bain's guide, watchdogs day 1 was the only day of any heist that truly bothered me.  But here it is, one of the few things I didn't actually try, although tbh I don't think it will result in anything, is getting in the fire with the bags kind of like Balkan did. Maybe you teleport somewhere else like the bags of money?  Edit: I also posted this connection a long time ago: that fourth image with the light and the burning money could also connect to watchdogs. In the second day you need to turn on the spot light for the boat driver to see you, but you also don't know which direction the boat comes from. This could be why the guy on the hill has the lantern (like a signal beacon kinda like watchdogs day 2) and he's also scanning the horizon searching (the guy in the pic could easily have lit the lantern and is now searching for where help is coming from, much like we wait for the boat). The burning fire I thought was an indication to burning the money in day 1. This is an old theory I had and am just rehashing. Nothing ever came of it before and I doubt anything ever will, but I thought I'd mention it anyways."
payday2secret,2tryo4,Strondkop8,6,Mon Jan 26 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"Nice find. After some further research of my own, there are a few things I would like to add.  Searching on google images for ""glitch image"" yields the three following images, all near the top of the results:   One Two Three   The second image is the one you found from the Glitch movie, however it appears this is not the original. If we look at the first image, it appears to be a larger and higher quality version of that used for the Glitch movie. According to the source website, it is an OpenGL accidental texture corruption. This leads me to believe that it is the original image and was used for the Glitch movie cover. Comparing it to Overkill's glitch_01.jpg, whilst it is visually similar, there are some differences, notably the light blue distortion in multiple places which appears to be an overlay.  The third image is also the first result if we search google images for ""glitch gif"", see here. I have uploaded the last frame of the gif. Note that Overkill's glitch_04.jpg is a section of this frame.  It seems too much of a coincidence that three of Overkill's glitch images can be found by searching ""glitch images"" and as a result, I believe that the glitch images are NOT secret related. They seem to simply be random images found on google by whoever designed the website to be used to create a cool animation, nothing more.  In regards to the light blue overlay on parts of glitch_01, I am unsure what this is and why it does not appear in the original. It is possible that it was added either by Overkill or perhaps it was sourced by Overkill from someone who had already added it for another purpose. I also would suggest that the result stegdetec returns when run on glitch_01.jpg is a false positive, due to the fact glitch_01 seems to have been generated by an OpenGL algorithm."

""Mr. Bojangles"" is a song originally written and recorded by US country music artist Jerry Jeff Walker for his 1968 album of the same title. Since then, it has been recorded by many other artists, including US country music band the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, whose version (recorded for the 1970 album Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy) was issued as a single and rose to number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart in 1971. Live versions of the song appeared on Walker's 1977 album, A Man Must Carry On and his 1980 album The Best of Jerry Jeff Walker.  The NGDB's single version begins with the Uncle Charlie interview (subtitled ""Prologue: Uncle Charlie and his Dog Teddy"") that also precedes the song on the Uncle Charlie album. This was originally backed with another interview with Uncle Charlie, also taken from the album. When ""Mr. Bojangles"" started climbing the charts, the B-side was re-pressed with the same song without the interview prologue.

If you search for ways to stealth TrainHeist with the current PatchVersion, you'll find it pretty quick. You start hacking the machine ==> AI-routine creates a waypath and the following kick-animation for the Cop. Cop starts moving. Hacking the machine is over before cop reaches the machine or gets alerted ==> Pathfinding script breaks because the entity he was commanded to kick is no longer a valid target.  TL;DR:  USE THE SEARCH FUNCTION!"

And I never said it was part of the Secret, I only exposed, as said, facts. These are not theories. You want some? Then stop lurking here, being aggressive with people, and go try make a valid theory. If you're actually capable of doing one, then you'll be able to talk like that. Or if you just wanna help, you can add things like ""oh, I actually saw an exception in one of the phone rings"". So, I know the phone thing is probably part of a red herring, but it's still a fact, and you can't deny facts.  For the policemen thing, you're two saying it could be bug related. Anyway, he won't stop himself from kicking the machine; I already saw him kick a machine more than one minute after a hack ended, because he had to take the only and longest path available. Don't know if it's just the same glitch as in Train, but it's weird in both cases. So if people could keep an eye on it on their next tries to kill democracy, see if that happens (like one guy watching the cops while another does the dirty job) everytime.  TL;DR: LEARN TO READ!"

Also if you read a bit into egyptian mythology, you would recognize that the things you noticed are different from what you think they are. The ""Pig"" is actually a small vase containing the heart of a dead person that is weighted an a scale (not a crane) against the Feather of Ma'at (that very interesting symbol). To be honest I have no idea what the ""clover"" could mean but I suspect it's not a clover as these plants don't gro in egypt. The Egyptian Clover looks a loot different to the ""irish"" one.  I tried to find some information on the actual displayed scene on the papyrus for some days now but couldn't come up with much information except the original seems to be in the ""Leiden University"" in Netherlands. Though, I'm not sure if that location is true or part of a hoax pulled from someone. As far as I could find out is that the news-line ""Child King Tut played marbles says Leiden University"" is propably a hoax spreaded over a few news-aggregators.

Could be that sticking that hard to the 9thGate-Topic isn't right. Transferred to our secret it would mean there are 9 different locations/actions we have to visit/do in order to get to the secret. Trying to connect this theory to other things people are speculating about isn't that off. The different parts of the cards could show the things we have to look/interact with ingame in order to fullfill the requirements. This could also mean the actual scenery we're seeing on the card doesn't mean anything but we would need to find the specific spots on the heists which have the corresponding objects.  But I also see that there's a lot of stuff that I can't connect to this theory.

Hoxton breakout mainly because of the man in the cell wearing a mask that could represent Hoxton   I think this is very plausible as not only to most of the places related to the photo but there also all free and either come with the game or you get them by joining the community group which stops people from having to pay just to enjoy something that was free in the first game.

payday2secret,2r495f,Fallout10mm,14,Mon Jan 5 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"We just ran a full crew trying to re-create it. I think this is just a bug for the following reasons:   The breaking isn't carried over to all the clients (i.e. all clients seemed to have different things in broken / unbroken states) If the trigger really is all broken items, the host has to break everything on their game while three others sit around and watch It's complicated and slow   If we pull what we know from the original secret and apply it in this case, we must come to the following assumptions about the secret in PD2 (if currently present):   It's a co-op focused game. You can't get to the secret without 4 people (and you still need 4 people for PD1 for overdrill) Context: There's no solid theory behind this, other than potentially the weapons. Everything else is hap-hazard; in the original secret, if you decoded all the clues, execution on the actual player inputs (security trigger, tiles) were all relatively fast and not complicated, just a long wait time It's too easy. Granted it could be the first step in the puzzle, but there's just nothing happening on the map. Masks: one of the key elements of the game. I don't think we'll be able to activate the secret unless you are wearing a specific set of masks (for instance, we tried golden difficulty masks, etc).   I would conclude that this is no more than a map bug, or an hoax.  Methods:   All civ's downed, break all glass, pickup packages All civ's downed, break all glass/pickup package at the same time Combinations of the above two ending on the package by the bench Combinations of the above with different masks Single player repeat of everything you broke or picked up, in video order (if applicable)   If someone does get that noise, record and see if an assault starts, I submit that there will be no assault -- you'll just be waiting on a empty map.  edit: methods  edit: Just confirmed -- had a solo with the exact same placements as in the video: guards, civs, packages, everything. Collected/broke in same order as in video and no vault sound. Confident in calling this one a bug / defunct."

You also don't say what difficulty you were playing on, and I didn't see it in the video. Edit: I see you tab menued, and it's Deathwish.  Fortunately, this is also what I tried, since in pure stealth the difference in difficulty is largely irrelevant, and it's most likely to be there.  And the vault noise isn't directional, like all the other sound effects.  Furthermore, I wasn't able to replicate it after three attempts. So if your goal was to make me waste an hour of my life, mission accomplished.    That, and the amount of breakables that spawn each time are different based on what cars and wall painting spawn.

Pretty much every phone in the real world has those digits.  Also the idKFa12321 is actually a reused asset from Payday: The Heist. The reason that it showed up in Payday: The Heist is because the user idKFa12321 helped solve the Overdrill, so Overkill credited him by putting his name on the phone texture in the First World Bank. All it means is that Overkill reuse assets.  Evidence to idKFa12321 just being a user (it's the second post on the page)."

payday2secret,2qv1j6,MeltingTerminal,2,Wed Dec 31 14:47:21 2014 UTC,"Ah, sorry. You didn't make it entirely clear as to whether you knew or not, and in the doc you talked about it as a Doom cheat code, but that doesn't make sense to me at all. For the name to have any relation to the secret they would've had to know someone with that specific name would find help find the Overdrill (or picked that specific user and planned ahead to the Safehouse Nightmare, which seems unlikely).  I also don't really understand how this could have anything to do with the Safehouse Nightmare, it means that you have to wait for a certain week, and find the secret, in order to do it, which seems like a waste of time on everyone's part.  Which phone specifically are we trying to answer though? The safehouse one? It could be to do with GO Bank, which other people have deemed in the past as a likely candidate for the secret. This also ties back again to Big Bank and how similar it is to FWB again though, as in stealth you do have to answer a phone. Or it may have no relevance at all (as I believe), and the secret might be in an unreleased heist or unobtainable for now as it was with the Overdrill. It's hard to say right now though, with the extra year or so of support that Payday 2 will get, we will probably have to wait until the last couple of months before the secret is actually activatable."

Go look over the original secret stuff again, it was added with the Wolf Pack DLC, and found out through the radio on Counterfeit.

payday2secret,2qj1v4,Omfg_honx,6,Sat Dec 27 13:02:29 2014 UTC,not sure if this will help but the Andrea Doria was also an italian battleship during WWI and WWII. She was considered one of the two best ships the italian navy had. This ship has been involved in many european incidents in the early 1900's some of which may be related to other things.
payday2secret,2qj1v4,haekuh,3,Sat Dec 27 16:40:40 2014 UTC,The  Andrea Doria that collided with the Stockholm (and therefore the one referenced in the trailer) is this one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Andrea_Doria  Build when WW2 already ended but was part of repair payments from Italy to the US.
payday2secret,2qj1v4,Gr3gHill,4,Mon Dec 29 14:47:23 2014 UTC,"SS Andrea Doria:       SS Andrea Doria, pronounced /ˈændriə ˈdɔəriə/ AN-dre-a DOHR-ee-a, was an ocean liner for the Italian Line (Società di navigazione Italia) home ported in Genoa, Italy, most famous for her sinking in 1956, when 52 people were killed (51 from immediate impact). [citation needed]  Named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, the ship had a gross register tonnage of 29,100 and a capacity of about 1,200 passengers and 500 crew. For a country attempting to rebuild its economy and reputation after World War II, Andrea Doria was an icon of Italian national pride. Of all Italy's ships at the time, Andrea Doria was the largest, fastest and supposedly safest. Launched on 16 June 1951, the ship undertook its maiden voyage on 14 January 1953.  On 25 July 1956, while Andrea Doria was approaching the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, bound for New York City, the eastbound MS Stockholm of the Swedish American Line collided with it in what became one of history's most infamous maritime disasters. Struck in the side, the top-heavy Andrea Doria immediately started to list severely to starboard, which left half of its lifeboats unusable. The consequent shortage of lifeboats might have resulted in significant loss of life, but the efficiency of the ship's technical design allowed it to stay afloat for over 11 hours after the ramming.  The good behavior of the crew, improvements in communications and the rapid response of other ships averted a disaster similar in scale to that of Titanic in 1912. 1,660 passengers and crew were rescued and survived, while 46 people died with the ship as a consequence of the collision.  The evacuated luxury liner capsized and sank the following morning. This accident remains the worst maritime disaster to occur in United States waters since the sinking of the SS Eastland in 1915.

payday2secret,2qj1v4,gp1200r,3,Sun Dec 28 00:09:58 2014 UTC,"It actually wasn't empty at all. The opened save from the first-class had lots of US Silver Coin Certificates, italian currency and some African money. ( http://www.pcgscurrency.com/andreadoria.html ) According to PCGS, ther're 2,726 U.S. $1 Silver Certificates from the Andrea Doria, one is currently sold at 995$. ( http://www.govmint.com/ss-andrea-doria-1-silver-certificate-pcgs-ngc-grade-a.html ) That's a minimum of 2,700,000$ in total. Also noteworthy: It's hilighted that a part of the certificates are so-called Star-Notes as they have a star instead of the first number printed on them.  Also, according to this newspaper-article ( http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sFctAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1NkFAAAAIBAJ&hl=de&pg=3524%2C5647315 ) there were two safes in the Andrea Doria. ""One containing passengers' valuables and the other from the Bank of Rome."" As far as I can see the opened safe was the one from the Bank of Rome but I can't find any information about the other safe.   Seems that at least the ""Bank of Rome""-safe was a ""Helluva Safe"" from an italian producer and it's said there're only 3 safes ever made like this."

This may work for other parts of reddit (I joined just now to join this subreddit), but in evaluating and testing ideas for an ARG it's incredibly counterproductive.   In the first ARG, the ideas that wound up being correct got missed because they were passed over. A part of the moderating approach here should probably be to avoid the same phenomenon.

After a quick look around Google Maps, it seems to me that the points are all bodies of water. Some are hard to pinpoint which body specifically, there are lots in a few places, but they all have large lakes or bays.  The ones that I did identify are Salt Lake in the US, Chott el-Jerid in Tunisia, Lake Tengiz in Kazakhstan, and Vanern or Vattern in Sweden. The waters in Brazil, Quebec, and Australia are a little harder; they have lots of bodies of water there.  Brazil has a few bays there, the largest being part of the Amazon River, but smaller ones being the Baia de Santa Rosa, Baia do Vieira Grande, and Baia de Marajo.  South Australia has several large lakes with lots of smaller ones. The larger ones being Lake Eyre, Lake Frome, Lake Torrens, and Lake Gairdner. I won't list the small ones.  Quebec is a nightmare. There is water everywhere there. The most striking body of water is Lac Manicouagan; it is a very round lake with a very large island in the middle. However it being striking doesn't make it correct, so this is the hardest one to name as the ground seems to be nearly half water."
payday2secret,2qgspd,wolfdarrigan,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"Hey... What do you guys think of this; I found the thread about the bluescreen in HB D2. Someone had converted the crash text to numbers, but ASCII didn't give any type of answer. I took the number string and searched them on Google maps. No results. I swapped the places of the dots and spaces between the numbers a few times and got very surprised: when you put 14.367322, 081.2756 to Google Maps, it points to the Indian Ocean, not very far from the shore. What's more interesting, is that the point is very close to the area which had the mine where The Hope Diamond was mined from. Could be random of course, but as far as I know Ovkl, they can make really weird and random numbers to actually work. Any opinions on this one?"

To me this implies that there will be a follow up when Hox found out who ratted him.  With the Cagliostro file in the manager's pc would that mean we are either after cagliostro or hoxton is refered as cagliostro?  Either way i get the feeling the other main illustrator in bains guide, Baldwin, is tied to this.  Can't wait to see the follow up from Hoxtons breakout and go after the rat himself."

According to wikipedia Antilla could also be part of the Atlantis saga:   ""Stories of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, legendary and otherwise, have been reported since classical antiquity.Utopian tales of the Fortunate Islands (or Isles of the Blest) were sung by poets like Homer and Horace. Plato articulated the dystopian legend of Atlantis. Ancient writers like Plutarch, Strabo, and, more explicitly, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, testified to the existence of the Canary Islands.""    If we check who Pliny the Elder was, we learn that the cause of this death is unknown but supposed to be the volcanic erruption in Pompeii ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder ), which already is a theory from the computer screen in Big Oil 2.

These various forms may possibly be different perceptions of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality.

The same works for Payday 2, assets do not spawn unless the correct triggers are completed completely preventing free cam, clipping, etc.. From being any use in searching for hidden objects.

payday2secret,2pz8j4,Heroic_Sheperd,2,Sun Dec 21 23:17:42 2014 UTC,"The way the game diesel engine(the engine that payday runs on) works by only loading assets when they are needed. For example, the bank heists none of the money is loaded onto the map until you open the safe boxes. If you use a map editor and look at the map you will not see any useful information as it does not exist in the basic map. It is called into the map upon being triggered.  As for looking at the triggers you can only go off of what their names are but you have no way of knowing what they are actually calling. Also all assets  are stored in massive .bin files which are basically useless to us.  I spent 3 months looking at everything I could find in the PD2 files. I will not say I didn't miss anything because it is a MASSIVE amount of data.  I still have no idea what you are talking about when you say turn images into sound."

payday2secret,2pv84s,Jetstream_Kage,5,Sun Dec 21 17:52:47 2014 UTC,If I was overkill I'd probably just drop the idea -because I don't have a plan to earn money out of it for minimal work; and mark it to remember about it by the time I am planning to release payday 3

payday2secret,2pv84s,UnforseenConsequence,2,Wed Dec 24 05:11:43 2014 UTC,The overdrill vault was patched in sometime after the release of the Wolf Pack DLC. The first hints to the overdrill were released with the Wolf Pack.

payday2secret,2pv84s,babypowd3r,1 point,Sun Dec 21 09:08:15 2014 UTC,Just read the guide and how the first ARG is done so once i a while...
payday2secret,2pv84s,The_zendman,1 point,Sat Dec 20 10:56:55 2014 UTC,"I'd probably do it in a very similar way, tying in a lot of the same hints from the last game as markers that you're going the right way, or go in the exact opposite direction and make the nods to the first ARG complete red herrings, with no middle ground. The way I see it, nods to the first Secret are either trailblazers to help us out or just false prophets. And if they are false positives, then anything that falls under their pantheon should be considered misdirection too.  Then again... since ""I"" did have things like yggdrasil on the Secret masks (Chains), then I would probably make references to the World Tree or norse mythology relevant to the Secret, as well as references to the old secret. With this in mind, I think ""Unleashing Ragnarok"" is a big hint, as in GO Bank iirc. Which may mean that GO Bank is a heist that needs to be done as part of completing the Secret, possibly loud. And if the theory that we need to do a series of heists holds, that would mean that the rest of the heists might have to be loud following GO Bank, like the idea of the cops following us through DC in a mad chain of heists, culminating the in the biggest bust in all of history, topping even our final stunt (both No Mercy and Overdrill) in The Heist."

Scales (Libra), which appear all over the darn place throughout the game. Compass and Square of Masonry. A nautical compass was a prominent symbol in the first Payday secret, and has reappeared in Payday 2 in a mask pattern and on boxes in the vault on Big Bank (thanks to Lucky Charm of the steam forums thread for finding that one).    Note that the genuine compass and square of masonry have a capital G in the middle, referring to God, Geometry and a number of other things (it's masonic symbolism, so there's never one meaning when there's room for twenty). The square and compass on The Diamond have a capital C in the middle, instead."

The upcoming ""Golden Grin Casino"" job, where we chase the guy who ratted out Hoxton (possible Mendax connection, as it can refer to our times most known informant Julian Assange).
