mypartneristrans,3e6bpz,PANDADA,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:21:52 2015 UTC,"It was really great to read this. I feel your relief jumping off the page at me. It must feel so great to have the turmoil turned down a few notches. I think you will both be much happier now that you're in a place where decisions aren't made out of anger.    Good luck to you as you begin your transition. Just a thought for you, the weekend my wife began hormones was very emotional for me (and her). She may need some support or an outlet so that when you begin it doesn't send her back to a place of anger. I hope things continue to get better and better!"
mypartneristrans,3e2ngk,Tiff020212,5,Tue Jul 21 14:14:32 2015 UTC,"I don't have the experience to really be saying this, but the first thing that came to mind reading this was: Good Lord, you're pregnant, give yourself some leeway to be emotional and not know what you want right now.  It's hard enough in a stable, less complicated relationship.  You don't have to decide right now what to do, and dare I say you should not decide what to do right now. Give it a little time, have a baby, communicate with your partner how you are feeling, and see if how you feel changes.  Now I'll just step aside for the people with actual experience."
mypartneristrans,3e2ngk,HiImNotCreative,3,Tue Jul 21 15:10:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely give it some time. My Fianc√© (M2F) and I have been together about 4 years and 2 years ago she came out. It's hard, and I'm not going to pretty that up for you. There will be days you don't think you can handle it. But, as she transitions you will begin to see her how she sees herself. It's an anxiety filled, exciting, and emotional experience. And if she starts taking hormones too, that will just add to the hormonal situation you are already in. Just remember to relax. You are both beautiful humans."

I think you should both consider the possibility that he is gender queer (non-binary, bi-gender, and/or fluid).  I absolutely agree with your concern about the hormones that haven't been prescribed for him."
mypartneristrans,3e2gmu,kristendk,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"One thing I told my gf early on is that I'm fine with any changes she wants to make physically, but only if she does it safely and in a healthy way. That means that if she becomes emotionally unhealthy she sees a therapist/takes the appropriate medication, that she does her research before proceeding with any medications or procedures, and that she only takes medications that are prescribed to her and deemed safe by her doctor(s). I'm happy to stay with my partner through transition but I will not stay with someone who is reckless with their health and safety. Both partners deserve better than that, and I would suggest telling your partner something similar. Taking hormones that aren't prescribed to him is risky and possibly illegal."
mypartneristrans,3e2gmu,rosequartzuniverse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"I personally think he may be gender queer and I have expressed this to him, but he doesn't respond to the idea.

We told our son first, because he found search history my partner had left about name change and transgender protocols. We told the girls a day later, and then came out to our extended families not long after that, because it wasn't fair to the kids to not say anything when we visit.   We approached it from the perspective of being happy and just like we want them to be happy, we want to be happy as parents. We explained about feeling like she was supposed to be a girl and that starting now she would be wearing clothes that are more girly, and the other changes would be more gradual. We told them we loved them and that wouldn't change no matter what. This is also a good time to talk about what your partner wants to be called, some like to change to Maddie, Mimi, Omma, my partner uses a shortened form of her new name.   Our kids have been wonderful and accepting. They love that their parent is happier and more calm."

Sometimes trans people feel so guilty for wanting to be happy that they forget to keep themselves in mind when they are in relationships. Sometimes it is best to just step away from the situation, clear minds and become comfortable again with yourself and then revisiting the situation after time to contemplate. I think you chose to do the right thing, especially with her angry and manipulative behavior. I think you will both be happier about things after a break. It is hard but it will give you a chance to analyze what you want exactly and give her a chance to do the same. I wish you luck during this hard time and also clarity and truth."
mypartneristrans,3doawr,jenlb714,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's weird to comment on my own post... But she told me today that she wants to try and work things out. She said she is willing to try and understand my transition, see if she can get past the changes. She says she loves me, and even if I have different parts she wants to try and win my trust back.   I have mixed feelings. Part of me wants us to be able to come back together. And if she is willing to take me as her husband - facial hair and all - I want to give it a chance. But I'm worried that this won't last. I'm skeptical.  I told her that my requirements still stand. She needs to move into the other room. She needs to go to counseling. I told her that if she wants to have children that she needs to heal and be a whole person before we can think about that. She agreed.   I told her that at this point it's going to be hard for me to go back to the way things were. That we would need to start at the beginning - after my transition has started. I also told her that I needed a little privacy... I intend to start pumping and I guess I feel like I'm a little self conscious of it...  But I think this is a good thing. Maybe we can heal, maybe we can still have everything we wanted."

I think what WILL be useful is that you two are on the same page: committed to seeing this transition through successfully, committed to your relationship, committed to your family. I anticipate when we get around to talking to my mom, she will be conflicted between her support for my partner and concern for whether I will be/am happy. I think that you being clear about this being a decision mutually endorsed by you and your wife will help them avoid feeling like they have to choose sides. Good luck, and please let us know how it goes. Aside, thank you for all your wonderful support here on the sub - it's been very much appreciated by me and no doubt many others."

One issue I have is that I am a crier - even thought I am totally on board with transition and definitely plan to be married to my partner for the rest of my life, I know that I will cry when we talk. Good thing is, they are used to that and hopefully won't take it as a negative sign.

I hope you have a better experience than we did. I suggest being as prepared as you can. Think about possible questions they might have, be prepared for the worst reaction so if it does happen, you can handle it without becoming angry or frustrated and react as calmly as possible. Unfortunately, there are questions they will likely ask that tend to be uncomfortable for transitioning people. And there will be questions asked from and about both of you, not just her. You need to determine what your answers will be to the sensitive questions. I honestly suggest, even though it is hard and feels like a violation, to work up to answering the sensitive questions regardless of what they are as your daughters are family and will be with you throughout the transition and those curiosities never go away. I am not saying this just as a cis woman but as a partner of someone who is transitioning. Those questions get brought up a lot by those we are close with and it is just best to address them without divulging too much sensitive information.

Getting outside if the weather is nice helps boost mood and Vitamin D production which can also help with mood.   Do you or your spouse have an Employee Assistance Program? Many companies have them and they offer short term counseling, and also have people available to call and talk to. Best of all these services are usually free.   Do you have any friends that you can talk to? I know you're u said you don't want to, but maybe someone can understand that you are going through a rough patch and not assign blame. When we hadn't told anyone what was going on, I would go to a friend's house and just hang out talking about anything other than my problems.

I want to be there for her and help her through this but I am just not strong enough to support both of us. It hurts when she is in pain and there is nothing I can do to help. My only support, aside from my friends, is reddit and the many trans boards that offer a community of people going through the same situation. I have found comfort in the support offered here and I have even begun offering an outlet via messaging myself. I have actually found more support on here than I have from any of my friends (not for their lack of trying, it is just more comfortable to open up to those who understand what I am going through, who aren't already bias about the situation)."

mypartneristrans,3do8ag,anonymeee,4,Sat Jul 18 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"A common mistake that transgender people make when trying to transition with partners is not letting the partners feel included in the transition. They tend to have a ""this is me and if you aren't all on board, you don't support me attitude"" instead of accepting that it's perfectly natural for their partners to feel shocked and scared. Right now you are being flooded with too many emotions, questions, and concerns to handle -- give yourself a breather. Accept that these will all be answered in time, and you don't have to feel okay about everything right now. Best of all, talk to your partner about maybe slowing down a bit to give you time to process. It doesn't mean you aren't excited for her, but it's not healthy to take on everything all of a sudden at once. You need to be included in the decision-making process as if you were making any other life transition together: buying a house, having a child, etc. because this is happening to you, too. Stand up for yourself. And know that this community is always here for when she gets a little too self-centered (they all do)."
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,PANDADA,0,Fri Jul 17 22:28:28 2015 UTC,Well said!
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,kristendk,0,Fri Jul 17 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"Her body is her body, but I generally agree (and I'm MTF with cis female spouse). Especially where costs/budgets are a factor. A partnership is a partnership.   I have no advice re ""mommy"". I don't ever see myself not being my daughter's father, even with transition, so I'm not worried about not being ""mom"", but I haven't gotten to choosing an alternative yet either (edit: if I even decide to do something other than just Kristen)."
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,PANDADA,2,Sat Jul 18 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"She may have this ideal ""image"" in her head of what she wants look like, but it doesn't work like that. Hormone changes are slow and from what I've read, you need to be on HRT for at least a year before you can get SRS (I'm not positive if that's the case, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong). Not only that, but the appointments can be scheduled pretty far out. This isn't going to happen in a couple months. Plus, based on what you said about money, most insurance companies don't cover the procedures she wants and it will have to be out of pocket. But maybe you have great insurance, you'll have to look into that.  As for the mom thing, does she think both moms in a lesbian relationship just go by ""mommy""? Most of the time they have some differences, even if it's mommy a and mommy b (the a and b referring to your names). Relationships are about compromise and she's not going to get everything she wants if she also wants a happy and healthy marriage. Unfortunately, it may take several discussions and arguments to come to a decision/compromise. This is where counseling can be helpful. My wife and I don't have kids yet, but I'm hoping one day we can adopt. She is okay with not having kids or having them, but I also want another year or two for everything to be stable with her transition (plus her fully being out to her mom and oldest brother and his family) before we have a child.   I would also recommend not rushing into having another kid together unless you've already decided you're going to stay together. Need to focus on one thing at a time and I think you have every right to ask her to slow things down a bit while you two talk about what's happening for your marriage/relationship before you bring another child into the picture."

mypartneristrans,3do8ag,RevengeOfSalmacis,0,Sat Jul 18 20:35:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sure others will reply to many of your other questions, but regarding surgeries, two distinct but useful points:    If she's on hrt, her appearance is going to change dramatically. Go to /r/transtimelines and look at body and face changes over several years for 25-35-year-olds. She may or may not find that a lot of the things that bother her go away under the influence of hormones alone. Genetics are the main thing here; for all you and she know, she may end up with wearing Ds just from the natural process of breast growth once estrogen gets the ball rolling. Her past exposure to androgens still may have left a lot of damage that's been hurting her for years. I remember watching my facial bone structure deform and virilize during puberty, and even though my face looks nothing like a man's any more, I'm going to need to remove the brow bossing and other bone virilization, as well as the (usually invisible to others but still physically almost painful to me) adam's apple just so that my face feels fully mine again. It's very possible that her facial features contain a record of pain she wants to move past. Additionally, although most trans people blend eventually, if she wants to avoid harassment for being visibly trans then some surgery may be helpful."
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,tulips_onthe_summit,0,Fri Jul 17 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you two are trying to make a lot of decisions really quickly. One thing about transition is that it is a process, none of this is going to happen overnight. I've found that some things that were ""definite"" at the beginning of my partner's transition have become ""maybe"" and vice versa. Maybe it would be easier to tackle the decisions you need to make now and table some others for down the road."
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,Daniswife1,0,Fri Jul 17 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"I think you are being very rational in this. It seems as though throwing everything out there in the course of six days is somewhat irrational and unreasonable. My wife took a year to find ways to make this easier on me, and I believe that has made it easier on our relationship. I love her immensely, and I want to grow old with her. That being said, I appreciate her concern with what works for us, as a couple, and not just what she wants."
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,jenlb714,0,Sat Jul 18 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this is common with trans women just starting out. They have this image in their mind of what they want to look like and don't realize just yet that it may not be necessary for them to get all the surgeries and such to achieve that look. It is usual for them to not want advice on how to get that look from a cis woman because to them, we don't know what they are going through, and they are right. We will never fully understand what they are going through and HRT is different for everyone so she may need surgery to help her look like the woman she wants. Also, when it comes to breast size, the pains that large breasted women have may not be the same for trans women. Their bone structure is different from ours and so it could be that her breasts don't cause pains like your breasts do. At first, my wife thought she wanted tiny breasts because she always thought they were cute and that mine were too big (I have almost Ds). She wouldn't listen to me either about a suggested size. Now, after a 1.5 years of dressing as a woman with smaller breast, she is thinking that a bigger size will be better for her stature.   To be honest, I still struggle with the fact that I will no longer be married to a man and the person I married is changing physically. But I think it helps to see the changes as they progress because I become comfortable with what I am seeing before the next thing changes. The slow progress helps as it is not as dramatic as surgery is. I don't think that my wife will become unrecognizable to me as there are some things that won't change (eyes, mouth, height).   In terms of family, I think you should reconsider trying for another baby right now. Things are stressful and painful right now and you do not know what the future holds. I think that your spouse's dysphoria will only become worse the more it is pushed into the future. I do agree that freezing sperm is a good idea, just in case you do decide to have more children because once the hrt begins, the sperm becomes non-existent for pregnancy purposes. But you really need to consider the additional stress and pain that another baby will have on your relationship and on your spouse's dysphoria.   I understand that you aren't willing to share the title, but maybe there is another way to include her in the ""mommy"" position. I don't have kids, but I do have godkids and we (my best friend, she is the mom) just thought about having the kids refer to me as Jenn like everyone else. When the kids were able to talk, they were introduced to my name but shortly after learning it, they began referring to me as Momma Jenn. Perhaps that would work for you, you be referred to as Mommy and your spouse as Momma. It's close but not the same. Another thing to consider is does she even want to be called mommy. Some trans women who had kids prior to starting their transitioning wanted to keep things the same for the kids as possible and only allowed the kids to refer to them as daddy (perfect example, Laura Jane Grace from Against Me!. She still has her daughter call her Daddy and plans to let her daughter decide if she wants to change the title. Might be something that your spouse is ok with, or maybe not. Just some options for you."
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,kristendk,2,Sat Jul 18 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like ""mommy"" should only be for me as the only one actually carrying and giving birth to our children. I wasn't suggesting that my love be called ""daddy"" or anything masculine, but only that I want to be the only ""mommy"". I suggested that he could be ""mama"", ""momma"", or we could go British and she could be ""mum"" or ""mummy"". No matter what I suggested or why I suggested it I was being given nasty looks and told how hurt she was by not getting called ""mommy"". We remain stuck on this point and she still seems really upset which is upsetting me."
mypartneristrans,3do8ag,Kaeryn88,0,Sat Jul 18 23:00:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to comment on 2 parts of this. I agree with the breast size, perhaps they should wait and see what HRT does for them in the breast department and then decide, but wouldn't suggest going larger then a Full C!   And on the Lipo and Tummy tuck, suggest they work on losing weight now as losing it as a male is much much easier then when you're a woman. And the fat he gains after being on HRT will filter or go in way of the female body form so he will look feminine without having to do surgeries.   Vocal surgeries are hit and miss, and I wouldn't suggest it to anyone without doing a ton of research and realizing the risks.  your partner should listen to your input and suggestions and include you in the decisions instead of just ""This is what I want to do"" and such. It's nice to be included in it all."
mypartneristrans,3dlmej,Swqordfish,3,Fri Jul 17 07:07:53 2015 UTC,"It is a confusing place. You admit that you are clearly confused (and I bet lots of other emotions, too :) Your girlfriend is also confused...there is no manual for this stuff. It may feel like a long time, but a month is not really that long to process this information. Think about all the time you may have spent thinking, questioning and accepting this about yourself. If you really want to be a team and travel through this stage of your life with your girlfriend, you will need to see her as a partner in your process. That being said, maybe you don't want to share this with someone else and make compromises and support her, if that's the case, then you should be honest with her.    If you are exploring how you want to proceed, I would encourage you to communicate and be very open and honest about your feelings. Try to connect with your girlfriend in this vulnerable place and work together to decide what your future should hold. Good luck to you :)"

mypartneristrans,3dlmej,tulips_onthe_summit,0,Fri Jul 17 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"Just last night my wife and I were talking about how awful this time of year was for us last year. I was digging up old posts from last year on my retired account and I was like uggghhh while reading them, but so much has changed! For the better, thankfully. And I reflect sometimes how bad things felt without her. Like even when I'm upset or unsure, I think about wow...I could be just doing all of this, living daily life, without her. So then I know I've made the right decision even if the long term future is still kind of hard to imagine.   But thank you for your kind words!"

I'm having mood swings where I'm so angry and hurt, but I have moments where I am understanding and want to help her. I just don't know anymore. And that's frustrating, so... And I didnt get into it here, but her reaction has ranged from turned on, to uncomfortable, to confused, to upset, to scared, to okay, but not great. And I get that it isn't an easy thing to accept, but through this relationship I've pushed this aside and acted as her rock, so that may play a role in it. thanks for the reply."
mypartneristrans,3dlmej,HiImNotCreative,6,Sat Jul 18 10:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have to be honest: Some of the commenters in the other thread were calling your girlfriend an asshole, but I side with her a lot on this one.  You might want to look in a mirror.  In this post in the last you sound really whiny and sensitive about yourself while having no sensitivity for her.  I know some people can get through that type of information overnight, but I didn't, and if your girlfriend needs time to process, this - needing time to think - does NOT make her a bad person.  If you look through some other posts here, how supportive we partners feel can vary a ton at first - by the day, the week, the hour, anything.  Not only is it normal, but it's probably a lot harder on her than on you.  And given that her feelings are probably changing rapidly, it's understandable and even reasonable for you to question how much she can support you right now. However, if you are assuming she will always be like this or that you will never be able to expect support from her while she is processing this, you are being way too presumptuous.    Try to separate trusting her to support this and trusting her in general.  I think sometimes people don't manage to do that, and that is the main reason that couples break up before the partner even understands what is really going on.  A lot of my feelings about this situation hang on a major question: Have you two even seen each other since you told her?  Honestly, with the timing and everything, it sounds like you might have gone on break, sent her a letter, and haven't been able to discuss this in person since, or maybe only had a week together in person.  If that is the case, I only feel yet more compassion for your girlfriend.  As I said, processing this type of information is difficult enough, but trying to figure out how you feel about your partner when suddenly your partner isn't around has to be 10x harder.    You didn't mention it in this post, but you did mention TiA in your previous one.  Let's be real here.  I understand that there are some posts there that would make you uncomfortable, but that is a reason for you to not visit, not to tell her not to.  I frequent that page.  I don't take everything at face value.  I use it as a reality check, to keep myself moderate and critical instead of falling into the blindly emotional state that a LOT of people in the trans* subs seem to be in.  Do you think your girlfriend has the mental capacity to do the same, to read material without automatically accepting it 100%?  Right now, this is how I would guess your girlfriend sees things:  You broke massive news to her about you, which will affect her and the relationship, right before 3 months of not seeing each other.  She is trying to figure out how she feels, which is going terribly because you aren't there with her, and is experiencing massive swings in how supportive she feels.  Not only is this exhausting her and making her feel like a terrible person and girlfriend, but in the mean time, you are expecting full, unconditional support and starting to attack her (TiA).  She feels bad about herself already for not knowing where she stands, and then when you came out to someone else, she felt twice as guilty.    Honestly, she is probably thinking about breaking up too, and I don't blame her a bit.  TL;DR: You are not getting what you need right now, but it may actually be because you are not being the greatest partner, either.  I think the first step to a healthier understanding between you two is backing off for a bit and letting your girlfriend get her wits about her.  And you should accept that doing that might take a good chunk of time even after you are around each other again.  You need to decide if you can handle giving her that much time.  Sorry for being so critical, but I think some people who post here need a good reality check more than they need coddling. I hope I didn't offend or insult you."
mypartneristrans,3dlmej,PANDADA,4,Fri Jul 17 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this being harder on her then OP, it's not a competition. I get really annoyed when some trans people come in here telling us how it's so much harder for them then us, so let's not do the same thing please. It's hard on everyone, period.  But, I do agree with the lack of sensitivity and understanding you're talking about. It's been an emotional roller coaster for me and my wife. And when she came out to me, she rushed into looking into starting HRT and I was still learning and processing everything. So after two therapy sessions (this was end of July last year) she said all she had to do was sign a letter and she could start. She gave me the impression it was going to happen immediately. Then when I ask questions, she gave me no info and I didn't have any clue herself, or the little info she was told she ""didn't remember"". So I felt very left in the dust and everything just felt like one big slap in the face. That is not how you operate in a marriage. Any major life change you do together, and that wasn't happening. Unfortunately this is sooooo common after a trans person comes out to their partner from what I've read. They go full speed ahead while thinking their partners should be 100% on board with all of it immediately or they're not being supportive.   Now, OP isn't married so it's a little different. But if her partner is on board sometimes, that is a good sign imo. I had to flat out ask my wife if I wasn't in the picture, would she transition because she was so wishy-washy with talking to me about it and once she said she would then I really knew the gravity of the situation.  Transition is hard. My wife and I both know if she wasn't transitioning, it'd be ""easier"" in so many ways, but she wouldn't be as happy. And at times it can feel so overwhelming and you just want to say ""I don't want this, I can't handle this!"" And if you really can't, that's ok. I went through the similar ups and downs when I was diagnosed with diabetes. Some days were okay, others were a nightmare. But after nearly 19 years, I have way more okay days than nightmare days. I'm sure I'll get there with her transition eventually too, when the awful days will be rare."

mypartneristrans,3dlmej,saintartaud,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:43:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think her attitude re:your issues with TiA is kinda crappy, but you can't ask her to stop visiting that sub or even assume she's possibly transphobic because of that. Some of your approach seems to come off as demanding things from her in order to ""prove"" she's capable of supporting you, when like others have said, she's probably just work on adjusting to what you've told her and trying to understand what it means for you, her, and your relationship. It's totally understandable why you would need her support, but you need to be sensitive to what she's going through and give her time to figure this stuff out."
mypartneristrans,3dlmej,saintartaud,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not assuming that she's transphobic because of it, just that some of the ideas and things she said before I was out seem to stem from there, and I was worried she wouldn't accept me. The ideas it perpetuates are, really kinda harmful.  I know, I had like a week of weird stress about it, to which I came to her, and it was during that time she dropped all sorts of ""I'm definitely straight,"" ""It's too weird for me"" type phrases. Like, if that's true, I don't want to force her to have to deal with this."
mypartneristrans,3dlmej,jenlb714,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. I'm not a fan of TiA, because while I think a lot of users are there out of reasonable frustration with the more extreme corners of Tumblr, the spirit of that sub often caters to ideas I agree are damaging. Gender fluidity and non-binary gender are things that often get dismissed, so I can see how someone spending time on that sub might be cause for concern and make you wonder whether you'd have their support.  Really, I'm just trying to look at things from her perspective (admittedly hard, since I don't look at things like that and am queer-ish myself). She's trying to come to terms with something that's difficult to understand and changes her perspective about who you are. She's also trying to figure out what that means for her. I totally agree that if this really is too weird for her, and if she's too straight to ponder other possibilities, then she shouldn't be forced to stay. But that's something you'll need to work out with her and give her time to sort out."
mypartneristrans,3dk6q1,crucioavadakedavra,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"It's ok to be overwhelmed, shocked, scared and all the other emotions that came out in your post. Your partner is probably just as scared, confused and overwhelmed as you are. This is a really big topic and you don't have to solve all of this at once time. You found a good place to learn and talk and gain the support that you need here.    To address your concerns about his behavior towards your pregnancy and your daughter, I have noticed several transgender people post about heightened dysphoria while their partners are pregnant and also nursing. It seems to be a common theme. Your partner's comments about your daughter's body may seem a bit strange, but I think he is trying to communicate to you what it feels like to have dysphoria. I have no medical training to provide guidance on their behavior, but I personally wouldn't see them as a danger to your daughter. This period of your partner's life could be what finally helped them accept their trans identity or at least pushed it so far to the forefront, they can't deny it anymore, even if they haven't accepted it yet.    You have an opportunity to be their partner in this journey (or so it sounds) as they figure out what being transgender means for them and what impact it may have on your future. I would suggest your partner find a gender therapist and that you consider therapy, as well. There will be a lot of emotions, decisions, feelings and learning to navigate for both of you.    If it helps, I have been married for 9 years to a wonderful woman who is 5 months into her transition. I was once shocked, scared, and beside myself, too. Now, we are making our way through transition together and things are going really well.    Communicate with your partner, learn about the transgender community, read books, keep coming to this subreddit and ask for help. We are here for you :)"

mypartneristrans,3dk6q1,putmeinthezoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"Hi! Welcome to our little party. I bet you never thought you'd be at this table, but welcome.  First thing, breathe. Your spouse is the same person you fell in love with, and that shouldn't change. I know it's a lot to take in, but you have a lot of time to come to terms with the new normal. Going through a transition can take years, and even months just to get the ball rolling. You can use that time to do some reading, get to know people in the community, and talk things through with Justin.  Your story isn't uncommon at all. I, like Tulips, know of many, many stories where the wife's pregnancy triggered depression and dysphoria in someone who was seemingly very masculine. My own wife didn't come out to me until after child #3! But like yours, she was having feelings of being different and wanting to be a girl as early as 11-12. And like yours, squashed them down and tried to be a good guy - got married, had a baby, got a good job, found a hobby, etc, all in hopes that the urges to be a woman would go away. After a while, both of our spouses had to admit to themselves that these feelings really don't go away. So here you are, standing where I was about 8 or 9 years ago.   It'll be okay. I was with my spouse for almost 15 years when she first told me. At 19 years together, she finally started transition. And now, we're just over 22 years together. Sometimes relationships fall apart during the turmoil of transition, but many of us get through the rough period and things get back to normal.  Here's a link to a blog that really helped me when my wife hit her depression and need to transition point: Permission to Live"
mypartneristrans,3dk6q1,putmeinthezoo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:42:17 2015 UTC,Thank you. I never could have imagined being at this table but I'm here now and so happy I was referred to this group. Seeing that there are over 3300 people here that might be in similar situations to mine is comforting.   Breathing is still hard but getting easier. My initial freak out period seems to be ending and I've already realized I overreacted to what he said about our daughter's body. Thanks for that link and telling me it's been almost a decade since you were where we are now. That gives me hope. I would like to talk to you privately in messaging if you're willing to talk to me.

mypartneristrans,3dk6q1,PANDADA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for talking to me. My main concern is how our daughter is going to deal with this. She's still just a baby and shouldn't have any memory of this period of her life, but I'm worried about the future and how she might deal with finding out one of her parents is trans. How have your children dealt with this? I also really would like to know how long it took you to really accept what was happening, and how long it took for you to accept that your husband had become your wife. Was there anything you did or that she did to help make that acceptance happen? And lastly, and I know this is very personal, did you maintain a sexual attraction with your wife as she transitioned or has the romance and sex just disappeared? I know it might sound pathetic or petty but sex and sexual chemistry and attraction are very important to me. If I'm not able to remain attracted to Justin as he becomes ""she"" I'm not sure our marriage could survive that.   Thanks again for talking to me."
mypartneristrans,3dk6q1,PANDADA,3,Fri Jul 17 00:29:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, your child will be the easiest part. My youngest was 3 and has no memories of my wife as a guy. Even my 9yo would be hard pressed to remember much, as he was 6 when the transition happened. We have had very few issues with other kids and their parents. Friends of mine that had older kids when they transitioned have had mixed experiences - a few friends were fine, but the parents freaked out. The great majority continues on like normal, though.  As for finding out, well, you have a baby yet. You haven't even reached the stage where you realize that privacy no longer exists. (As if everyone and their brother checking on your crotch when you delivered isn't a clue...) By the time your baby is 6 and old enough to notice, she'll probably have walked in on you in the bathroom hundreds of times!  When we transitioned (and it really does become ""we,"" becuase you'll learn that you have to come out to people, too), the early days were tough. It's hard to have 15 or 20 years of memory of a person and make that switch in your head. I could easily talk about <femalename> and say things like ""go give this to her."" But talking about the past was hard. My wedding was to <malename>, who was wearing a tux and did all the male things. Those memories and images are in my head, and that's never going to change, so applying the she/femalename label to them was sort of like patting your head and rubbing your stomach. Using the name gets easy quickly. But the really hard part is labels. ""This is my husband, Sarah."" Oops. Wife. Wait. I'm the wife. Uh....  My solution was to switch first AWAY from the male pronouns and titles. My husband had to become my spouse first before I could get to wife.   I don't go into detail on my sex life online, but generally, there hasn't been a problem in that area. Some transwomen have a lot of dysphoria when it comes to having erections, or even more generally, just having parts down there. Others are fine with their parts and try to keep things functional. What's the phrase? YMMV. Only you and Justin can work out how things are going to work out there. Although you should know that you'll either want to finish having kids or plan to bank sperm or adopt or go off hormones if you're planning on siblings."
mypartneristrans,3dk6q1,PANDADA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:02:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't read the childhood history really, just the more recent stuff. A lot of what your spouse told you is pretty common. However, the weird thing to me is what you said about him not being able to bathe your child because he gets so depressed just seeing her genitalia, but doesn't get depressed when he sees yours or your breasts? That to me is a little strange, even my wife agreed when I asked her.  But, I wouldn't worry about him harming your child. It doesn't sound like that's an issue at all. What I do worry about is how much this is consuming him and his ability to support you and your child. Does he help with responsibilities in other ways? Or does he shirk everything in regards to taking care of your daughter?  He definitely needs to see a gender therapist. And if you can, you should get counseling together and even separate for yourself too. Transition is very stressful, and even more so when you have a baby. It's okay not to be sure if you'll still be attracted to your spouse after/during transition. Many partners here have the same doubts and are in the same spot. It's okay to be scared and uncertain about the future. So much is changing. My wife came out to me last June and while things have gotten a lot better and much calmer now, I still have my insecurities, fears and doubts. It can be overwhelming, especially if you never really felt those emotions before in your relationship.   You're not going to have an answer today, tomorrow or next week. It's going to take time. Be patient and take it one day at a time. Get yourself in separate and couples therapy. Talk talk talk and talk. Communication and honesty are the most important right now. And don't let yourself become consumed by it and neglect your own needs. It is said that transitioning is a very selfish time and it can be, but when going through it in a marriage, you're in it together and you'll be transitioning too, so remind your spouse that you need support too."

That's what had me so freaked out that I left her with my parents until today. He doesn't shirk everything, just bathing and changing, but he's promised me he's going to work on it now. We're both going to be seeing his psychiatrist, and I think you're right about needing some separate counseling just for myself. That's a great idea.   It's been over a year for you and your wife since she came out. What kinds of things have changed in the last year? If you would like to message me privately I would like that."
mypartneristrans,3dk6q1,Khelek41,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"Well, she started HRT in October. Her face looks more feminine and she has some small breast growth, not enough for A cup yet, but she wears a sports bra. She is also getting laser hair removal on her legs and face. Her hair is much longer and she got her ears pierced. However, she hasn't done any voice training yet. I'm not really sure if there's a time line for that, she'll get to it when/if she wants to. Personally, that's the biggest hurdle for me, that her voice may change. My wife doesn't want SRS and I admit I'm pretty happy about that.  But she's still the same person she was before. She still enjoys the same hobbies she did before, but now also likes makeup, painting her nails and wearing women's clothes. She's pretty much that - a female version of the previous person I was with for seven years, except this version is the more true and happier one. Even my friend recently said he noticed she's much happier and more talkative now. She's out to all of our friends, family and just came out to her work recently. Her name change goes into effect legally on the 26th. Everyone has been very accepting and supportive (including my conservative Catholic mother) except for her mom and oldest brother. But my wife is also Vietnamese so there's a lot of cultural conflict too.   The one thing you'll notice is that everyone's situation is unique. You'll be able to find ways you can still relate though."

mypartneristrans,3djslx,totallytooth,5,Thu Jul 16 21:03:45 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Welcome aboard. It's a wild ride no matter when you learned about it; transition is different than questioning.    I've started seeing a therapist for myself (husband is mtf, too) and something she told me which I'm trying to internalize is ""everything belongs."" I.e., there is room for your feelings, even if they conflict, even if you feel guilty about them, even if you are scared. I am getting better all the time. We both want to be together for the rest of our lives, but the nagging anxiety doesn't simply go away because of that affirmation.    Going to his therapist appointment may help, but if you can, try to find someone you can talk to. My partner is my best friend and it was very hard on us (and sometimes still is) while I worked through all my feelings out loud, over and over again.  I kind of feel that the rational part of my brain and the empathy and understanding and hope are a bit at odds with the reptilian part that says OMG WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE! I hope you can find a good equilibrium for yourself, and a way to learn and grow, and even enjoy, transition if that's the path you two take."

It's a wild ride no matter when you learned about it   So true, so very true :) OP, it sounds like you have got a great perspective on this. Abandon the guilt, throw it out the window. It's ok to have a lot of feelings about transition and some of them may really surprise you, even if you've considered transition yourself. There are some really interesting stories about two trans partners experiencing each others transitions and they are definitely distinct from the trans/cis partner experience, but they do seem to also encounter many of the same feelings, issues, roadblocks, etc...You are in a unique position in that you can truly identify with what it means to struggle with your gender identity, I think your partner is lucky to have you!"

As someone with a trans partner and as a child of an alcoholic, I feel so much for what you're going through and I really wish I could just sit and hold your hand for awhile.   So, as everyone knows, relationships based on ultimatums don't generally work out. I think the one ultimatum that is okay to make is ""get help for your addiction or else I'm leaving."" If your partner isn't in therapy or in a sobriety program they need to look into it ASAP.   Addicts and alcoholics are like selfish little vampires inhabiting the bodies of people we love. And trans people in the midst of their transformation can also be a little self absorbed. You're dealing with a double whammy of selfishness and hurtfulness. What are you doing to care for yourself these days? Take some time to treat yourself to something."
mypartneristrans,3dkok9,markoyolo,2,Fri Jul 17 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"So was this the first time that they have gotten completely smashed?  Whether or not this is a pattern is very important.  Either way, though, you should definitely sit them down when they are sober (with or without a hangover is up to you, it might drive home the message better...) and talk about this and how it is making you feel.  Are they drinking because they don't feel they can start taking steps in their transition?  There are a lot of questions and possibilities here. I think the only thing to do is communicate with your partner.  You can always come back with more posts depending on how things go, which will likely be much more helpful than speculating now without talking to your partner about it. Good luck!"
mypartneristrans,3dkok9,HiImNotCreative,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:15:20 2015 UTC,It sounds like your partner may need hospital treatment. Do they have a therapist or doctor that is helping them through these issues? Have they started on hormones or other things that relieve the depression and dysphoria? Is this an ongoing thing or a one-off?
mypartneristrans,3dkok9,putmeinthezoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"I hope she is getting help in therapy. After my wife came out to me and I didn't react well, she started drinking a lot. I found lots of empty bottles and that just made things even worse because it was so unlike the person I knew. She's cut back a lot, drinks only socially or once in a while at home, but even then I feel anxious because I know the hormones put stress on her liver.  Is your partner on HRT? Does she know the strain it can put on the liver and drinking excessively will make it worse? I think you should hell her how you feel about the choices she's making and that she's hurting herself and you."
mypartneristrans,3dkok9,PANDADA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:47:48 2015 UTC,"My partner has started drinking as well. I mean, she always used to drink, but it's definitely increased with the stress and worries of her transition. I'm struggling to be respectful of her life choices (she's an adult, I can't tell her what to do and what not to do, after all), but I am also exploring the limitations of what I can and cannot accept in my life. I grew up with alcoholic parents, so I'm quite sensitive to excessive drinking, and it pains me to see her wash away her potential in bottles. I don't know what to do, either. But know you're not alone, and this is temporary."
mypartneristrans,3djwdr,VeronicaO85,3,Thu Jul 16 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to let your wife know about your difficulties now, rather than putting it off. There are just so many people who take that approach, until their dysphoria gets worse, the need to transition gets more pressing, and there is more investment into the appearance of that ""Type A male."" Be honest with her, tell her you're questioning and figuring out whether transition is right for you. Let her know what steps you'd like take to take. Presenting as female? Seeing a therapist? Get a sense of how she feels. Ask her questions. If need be, go to therapy together.  It will be difficult for her. She will need time to adjust as far as her perception of you. If you decide to transition, she may not be able to adjust to that. If you want to have kids, you'll need to have a plan in place as to how to do that.  My partner came out about halfway through her questioning phase. She didn't come out IDing as trans, she just said she wanted to start crossdressing and exploring those desires, and it eventually became clear she has dysphoria and transitioning was what she wanted. Being included in that process allow me to figure out some things on my own and come to terms with the possibility of transition when it became a reality."
mypartneristrans,3djwdr,saintartaud,2,Fri Jul 17 20:26:40 2015 UTC,"I would just flat out tell her, then let her ask you as many questions as she wants. Start out by telling her that you've been struggling for a while about this and are finally beginning to accept your identity. If she doesn't know, explain to her what ""transgender"" means. (She may already understand, but there are a LOT of misconceptions.) Then tell her she can ask you anything she wants to know.  She may be very confused, or angry. She may question whether you're sure or say that you're simply confused. You deserve to be treated with respect, but try to give her a bit of leeway right after you tell her. It's a huge change to accept, and even though you've been questioning for years, for her it will be out of the blue.  Also, if you read through this sub, you'll notice that there are a lot of great, supportive wives and gfs who identify as straight but who have stayed with their mtf partners as they transition. (I'm assuming your wife is straight and that you'd like to remain married to her.) You'll never know if your transition will cost you your marriage until you tell her. I know I would not have wanted my girlfriend to remain closeted and to live as a male for my sake. Some trans people are willing to do that for their spouses, but in my opinion as a partner, that is an unfair thing to ask for."
mypartneristrans,3djwdr,rosequartzuniverse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"I replied on your other post as well, but I'll add here to make sure that if you want to stay with your wife that you make that clear to her - you are partners and you can choose how your relationship goes. Let her know that you are trying to get a better understanding of yourself so you can live the most meaningful life possible.    I'm sure you know that the sooner in life you do this, the better your outcomes are likely to be as far as appearance, and the more of your life you will get to live without anxiety about this or fear of future regret. I've seen other good posts about this topic, so do spend some time looking around. Good luck!"
mypartneristrans,3dg64k,anonymeee,3,Thu Jul 16 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about putting your partner's transition before your own. All too often, those of us in relationships with someone who is transitioning are forgotten and many times people don't realize that by choosing to stay, we choose to transition as well. It may not be as dramatic of a change but it is still a significant one. We are part of the their transitioning process but that doesn't mean it's only about them. We deserve to be acknowledged!  We have to figure out what our partner's transitioning means for us. Are we comfortable with becoming a lesbian couple after being a straight (and so sure of it) couple? Are we ok with the process that will be required to become as comfortable as a lesbian couple as we were when we were straight? And most importantly, do we want this? Because let's face it, transitioning couples are not as likely to stay together as other couples. Transitioning puts alot of stress on both people and sometimes its just too much to handle. The fact that we stick around should be recognized that we are willing to do whatever it takes to get through the stress, pain, and heartache in order to gain the love, excitement and true happiness that is achieved after transition.   Have you considered finding support for yourself outside of your relationship? Maybe there is an LGBT support group for partners of trans women? I know in our area, the local LGBT community hold meetings for those in a transitioning relationship, both for individuals and as couples. Not sure if your area does but it might be something to look into."
mypartneristrans,3dg64k,jenlb714,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:20:20 2015 UTC,"Our city did have a transpartner support group, but unfortunately it was discontinued due to lack of interest. I contacted them about restarting it, but never heard back. I don't want to burden my close friends with any of this, especially because they (understandably) have my best interests at heart, and it's hard for them not to villainize her for all that's happening (even though it's out of her control). This subreddit is the best form of support I've found thus far, but I find it creates a me vs. her mentality, and I'm really struggling to find ways for us to bond and grow together through this."
mypartneristrans,3dg64k,Girl_Dinosaur,2,Thu Jul 16 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"The biggest way they support me is in allowing me to have worries too and making space for me to voice them (even when I know they are silly). Being able to say ""what if you don't want me any more after you transition?"" and getting to hear them tell me how that's never going to happen makes me feel a lot better than keeping it inside.   Also, being able to process my feelings around things just like they do. For example, their impending top surgery: I fully support it and know its the best course of action for a lot of reasons. I know I'm going to be attracted to them sans chest. But I love their chest and it would be a lie not to admit that I'm going to miss it and I'll grieve it a little bit just like they will.  My partner does a lot of things to make me feel supported but one thing I didn't appreciate until joining this subreddit is how much they include me in their transition in a way that it seems a lot of partners aren't included. Transitioning isn't something that I'm watching my partner experience from the outside or something that's just happening to me, it's something we're in together and I'm a part of.   We shopped for packers and binders together (and I help with the chest and packer wrangling on a regular basis) and we've discussed all the options from surgeries to hormones to doctors and timelines for our life TOGETHER. I feel like it makes us even closer rather than putting a big wall of unknown between us and I'm really grateful for that."
mypartneristrans,3dg64k,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing this with me; it's really wonderful to hear this has been your experience. This helped me see some major differences in our experiences and realize where a lot of my fear and frustration has been coming from:   I haven't been given the freedom to articulate my fears and concerns in a welcomed way. It seems each time I try, all I do is amplify her fears and concerns as she is not stable enough to give me the reassurances I need at this time. It would be lovely to be able to say ""I'm scared"" and hear ""It's okay"" instead of ""Then leave"" followed by a breakdown of her own. I also don't necessarily feel included in her decisions, which she tends to inform me of in a ""take it or leave it"" manner. I get that these are non-negotiable for her, but it's difficult to face the immediate requirement that I must adjust my life to accommodate something that, from my perspective, has come out of the blue and time to warm up to. For example, I get that coming out is important to her, but she can't expect me to be ready to come out to my landlords without notice as it has potential consequences for my life, too! I wish she could say, ""This is what I'm thinking, what do you think? I'm ready when you're ready"" instead of getting upset that I'm not always on the same page. She is also quite protective and sensitive about her minor transitions, often choosing to deal with the little things (getting a haircut, picking out underwear, etc.) on her own out of fear of judgement. I try to make these bonding experiences by making appointments together, etc., but I don't think she's quite ready. Or, when she does want me to go shopping with her, it's more about having someone there to cover up her purchases than actually be included in the decision-making process.   I guess I feel lonely because it seems like there is no space for me in this new life of hers. At the beginning of her transition, she seemed so concerned about how it affected me and was so understanding of my emotions, but now that sensitivity is lost and I'm struggling to cope on my own. When I mention this, all I get is a ""Well, I don't rely on others to make me happy,"" but I don't think it's so wrong to want to enjoy your partner's company and continue making memories and experiencing experiences with them. I also don't think it's wrong or makes me weak to feel sad that that isn't happening as much anymore. So I wonder how I can go about changing these behaviours to recover much of our relationship that I feel we have lost?"
mypartneristrans,3dg64k,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Thu Jul 16 20:57:28 2015 UTC,"My partner does so much for me in the realm of support during her transition. I really can't thank her enough for everything she does. She is very inward focused, as she should be, but to your point at times that intense inward focus can feel a bit alienating. I think it's my job to point out when I am feeling that alienation (in a constructive manner) so that she gets the signal to put a bit of focus on me. And she does. She responds. At a really good rate, too :)    What specifically does she do?     She embraces her transition as our transition. As you said, we partners are transitioning, too. Not into new bodies, but into new lives. Into new identities. Into a new world for me, at least. She seems to really believe that this process belongs to both of us. She keeps me informed on a medical basis (prescriptions, levels, doctor feedback, etc...). She keeps me informed on a personal level, she points out changes she notices, asks me for feedback, shares with me changing feelings and desires. She asks for my input on decisions for the next steps - upping dosages, coming out strategies, tiptoeing out into the world.   She (without question) supports my therapy. I have a weekly therapy appointment that I began soon after she started transitioning. She encourages me and brainstorms with me on topics to discuss, she gives positive feedback on the changes I've gone through since starting therapy and we tend to set aside the evening after therapy to go for a walk and discuss either: the appt itself or any thoughts or feelings that the discussion spawned in me. It has lead to some great insights and offered a format for discussing sensitive topics in a really positive way.   She shares articles, news, threads, posts, etc...that she comes across or identifies with so we can read and discuss together. Again, this opens up communication and starts dialogue on many of the myriad of topics related to transition. She also respects my boundaries when I am not quite ready to discuss a topic, or is willing to set aside a conversation when it's become too heavy. Some conversations have taken a number of attempts to have, whether it's the timing, the sensitivity, our moods that day or whatever - it seems to help to tackle the hard stuff this way.   She encourages us to do trans things together. We attended Pride, we attend a monthly support group meeting that welcomes partners (so we go together), and we continue to do more and more things together in her female presentation to allow both of us to become more comfortable and familiar with our new identity. We have a few planned weekends planned during her part-time phase, where we can spend the entire weekend full-time to prepare for the next phase.   Specifically in the realm of intimacy, she shares herself with me. She has an incredible capacity to allow me to share her changing body. We talk a lot about the changes feelings, sensations and desires she has as a result of transition and how we can incorporate those into our intimate life. We also talk about ways to take the pressure off while exploring our new intimate relationship. Neither of us know exactly what we're doing, but by being willing to experiment, try new things and give feedback on how things are working, we have actually improved the intimacy in our relationship. Yes, it is different, but I believe in the end it will be just as good as before, if not better :)   She has given me time (and I her). She began her transition earlier this year and I have decided that I don't expect there to be a new normal established in life until at least early 2017. We agreed that from now until then, we will give each other a LOT of patience and understanding and allow each other to make mistakes, throw tantrums and just simply lower expectations as we both adjust to our new relationship. We spend a lot of time together, talk incessantly and yes, are fairly hyper-focused on transition.     For myself, I have made a deal that I, too, will grow during this time. I have set a few goals for myself over the course of these two years to ensure that I am also working at becoming a better me, in addition to how transition will alter me. I think it's important to make sure you have this focus on yourself. The love and support should definitely be flowing in both directions."
mypartneristrans,3ddeva,Aniwen,8,Wed Jul 15 11:59:04 2015 UTC,It could also be the case that he's happy with his gender but likes to cross-dress.   But I understand your concerns. I thought I was a cross-dresser before realizing I was trans. Decades of not understanding for me.
mypartneristrans,3ddeva,kristendk,5,Wed Jul 15 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"I was going to suggest this. I love to crossdress but I am not and will never be transsexual.   Transgender? Don't think I could live as a woman. But the fantasy is nice.   In any case, it's a spectrum and where there is a spectrum, there is fluidity."
mypartneristrans,3ddeva,yangstyle,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"That age is a rough one - mean high school kids and all that jazz - and trans* people weren't even as accepted as they are now (not very in much of the world).  If he came out at that age and put that much effort into it, it would seem like there must be a solid basis for it.  I've heard a few cases of doing a 180 on trans feelings, but never after a year of actually acting on them - maybe after a few months of self-exploration.  However, it is very possible that your boyfriend's dysphoria just isn't bad enough for him to act or want you to worry.  Maybe he really is just feminine but not MtF.  Maybe he just has a guilty pleasure of admiring women's fashion.  There are plenty of reasons why he may have changed his mind or let it go.  And since he seems to have decided that, the best thing I can think of for you to do is not worry about it or constantly ask about it.  you have told him that you will be supportive; let him sit on that and decide what he wants to do with it.  He told you about his past when he was ready, let him take the further steps at his own pace again.    TL;DR: Let him decide what more to confide in you, and when to do it.  Don't push it, and try not to worry too much :)  (Male pronouns on purpose.  Not trying to misgender.)"
mypartneristrans,3ddeva,HiImNotCreative,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:17:10 2015 UTC,Society has come pretty far in some regards and is still fairly regressive in others.  It is entirely possible that your partner had the 1+ year of experience presenting as female and ended up feeling that the societal disadvantages associated with presenting as female would have a greater impact on his life than the degree to which he feels that the gender identity assigned to him at birth is a misfit for him.

mypartneristrans,3dcjvt,HiImNotCreative,2,Wed Jul 15 12:03:12 2015 UTC,"Oh god I feel awful even writing some of these..  What if I'm not as bisexual as I thought? my partner is FtM, and once or twice I've had this thought after sex with him. He's the first guy I've felt completely comfortable around and I've never been this attracted to a person in my life. I've also never had sexual experiences with women so for a while I felt that maybe the fact that I feel such sexual chemistry with him is because he has body parts typically associated with women. I felt so guilty having this thought because to me it felt like I was pretty much shitting on his identity and seeing him as someone he's not. That's since faded luckily but it's certainly a horrible thought to me.  what if I call him by his birth name? Once he thought I had called him by his birth name while we were having sex. He was clearly affected by this and despite having not actually called him by it (I didn't even know it then) I felt immensely guilty and it started a period of obbessively worrying about this. I even had to bring it up in therapy because I couldn't stop thinking about it. It still pops up from time to time but it's less overwhelming.  What if his family out him to mine at our wedding? My partner is stealth, and as I met him after he began presenting as his gender he never had to come out to anyone in my family. Now we're engaged and were planning a wedding and he mentioned that he was worried that his family would accidentally out him at some stage during the wedding day. We've since decided to elope and have a blessing at some stage in the future but I'm still (rather selfishly) worried that whoever from his side that comes to the blessing will out him to my family. This is partially because I don't want my image of my grandparents to be tarnished by them not accepting him but mostly because I know my family will be assholes about the fact that they had to hear it from strangers.  Anyway, that's pretty much the prevalent fears I have at the moment!"
mypartneristrans,3ddidq,jenlb714,8,Wed Jul 15 12:36:07 2015 UTC,"I have to be honest; I don't think this is the place for these types of posts.  There are a good many trans subs on here, and I'd like to avoid this ONE partner subreddit from becoming flooded with posts of ""Support this person!!!!"" possibly with ""They need to hear they can be loved and find romance!""   I'd guess many of us are subscribed to those other subreddits, too."

mypartneristrans,3dazfg,blueyes11095,3,Tue Jul 14 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"To be very honest perhaps you would be better off ending the relationship and simply remaining as friends.  Sometimes in a relationship you have to understand that there are areas which you are simply not compatible on. If he does have gender dysphoria then that is not going to go away and you need to be very honest with him that you will never be attracted to him if he transitions. Be there to support him, be a friend, help him choose outfits and help with make up but let him find someone who adores him for who he is and who he may become and perhaps by doing this you may meet someone who you are more compatible with too."
mypartneristrans,3dazfg,tipoftheicebergs,2,Tue Jul 14 21:57:09 2015 UTC,"I also struggled with this, as well. I have been with my partner for seven years. I had to think long and hard if it was worth the changes and the challenges that will be endured, emotionally and physically. My partner is a tranwomen am a straight women who has never considered being a lesbian. I chose to stay in the relationship because I do love her but I frequently question if it's worth the fights and various struggles we face, Trans related or otherwise. It is definitely not a position I ever thought I'd be in. But I'm trying to make it work because I love her. If you find that you will not be romantically attracted to him while he is figuring out if he will half or completely transition you should not stay with him. He is still trying to figure out who he is. Staying in the relationship without being all in will make it hard on both of you. It kinda sounds harsh via text but it's not meant to be that way. I just honestly want to say that it is great to be supportive but you have to think about yourself, too. Good luck with whatever you decide."
mypartneristrans,3dazfg,whatevrhappens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:28:20 2015 UTC,He said he's keeping his junk but it's like he'd be a different person like the man I love would be gone forever. He makes a very pretty girl though. And trust me didn't think I'd be in this situation either.
mypartneristrans,3dazfg,SphirosOKelli,2,Wed Jul 15 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"As the trans side of a relationship I can say that in some cases there are stages to this as well. When I first connected my feelings of maleness to being transgender I assured my partner that all I would need was a breast reduction, maybe some lipo. But as time went on and I started dressing male (packing and binding for me) I found that things changed. I started wanting facial hair, which is a no go for her, and I've been thinking about wanting at least some type of bottom surgery...  Point is, this is something of a journey for your partner, and you as well if you feel comfortable enough to wade through the waters. I'm not saying your partner will ever want bottom surgery - It's a lot different for FTM than MTF, but I'm just saying that you want to make sure that you don't hold your partner to claims they make when you guys set out on this because feelings and desires do change for some of us as we explore what this means."

mypartneristrans,3dazfg,alloutrage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:12:50 2015 UTC,"I hear that completely. Keeping open the lines of communication here will help a lot. I suspect my partner felt like I was moving quickly going from ""regular"" to full male mode in the course of 2 months, but if she had let me open up to her and share all of the never ending thoughts I had about this I feel that maybe she would have been able to see that for me these past two months have been immeasurably longer than any other months in my life. I can't help but wonder if I would have been able to take it slower if I had been able to actually talk to her on a daily basis.   A fear of the unknown and the changes and the ambivalence about what will or won't happen seems natural to me. But I feel strongly that if you and your partner do the research together it can be binding as well as informative. Not to mention it might buy you time as the reduced ""shame"" your partner might feel will allow them more time to contemplate.   Wish you guys the best of luck - regardless of outcomes."
mypartneristrans,3d95om,Royal_Robin,4,Tue Jul 14 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"First tip: Don't force yourself to do something you are not comfortable doing.  It can suck feeling like you are not meeting your partner's needs, but boundaries can and often do change with time and experience.  Wait until you are ready to take each step.  It might help to just explore down there - using your eyes, fingers, mouth, whatever is easiest.  Some things will probably come more naturally than others.  Start with those and see if you can expand your comfort zone.    You know yourself best.  Do you just need to see it more often until you get used to it?  Maybe you need to get used to it in a non-sexual way first (somehow).  Think about what YOU think will ease you into things.  Also, you should definitely let your partner know what's up.  You don't have to hurt his feelings - let him know that you don't know what you are doing and that you would like to try x, y, and z to get used to things.  As always - communicate!  Good luck!  Edit: I almost forgot the most important thing: It is completely okay to not like vaginas.  It is okay to not like vaginas even when they are part of a man.  It's even okay to not like your partner's vagina.  If you are a gay man and you are attracted to dicks and not vaginas, IT IS OKAY.  It may cause some problems for your relationship, but there is NOTHING wrong with you and you should not feel bad about it."

I don't like a cis girls vag though but honestly there are subtle, but game changing differences between a trans guys front hole and a cis girls hooha.  Really I just feel bad that I can't get him off. We have no problem with me going down on him or using my hand, I just don't know what to do to make him cum. His reactions show me a lot but I just can't quite finish him off.  I'm not quite sure how to tell when he cums either. Like I know he tenses and shakes and stuff but its not like a dick where goo goes flying to make it totally clear"
mypartneristrans,3d95om,HiImNotCreative,3,Tue Jul 14 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay.  I'm a little confused then - are you only not comfortable because it's a new experience for you and you can't get him off?  Either way, if the main issue is not quite being able to finish him, you aren't going to find your answers here.  What pushes someone over the edge seems to be very unique.  If this is the main issue, it's something that you need to work on with just your partner.  Practice and communicate."
mypartneristrans,3d95om,taylor-in-progress,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:51:26 2015 UTC,Yeah its just that it's new and very different than anything I've ever tried.   And I didn't actually know that it would be different for everyone. With a dicks you can pretty much do the same thing to them all and it works.
mypartneristrans,3d95om,taylor-in-progress,3,Tue Jul 14 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"This is probably going to be way TMI, but whatever.  The main thing is that typically most people with this equipment can't orgasm from vaginal contact / penetration alone. I'm a trans guy and it's difficult for me to reach orgasm from anything other than a vibrator right on my dick, but I still enjoy the other things as well. So, the best way my cis male partner and I can do things is to have sex doggy style where I can hold a small vibrator against my dick while we do it.   In general though, do you know if he can easily reach orgasm when masturbating? Being able to let go and reach it often when alone can make it much easier to be able to finish with a partner. I had to basically learn how to orgasm again after antidepressants messed up my ability to come."
mypartneristrans,3d95om,HiImNotCreative,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:19:44 2015 UTC,He can and often does cum when he's playing with himself. and I watch what he does and I just can't seem to get the right movement down or when I do get it I can't quite keep it consistent. I'm sure its just going to be about handling a learning curve. I just wish I could get him off already
mypartneristrans,3d95om,askaboutmyboyfriend,5,Tue Jul 14 16:53:06 2015 UTC,"All you can really do is encourage him to help guide you by telling you what is working and what isn't and provide more feedback. I'm sure you will get there in time. Just remember, sex isn't only about orgasms and you can have great sexual encounters without ever reaching orgasm, this seems to be especially true for those with this anatomy, in my experience anyway. sometimes it just doesn't happen and that's perfectly ok. I know it's frustrating through."

Some can orgasm only through clit stimulation, some only through penetration, some only with vibrators, etc.  And for each group, each person seems to have exact movements, positions, angles, etc. that make it work.  Air light touches vs. hard and fast, certain amounts of pressure, every detail you can think of.

Well, family.  Here's the thing, you're who you are and if they cannot love you for who you are then, what, exactly?  You'll bend to their implacable will, and, what? Live in misery?  I married a woman outside of my race, and I've had minimal contact with some family over it for a decade ... yet, somehow I persevere. Their ignorance, their hate - it's not a factor.  I've had a few try to reconcile, but why bother? You've revealed your lack of character, or balls (throwing in with other factions just to curry favor) so ... what is my interest in you, again?  You're deal is more keen as you're dependent on them and they can freely get their digs in ... as such you need to accelerate your plans to get out of their orbit.

mypartneristrans,3d3yaz,SleepNowMyThrowaway,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I've been trying to do. I finish school in around nine months, so getting a good job will be a lot easier than it was when this first started. My partner and I have a pretty good line of communication, and we always take some time to talk about stuff like this and get our feelings and worries aired out.   My family's never been the most...healthy bunch. Nor the most understanding. My older sister managed to get out only through the direct intervention of her partner, and my mother's only clung to me tighter since then. Just the prospect of my moving out sets her in fits, fake-sobbing about me ""abandoning"" her; getting out is going to be harder the closer I get to it, but it'll be worth it to give my partner some breathing room and the ability to be herself without worrying about someone overhearing.   I'm sorry about what happened with your family, though. I'm glad that you're pushing through it, but these sorts of situations are never easy to deal with."
mypartneristrans,3d3yaz,HiImNotCreative,2,Wed Jul 15 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"My partner's worried, too, but she just assures me that if things get bad, we can cut them out of our lives.   This kinda raised a flag for me.  Is your partner also willing to cut out any and all of her own family that doesn't handle the transition well?  It's great if she has said that she will support you if YOU decide to cut them out, but I think it is crossing a line if she is assuming you will or pushing the idea on you.   That aside, there is plenty of testimony in other threads on this sub from people who had parents that surprised them or even changed their views as they discovered who their loved ones really are.    If I recall correctly, some parents who were or became accepting were/are very religious as well.  Your mother may be more accepting than you expect, even if she has a meltdown at first.  Don't cut out people too soon without giving them a chance, I guess is what I'm trying to say. :P"
mypartneristrans,3d2kcb,SphirosOKelli,7,Mon Jul 13 00:38:57 2015 UTC,"Hi, friend. We've talked a bit via PM in the past and I initially defended some of your partner's behavior (although now I wish I hadn't). Truthfully, I could understand some of it (like the eyebrow-plucking thing) since I'm also in a lesbian relationship that will soon become a straight relationship as my partner transitions. However, the more you post on this subreddit about the things she says and does to you, the less I can understand her point of view. She is straight-up bullying you, and it is not your fault. You are not disgusting, you are not unworthy of love, you are not broken -- and I'm sorry she makes you feel that way.    I'm scared of a lot of the same things that your partner is scared of. I don't want to have to clean up after my partner in the bathroom when he learns to pee standing up. (I grew up with two brothers -- I had enough of that!) I don't want him to smell different. I don't know how I'll feel when he grows facial hair and stops shaving his body hair. But -- and this is where your partner isn't being fair -- I would never say those things to him with the aim of hurting him. Your partner seems to revel in hurting you and cutting you down, even as you're trying to be accommodating and patient. You don't deserve that.    If your partner had been loving and understanding and there were still some bumps in the road, I would understand therapy. My partner and I are currently in therapy, and it's worked wonders for us. But your partner hasn't been loving and understanding -- she's been hateful and hurtful. You don't owe her anything. I know you feel terrible about leaving her, and that to me speaks volumes about your own character, but you don't owe her anything. She can find her own way. If she wanted to continue living with you, she shouldn't have treated you so poorly.    Please understand that you're not broken. You're not the one who screwed this up. Yes, at times (OK, most of the time) this process has been frustrating and upsetting, but I understand that it's not my partner's fault. He can't help being transgender any more than I can help being a lesbian, and it's up to both of us to make this work. Good luck to you. Keep us updated!"
mypartneristrans,3d2kcb,RainbowPinata,3,Mon Jul 13 12:43:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks Rainbow - I truly appreciated the advice you gave me. In fact, some of my driving impetus was that, our other issues aside, I can't expect her to be attracted to m once this goes through. And she has been up front about the fact that she just can't see herself with me as a man. She wants ""female"" me - something I just can't give her...  So while I did address the out and out attack from the other day I told her that she had to be honest about what she wanted, and if she didn't, or couldn't, want me as male then we needed to be friends.  Ugh I cried so much... I am a super softy, and I really care for her. But in the end I know I need to have the space and freedom to follow my transition. I want to be able to let my leg hair grow, decide whether I want to shave my pits or not (probably will), grow facial hair with impunity. I couldn't have these things with her. So despite the fact that all of the other stuff happened I am trying to find some sort of silver lining...   I'm not sure how we will navigate her moving out, or moving to a new room... I personally think that in a few months when I have been on T for awhile she won't be into me anyways so things should settle down, but we will see... I might be wrong thinking that she would be nicer if I wasn't that chick who just ruined all her hopes and dreams, but instead was the roommate guy she liked eating pizza with..."

Yes, I'd say it's time to move on.   I don't want to ditch her in this time when I have caused her pain. I don't want to leave her feeling that I lead her on then dumped her the moment things got tough...   No, you're not ditching her because you've  caused her pain - you're ditching her because she's hurtful, ignorant, and possibly violent.  If she's not into you, that's fine but it's not an excuse for her behavior.  You're not responsible for her actions or attitude.   I'm hoping we can work out a good living arrangement while she gets her career started. Maybe we can go to therapy and work out some issues?    Unclear why you'd want to help out a person that has categorically rejected you? Therapy? For what, exactly?  It looks like you're feeling guilty because you're transgender, and you've accepted your partner's atrocious behavior is your fault.  You're wrong; you've nothing to feel guilty or responsible about, and any time you fritter away on her, the more time you're not meeting someone worthwhile."

It's only my second relationship though so I guess I have time to learn...  I do still care for her, despite the fact. Knowing her background I understand that she is trying in her own way but lacks certain coping skills. It just sucks because it feels like my insides are being turned into mush. For some reason worrying about someone else helps me deal with that feeling.   But at the end of it all we are going to split.

""I'm transgender"" wards off a host of assholes that might otherwise have a chance to infiltrate our lives.   As children, ""girls"" are taught that ""loyal and selfless"" crap. ""Boys will be boys"" but girls must remain steadfast and sacrifice all they are. It's crap. Not that being raised like a boy is any better. They're not supposed to cry when they're hurt. The fence is fucked up on both sides. I'm rambling...  My point is that we're not worth less than anyone else because we're transgender. Sure, some of us are assholes, or have serious issues that we should really address before dating... but the transgender thing is not a mark against us.   We are people.

Her fear of being alone is pushing her to find someone but in her frame of mind, will they be a good someone?

My partner (FtM, pre-everything) says he finds me attractive and desirable, yet we haven't had (mutual) sex in a year and a half. Last month he touched me out of the blue, which was amazing, but he didn't want me to reciprocate. That's happened once more since then, but always on his terms. He told our marriage counselor that me initiating sex is ""off-putting,"" so I climb into bed every night and wait to see if he's going to touch me -- and if he doesn't, I go to sleep. I try not to be optimistic because it sucks getting denied over and over again.    This, more than anything, has been the greatest hurdle in our relationship. I hate not having sex with my partner. I hate that he's the one who gets to set the rules and the boundaries as far as physical contact and I just have to live with it. I hate that I'm not allowed to initiate or ask to have my needs fulfilled: I have to wait until he feels like it. It makes me feel ugly, unwanted, ashamed, frustrated -- you name it.  I understand that it's normal for people going through gender dysphoria, but understanding it doesn't make it any easier.    I'm sorry you're going through this. I wish I had some amazing insight or a perfect bit of advice to share. Just know that you're not wrong for feeling the way you do -- it's perfectly normal to be attracted to your spouse, and it's perfectly normal to feel everything you're feeling when that attraction isn't physically reciprocated."

mypartneristrans,3cxn6b,msrepresents,3,Sun Jul 12 14:45:32 2015 UTC,"When you say sex, do you mean strictly PIV sex? I ask because there are times when the last thing I want is to be reminded of the fact that I've got a dick. Now, I happy to enjoy PIV sex with my girlfriend very much, but I can totally see your wife having less desire for strictly PIV sex nowadays because it can be an unpleasant reminder of the fact that she's trans.  I suggest you talk with her about it, and next time you have sex, try making something other than PIV sex the main event. You could even try making it explicitly clear at the outset to put her at ease. ""I want us to fuck good-old-fashioned lesbian style.""  A second thing is, I don't know if she's on hormones yet, but if she is, there's a good chance her nipples will get stupidly sensitive pretty quickly. I can say with no hesitation that mine did, and my breasts are now frankly my primary erogenous zone. You could try focusing on those, or really anywhere she's sensitive that isn't her dick.  The take away from this is, there's more to sex than PIV, and hammering that home for her might make her feel less repulsed during sex.

I will say this:  I gave it a good long think when I first noticed it heading down this path and decided that even if it meant giving up sex entirely, I'd rather spend my life with my SO. Period. And I meant it, from the bottom of my heart. It has comforted me to know that I already accepted this from the start.  I take full responsibility for my decision to be with my spouse, despite a practically non existent sex life, and I don't regret it. It also keeps me from comparing her to other trans wives, some of whom may be more active sexually. Every case is different. This is mine, and I accept it.  I would encourage you to take a good hard look at your life and relationship priorities and do the same: If you cannot live like this, you simply cannot live like this. If it is worth it to you, then it is worth it to you. At least this way you own it moving forward.  Very little practical advice is available in this situation. I can say masturbation is a decent (albeit imperfect and temporary) coping mechanism. I did just order a strap on and some other kink equipment as well. It should arrive in a week or two.

They made a subtle comment about not fully fitting into the label of female and maybe something about being genderqueer but they're not distraught enough about it to bother people with things like neutral pronouns and in general it‚Äôs just easier not to think about it. I've been with them through their whole questioning process and I've found several things that I think have worked well:  1) Nudge them into self-exploration. My partner had a big block of 'not wanting to stir the pot' or 'put anyone out' and I really pushed back against that. I told them I didn't think it was healthy to just keep ignoring and pushing down big questions and big pieces of themself. I also pointed out that realizing who you are and acting on it are separate things and they didn't have to change anything if they didn't want to.  2) Make it clear you're supportive but don't force your support on them. Let them know you're there for them but also respect if they don't want to talk about it. You're a support, not an additional pressure for them to figure it out and have answers. Try to be okay in the grey zone.  3) Make it clear you're interested but don't push any specific agenda. I made it clear that I liked talking about this stuff and it was important for me to know them and understand who they truly are. But I tried really hard not to make assumptions or make them feel like I wanted a certain outcome. For example, I didn't assume they were FTM and going to fully transition at some point just because they weren‚Äôt 100% cis female.   4) Read ahead. I tried my best to research as step ahead of where I knew they were at so I could be helpful and informative. When they mentioned genderqueer, I read up on it and could say things like ""I read this thing about a person who identified as agendered rather than more than one gender, what do you think? Does any of that resonate with you?"" and the day they came to me and said, ‚ÄúDo you know anything about binders?‚Äù I was able to respond with ‚ÄúYup! One of my friends was raving about this one brand.‚Äù  For me it‚Äôs really about remembering that it‚Äôs their journey, they should lead it in their own time and own way. I just want to walk it beside them, ready to help out if they want/need me, so I can share in their life and better understand them. The only outcome I want is for them to know who they are and be happy and satisfied with what they choose to do with that knowledge."
mypartneristrans,3cw60n,Girl_Dinosaur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:59:47 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I'll do my best! I really appreciate all of the help I've gotten!
mypartneristrans,3cw60n,brotddcc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"Do research, together and separately. When I found out my partner was questioning, leaning heavily toward trans, I took a day or two to sort out my feelings, research what we were getting ourselves into, and decide if I still wanted in. (Of course I did- like you said, unconditional love!)   My biggest piece of advice is to listen. Your partner is in a very vulnerable place right now, so make sure you're open to whatever their truth is, and be ready for that truth to change as they discover more about themselves. It helps, when my partner is being stubborn or acting a bit childish, to remind myself that she's basically entering puberty again, mentally as well as physically. She's nervous about hormones, about how the world will view her, how she'll be treated by her friends. This might not be everyone's experience, but it works for me right now.   I highly recommend therapy for both of you. I had huge anger issues that are now being sorted out, and it's nice to have someone you can talk to about anything you don't want to lay on your partner's already full plate. Therapy can help your partner figure out what they want out of life, and what their next step is.   This is a very exciting time, and it already sounds like you've got an awesome mindset going into it :) Feel free to PM me if you ever need to chat!"
mypartneristrans,3cw60n,brotddcc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:51:07 2015 UTC,Thank you so much I'm going to take your advice to heart! We're looking into getting therapy as soon as we can afford it:)
mypartneristrans,3cw60n,justmycrazyopinion,2,Sun Jul 12 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"Check out colleges if cost is an issue. I'm going to a clinic at a college, the therapists are psychology grad students who are working toward their licenses. They're under the guidance of licensed therapists/professors, and they go over the cases every week with their direct supervisor.   I absolutely love it, and I know this particular college does couples counseling as well. It's on a sliding scale, basically all they want is to keep the clinic doors open :) I should add that I'm not a student- this clinic, and many others, are open to the public."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,JDMartel,12,Fri Jul 10 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of confused how this was even an unknown quantity for so long. It's unfortunate but undeniable that MTF surgery is considerably more workable than FTM, so I feel like regardless of the inability to have biological children that it'd be instantly obvious the minute sex came up."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,AvalonBright,4,Sat Jul 11 14:56:32 2015 UTC,"I've done a little digging on this, and MTF transitions are pretty amazing.  The combination of hormones, surgery and prosthetics makes it possible to reproduce the experience of sexual intercourse between two cisgender people--even penetrative sex--to a very high degree.  However, in my case the explanation is a little simpler.  It's possible for two gay men to have sex without the bottom half of one partner's body being involved.  Also, my spouse went to great lengths to keep me from seeing his body totally naked.  As a result, I only saw his genitals briefly, once or twice.  I thought they looked a little unusual, but I've seen a lot of penises, and they all look kind of unusual.  His presentation was extremely masculine and I would never have imagined that there was anything at all different about him."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,Royal_Robin,21,Sat Jul 11 21:35:36 2015 UTC,"Does it particularly matter that at some point before you met him ""he"" went by ""she?""   They weren't lying to you, not even a lie of omission. Many trans men, because the transition process for them works so well, are happy to drop the trans label. He was always a he in his mind and he just had to work a little harder to get there.   Do you love him any less? Do you feel like this knowledge has tainted your image of him? He loved you enough to marry you, to presumably spend his life with you. Isn't that what truly matters?"
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,bookwormxx,12,Fri Jul 10 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"You raise some important points, and I'll think about carefully before I answer them."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,AlexaviortheBravier,7,Fri Jul 10 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"My only issue would be if we had talked about trying to have biological children together, and my spouse did not disclose that they knew that it was not possible.  However, I agree that meeting and falling in love with someone who has already transitioned should be less complicated than marrying someone and then finding out later that they will be transitioning."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,AlexaviortheBravier,3,Sat Jul 11 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"This experience has been pretty mind-blowing in terms of how I think of gender.  I could see myself having a relationship with a trans man at some point in the future.  But when I met my husband, I wouldn't have consented to it.  Issues of consent relating to genitals are taken very seriously where lesbians are concerned, and I don't see why they shouldn't be taken seriously where gay men are concerned.  As far as my husband (let's call him Lee) dropping the ""trans"" label, I have a hard time accepting that.  Trans men say and do a lot of things that demonstrate acute awareness of their trans condition.  Use of slang terms such as ""living in stealth"" and ""front hole""; practices such as putting up personal ads that are formatted so that other transmen can spot them but cisgender men will not think they're unusual, etc. seem to me to reflect deep discomfort with their identities and a feeling that they have something to hide.  Even if Lee had simply dropped the trans label in his mind, he did tell me a lot of lies--and they're indisputably lies--that seem intended to deflect attention from his ""front hole.""  The biggest one was about a gynecologist bill, which I swallowed only because at the time I didn't know that a man might need a gynecologist.  By the way, I find the term ""front hole"" offensive--this is also a problem that a lot of cisgender women have.  I'm going use ""bonus hole"" instead.  There's a porn studio called ""Bonus Hole Boys,"" that features transmen who haven't had bottom surgery.  I just think that's a good way to lighten up what can turn into a pretty dour conversation.  As for your last question, it totally changes the way I think about him.  I feel like a straight female friend of mine who married a guy who turned out to be gay.  She said she used to have nice memories, but now they're tainted by the knowledge that the whole time he wanted to be with somebody else.  Her husband and mine took advantage of our naivet√©, loneliness and trust to construct worlds that served only their interests.  What makes it really bad is that they knew exactly what they were doing."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,sbrandi74,2,Sun Jul 12 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"I just cannot understand where you are at. Nor can anyone here speak for your husband. I also really don't know what you mean about consent relating to genitals being taken seriously where lesbians are concerned but not with gay men. It's something I know nothing about so I don't know what you mean.  As for slang being used that is used within community and those outside wouldn't understand, that's nothing abnormal or something only trans people do. Gay people also did that when it wasn't safe enough for them to openly advertise as such and I don't think it was exactly to ""con"" people or just because they were uncomfortable with their identities and feelings. But it is different.  There are quite a few trans people who just want to be viewed as their gender without an asterisk of trans. I don't feel like a trans man, I feel like a man who happens to have the wrong parts. And some people just want to live as if that never happened to them because that's the most honest way for them to live.  Personally, I have times where I think, "" Someday I may kill myself,"" because I don't know if it will ever be enough for me to be a trans man. I don't know if I can live there, because all I want is to be a man without any of the trans crap. And that's not possible at all, even if I never told anyone.   For some people, they chose to not disclose to anyone once they are post transition because they don't feel like it's relevant. They finally are who they have always been. This is the honest them, living as a man/woman alone without the trans marker. It doesn't feel like they are being untruthful because this is who they always were. So they see no reason to bring the past up. Like how some people don't talk about their sexual history with partners. (Maybe?)  Not sure about the conflict over front hole/bonus hole. Never knew there was one, no comment.  What I'm hearing is that he actively lied to hide things that were going on because he was trans. He wasn't just completely post transition and just ""not bringing it up,"" he also lied to you to hide his status and that you feel a lot of emotions because of it. Including that your life together feels like a complete lie.  Like I said, I can't speak for him, but I'm sure everything was not a lie and he felt that he lived honestly with you besides the parts concerning his trans ""status."" He wanted to be with you. He wasn't acting maliciously though I wouldn't say that he wasn't being selfish. Sometimes your own fear causes you to act in ways that I call, ""Self-consciously self-centered.""   I just think many people who hide their trans past/status from partners do not feel like they are doing anything but trying to live as honestly as possible because they do not see their trans status as an honest part of them and feels more like something that causes other people to view them less honestly. Because they feel that their trans status is not a part of them or relevant.   I do wish someone could maybe explain who would chose or has chosen to live completely ""stealth"" post transition and who would not disclose to their partner, but I guess it would be hard for them and may be hard for you. I feel like I'm really outside of my depth.  Overall, I'm not trying to diminish your feelings at all. I understand them completely. I just know that he is not available to answer these questions himself, and it sounds like you may be somewhat new to the trans thing in general. Even if you weren't, it is different when you're outside of the community so I thought maybe I could at least tell you some of what I've heard from people who say they would chose to not disclose in the future and who resent the idea that it is required, that not disclosing is lying or playing a trick on someone, ect. And it's that they resent it because they are finally, honestly themselves. Why bring up the lie they were forced to live before. That the cage they were trapped in isn't and shouldn't be a factor in how others view them now that they are free.  I'm sorry, really, that you are in this place. I'm sorry you feel that your memories with him are tainted now and that you feel taken advantage of by someone you love. I'm sure that wasn't his intention and that he didn't view you as that. He didn't view you as a fool, his friends didn't either probably. He just really want to live with you as a man only, because that was his truth. He was a man, and that's all he wanted to be."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,bookwormxx,2,Sun Jul 12 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"I want to thank you for this response in particular, because it‚Äôs helped me work through a lot of issues.  (While doing this, I must have written 20 single-spaced pages that I‚Äôm not going to inflict on anyone, but you did stimulate a lot thinking.)  The conclusion that I‚Äôve reached is that my situation is very similar to the situation of a friend of mine whose father turned out to be American Indian.  They lived in the Southwest and the father very urgently wanted to be experienced as a white man for economic and social reasons.  He never actually lied about being an Indian just as Lee never actually lied about being transgender.  However, both of them did tell a lot of lies that were intended to divert attention from the unspoken no-go zone.  When Lee did this, I just kind of filled in the blanks by applying my preconceptions about men and masculinity.  For example, Lee once cooked up an elaborate story about a gynecologist‚Äôs bill that I found.  I went along with this totally crazy story because why would a man need a gynecologist?  Lee was telling me an outright lie about the gynecologist‚Äôs bill, but not about his gender.  He was just kind of changing the topic in order to keep me experiencing him the way he wanted to be experienced.  When my friend‚Äôs mother found out that her husband was an American Indian, she divorced him on the spot, and my friend won‚Äôt talk to him anymore.  Neither one of them gives a tinker‚Äôs damn about the American Indian issue, but finding out about all the lies the father had told changed their understanding of him so completely that neither one wants to continue a relationship with him.  Even though I sympathize with him, I feel the same way about Lee.  Thinking about things in this way has helped me understand the transgender experience a little better, to stop thinking about transmen acting in a unique‚Äîand uniquely malicious or malevolent‚Äîway.  Still, I can think of dozens of examples that are similar to Lee‚Äôs and my situation (gay men marrying straight women as ‚Äúbeards,‚Äù e.g.). These situations are very common, and I just don‚Äôt think that lying in an intimate relationship‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúreally‚Äù lying about some issue or other‚Äîis justified.  It makes me very sad.  If Lee had been just a little more flexible about how I experienced him, I sincerely believe we could have had a great life together.  Instead, I was perpetually frustrated, he was probably constantly stressed out about keeping track of all those lies, and he died never knowing if I ‚Äúreally‚Äù loved him.  That seems like an awfully high price to pay for ‚Äúauthenticity.‚Äù"
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,Sarahthelizard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I was really worried my comment would come off wrong, because I really didn't want to share my personal opinion on the matter and wanted to try to help you understand the reason behind your husbands actions and that trans men aren't going around trying to fool people maliciously and your husband wasn't either, because I don't know what else would help you with this.  I really can't imagine finding out something like this after someone had already passed away.   If you want, I encourage you to maybe look into trans things a bit more. Maybe you will come across someone explaining why they would chose to be ""stealth""/not disclose to a partner. Or even just come across things that you may be able to see in your husband to understand him more. Maybe not now, but it could help.  I also encourage this, because I don't know if I explained very well. It is not something I understand from personal experience as I don't plan on actively hiding my past from anyone. For all selfish reasons.  This is not the truth for everyone, and I do not begrudge those who chose differently. I don't want to sound like I'm trying to speak for them, because I can't. And I don't want to sound like I don't agree with their choices because their life is not my life and it never will be. These are people for whom the pros and cons of their available options come out to where they want to live ""stealth."" Everyone does their best.   Anyway, I really wish the best for you and I hope you take care of yourself. All your feelings are valid, and where you go from here is obviously completely up to you."

You and everybody else on this thread has been very generous, and the experience has helped me think things through without knee-jerk reactions.  It really has been helpful and I really am grateful.  I'm going to give it a rest for a while, because it's such an emotional issue (and because I have to earn a living) but I will definitely keep learning.  Best, JD"
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,AlexaviortheBravier,8,Fri Jul 17 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss. My first reaction is that you only knew your husband as a man, you married him as a man, and this had no impact on your relationship while he was living. I can understand that it might be hard to process, but your relationship was not a lie. You were married to a man. Your husband. His prior life as a woman was irrelevant and should be so moving forward. My experience is different because my husband is a trans woman (transwoman? - there seems to be some controversy if one is less offensive or inoffensive) who has not begun to transition. Our relationship isn't a lie either, even though I was not aware of this before our marriage. What matters is your love for each other, and the opinions of others  need have no power over you. I'm not sure what you mean by how this is impacting you, but I hope you are able to get beyond it soon."
mypartneristrans,3cufzo,hookedOnOnyx,3,Fri Jul 10 22:16:28 2015 UTC,"I have no problem accepting Lee as a man, but he allowed his status as a transman to change the nature of our relationship.  In particular, he denied me a satisfying sex life while keeping his going.  I don't know if his history was irrelevant.  For one thing, everybody has a history worth hearing, even if it's painful to tell; a new person doesn't just pop into existence when somebody crosses out ""F"" and writes ""M"" on a birth certificate.  As for our relationship being a lie, Lee told quite a lot of explicit lies about himself to explain away things that I noticed (such as a gynecologist bill) and he relied on my assumptions about him being biologically/anatomically conventionally male in order to keep our relationship going.  I think that the reason your relationship is not a lie is because your husband let you know about his being a transwoman shortly after coming to that realization herself (or himself--which do you use?).  Also, it would probably be hard for him to transition without you noticing.  ;)"

You can PM me if you want.  I am curious...what kind of ramifications has the news had on your life?

There's been more time put into trans women surgeries, they were the first to get them. The biggest problem now is that people put down the techniques that are there. It's like if people were saying things like, ""How can you not know she was MtF? Maybe she just said she had vaginal surgery for cosmetic purposes. Maybe she said something traumatic happened to her downstairs to make it the way it is,"" like there is no way fathomable that anyone could see that part as ""natural.""   And most people saying these things don't even know what results really look like. It's insulting and so sadly prominent in trans circles. This talk is about people's genitals and often the talk about is as if they are defective. It's not okay, but people just don't think about it.   This isn't about procedures or how good they are or anything, this is about the negative way people think of and talk about bottom surgery for trans men."

mypartneristrans,3cu90m,ifeelhorriblethrowaw,12,Fri Jul 10 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"Of all the things about my girlfriend's transition, the hardest one for me to understand was why when she was male, she dated women and when she transitioned, she was only interested in men. I still don't understand why your gender can affect who you're attracted to. Yet for many people who transition, that does sometimes happen. My girlfriend told me that she always knew she should be in a straight relationship, but she had to be the woman. As someone bisexual, this never mattered to me.   I think that whether it was you or your wife who decided after transitioning that she's not attracted to women, it shouldn't matter. Either person should be able to admit limits to their sexuality and be comfortable moving on. Hopefully your wife will still be your friend, as it sounds like she's been a great ally to you. But don't expect her to understand your reasoning when you tell her why this changed. It's part of the experience that we cis people just can't get without firsthand experience."
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,brotkel,8,Fri Jul 10 22:57:24 2015 UTC,"It is really hard to give advice or thoughts on this one as this is one of my biggest insecurities in going through transition with my wife. So...let me take a deep breath and let out some of the anxiety.... <inhaaale>... <exhaaale>...    Be honest. Be gentle. Tell her what a special person she is. Tell her how wonderful it has been to have her love and support during your transition. Admit to her that your sexuality has changed and that you can no longer be true to your love.    If this were me, it would destroy me. I would be heartbroken, angry, bitter, and everything that I know it makes no sense to be. Does she have a good support network? Is there anything you can do to ensure that her support network will be close and available (without actually telling someone else first)?     What ways can I comfort her?     The thing is, once you cast her aside as no longer your partner, I don't think it's your job to comfort her. Hence the suggestions about her support network.    I'm sure this isn't easy on your, either. I don't imagine you knew ahead of time that this would be the result (you didn't know, did you?) However, if your feelings are clear, you need to tell her now. She deserves to know about her future, however you break the news :("
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I have to agree. I guarantee that this thought has already crossed her mind and she is already in fear of it. I know I have thought about this possibility happening.   In terms of comforting it, Im not sure that it is not your place to comfort her since you will be giving her news that as you said ""will break her heart"" however, I can tell you that you should expect all ranges of emotion, especially anger. She is going to think about the fact that she put in effort to make the relationship work when you dropped transitioning in her lap. She's going to think about the fact that she still loved you and wanted to be with you regardless of who you were. She isn't going to understand that you are no longer attracted to her because of her gender. She will only see that you are leaving her even though she didn't leave you when she could have. You need to prepare yourself for that. I agree that a support network is important for both of you because this change is going to make a huge impact on both of you, not just her. You will both need someone to turn to, someone who knows your situation and can comfort you as you will not be able to comfort each other in this scenario, no matter how much you want to. Just be easy and calm and gentle when you tell her, but also be truthful and do not wait to tell her. It will only make matters worse.  Im sorry this is happening to you."
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,jenlb714,3,Sat Jul 11 22:57:35 2015 UTC,"Very good advice  This is a very well talked about topic and debated very well. I know that this is the biggest fear of the non-transitioning partner, but it can happen. It's not uncommon for your sexuality to shift through the use of hormones, and allowing yourself to be a complete woman. Thru transition you begin to notice men more, how they open doors for you, flirt with you and treat you like a woman. You also notice how they smell different and sometimes that can be new to you and enticing. They say the rule of thumb is that 1/3 will not lose a shift in sexuality and remain a lesbian, 1/3 will be bisexual and 1/3 will shift to straight.  You need to tell your wife with a support network because you are not being fair to her either and the longer you wait, the worse it will be. This way it will give both of you a fair chance to move on in your life's."

I feel a little guilty feeling that way as I read through all of these very understanding responses, but honestly, that would be my reaction. My gf swears up and down that she's always been bisexual and that she'll love and be attracted to me after HRT and transition. Logically I know people can't help who they're attracted to and I have sympathy for OP, but I would be betrayed and angry and so hurt if my partner did this.   I am happy to support her and want nothing more than for her to be able to present the way she wants, but that means risking losing friends and family after she comes out and being a rock through the emotional roller-coaster of her transition. If I went through that with her only for her to leave me to date men, I wouldn't be able to forgive her. I recognize that might be unfair but it's the truth in my case."

This is also part of why I flipped out so much when my wife came out to me. I read story after story of trans people stating their sexuality changed after HRT so then I started worrying that even if I stayed, she'd leave me in the end. And I admit I still think about it sometimes, especially after reading a story like this. It's a pretty bad trigger for me. :/  I also feel like you should be certain of your sexuality before getting married. This is something you should know before making a life commitment. It's one thing to maybe realize your sexuality is a little more fluid down the line, it's another to leave your spouse because of it. I felt so used and betrayed when my wife told me she never liked vaginas (which wasn't true...long story), after being with her for seven years. It's basically saying she never liked sex with me. And I didn't understand why she risked losing her family to marry me if she felt that way. It tore me apart. I'm getting choked up remembering it. I just can't even give advice to OP because I don't think there is really anything she can do to make the situation better. But she better be absolutely sure this is what she really wants."
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,PANDADA,-2,Sat Jul 11 00:44:54 2015 UTC,I also feel like you should be certain of your sexuality before getting married.    She likely didn't even know her gender. Do you have any idea what kind of repression she was under?
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,Disposable_Corpus,12,Sat Jul 11 13:01:17 2015 UTC,But doesn't gender identity have nothing to do with sexual orientation? That's what everyone keeps saying.
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,PANDADA,-1,Sat Jul 11 13:15:55 2015 UTC,"But that's not how it's treated and nothing like what's berated into us from a young age. She was told every waking minute of every day that she was a boy and that means she has to like girls, with threats of violence for any deviation.   And when you have to play to that idea all the time you have to bury your deviation so deep even you forget about it and recontextualise it and project it onto everybody else.   Your feelings aren't wrong. It was unfair and hurtful and you deserved none of it. She needs some empathy, too, but that doesn't lessen the harm done."
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,Disposable_Corpus,8,Sat Jul 11 13:36:29 2015 UTC,"Some people experience a shift in their orientation after/during transition. It's not treason. You make it sound like she is doing this on purpose. Before I transitioned I dated women, and only saw myself in serious relationships with women. Within weeks of starting testosterone I noticed an increasing attraction to men, and decreased attraction to women. I now, 4 years on T, consider myself a gay man. I can't explain why it happened but it did. Maybe something like this is the case for OP."
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,Jackson99,5,Sat Jul 11 04:08:42 2015 UTC,Fuck. I didn't realize until this moment how nervous I am about my partner having the same experience once they start T.
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,markoyolo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. It's a good thing to be aware of, but I also don't think you need to worry about it too much. It's definitely not what the majority experience. I know a lot of trans guys and only a small amount of them experienced a change in orientation. Most of those guys now consider themselves bi. I only personally know one other guy who went completely from one end of the spectrum to the other, like I did."
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,Jackson99,0,Tue Jul 14 05:12:30 2015 UTC,"People change, it doesn't matter why, people make mistakes. If she married her wife knowing that she wasn't attracted to her that would be one thing, but it doesn't seem like that was the case. Her sexuality changed or maybe she simply discovered it, but either way it is what it is now and that's what matters, it would be dishonest to her partner not to tell her, or to try and make it work when she seems fairly sure it won't. Of course if she actually is bisexual then it would be different but she took a year to try and figure that out so it seems like she isn't, especially considering that she's sure despite being conflicted about it. This isn't a good situation for either of them, it's a rough reason to have to break up and I do feel bad for her partner, but I think it's unfair to call this a betrayal, it's just a shitty, awful situation that's no one's fault-however tempting it might be to lay blame- and it doesn't have an easy solution, but that's life."
mypartneristrans,3cu90m,Mytransaccount33,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"This is by far my biggest fear. I have always known I was bisexual, even though I mostly dated men to fall into the society norm. I am now with a MTF who is so confused that he ( his current pronoun choice ) is taking HRT for 3 months, sees changes, gets freaked out, and stops. So not healthy for him. I will never change my feelings for him, but his may change for me. This is the biggest fear that I have, the biggest. The amount of betrayal I would feel is not even explainable. You need to tell your SO, there is no doubt about that. But don't expect them to be accepting and understanding considering they were there for you. All you can do is be honest and hopefully they will find it in their hearts to forgive you and understand. I wish you luck."

Sometimes for no apparent reason.  In any event after a few hours, everything resets back to ""normal"" and that's that.  Hasn't impaired my life any.

But I've heard that every sterotype you hear about 13 yr old girls going through puberty is basically what you'll be dealing with when your partner is going through their 2nd puberty. I'd assume 7 months in their body is still adjusting to the hormones so I'm going to say probably normal! I remember myself going through puberty and it was not pretty... ! Just hang in there :)

So yea, maybe that kind of counts as mood swings?   From my side, I'd describe it as feeling like I'm not as distant from my emotions anymore, which can be a good thing, but it also means I'm no longer as good at staying in control of them as I used to :/"
mypartneristrans,3cqt7r,Thessalonike,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:38:35 2015 UTC,"My MtF partner hasn't so much been having mood /swings/, but more like mood amplifiers; everything is much more intense than they were before.

My wife reassures me everything will be fine, though we also had a lot of problems shortly before and then after she came out, but it's hard at times to really think everything in the relationship will remain the same when there are so many changes and when you read/hear so many stories. So many trans people are hurt of course if their partners leave them after they come out, but then as the partners, we read stories of sexuality changing after HRT so then we get scared too. I read a story (not on Reddit) a few months ago of a wife who stayed with her transitioning spouse, she wanted to stay, helped support her through so much, and then years later her spouse said they no longer feel attracted to women and just wanted to be with men so she asked for a divorce. That is my biggest fear. I never really ever considered that my spouse would leave me until after she came out to me and I started reading all these stories and it became very overwhelming. It's a lot to go through emotionally."

I continue to struggle to define why. It sounds like your partner may share some of my newfound anxiety.    My partner, like you, is very considerate and inclusive. She makes me feel like her transition is our transition. She tells me that her transition is only successful if we come out together. She talks with me about the changes in her body and the thoughts in her mind. These are the things she does that make me feel like I really am important.    In spite of all that goodness, there are still many hurdles for me to overcome emotionally and I also struggle with how that makes my partner feel and whether or not it brings into question the quality of my support. I hope you can practice patience with your partner as she works through her process. I hope she is in therapy and that she communicates as well with you as you have with us. Good luck to you both :)"

As a partner, mine is 100% reassuring. Loves me, wants me, forever and ever amen, but only today is real. We can't ever know what tomorrow will bring for sure, and that requires some level of accepting uncertainty. And the things that are uncertain are big, scary things.     I get caught up trying to be a model wife and feel like my partner might be so much further along if it wasn't for me being in the way, so I know where your wife is coming from. Aside from keeping the communication open and continuous, I'm not sure how you can allay her fears - much of that will have to come from herself."

mypartneristrans,3coqy5,ServerCora,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:29 2015 UTC,I wish my parter cared this much about what I'm going through.  You're a good person!
mypartneristrans,3coqy5,ServerCora,2,Thu Jul 9 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"I find that anytime I'm REALLY happy and there's a big change on the horizon, I can get worried that it's going to mess with my HAPPY. Basically: change is scary (even when it's a good change). Maybe she's got some of that going on?  My partner is an FTM who is questioning the degree of transitioniness that would be right for them. I'm bi-ish (basically I love all the physical bits but only fall in love with men) and I've known since the beginning that my partner was 'non-binary' or 'genderqueer' but they were just figuring out the words to describe themself at the time. TL:DR I am not surprised or disappointed by the thought of them transitioning. In fact, I'm SO excited and proud to help them in this journey of discovery. It's amazing to see how much more alive they are now that they are exploring who they really are...  HOWEVER, we are so freaking happy at the moment and so even though I'm excited about the possibility of their transitioning, it also sometimes scares me. I can get caught up in worries like ""what if their moods change on T and we don't get along anymore?""""what if they don't want me after they transition?""""How much will I miss their old bits when they're gone?""  Some of my worries are silly and some are more valid and really none of them have any immediate answers. But what helps is that it's okay for me to have fears too and share those with my partner. I'm their big emotional support most of the time but occasionally I need support in this too. Which can be really hard to ask for because I feel guilty for needing support when they are the person who is actually going through stuff. Sometimes it helps for someone to just say ""It's okay for you to be scared too. We're in this together and we'll figure things out as they come.""  Also, I find reminding me of past fears that turned out well can help me put things in perspective. For example, I was worried when they chopped off all their hair because I loved it long and curly. But, you know what? I love the new cut SO much! I was worried for nothing. With change you also can gain awesome things you never had before but when you don't know what those things are going to be it's easy to get fixated on the worst case scenario.   And when focusing on the changes that turned out well isn't enough, I focus on all the things that won't change. A lot of who you are is going to stay the same. Maybe remind her of some of those things so she has a small piece of stability to hold onto in this sea of BIG change. Best of luck :)"
mypartneristrans,3coqy5,jenlb714,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:26:56 2015 UTC,"These are all great suggestions! Thanks, Girl_Dino :)"
mypartneristrans,3coqy5,Dina0214,2,Fri Jul 10 02:42:36 2015 UTC,"First off, I applaud you for staying strong :) and it's awesome to have such a supportive partner even though it can be quite difficult at times. What you're going through sounds very similar to my situation. I'm MtF and I've been with current girlfriend for over 2 years now. I came out to her as a crossdresser pretty early in our relationship and she seemed perfectly okay with it (but I had known for years that I wasn't a crossdresser and the feelings of gender confusion were much deeper, I just hadn't fully come to terms with the fact that I am trans at that point). Fast forward about another year (last September), I come out to her as transgender and she seems super excited for me and supportive the day I tell her but that feeling was quickly replaced with confusion, feelings of inadequacy, fear of the future, and so on and so forth. She has been supportive since the beginning but it was extremely difficult for her to talk about much of anything related to my transition for months since I think was still coming to terms with the fact that the transition was really happening and wasn't just something I brought up that would happen in the unspecified future. Also need to mention that she has only ever dated guys and never been attracted to girls so that definitely added a extra bit of complexity to the situation. But not to dwell on the rough start too much, things are much better now. I think what has helped the most is trying my best to always keep an open communication with her about anything and everything that's going through my mind. For example, early on she would get frustrated at me during things like taking hours on my makeup but a lot of times it was due to having an overwhelming sense of dysphoria that day, not because I actually needed that much time to get ready. Once I explained these things to her, it helped her realize that what might seem like a trivial problem to an on looker was in realty a much more difficult thing to deal with. It might seem like a generic or obvious thing to say, but being overtly open with my girlfriend has greatly helped her support me more and more with each day. Additionally, at least from an emotional perspective, I feel that we are closer than ever since I am way more open about things with her compared to the year or so prior to coming out to her. Believe me, I think we still have some hurdles to overcome but we're light years ahead of where we were when I first came out. The next step that I want to explore is couples therapy to really delve into the conversation. She has only come to therapy with me once but it was extremely helpful. I think it would be great for us to help our relationship grow even more in a positive direction. Keep in mind that therapy doesn't mean that something is terribly wrong in the relationship but can just mean that you both know that there are some difficult subjects in your life and you just need a little push from an expert to start the conversations. I'm sure you're probably very open with her about what is going on in your life but I would maybe investigate some sort of couples counseling to really explore the tough subjects. I know from experience that it can be difficult to really delve deep into conversation when it's a potentially upsetting topic."

She needs to take the next step, and you can't do that for her. Just be supportive and loving, which is what you are already doing.  Actually, has she been to a gender therapist? Perhaps her speaking with one would help, instead of just going the Informed Consent route. Just a thought..."
mypartneristrans,3cox8g,ServerCora,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"I was worried about all of the thighs that she is/was. I don't like the idea of ""shaming"" my parents because I'm transgender. I don't like the idea of family knowing that I am, and then possibly thinking different if me, or excluding me in a passive way. Also, I don't like the idea of my parents thinking of me differently, as like a failure or something. I don't think they do, but it still scares me.   And how I got around this, was knowing that I could come out whenever I wanted. I now live in kinda a dual world, but it's working for me, and allowing myself to get braver to come out on my terms, while still being able to transition.   I came out to my parents right away. But, I've not come out to anyone else other than close friends, and I've been transitioning for a year. I pretty much pass as long as I dress right, and my fam has definitely made comments on how I look more like my mom and that my style has changed, but it's only been positive. So, I don't know if I'll be able to make it much longer without coming out."
mypartneristrans,3cmp64,thro19421c,9,Thu Jul 9 02:38:06 2015 UTC,"She is not communicating with you very well, and that is not good at all for your relationship.  I get all the feelings about not wanting to be responsible for her not transitioning and for always wondering in the back of your head WHEN she will do so.  I've been there, and yes, my spouse ended up transitioning after saying that she wanted to 'stay a man.'  It's also totally not right of her to call you her BF, and that makes me wonder if she envisions some redefined roles in your relationship.  She needs to be talking to you about that and figuring out what you are both comfortable with.  Hopefully the gender therapist will help her be more comfortable with talking about it.  I wonder if you could tag along to one of her appointments?  A far as the fading attraction, I totally get it.  I was looking at old pics of my spouse the other night.  I thought she was so sexy as a man (she also presented very masculine).  I honestly don't think in this situation that being bi is always enough.  You fell in love with her as a man.  Just because you are attracted to women doesn't mean that you will be attracted to EVERY woman."
mypartneristrans,3cmp64,bookwormxx,2,Thu Jul 9 12:24:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply, I felt really alone when I typed this so I'm glad there are a lot of people with similar situations.  I had a discussion with her tonight, and she danced around the topic of her calling me her 'boyfriend' and claimed it was a joke. I feel like she's not being honest. I think our relationship has a lot of communication issues with both of us, and the prospect of transitioning is magnifying them. She said I could tag along on one of her appointments if it was okay with her therapist. I'm thinking about getting my own therapist so I have someone to talk to who isn't my partner."
mypartneristrans,3cmp64,bookwormxx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"I think that would be a great idea, getting your own therapist.  I wish I had done that sooner!  I bottled up a lot of my feelings when my spouse came out to me, because I didn't want to make her feel guilty or hold her back if she needed to transition.  And I'm sure that your partner making you feel like the decision depends on you just exacerbates that fear of saying the wrong thing or having the wrong reaction to something.  If you ever feel alone or just need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me.  I think sometimes just talking about it all can be therapeutic!"
mypartneristrans,3cmp64,Awn-Uzumaki,5,Sat Jul 11 04:12:01 2015 UTC,I think her saying that she's going to put off her transition just to stay with you is incredibly bad for your emotional health. That's putting a lot of pressure and unnecessary responsibility on you.   If that's making your anxiety worse you really need to discuss it with her. The way things are now is really unfair on you.
mypartneristrans,3cmp64,thaneofpain,3,Thu Jul 9 08:45:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. That was one of my main issues with her bringing up transitioning, was that it seemed like she was going to make the decision based solely on how I felt about it. I brought it up with her tonight and she still said that the pros (being in a relationship with me) outweighed the cons (possibly transitioning alone, not being with me).  I worry that she isn't seriously thinking about this and is making a decision based on how comfortable she feels with me at the moment.  I want to believe she is making the right choices for herself, but my anxiety is getting the better of me."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,SphirosOKelli,12,Tue Jul 7 07:24:22 2015 UTC,"I am sorry you are going through this. If we put aside the trans issue, it would appear that you are not in a healthy, sustainable relationship. There are red flags everywhere.   She can't handle you as you are. This will only get worse and I doubt your current relationship will strand up to the strain of transition. I don't usually advocate splitting up, but I think that would be the healthiest thing for both of you.  edit phone typos"
mypartneristrans,3cegde,unixbeardxd,9,Tue Jul 7 09:11:22 2015 UTC,"Neither of you sounds like you should be in this relationship. I'm not going to defend the worst o your gf's behaviour but It sounds like she's struggling with the idea of being with someone who is transitioning - it is mentally and emotionally taxing to be with someone undergoing such huge change. She very well might still love you, but be struggling to reconcile that with not being attracted to men. Did she know you were trans or did you come out to her while in the relationship?  And it might just sound worse written down, but I don't think any cis partner wants to be told that 'technically you are the one who is incapable of loving me'. You're both throwing around language and arguments that suggests to me you're just trying to antagonise the other."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,bookpig,2,Tue Jul 7 10:22:04 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, my bad - I didn't actually tell her that she was the one who wasn't capable of loving me - though it's how I feel, I actually told her that I accepted that she couldn't love me once I transition, that she is a lesbian so I get that she can't love me once my body is male. I really do get it. I found myself recently after we had been together and it has made things worse. And I tell her every time she tells me that I understand and that if she needs or wants to separate I am 100% supportive and will take care of her. It has been my utmost priority to make sure she feels no resentment from me on this, though she doesn't mind telling me that I am ruining her life and that I don't have to do this if I don't want to...   But the other stuff... The anger, the sex... it's been happening for so long now - I am trying to suck it up so that things aren't worse but I am starting to feel drained and emotionless... She keeps saying we need to go out and buy more toys and all I can think is how badly I don't want us to buy a new vibrator... I don't know if I can take another session of laying there while she gets off and then trying to figure out how to get off so she will be happy that we had ""amazing"" sex...   She'll be applying for over the road truck driving soon... that should help. I feel so stupid and weird. What kind of person has sex when they don't want to? Like what is wrong with me that I can't just say no? Can I even be mad at her? I sometimes try to avoid sex for a couple of hours and she just persists... Then she wants to talk about how ""good"" it was and I can't bring myself to tell her it made me feel miserable...   I don't even know what is wrong with me... I really can't hold it against her if I can't say no. But I guess I wish she cared enough to notice my disinterest and give me space... At this point it's only 50/50 that I even ""take my turn"" because sometimes I just feel so gross....   It'll be over soon. Then it won't matter anymore and I wont feel this way."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,bookpig,3,Tue Jul 7 10:42:07 2015 UTC,"I hope I didn't come across too harsh in my last post. To be honest, it sounds like she's in a lot of denial and is lashing out at you - it's understandable, but not okay at all. Unless you're acting incredibly enthusiastic  (it doesn't sound as if you are at all) when she asks for sex, she's either deliberately ignoring your discomfort or has some idea that you'll like it once it gets going. That's not okay. It speaks to a larger issue of her ignoring your feelings in general, and I would have to believe it will only get worse the further into transition you are. You deserve better."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,Ranulf12,9,Tue Jul 7 11:11:21 2015 UTC,She... doesn't seem all that interested in your emotional health. It's not good to attach yourself to someone who wants to do things only their way. Especially when she got mad at you for not saying you had a perfect relationship. That raises all kinds of http://www.bluenose.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/red-flag.jpg
mypartneristrans,3cegde,bookwormxx,4,Tue Jul 7 07:38:51 2015 UTC,"Did she act like this prior to you coming out as trans?  It's possible that she is lashing out as a coping mechanism because she feels that she has no control over what is happening in her life/relationship.  I'm not making excuses for her, just trying to understand things from her perspective, especially if this is behavior is not typical for her.  It sounds like neither of you are getting your needs met in the relationship.  I think a break (a REAL break - no bed sharing!!) would help both of you clear your thoughts.   When my spouse and I started sleeping in separate bedrooms, it really took a lot of the pressure off of both of us."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,bookwormxx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:55:21 2015 UTC,"I think that these things have been ongoing issues that the transition has exacerbated. I have definitely discussed the anger reaction with her, definitely discussed needing to feel comfortable to say ""no"", among other things. Everything had been decent for a few months and I started to feel like everything was great. We were made for each other - then I realized that I was denying a major part of myself that had to be addressed and everything we struggled with before came roaring back, this time compounded by the fact that I feel guilty and insecure.  So part of this might be my fault... I am pretty sensitive - maybe I am taking her words too harshly, maybe she wouldn't flip out if I said I wasn't up for sex. I can't tell anymore...  She is getting ready to apply for an over the road trucking company which would have her out of the house for most of each month - I think that will be the perfect time for us to start seeing where we stand because we will both have breathing room.  Behavior can be changed right? I want us to go to counseling but I'm not sure if it will be worth it if she just isn't going to find me attractive at all. Or only if I don't grow facial hair, or a penis, or lose all my breasts...   I wish we could go back to when we first started dating... Everything was fun and fresh, she used to play around with me in bed... I can't remember the last time we just played around... I miss us so fucking badly... I don't mean to make this worse by closing off - I just can't tell which side is up right now..."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,bookwormxx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:55:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like her new job might be a blessing in disguise.  Sometimes all it takes is a little time apart to clear your thoughts.  It will probably be good for both of you.    Counseling might help you both to cope with things better and to sort out what each of you need, the redefined roles in your relationship, etc.  In the end, you may not be able to fulfill each other's needs.  I think you will probably just a reach a point where you will have to say ""I'm transitioning"" and let the chips fall where they may.  Something else to consider...you seem very hurt by the fact that your partner is having trouble with the thought of you losing your breasts, obtaining a penis, etc.  Yet, I saw in another comment that you wrote that you 'love vaginas' and require one in a partner.  Maybe if you try to think about it in that perspective, you will understand your partner's struggle.  Think about if she were transitioning and how you would feel.  I'm not saying it gives her the right to be manipulative, but it does not make her a bad person for not knowing if her sexuality can bend enough to stay in a relationship with you.  I hope everything sorts itself out for you soon.  I know how hard it is to be in limbo and to feel such turmoil in your relationship.  I hope that you find some peace soon..."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,bookwormxx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"We reached a point yesterday where she told me that our relationship issues were all my fault. That I messed everything up and she felt like I had lied to her. I understood her feelings of loss. I also accept and understand that she may not find me attractive once I transition.   But the misplaced anger, the punishment for upsetting her, basically have to have sex whether I want to or not... I'm so over all of that. I don't have enough emotional energy to focus on transition and deal with these other things.   So I wrote her a response letter in which I lay out why I am closing down. I also lay out what I need to be interested in trying to fix things. At the end of the day though... Is there even a point to trying to fix things? She is going to leave eventually anyways..."

It sounds like you need to transition, and it‚Äôs unfair of her to act like it‚Äôs a selfish ‚Äòchoice‚Äô you are making.  When people say things like that about my spouse ‚Äì like she made this choice and has to live with the consequences if I leave ‚Äì I am always quick to correct them and remind them that it‚Äôs not a choice and that I know if she have had it all figured out, she would have disclosed it to me much earlier in our relationship.  I wish your partner would give you the benefit of the doubt, even if the relationship ends romantically.  Can you elaborate on why you wanted the relationship to work out but are not interested in sex?  Is it because of dysphoria?  No libido?  Because she wants you to fill roles you are uncomfortable with?  Do you envision a permanently sexless relationship (if you stay together) or think that‚Äôs just a temporary feeling?  I‚Äôm curious, because in my own relationship, sex is a huge issue.  If my spouse said ‚Äòno more sex‚Äô that would be the end of the relationship for me.   In fact, the start of our quasi-separation was after a conversation where she told me she thought our sex life was over.  I try so hard to be understanding, but it's hard not to feel rejected when I'm in a relationship with someone who not only never initiates sex with me but also turns down my advances.  I try so hard to be understanding that sex is difficult for her, but I would be lying if I said that as her partner it doesn't suck big time."

It was to the point where I literally told her I felt like I was raping myself because if I didn't perform she would hound me, snap at me, and throw it in my face.   It's been awhile since my friend has come to visit, he just doesn't really feel comfortable here. Things got better, but still when I try to gently push off her advances she gets upset.

I felt bad but I'm pretty much insinuated that all transition stuff aside that if things didn't change it wouldn't matter if she loved me as a man or not. So she agreed to counseling - we'll see how that goes for us. She's been super nice today... It's been a great day. We shall see if things really improve or not.

I'm an example of someone whose marriage survived transition, and doing it required us talking to each other a LOT and being on the same page emotionally. Your description of your girl screams, ""ME! ME! What about ME!"" and I'd be hard pressed to see a relationship survive like that. You can't NOT transition, and she could be in the first phase of coping - denial - but everything you posted seems like there are bigger problems than just trying to cope with a major life change, and those bigger problems likely will derail this relationship anyway."

At the same time, if she does somehow manage to roll with me and I don't spend the time on the relationship than I will be a man stuck with a girlfriend he can't stand...   All of the unknowns and uncertainty and the flexibility of the universe make it really hard for me to bite the bullet and say that we should or shouldn't break up...

mypartneristrans,3cegde,bookwormxx,2,Wed Jul 8 04:35:35 2015 UTC,"This relationship just seems so unhealthy and there are red flags everywhere. It may be best if you totally separate. You should definitely not be sleeping in the same bed, not with how she emotionally manipulates you into sex you don't want. This is neither healthy, nor sustainable. For a relationship to survive transition it requires compromise from both sides, not one person saying ""do things my way or I'm leaving."" From what I've read it just seems like you would be much better off without her, even though it will hurt for a while. If you break it off though, you have to stay apart. No sex, no cuddling, no kissing, it's over. You may be able to be friends eventually, but you would need time apart first to let things actually end with some finality. Life is too short, please don't put up with being unhappy ant longer than you have to."
mypartneristrans,3cegde,thaneofpain,2,Tue Jul 7 13:19:52 2015 UTC,"Im sorry you are going through this but you need to put a stop to it. If you are going to take a break, you CANT sleep in the same bed. You are putting yourself in bad situations and it is causing you to feel more pain. You need to not give her the opportunity to take (or try to take) advantage of you. She needs to accept you for who you are and treat you better before things can be more physical between you. She isn't being fair or thinking of you, she is just continuing what she wants, you to be a woman when you aren't. Personally, I think you need to get away from her entirely until you feel comfortable being around her. Both of you are obviously having issues with everything (your relationship, your transitioning, etc). You need to stop thinking about how she will feel and think about how destructive she is for you. I mean you just spent a long time writing up this post about how you feel but I bet she doesnt even know about it. Make her read it. Make her understand how hurt you are and how she makes you feel.   I agree with Unixbearded, your relationship is not healthy nor sustainable. As long as she continues to abuse you and not accept you, your relationship is not something you should be in. You need to get out of it entirely before you get hurt anymore than you already have. Do what is best for you. She is a grown woman, she can take care of herself.

I am more attracted to women than to men, and I still sometimes feel weird about my partner becoming more feminine. Partly it's just that I can see it changing the dynamic we've already had established for a long time. Partly it's uncertainty about the future, because I don't know what things will feel like once we start to be perceived as a lesbian couple instead of a straight one. Your reaction to hearing your partner plans on a name change reminds me of mine when my partner first started wearing a bra... I mean, I knew it was coming, but it still took me by surprise. It made things start to feel real in a way they hadn't up to that point. Keep the lines of communication open - I find it helps a lot if my partner is able to talk things over with me before making changes, because otherwise things that she's given lots of thought to end up feeling unexpected and strange to me. Going slowly is helping us move forward together."

A difference for me is that I have had experiences with both men and women and enjoyed them both but I would say that I am more attracted to females. But at the end of the day I don't feel like some lesbians don't understand where I am, I know I am not hetero, and Bisexual seems to fit sometimes but other times it just feels like that isn't quite right either.

Something I've read on this subreddit is that quite a few people have voiced that their sexuality is their partner, if that makes sense. While they are attracted to their partner when said partner identified as male, they're still attracted to them, now, when the partner identifies as female (but not necessarily attracted to other females).

The important thing is that you take the time to reflect on what your relationship means for your future and you need to discuss with your partner what that future includes in terms of her transition, so you are fully aware of what you will be involved in. You need to understand what being with her will mean ultimately for you. You have to be comfortable with the future of being with her. You have to prepare yourself. The more accepting and comfortable you get with the future, the better and easier it will be.   I am a cis straight woman whose husband of 10 years is transitioning to become the female she has always wanted to be. I have never been with another woman or even another trans person. This is all new to me, but as time progresses, my nerves and fears disappear and I see how truly lucky I am to be a part of this new and unique world that I have been introduced to since she begun transitioning. Given time, I think you will go through the same experience, where those fears and nerves will be just a distant memory.   I wish you the very best of luck for you and your partner.

I think this was a good way to do it, as it meant that she had the person's full attention, and was better able to direct the conversation. I'll be talking to my own family next week and plan to do the same thing. Because it's my family, I'll be having the initial conversation privately with each person, where they can feel free to ask questions without feeling embarrassed or weird about it, and then plan to have some time when they can talk to us together.  My partner also made sure she had on hand some printed info for people so they had somewhere to start in reading up on being trans. I think she brought this booklet. I'm planning to bring this one, which I like better.  I think keeping things simple at first is good. People don't immediately need all the details about electrolysis, surgery, etc. My partner tried to have the first conversation center on feelings and explaining that this is something that she feels very strongly and is not going to go away. Of course she explained her general plans to transition, but saved the details for later conversations after her parents got over the initial surprise.  Best of luck to you and your SO!"

My partner is in the early stages of planning top surgery for sometime this year. His chest is right on the border between double incision and peri. He had a consultation with the only surgeon who offers chest reconstruction in our home city. She said double incision, but he doesn't find her style of cutting appealing so he's going to shop around. It's obviously his choice, but I am so terrified that he is going to choose an out-of-town surgeon precisely because it would be just me and him and a miserable hotel room and then a long, long painful drive. Instead of a few friends and family helping out, with recovery in our home. :/  I hope that you both feel better soon. Best of luck."

mypartneristrans,3c6o24,shadowclone12,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:58:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just had leg lipo and top surgery together with Medalie in June! Can I ask a couple of questions?   What pain meds is he on? Can you describe how/where the vest is causing the bruising how it's messing with the drains? What makes you think there's an allergic reaction going on with the foam? What kind of compression garments do you have for the legs? Do they have the zippers going down all the way?   Edit: I'll go ahead and put some of my experiences here: I had a lot of itching on my legs from the foam, but I think that was more irritation from the area being shaved and hair starting growing back than anything else. I also could feel the incisions getting caught on the shorts. It was uncomfortable. I think it got a bit better when I would take walks, but I had that catching keep happening up until the stitches dissolved. After the first week when I could take the shorts off of to clean them I definitely trimmed the exposed stitch ends if I could. The nurses got my vest on crocked too - this might have been a bit of my fault, I think I got too small of a vest to deal with all the swelling. But yeah, that sucker wouldn't move anywhere. Don't worry about it messing anything up results-wise because it's still definitely compressing things. As far as the drain sites go, the nurses put extra foam around the exit area to try to help with irritation, but mine kept falling out. Maybe try to get some extra padding in there? For pain meds they had me on hyrdocodine something or other - after a couple of days I was also allowed to take Motrin on top of that. So maybe that could help a little with the pain?   One more question for you - does he have one of those neck travel pillows to sleep with? I quite frankly have no idea how I would have slept without it. If you don't have one I'd highly recommend trying to get ahold of one."
mypartneristrans,3c6o24,shadowclone12,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:47:44 2015 UTC,"This is great! Thanks for the response. Did I say he went to Medalie too, because he did!   Oxy. And he is taking Ibuprofen as well, along with Benadryl for the allergy reaction. The vest is causing bruising on the stomach. Since the vest is crooked the arm hole for the right side is pressing up against the drain area and it is very painful to have the drains stripped. I don't think they are coming out, but he says it feels like they are every time I strip them, so I think I may not have been stripping them well enough as there is a bit of bleeding around the site so I have upped my stripping game, as it were. But the paper Medalie gave us said the bleeding is not a concern.   The top of the compression shorts also won't stop rolling over and cutting off the ability to breathe properly - we have to keep adjusting the waistband and that causes the whole garment and subsequently the foam to shift as well. We cut it a little bit where the elastic is on the waistband (not below, where the compression happens) and that sort of helps but not a ton, we still have to adjust. We think the lady at Marena quoted the wrong size as well and that is probably causing the roll-over issue. We also loosened one of the eye hooks, but then determined that was making the issue worse. And we have also unzipped the garment a touch, but not a lot.   He has an allergic reaction to some adhesives, but only on certain parts of his body. One of those is the thigh area and so the adhesive on the foam is likely causing a reaction. There's a constant burning sensation, especially when there is any pressure on that area. The form the reaction takes is small blisters along the edge of the adhesive, and when I shine a light toward the bits of foam I can see on the thigh through the hole in the garment, it is definitely red around the edges. When he moves sometimes it feels like his skin is being ripped off. The on-call doctor told us to take benadryl and it at least helps him pass out and sleep. Yes, the garments have zippers all the way down.   Thanks for the experience notes - he has definitely been experiencing the incisions tearing open or getting caught, so it's nice to know that's just part of the game.   And yes, we do have a travel pillow and it has saved out lives! Also a nice tip we discovered is a pee funnel. It's so, so helpful. http://www.amazon.com/pStyle-Blue/dp/B002AA2LDW/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1436134492&sr=1-1&keywords=pStyle  A few questions for you:   How did you manage moving around and positioning yourself? Were you totally uncomfortable the whole time?  Did you have more than one person helping you?  How is the healing process going for you?   I think we are going to request a visit tomorrow (Monday) even though the post-op is Tuesday to see if there's anything we can do about the garment situation. We may have to have a bigger one sent overnight so the drive home isn't more miserable than it has to be.  Thanks again for your response. It is reassuring and helpful!"
mypartneristrans,3c6o24,shadowclone12,0,Sun Jul 5 22:18:27 2015 UTC,"Were you also surprised about the whole leaking thing from lipo? Because I had no idea I was basically going to be oozing for 2 days.   About the drain stripping, I found that it was really unpleasant to have someone else do it. It was very helpful to have help emptying the drains and unpinning/pinning them onto the vest, but the actual stripping was way more comfortable when I had control on the tugging. I used one hand to pinch the tube and keep it still and then the other one to pinch and drag the fluid forward, and kind of inch-wormed it along. I did have some bleeding around the site, but not a whole lot.   Are the compression shorts you got also the high-waisted ones? I ended up with those and they were waaaaaaaaay too tight on the stomach. I ended up undoing the top three eyelets on both sides but I still have bruises from where it dug in. I also got blisters , but it was actually from where the adhesive came together and the compression was just making the skin that got caught there rub together. It burned. It wasn't fun. It improves if they burst, I ended up lancing mine when I got the opportunity. Not sure if that's the same thing that's happening on your end, but it is something that could also be happening.   Answering your questions:    Positioning was challenging for the first couple of days, especially while I was afraid of bleeding on everything. The worst was getting the pillows right on the bed. Otherwise I was able to manage getting up and around reasonably well. I felt strange because I knew I wasn't supposed to do a lot of heavy lifting, but I was basically doing planks pretty regularly.  I was uncomfortable, but it was manageable. The pain meds worked pretty well for me, but when they wore off I could really feel it. I'd take them early if I felt things getting too bad. The legs were definitely the worst part especially before I figured out to undo the pants where they were literally digging into me.  I had my parents helping me out. My dad would be gone all day working so my mom was primarily the one watching me, but it was nice that he could run out and pick something up if we needed it.  Healing is going great! The incisions look a lot better once the junk finally comes off. I ended up wearing the compression vest (a properly sized one) longer than suggested just because the aftercare called for having moisturizer on the incisions, which then would get on my clothes, so I kept using the pads and wearing the vest until I could put scar strips on incisions.    Let me know if you have any more questions! Also, look into getting some compression shorts for when you can finally ditch the compression garment pants. It took forever for mine to come in so I ended up wearing the other things waaaay longer than I wanted to."

mypartneristrans,3bsvnz,tipoftheicebergs,9,Wed Jul 1 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry... it must be hard for a relationship to end after you've been through all that together.  I recently read the book ""Love, Always"" which is a set of writings by the partners of trans people. Some of the relationships work out, and some don't, but one author points out that when the relationship ends, it's generally not the trans-ness that killed it. These relationships end for all the same reasons any relationship ends. (Not counting cases where sexual incompatibility was the issue.) Transition can be a stressor (the same as any issue like financial difficulties or health problems) but that's the pressure that causes the relationship to break along the fault lines that were already there.  It sounds at least like you have happy memories of being with your ex. Best wishes as you move forward in the next phase of your life."

Time and time again, I see comments on here about how the relationships that don't survive must have had other issues, or they must not have loved each other enough, or they didn't communicate well enough.  That's BS!  It's such an overly simplified way of looking at things.  Sure, when a relationship survives and remains sexual, etc. and then ends quite some time later, it's very probable that it was due to other issues.  But in the beginning of the 'coming out' phase, the ""trans-ness"" and the other issues are often so meshed with each other that it's difficult to pull them apart from each other when you try to analyze things.  In my case, my relationship with my spouse was (and still is) very strong.  Sexual incompatibility is truly our only struggle."

mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,DreamTimeDeathCat,20,Wed Jul 1 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"My partner originally came out 3 years ago saying they were non binary in gender, but more heavily on they male side. They were AMAB, and I married them and thought I was marrying a man 8 years ago. They said nothing would really change. Last month, she came out as mtf and wants to start taking hormones and present female.   I am absolutely devastated  as well. I love her as a person, but I know we will absolutely not be sexual compatible. I don't like breasts. I am attracted to masculinity. We are looking at divorce with 2 small kids and fucked up finances.   I don't have a lot of advice other than the fact that your sexuality is just as valid as his gender identity. You can't make yourself be attracted to something you are not. People say a lot on this sub that the person is still the same person and if you love them it will work out. While the person is internally the same person, attraction and sex do matter to a relationship. If you can't see yourself remaining attracted to him, then that is an ok thing.   You can always see how it goes, see how you feel about the changes when they occur and give it a shot. But attraction is attraction."
mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,mec_happens,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:37:06 2015 UTC,Well said!
mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,bookwormxx,9,Fri Jul 3 14:47:45 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be harsh here and while this may come out critical it's not meant to be anything but helpful.  The number one thing I have to say though, is absolutely do not lie to her. Don't tell her that you're going to be with her forever and find her attractive after starting testosterone if you know you won't. Be tactful and kind but be up front with that.   You can be supportive of someone and love them without being attracted to them, and if you need to be attracted to someone to get what you need out of a relationship there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but you shouldn't string her along by not telling her that it will probably become an issue for you.  Communication is incredibly important, and no one needs to be hurt by you not being attracted to masculine features; not you or her. (When you put it that way, it's a ridiculous thing to be hurt by.) But, if you don't bring it up as soon as possible it could hurt someone. The longer you let her believe that you're happy to be in a relationship with a masculine person, the more it will hurt when you finally have to admit that you aren't.  By all means, don't try to stop her, but tell her how you feel; not just about not being attracted to masculine features, but also about loving her and being supportive.  If my girlfriend told me today 'hey I love you, but I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone with a deep voice and facial hair' I'm sure we'd either work it out or stay friends at least, but if she pretended everything was great then had a breakdown and told me it wasn't working and she had been suffering in silence after I'd been on T for a year? Yeah, I'd feel lied to."
mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,GoblinPaladin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"To piggy back on that, it's important that this honesty comes from a place of actual compassion and not from a place of hoping that seeing your lack of attraction will reduce your SO's desires.  For me, I feel super guilty that I am changing my body to make me happy knowing that she probably won't find me attractive once it's all said and done. Comments that reference my growing masculinity as gross or weird - like telling me to clean the bathroom because now it smells like a gross man urinal, or saying that you don't want me to take hormones because you don't want to inhale gross man stink only serve to hurt me on a personal level - even if there is an aspect of ""honesty"" about the comments. Conversations where we have both expressed, simply from a place of honesty, that she might not find my male body attractive don't hurt my feelings because I understand sexuality and I get that if you are into and turned on by the female body no matter how feminine or soft your transitioning FTM might be they will eventually have a male body that you just might not be able to hang with.  My partner and I are working on letting her sort of absorb my transition and eventually I am going to move onto hrt. The plan is for her stick around as long as she can but we both agreed that we can't promise what the outcome is. For me it makes me feel very insecure, like I worry about doing something that will just run her off, but at the end of the day it gives both of us a chance to realistically weigh our options. Or it will... Once I stop trying to tell her and myself that I can sacrifice parts of my transition to please her... (I'm working on that part...)"
mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,SphirosOKelli,5,Thu Jul 2 05:29:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks to everyone that commented. I messaged her today (she's actually halfway across the country on vacation) and shared my concerns. Things look like they'll go in a fine direction right now, she actually said a completely masculine appearance doesn't appeal to her. Writing this up and reading people's replies has boosted my confidence about the whole thing. While it might be a little stressful for me to get used to, I'm trying to stay positive and think about all the good times we've shared. Again, thank you for commenting or even reading. Gave me the confidence to talk to her."
mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,kristendk,2,Thu Jul 2 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"No good advice, I'm afraid. You both just have to be honest about who you are. Hugs, if you want them.  (Pre-everything MTF parent married to a straight woman, with no answers. Didn't understand it myself until recently.)"
mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,Rrroxy,2,Wed Jul 1 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"I suggest lots of talking and good communication! Your needs are important too, and while I know straight women who have happily stayed with their mtf wives while still identifying as straight, sexual attraction wasn't as important to them in that phase of their lives. Not everyone has the same needs though, and your sexuality is very much a part of who you are and what you need.   Mention your questions. There may be a lot of ftm feels involved with being afab bigender person than there are about femininity. Sometimes when something is denied--or seemingly denied--that initial rush of freedom might mean a time when it's really important for her to explore that side of her identity. My wife took several years of experimenting with her identity before she realized she really wasn't quite as feminine as she was dressing most of the time--her aesthetic is still much the same as it was when she identified as cis male. But that freedom to do the feminine things denied to her and the struggle with dysphoria were very important for her early understanding of her identity and needs, and it was also therapeutic for her. But then, I'm not her, and I can't really say for sure. Because, my wife initially came out to me as a cis male cross dresser before later identifying as cis-mentally-but-dysphoric-physically, bigender, gender queer, and later finally realizing she was mtf the whole time! Some people inaccurately identify their experiences at first as they still have internalized things to go through, while others find their identity changes widely between months and even years.  In the end it's really going to come down to communication, and, honestly it's going to come down to what you need. I'd recommend talking to her, talk to her about her being bigender vs ftm, don't say it like you're questioning her ability to understand herself, really you're just expressing the concerns and thoughts flying around in your own head making you anxious. If the idea of bodies that are higher in testosterone (and, some people take lighter doses of T to go for an androgynous look, others take stronger doses, I'm not sure what she's looking into) makes you nervous, you really have got to tell her. You aren't required to change your sexuality because the person you are in love with doesn't fit the gender you are attracted to. Your relationship, well, might change. I'm not a good uh, person to really know what that might mean for you, being asexual, this is all the same as any relationship for me, but that's what makes the difference between allo and ace people. But communication is huge, you really have to be honest. And if you're honest and your datemate is honest and in the end your goals just don't match up, maybe you'll still be best friends, be in a more qplatonic relationship, stay together--I don't know you guys--but you know each other and you know your own needs.    I do hope that whatever happens is something that means good things for both of you in the long run!"
mypartneristrans,3bs9lv,mollymollykelkel,0,Wed Jul 1 23:15:12 2015 UTC,It's a tough position to be in. You have a few options:  1) Be honest about your feelings and open up your relationship so you're both sexually satisfied.  2) Be honest about your feelings and break up. Obviously a lot easier said than done. There's always the possibility of ya'll being friends once things settle down.   Hopefully that wasn't too blunt. Very sorry you're going through this. Unfortunately it's not something ya'll could've planned for. Hugs!
mypartneristrans,3br8df,sray374,2,Wed Jul 1 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"This is definitely one of the worse dysphoria areas for trans men that I've seen from all my guy friends (and my boo, who is curvy hips-wise as well). If your bf decides to go on T at some point, one of the most radical body fat changes is in the hip area- going from an ""hourglass"" fat distribution of estrogen-people to a more ""rectangle"" shape of testosterone-people. Remind him that he is fantastic and you love him. If he is looking for concrete answers (this may sound harsh), you can critique him on his walk. Women tend to have more ""hip-y"" walks than men, with swinging hips as opposed to a straight-from-the-hip motion. This might help! Hope everything goes well for you."
mypartneristrans,3br8df,Yourfavouritelesbian,2,Wed Jul 1 16:50:58 2015 UTC,Apparently Lopo suction is permanent. If hormones are not something your SO is interested in maybe Lopo on the hips? Then they would be less hip-y. It's an option at least.

Especially with scoliosis - one of my hips sticks out farther than the other and makes me look like I'm doing a feminine swagger stance all the time.

This isn't my favorite guide but if you skip to the section about the hips it goes into detail about what to wear and to look for. It mentions specifically to ""reduce [your] hips, enhance [your] shoulders."" I would also like to add trying to hide the hips by bulking his midsection. Otherwise, testosterone is the best way to distribute the weight to the ""masculine"" places."
mypartneristrans,3br8df,AlansShore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"Something I've found that has helped me is making a concious effort to look out for (presumably) cis guys with the trait that is causing me a problem. Men come in a wide range of shapes and while it's not as common, they are out there.   For me, I'm a shorty, so I make an effort to spot short men on the street and always smile when I pass one that I'm taller than (or around the same height).   It's not something that's going to change your boyfriend's body, but perhaps it might help change how he feels about it sometimes. Or, at the very least, offer occasional relief."
mypartneristrans,3bq4ju,ramsesniblick4th,5,Wed Jul 1 06:26:12 2015 UTC,Since you said they havent switched pronouns and you know the sitch better ill stick to the pronouns you use.  You can't change your sexuality and a relationship with a sexual nature can't survive with the sex suddenly cut away.   If you can't hang as his boyfriend that doesn't mean a damn thing. You aren't a terrible person. At the very least the fact that youre here seeking guidance proves that.  So let's say you can't hang at being his boyfriend. Does that mean you can't still be his friend? Does that mean you can't still support him?   The best thing to do is talk to him. Maybe this is salvageable? You obviously love him. But if you don't talk things wont get better.
mypartneristrans,3bq4ju,Royal_Robin,2,Wed Jul 1 14:41:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks.  We do talk, and he knows I am struggling.  I'm not sure we're there yet, but at some point if things don't improve we will have to call it a day.  With regard to remaining friends, he is my best friend in the whole world. It really is just the sex.    My hope is when she discovers her mojo everything will fall into place.  But it has been a year..."
mypartneristrans,3bq4ju,Royal_Robin,2,Thu Jul 2 06:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry dude. Dating a trans person as a gay guy is hard. My boyfriend is ftm trans and that was confusing at first. I love him more than anything though so just like, good luck dude. Anything is possible."

mypartneristrans,3bq4ju,themanwhowasoctober,7,Fri Jul 3 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"That sucks.  I'm really sorry.  deep breath  If you can't hang with this, it does not make you a bad person.  The heartbreak is real, the pain is real, but I really do believe that the terms of romantic relationships have to be renegotiated when a partner brings this much change to them.  In stark terms, this is not the relationship that you had signed up for, and you both need to examine whether the new relationship is what you both want.  That's still really hard.  People say things to each other like ""always, forever"" and such, but those things are conditional based on what the expectations are.  It's worth trying to stay together, but it's also worth taking a good hard look and deciding if staying together just means you both are going to be unhappy going forward, and if so calling it off may be the best option.  There's a lot of leverage for cheap shots.  There's not much you can do to prevent them, or to keep them from hurting.  But you can make the effort to be honest, to be genuine, to be open to how things have to change to make things functional, and how to sever ties if functional just can't happen.  It starts with telling your partner the truth.  Good luck."
mypartneristrans,3bq4ju,bookwormxx,3,Wed Jul 1 14:30:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for this.  As I said to the other response:   Hey, thanks. We do talk, and he knows I am struggling.

It really is just the sex. My hope is when she discovers her mojo everything will fall into place. But it has been a year...   And I want to stress, we do talk.  We're both waiting for the mojo to return - and we discuss how we can make this happen together.  Her hope is an increase in hormones might do the trick, but you can imagine how, in my weaker moments, this seems like the opposite of what is needed; still I am willing to wait and see for a while longer.    I am not sure what you mean by 'cheap shots'.  Certainly I am bitter at the situation, but I would never make that bitterness personal.  If things don't work out we will remember our origins.  I might be struggling, but I don't love her any less."
mypartneristrans,3bn0ne,RyannAllenTG,5,Tue Jun 30 15:10:19 2015 UTC,"My partner and I were together for three years and married for six weeks when he came out to me. To say it was a shock is a huge understatement! At the time, neither of us knew very much about the transgender community and what resources were available, so I felt very alone and scared. We were in a long-distance relationship at the time, so that made it even worse. There just isn't much for transgender partners out there, and it can feel like you're (meaning the partner) being abandoned and left to fend for yourself.    Definitely recommend this sub to her. I've been here for over a year and it's been, by far, the most helpful resource for me. I also saw a therapist for some time, which was wonderful because I had a safe place to scream and cry and be angry without my partner feeling the brunt of it. My therapist could also gently explain to me the changes that were coming instead of me finding them myself on the internet. I found a transgender support group nearby and started attending, although to be honest it wasn't super helpful since it was more geared toward the transgender person and not their partner. Maybe you could find a partner support group for her? My partner also told me that I could tell a few of my friends, which was immensely helpful because I definitely needed someone to talk to!    Something I would have liked from my partner would have been support. He found a transgender support community right away and got involved with them, but didn't make an effort to find anything for me. I asked him to ask his group for recommendations on partner support and he never did, which felt like a slap in the face because I was trying my best to find information for him. I felt very alone, especially since I struggled big-time to accept his gender identity. He would say insensitive things out of fear and frustration, which didn't help at all. He wanted to be someone I could talk to about all my concerns, but would then freak out when I tried to talk to him. Our relationship was an absolute mess for a long time -- a year later, we're only now starting to work together as a couple instead of each of us doing our own thing. Whatever you do, please don't leave her to fend for herself -- but at the same time, don't push her to immediately be accepting. I felt very much like I had to be accepting immediately or my partner would leave, which added a ridiculous amount of pressure to an already stressful situation.    Please feel free to ask me any other questions you have! I promise to be honest. :) Good luck!"
mypartneristrans,3bn0ne,RainbowPinata,3,Tue Jun 30 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"I love this response. It's awesome to get a response from someone else who was LDR. My SO and I have been LDR for our entire relationship 5+ years, and have known each other for around 10 years (we met playing video games online). Even though we've lived in separate states our entire lives, we visit frequently and are each others best friend. We Skype for any free time we have so around 6+ hours on weekdays and 10+ hours on weekends. I haven't come out to her yet because I haven't seen her since I made the decision, but I see her tomorrow night. Our LDR time ends soon too.  Enough rambling. I will be sure not to alienate her. That seems like one of the worst things I could do to her. I don't think I would intentionally leave her fend for herself, but I can definitely see me getting caught up in this and accidentally forgetting to include her. I won't start transitioning/finding groups till we are living together. I also think taking her to therapy sessions (if needed) with me is a great idea. I'm not sure how many partner support groups actually exist, but I will be sure to seek out any if possible. I do plan to go to support groups for me and I definitely want to take her with me. She is my best friend, and I will double and triple check that I am not leaving her alone in this. Thank you so much for pointing that out."

It's like these weird dual forces pulling on me that I haven't quite figured out how to negotiate.

You seem to feel that there is potential for this to be a positive conversation, so I would suggest that you attempt to set the tone of the conversation as positive right off the bat. Be upfront about the questions you have answers for and those that you might still be exploring. Let her know your expectations - are you telling her because you are going to ask her to be your partner through this or are you going to need to walk this road alone? Contemplate in advance if you are open to her setting boundaries. If her reaction is not quite as positive as you are hoping, please allow her to express and feel all the emotions as they come. Even if she is supporting and accepting, she may still be hit with a tidal wave of emotions that may or may not make sense to her. Try to be as open and honest about what you are feeling, and how you have explored and questioned your gender. Just communicate as well as you can. Be gentle. Be loving. Good luck to you :)"

I'd just suggest to be really open to answering her questions, no matter what they are. That's the thing that my SO did that helped the most. Anything I wanted to know she answered as best she could, and I asked a lot of questions. She was patient with me when I cried the first few nights after she came out and understood that the crying was just from having so many emotions, not because I was upset at her in any way.   The only thing she did that I really wished she didn't was to repeatedly tell me I didn't have to stay with her after I told her that being MtF didn't bother me at all. She just kept saying that I ""didn't sign up for this"" and things like that. She felt guilty and that I deserved better, but I love her so much and have never felt that way.

mypartneristrans,3bmqkq,baronsmom,2,Tue Jun 30 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"A series of small dinners instead of a reception/party?    My opinion:  if you're going to have a few people, have lots of people (20+), and an easy way to escape.  With a crowd, nobody notices when you leave for a while, and it's easy to pop in for 10-20 mins then go out/to the bathroom/to a back room/etc. to breathe and recover.  This is also how therapists recommend getting over it more generally (exposure therapy), and I've found it to be a plausible approach."
mypartneristrans,3bmqkq,tgjer,6,Tue Jun 30 19:12:58 2015 UTC,This is both you and your fianc√©'s day. Not your families day. If niether of you are going to enjoy it with family around then dont do it. Spend your day in love and happy not stressed. You want to enjoy your first day of marriage.  Also if her family cannot respect her enough to use the right name and pronouns with her there or out of the room they dont deserve to be around her on her special day

mypartneristrans,3bksuj,not_in_kansas_Nymore,8,Tue Jun 30 02:37:48 2015 UTC,"Gosh he's cute. You're a gorgeous couple.   I'm in my first relationship with a trans guy and I really like them... We've been dating for 3 months. Any advice? They're thinking of starting T soon and I'm excited, intrigued and a little anxious about it and how it may change our sex and relationship."
mypartneristrans,3bksuj,markoyolo,10,Tue Jun 30 01:47:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) He is very cute.  First of all, I would read this poem. Even if you're already having sex. Everyone who is with a trans partner should read this poem.  I got with my boyfriend when he was already 5-ish months on T. I knew him when he was still presenting feminine, but never considered him an option because he was just so closed off. He radiated misery. When he got on T, he became so much happier and more confident. He actually let me get to know him, and I got feelings for him like immediately, haha.   I hope the same is true for your SO--that they became happier in their own skin. It really does shine out of their face. It's lovely to see.  My main piece of advice will be to just always support them. They might second guess themselves; my BF did. They might miss their ""old self."" They might not like some aspects of being on T, and they might be misgendered a lot in the beginning which is always hard. Just remember that they are becoming wholly themselves. Hold their hand, let them vent or cry, whatever.   They're a person going through a change, that's all, and it's a change for the better. If you work together, if you communicate, if you respect each other, if you want to be with each other, there is no reason it won't work out. T is a hormone. Your relationship is so much more.  Hope this helps. PM me if you want more specific advice. Good luck!"

mypartneristrans,3bih3z,omgitsjackattack,2,Mon Jun 29 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"One thing I really struggle with is letting my partner know that I need help. I get in this ""support mode"" where I feel like I have to take care of everything -- cooking, cleaning, bill-paying, grocery shopping -- so that he doesn't have to deal with it. He's active-duty military, which is stressful enough especially since being transgender gets you kicked out, so I feel like I should shoulder everything I can to make his life easier. Except I work, too -- three part-time jobs, actually -- and I don't always have time to clean the house or make sure we have something nutritious on the table at night. So I stress out even more and end up exhausting myself, which in turn makes me unable to be a good support for him because I'm so tired that every little thing makes me cry or snap at him in irritation. I have finally reached the point where I can ask him to help me with household chores (although I still feel horribly guilty about it -- I'm a work in progress). Can your partner help you by taking some of the mundane, day-to-day chores off your hands? Sometimes that helps improve my overall mood, which in turn makes me more likely to be supportive and loving towards my partner instead of irritable.    As far as self-care goes, I've figured out a way to give myself a moment of Zen during the day. I work retail, and pulling an eight-hour shift while being relentlessly cheerful and helpful is very draining! During my lunch or dinner break, though, I make a point to walk outside and sit in the sun while I eat. Sometimes a coworker is with me, sometimes I'm alone. I find that taking a break and recharging my batteries outside really feels like a treat to me.    I have been so stressed out trying to care for my partner that, like you, I've forgotten what it is that I like to do, so I've been slowly trying to figure that out again. I would recommend a therapist, like people here have suggested, and a support system. To be honest, Reddit is my support system since I can't ""out"" my partner to anyone around here. I've found it's kind-of nice to have friends who don't know about my partner being trans -- it's nice to have something else to talk about for once!    I wish you the best of luck, my dear! I'm here via PM if you ever need support. We're all in this together!"
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,RainbowPinata,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling, it's probably what's burning me out so badly. And I certainly know how hard it is to ask for help from my spouse- even before the transition and dysphoria got to this point her job was still incredibly stressful, so I took it upon myself to have everything taken care of. And the guilt is real, asking for even little things has its way of making me feel terrible. On Sunday however my lovely wife did do the mountains of laundry and piles of dishes in the sink that had accumulated during my several-day stretch of long shifts, so she does do what she can to help.   That sounds lovely, and I definitely relate to having to play cheerful and helpful for long stretches of time. I wish I had the luxury of lunch breaks, thanks to there being no federal law on lunch breaks I'm not allowed to take one (I can still bring food and eat it, but I have to be available to customers), and often work entire shifts alone. I do, however, walk the fifteen minutes between work and my apartment, and that has a way of calming me, when I'm not busy freaking myself out about one thing or another.  Thanks so much for your reply, the PM offer extends to you, too. I imagine everything is much harder when you're forced to be so secretive about everything."
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,FawkesOrion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:03:12 2015 UTC,I'm about to get off my bus so I'll keep this short.   Talk to her about your needs.   Find a support system  Consider professional help.
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,FawkesOrion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:50:00 2015 UTC,"I'm never quite sure how to go about getting a support system. I haven't really made any friends since we moved across the country for her career a little over a year ago, I struggle with meeting people, I also don't want to drive away someone I don't know well with my problems. I guess I just don't find it fair to start a friendship immediately needing something from it? Honestly I don't know where to start, how have you found your support system?"
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,FawkesOrion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:08:39 2015 UTC,All over the place. I have a lot of family in town which helps. I was in school when I moved so I made some friends there. I also have a couple people at work I trust enough that I can talk to them if I need to.   The easiest place to meet knew people is probably work. If there's a person our two there you think you could trust suggest going out for coffee or drinks or something sometime and actually get to know them. You don't have to spring the heavy stuff on them right away but you'll have them if you need them.   Also if you have people back home keep in touch. I definitely have friends I don't talk to regularly for whatever reason but we do contact each other if we need to vent.   You should also look into what queer services and organizations are in your town. There may be a group or drop in space or workshops that could help you out.
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,FawkesOrion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:10:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about work yet, the problem with it being that it's very small (I'm one of five employees), so one person's business becomes everyone's business- but I do have a coworker that I get along with well, maybe in a non-work setting it might be less risk to open up. I also do stay in touch with family and friends back home, it's just hard to get the support I need with them being so far away.   I'm in the process of looking for LGBT centers, which are unfortunately sparse in this area, it'd be quite the commute to get to any of them, but if there's a program that suits my needs I'd be willing to go to it. Sadly, support for spouses/SOs of trans people is severely lacking at these places, but this forum has been very helpful. Thanks for your replies."
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,Awn-Uzumaki,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:46:08 2015 UTC,I don't even live in a small city and support for trans people is limited and partners or family of transpeople is basically non-exsistant. It's something my partner struggles with sometimes.   Universities and colleges can be a good place to look for queer resources. They probably won't have a group for you but will have a good idea where to send you to find a group and further resources.
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,askaboutmyboyfriend,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:14:22 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought to check colleges, that's a good suggestion. There's a college town not far off. I suppose I hadn't thought that non-students could go there.  Sorry for the lack of support in your area, it's definitely hard to deal with."
mypartneristrans,3bih3z,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:19:25 2015 UTC,It may depend on the college but it'd be worth googling them and giving them a call.   I know my university pride centre encouraged non-student participation because they wanted to really be part of the community.

mypartneristrans,3bilgz,yumcarrotcakes,8,Mon Jun 29 15:02:17 2015 UTC,"...my spouse came out to me 16 years ago early in our marriage. I told him I could not do it (him transitioning to full time woman) ...[16 years later]...I think this is way more than a fetish...   Well, yeah.  She came out 16 years ago and repressed it for the sake of what you could tolerate, for your marriage.  And now that denial seems entirely to much for her to bear.  It never goes away. It's who she is, if she's trans. So...the only thing you can do is have an honest conversation about just what is going on here.  But it seems like she is finally breaking.  You need to talk with her."
mypartneristrans,3bilgz,SleepNowMyThrowaway,3,Mon Jun 29 15:42:50 2015 UTC,Communication is key.  Try to be as supportive as you can but make sure your needs are recognized to. People are the way they are and denying their desires and needs that can be a very painful thing.  As weird as it is I find it really helpful with my partner to discuss and plan our bedroom fun; otherwise it is often too easy for needs to be left wanting.  Rather than focus on what the other person wants and does think long and hard about what you need in a relationship.  Make sure you both work together to take care of that!  If you can make sure that is not in question I think it'll be a ton easier to try and enjoy when your taking care of your partner's desires.
mypartneristrans,3bilgz,fatalexe,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Does your partner see a therapist? It might be a good step for him to start figuring out whether he wants to pursue transition. In the meantime, sit down with him and really talk about what this means to both of you... does he want to pursue transition? Is this something he's wanted for a long time but felt he had to repress? How do you feel about that possibility? Etc.  I think you might be interested in reading Helen Boyd's book ""She's Not The Man I Married."" Boyd's husband is trans, and living mostly as female, but (at least at the time of writing the book) was not planning to transition with hormones or surgery. She has a lot of interesting thoughts on navigating sex and gender roles in a trans marriage."

mypartneristrans,3bd2ej,meyereli12,3,Sun Jun 28 01:55:54 2015 UTC,"Hey there -- it sounds like you and I are in the same boat, except my partner is still pre-everything. I was actually married to a man before I came out and met my current partner, and the thought of having to be in a relationship with a man again makes me want to scream. I worry about my identity and how I can still identify as lesbian when my partner begins his transition. I worry about what sex is going to be like (our bedroom has been dead for a year and a half due to his dysphoria). I worry about what he's going to look like and if I'll still be attracted to him. I worry about accidentally calling him by his ""boy"" name in front of his fellow soldiers and outing him, which would get him kicked out of the military. In short, I worry about pretty much everything! It's exhausting and scary.    One thing my therapist has been trying to get me to focus on being present; in other words, not letting my brain run away with me. When I start thinking too much into the future I get really panicky and frantic, and I start to pick fights with my partner because I want him to be as miserable as I am. I find that I am happiest when I concentrate on one day at a time, and when I allow my partner to love me without pushing him away because I'm stuck in my anger-cave. I definitely recommend a therapist, either for you or for the two of you -- we've only been to two sessions so far with our marriage counselor, but she has helped us so much already. For me, even knowing that we're trying to solve our relationship issues makes my life so much easier. The issues are still there, but I know that I don't have to tackle them on my own.    What has helped me the most, honestly, is this subreddit and -- like /u/SleepNowMyThrowaway said -- time. We're all here for you! Feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk more privately."

You cannot force yourself to be something you're not, nor can you edit your sexuality to suit your new relationship's reality.  All you can do is just give it time, be honest with each other, and see how you adapt and feel down the road.  There's no hurry for any decisions, take time to really grasp what you're comfortable with."

I hope that the wide acceptance of this throughout my friend community will promote acceptance and respect, and that this can extend beyond the people I know.   My partner and I had a huge discussion on this, and although we are both beyond happy about it we still know so much more progress is to be made. I hope this can be a stepping stone for that.

mypartneristrans,3b3024,RainbowPinata,4,Thu Jun 25 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"This must be so difficult for both of you. I think every feeling that you described is understandable and you shouldn't feel guilty for having any of them. Including the jealousy. You have every right to mourn Jess and the fact that you had some jealousy associated with her does not change that. Your ability to articulate, own and be aware of your jealousy puts it more in line with envy to me, which typically has a less negative spin to it.    You are already battling with the difficulties of your relationship and your partner's trans identity. To add this blow is something that must feel so unfair. And it is. You're right. It sucks to have to be so prone to danger, suicide, rejection, mockery, loneliness, isolation...    When my wife and I were in college, her best friend committed suicide. In the months and years leading up to this event, he had fallen into heavy drug use and began associating with a very unsavory crowd. My wife was forced to limit contact with him because of this, even going so far as to not welcome him in our home. He would come unannounced with people who were not welcome in our home with our young daughters. The night he committed suicide, he reached out to my wife, but they did not connect. It was a sad time. In spite of the suddenness, the sadness and all the emotions surrounding the experience, I was really proud of how my wife dealt with her friend's death. As you mentioned, she didn't talk a ton about how she felt and I knew that this was a very important person in her life - I feared for what her reaction might be or what type of impact this would have on her life. Even 14 years later, there is still sadness - but there is also a lot of positive reflecting and out of the blue reminders and associations with our departed friend.    I hope you two heal well, and I'm glad you got into therapy before this happened. So, so sorry for your loss."

I like saying ""envy"" rather than ""jealousy"" -- that's exactly it. She was everything to my partner that I wanted to be, and she succeeded where I fell short. All I ever really wanted was to be the person my partner came to when he was upset or needing support, but at the same time I wasn't mentally ready to be that person. In some ways, I am still not ready.    I wish there was something we could do to fix all of this. It burns me up that I can't just come up with a solution and implement it; instead, everything just has to suck for a while. I have a feeling that things will continue to suck for quite some time.

I'm sure it's been posted all over Reddit and mentioned in various communities. I'm posting the article here because to me it means there's hope, and many of us live for that.   Third: Hugs again.

mypartneristrans,3az3ia,TallPinkBird,3,Wed Jun 24 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"Suicide and violence are devastating realities of the trans community. They are serious issues that should not be taken lightly. In the support group that my wife and I attend, they are adamant that trans woman not go out alone. I think this is a foreign concept to many MtFs that are not used to be advised to seek safety in numbers the way we cis women are often encouraged to. I definitely notice that when we are in public and my partner is visibly trans, I assume a more vigilant role in assessing the situation, being aware of exits and having more awareness of those around us. I think practicing common sense safety practices will go a long way in protecting you and your partner.    That being said, I do think that focusing on the danger and violence to this extent is only going to serve to stress you out. There is no way for you (or anyone) to protect your partner full time. The suicide statistics are another thing. The trans community is currently suffering from the recent loss of a very active and positive member. It is so hard to read over and over again about the suicidal thoughts and ideation that our trans loved ones suffer from. It is real and it's a problem in the community. I don't think there is much beyond being a good partner that you can do to protect her. Encourage openness and sharing, encourage her to see a therapist, support her and provide reassurance when she's struggling. Not so obvious is to also take care of you. You need to attend to your own needs, your own mental health and your own feelings. A healthy partner is going to make a better partner - and then you'll be able to help prop her up when/if she gets down low.    Last, I don't in any way want to minimize risks or the reality of the danger, but I do believe that these things are much scarier in our heads. The fears, when allowed to roam free in your imagination can really build into something out of proportion with reality. I encourage you to talk them out (as you've done here) with your partner or a friend or a therapist. I find that when I get all these thoughts out of my head and vocalized into words, they lose a lot of their power."

You bring up a good point about cis women being encouraged to seek safety in numbers. That's something that seems to be ingrained in us from a young age. My girlfriend, growing up with male privilege and such, was never really taught that. I never even really thought about that aspect of it. I do find that I'm more vigilant with regards to safety when I'm out with her.  We share everything, communication is absolutely amazing in our relationship. I think that when she gets closer to starting her transition, I may encourage her to see a therapist. The town we'll be moving to has an informed consent clinic, and her school insurance covers HRT, so I feel like this will be soon.  I try my best to take care of my mental health. I've had a lot of stress in life recently, so that's been taking its toll, but she's been so supportive of me too, so I'm glad we can be there for each other.   And you're right. Getting these thoughts out of my head has already helped me feel significantly better. I feel like I kind of panicked there for a bit; all these thoughts and feelings just surged to the top of my mind, so I'm glad I was able to get them out here.   Thank you, again."
mypartneristrans,3az3ia,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"We share everything, communication is absolutely amazing in our relationship.     This is awesome. I think that just the fact of having a loving supportive partner (or friend, parent, sibling, etc...) can go a really long way for someone that is transitioning. Sounds like you are ready to be one of the people that will provide that to your partner, so she's one step ahead of the game! I admire the strength of those that can push on, alone, with no support - but I have to imagine it is a lot more difficult that way.    One thing I want to do as we come out to those around us is to try to educate them. I feel like the more people are educated and understand the trans community, the less likely they are to fear/loathe the idea of trans people and instead become more welcoming and accepting. I was so uneducated myself at the beginning of all of this; I'm happy at the opportunity to bring other people out of the dark, too.    You sound like a great partner and a nice person. I wish you and your partner all the best :)"
mypartneristrans,3az3ia,RainbowPinata,2,Wed Jun 24 20:18:36 2015 UTC,"The very same loss that you and /u/tulips_onthe_summit mentioned has also triggered fear in me. The kind soul we lost was a dear friend of my partner's, and I am out of my mind with grief and worry for him. My partner has told me before that he wouldn't take his own life, but I know how low I felt at certain points during the months following his coming out to me. I can only imagine those feelings are multiplied tenfold for him.    I fear for his safety, too, although since he's FtM he may find that he feels more secure since people will look at him and think ""man"" instead of ""woman."" I told him, though, that the first time I have to send him into a men's room, he gets five minutes before I come barging in screaming his name. I'm so, so afraid for him, and my mind sometimes runs rampant with scenarios that I know in reality will probably never happen. It's hard to turn off that little voice.    I don't really know what to do about all this except to tell you that you're not alone. I try to stay in the present and not let my brain run away with me -- my partner isn't even in therapy yet, much less on hormones -- but it's easier said than done."

As you know, my relationship has endured about a year of limbo, during which I vacillated wildly between, ""I can't do this!"" and ""I can do anything!"" My waves come a lot more often than yours do, and anything and everything can change a good wave into a bad wave. Sometimes things that were fine yesterday are suddenly not fine today, and I have no idea why. I hate it, but my former therapist encouraged me to let myself feel everything without judging myself or telling myself that I am wrong for feeling this way -- so I try to love him the best that I can and avoid saying or doing anything too hurtful on the down days.

mypartneristrans,3av6va,supercorgi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. While we don't plan on having biological children, I understand the ""clock is ticking"" feeling. I'm not ready for a kid just yet, and I feel like I need a year or two of this whole transition process to smooth over. My wife still isn't totally ""out"" to her mom, her mom knows she wants to transition, but not that she started HRT. So my wife still presents male around her mom. And yet she's going to court this Friday to legally change her name, and her mom has no clue. Doesn't even know she uses a female name. So I don't even want to think about bringing a child into all of this yet.  But if we're going to adopt, I feel like we need to start the process soon because I know the process can take years. But I certainly can't start the process when I'm not feeling ready at all. But at the same time, I have no idea how we'll get the money needed to adopt either. And fostering scares me because I know there's always the risk of the bio mom getting her child back, which I know is preferred. But I have a hard enough time thinking about having to give up one of my cats, let alone a child I've been caring for as my own! But what other option do I have? Using a sperm donor? But I don't want to carry and if I was going to go that route, I would want it be my spouse's, but like your partner, I'm sure she's already infertile since she's been on HRT since October. So even a surrogate is not an option.   Unfortunately I never had the option of discussing these issues with her because she started HRT after we separated. I know she feels guilty about it, but what's done is done and there's nothing we can do. I just have to accept it, but it's hard sometimes because those options were always there before and now they're not.  But I feel like this is all part of the ""coming out"" and transition. Most of us who were with our partners before they came out all had an idea/semi-plan of how our future would be, but then that was completely changed after our partners came out.  Sorry I don't have any advice, all I can do is commiserate with you. hugs"

mypartneristrans,3at4l3,SphirosOKelli,4,Tue Jun 23 08:19:27 2015 UTC,"I've been with my spouse for nearly 20 years and for most of them knew that she did not fully identify with her assigned gender. For a long time, I didn't really understand what that meant or what that might mean for our future, but over time we both learned a lot, went through several different stages of questioning and exploration and finally last December I realized that she had made the decision to transition. Two months later, she began HRT.    From December until March, I had a really rough time. A really rough time. We spent a lot of time trying to talk things out, communicate, set expectations, etc...We were successful with some, but often dissolved into arguing, crying or just shutting each other out at times.    One declaration I can make is that I fully support her transition. Just because I supported it, doesn't mean I could deal well with the emotions that went along with it. I tried. I tried. I tried. It felt out of control.    The weekend that my wife began HRT was quite the experience. We blocked our calendar for the whole weekend and made no plans to leave the house. She took her first pills. We wept. We talked. We cuddled. We wept. We talked. We cuddled. and so on. She kept taking the pills...    When I reached my breaking point, I called for a referral to a therapist (who had experience with couples in transition). Reaching out to her was a game changer for me. I could sleep again, I could eat again, I could get work done again. Communication with my wife improved. Life improved.    It doesn't sound like your partner is using very effective communication with you. She's also lashing out and putting you down. This is not the way partners should treat each other, but I would hesitate to label these her 'true colors'. Transition is a big deal. Others have already stated it, but: the isolation, the loss of control, morning the loss of your partner's assigned gender - these things are emotional upheavals. They are painful, they are disorienting and they are tough to work through. Even if you are accepting and supportive.    I think I am a much better wife than I was in Dec, Jan, Feb. I've got the emotional upheaval under control and my wife is moving forward with her transition. Life is pretty good, we are communicating well and we feel confident about our relationship as she moves through her transition.    That being said, I still have my days. My emotional state is heightened (my wife thinks I kiss the estrogen off her lips ;] ), I suffer from anxiety where I didn't before and I'm still working through a lot of what this means for my life.    All relationships go through changes - big and small. This one is pretty monumental. Open communication, some empathy and education on everybody's part helps. Therapy has been such a big help for me. If you are going to go through transition together, it is not just your transition, as my partner says it's ""our"" transition. If you want to remain a couple, be a team and tackle this transition together. Best of luck to you!"

Because even on the worst days, like today, when it's all said and done I love her a lot, and I just want to be her little transguy..."
mypartneristrans,3at4l3,PANDADA,3,Wed Jun 24 07:12:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely set some boundaries and enforce them. You might be transitioning, and that will absolutely cause some stress, but letting yourself be her verbal punching bag isn't going to help anything at all. It might even make things worse because the focus is on the little day-to-day irritations, not the actual issues causing the upset. Regardless, it's not something you deserve, and it's not something that's really ""your fault"". You are who you are.  That said, there's a lot that goes on with being the partner of a trans person who is transitioning, and they are legitimate concerns. Unless your partner is absolutely amazing about dealing with major upheavals in her life, there's no ""might"" about this being stressful. It's not easy, and there's a huge sense of isolation, loss of control,  and sometimes even a loss of identity that comes with a partner transitioning.  For the isolation, does your partner have anyone, a family member, friend, online space, or a therapist she can talk to about this? It needs to be someone who is primarily concerned with her well-being. But having an outlet, that's not you, to talk about these things can be helpful, if she doesn't have that already.  The loss of control is probably the hardest to reconcile. Your transitioning is happening. It sounds like you're more than ready for it to start, but she's definitely not there with you yet. Are you willing/able to set down what steps you're looking to take, and then give her some extra time (a few months at least) to adjust to that reality? It's completely understandable if your transition is urgent and you need to start ASAP, but if that's the case, you're very likely leaving your partner far behind to wonder where she fits into this.  When my partner decided to transition, it was less than a month between her telling me she wanted to transition for sure and her doctor being willing to prescribe her HRT. I'd known for years that she was somewhere on the MTF spectrum, but the timing was still way. too. fast. for me. When we talked about it, and a lot of my underlying concerns that came with her transitioning, we agreed on a date about 3 months out. At the very least, that would give me time to at least see how it was being a lesbian couple in public, have us both come out to my mother, and at least try to have a child (since basically her transitioning would mean giving up on that).  In retrospect, it was still probably too fast from my perspective, but even that delay helped. At the very least, it showed that my partner valued me enough to adjust her transition to include my needs into it.  I know, as a partner, there's a complicated balance to be struck between respecting our partner's privacy and being open about who we are as people. I'm kind of being forced out of the closet, but as an accessory to my partner, not on my own terms. It's incredibly uncomfortable. I imagine the feeling is worse for people who have to go back into the closet when their partners transition, especially if that identity isn't really one that fits them. Does your partner feel like she's going to have to shift from being a ""lesbian"" to another label just to fit your identity as you transition? Does she feel like she's going to be forced back into the closet after your transition? Are you hoping to be full-stealth one day? If so, that's going to be a lot of her identity to give up.   So it's important to set boundaries about how you need to be treated as part of this relationship if it's going to continue, but hopefully recognize there are some legitimate things for her to be troubled or upset about. I hope at least this will let you both deconstruct what the core problem is whether it's some of the concerns above, something different, or even it's the whole transition thing she's not okay with."

I always thought of myself as straight, maybe a little bi-curious, but never pictured myself marrying or starting a life with another woman... Which he knows that's how I've felt.  As my significant other has been helping me understand what they are going through and feeling, they have been introducing the femme apparel slowly but surely. I guess to help ease me into it? Whether it be woman's underwear, yoga pants, or one of my tops, I've been...wading into the water, per say. And at first it was rocky territory, full of many emotions, but I've definitely gotten more comfortable with it. I've gotten more comfortable with it, because I've figured out that they will be the same person, regardless of gender. They still cuddle me, kiss and hug me, and treat me just the same as they always have. Making this connection has helped me IMMENSELY. It's gotten me thinking that maybe they don't need to be a cis male to fit my pre-imagined world for myself and my future. It's because it's THEM, that I'm warming up to the idea of dating/potentially maybe even marrying someone that identifies as woman.  I don't know if I helped with your question since I haven't exactly gone through the process, but I hope I helped  with maybe the ""pre-transition"" phase."

I personally made no promises to my partner, but it was understood that we wanted to stay together if we could. However, no one can foresee how they will think or feel by the end of a transition. I had to be completely honest, as much as it hurt me to tell my partner, that I didn't know if I would stay with her.  At this point, it's easy for me to say that we've made arrangements to have children, get married eventually, and it's worked out well. There were a lot of hard conversations and the only way through was to be completely honest, even if that honesty was ""I don't know how I feel."""

When she came out to me nearly 2 years ago, I was heartbroken. I thought that there was zero chance of the two of us staying together, that there was no way that I, as a straight woman, could be in a relationship with another woman, no matter how much I supported her. I told myself that I might as well start planning my life without her in it and be prepared for the inevitable divorce that was going to happen. I hoped that this was just a dream that I was going to wake up from and everything would still be as it was, a wife and husband relationship.  Then I realized that the only thing that was preventing me from being happy and still being in the same relationship that I had been in, was me. There are a variety of sexual orientation shades and I just created one for myself. I am straight and I am not sure that I could be with a woman other than my wife. So I see myself as a straight woman in a relationship with her best friend. I am not bi-sexual, I am not gay/lesbian, I am in love. I am a shade of sexual desire all my own.   I am not sure if that will help your wife but it did me. If she is open to you becoming who you want to be and especially if she is still being physical with you as you do transition, there is a part of her that believes she can make it through with you, in a relationship. If she didn't, she wouldn't be so physical, at least thats the way I see it. Sexual attraction can change over years and the person you are on the inside is who she loves, not the exterior (thats not love, thats desire and can be achieved over time, in my opinion). Your heart is what she is attracted to. I think that if she can get her head around the idea of looking like a woman in a relationship with another woman to the public eye, she will be much more happy and will realize that it is totally worth the change. It doesn't mean she is any label of sexual orientation, it just means she's in love. I hope that helps. If you have any questions or if you want to just talk, feel free to message me!"

If she didn't, she wouldn't be so physical,   I'm not sure I agree with this.  Many couples continue a physical relationship (both sex and affection) even when they are 100% sure their relationship is not going to make it and sometimes even after the relationship has ended.  I'm sure in some cases it's because they still think there's a chance for the relationship to survive or be rekindled, but there are a lot of other factors that could go into it.  Also, I think that some women with MtF spouses ramp up the affection as a way to (whether consciously or not) hold on to their 'man' for as long as possible.  I'm not trying to discourage the OP or say there is no chance, but I think it gets very complicated when trying to sort out the intertwining of sex and emotions, and one does not necessarily define the other.  OP, in your case, I think you should let your wife know how you feel.  Definitely try for it if it's what you want.  I wish my spouse would fight a little harder to keep me.  In fact, I think the fact that she's not fighting to keep me is contributing to the demise of our marriage.  And if your wife doesn't know how you feel, she may just continue on with the current plan, thinking that it's what you think is best, too."

mypartneristrans,3aom29,jenlb714,4,Mon Jun 22 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of people take a ""wait and see"" approach.  That's kind of where my spouse and I are.  She came out to me a year ago and has been on HRT since January.  I'm straight and attracted to very masculine men, which is how my spouse presented for the first 10 years of our relationship, but I love my spouse very much, so I didn't want to just walk away without sorting through my feelings first and seeing how things went as her transition progressed.  We are in counseling together but are currently what I call quasi-separated, meaning that we are living in separate bedrooms but still operating as a married couple otherwise, including willingly spending time together.  We're kind of in a weird place right now.  Neither one of us is ready to completely let go yet, but we also feel like we're holding each other back and that neither of us can fulfill the other's needs (sex has been an issue, not because of attraction issues but because HRT has killed my spouse's libido).  However, I'd think there'd be a lot better chance of my marriage surviving if my spouse would make me feel like she wanted to fight for it.  She says she doesn't think she has a right to do that because I'm straight.  I'm not sure if that's the truth or a cop out.   So...maybe your wife would be willing to go to counseling with you and hold off on any final decisions?  It sounds like you guys are still into each other romantically and sexually, so why rush the decision now?  In my case, I am pretty certain that my spouse and I will end up separating, but even so, I'm glad that I gave myself time and gave it my all before coming to that conclusion, because there ARE people who start out thinking their marriage will not survive a transition but then it does.

I love my spouse; she is also my best friend.  The first few weeks were rocky.  I wasn't willing to give up and walk away, though, without trying to understand my spouse's needs/feelings/thoughts.  Our relationship (including our marriage) is very important to both of us so we are trying.  We are both making compromises and working through to find a way to stay together because we both want to do so.  Dressing, shopping, girls nights, these all helped me get use to the idea and the outward appearance of my true spouse.  My wife was very understanding of my time frame and would let me set the pace for the most part.  We are 8 months in and ~2 months in to HRT and I think we are doing very well as a couple.  I think bottom line is your spouse has to be willing to try and you have to be willing to help.  I told my wife I would try and we would take it a day at a time.  She was supportive and helpful.  Information sharing helped me a lot as well.   I hope this helps."
mypartneristrans,3aom29,myaelaine,3,Tue Jun 23 00:36:11 2015 UTC,"It's just hard to tell, everyone has a different story and circumstances. Hell, many wives had zero inclination before their spouses came out, due to the over compensating of masculinity. My spouse on the other hand was always a cross dresser. So I was used to seeing her feminine side...until she stopped sharing it with me and I just got used to only being with ""him"". But even when she cross dressed, she never asked me to use female pronouns or her female name. So I guess even then I never really saw her as anything but a guy. And because of that, when she came out to me, I freaked out. But, she also came out to me when we were having dead bedroom issues, she wouldn't talk to me about it, and even when I questioned if it was related to her wanting to transition after she came out to me, she denied it and said they were two separate issues (in the end, that wasn't true). So needless to say, everything was a total disaster and we came incredibly close to divorce, we had separated even for several months, even though by then I was coming around and wanted to stay. So I find it difficult to compare our situation to anyone else's. But I can say a year ago, I was in this sub posting that I didn't want to be with a woman and didn't want to watch my ""husband"" slowly disappear. So within a year, it's been a total whirlwind and a huge 180. If you really want to know, I could send you a link to my old post to show you how drastically things have changed.  BUT, I will also say, while I identified as straight before, the opportunity for my sexuality being more fluid was already there I think, since I always supported her cross dressing and I did have a couple crushes on girls in high school (but never again after that - I'm 31 now). I never really liked manly men either, never liked guys with muscular bodies. My wife is pretty slender and was pre-HRT too. So because of all these things, I think my sexuality was able to be a little more fluid. Not to say that I don't still struggle sometimes though. But for someone who is attracted to just masculinity and no previous attraction to femininity, it may be more difficult or even impossible. But yet, you see see partners who identified strongly as straight or gay before and still feel attraction post transition.   All I can say is that both of you should keep talking and be honest with each other. Even now there are times where I worry if my attraction will fade as the years go by. I also think that it helps that my wife doesn't want SRS and still enjoys PIV sex. If that were to suddenly change, I know I'd have a difficult time with it. Would it be a deal breaker? I want to believe it wouldn't be, but it would be incredibly hard for me."

I am also super straight vaginas gross me out always have. At first the thought of her getting surgery bothered and worried me, we now basically have a dead bedroom situation as we are both strait ( hormones have caused her to be attracted to men) and she really doesn't feel comfortable penetrating for obvious reasons.  However over the last few weeks I keep thinking how much I can't wait until she has a vagina, I look forward to it. To be able to get her off in a way that she enjoys I miss that I want so much to give her everything she deserves and if that means getting my hands (and face lol) dirty then I'm excited to do it for her. I couldn't do it for anyone else but for the love of my life? Her vagina will always be special and sexy to me!"

mypartneristrans,3ajrtt,takingonedayatatime,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:09:32 2015 UTC,"I'm in your situation too, so you're not alone. I worry that once my boyfriend transitions (if it happens, it's still up in the air cause he hasn't seen a therapist yet), I worry a lot that I won't be attracted to him anymore. I love his jawline and facial hair and muscles and boy clothes... But something I've been trying to teach myself is that while the chiseled jawline might not be the same later down the road, they'll still have a cute face that I can hold. While the facial hair may not be there, he's been shaving a lot more lately so it won't be a big shock to me later. The muscles might not be the same, but physical appearance is never the same 100% of the time...people let themselves go all the time, lol. And the boy clothes... He says that he will very likely wear the same type of clothes (band tees/denim vests/skater shoes) and he'll ""rock the stereotypical lesbian look"" (his words, not mine.. just in case someone is offended. If so, I apologize) Long story short, things change all the time, regardless of transitioning or not. It's up to you to how you react and adapt to them. And by the sound of it, you're already super supportive of them. Just a little worried and scared. which is absolutely understandable. My significant other told me about thinking about transitioning three months ago and I'm still asking questions and reading into things online. Staying informed and asking them questions does wonders. Good luck to you both <3"

It doesn't say anything negative about your love, or your character. It just means that the relationship can go no further, that it has a bittersweet ending.  I hope it helps."
mypartneristrans,3ajrtt,SphirosOKelli,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"eta* To answer your actual question - not being attracted to your partner when they are changing their physical body does NOT make you a terrible person. If you aren't into someone, you aren't into them. Plenty of people have fallen in love with someone's heart, but couldn't hack it because the chemistry just wasn't there.  Depending on how comfortable your partner is with herself at any given point in the transition - because a lot of us tend to overcompensate when trying to pass - your partner's basic behavior and personality shouldn't really change. Unless she has been working super hard to alter who she truly is - but after having known her for several years - and I'm just assuming it was years - you probably have had the chance to see who your partner is on a basic personality level.  I might be biased due to the fact that I hope my partner will stay through my own transition, but I don't think that it will be any more or less hurtful if you stay while your partner transitions to see if the physical changes are something you can handle on the attractiveness end. Especially if you make it clear that you intend to stay unless you find that you are just not attracted to her growing female form.  When I initially came out my partner was very upset - understandable - and felt like she couldn't handle a transition. I started binding and packing and it killed our sex life for her for a week or two because she couldn't get past the thought that I was changing. As she found herself more and more willing/able to accept the fact that I wanted to transition our sex life returned to normal -ish. We are still dealing with some things - part of which is on my end, frankly I'm a little bored, but she has found that even bound and packed she can still see me as her sexual partner in addition to her emotional partner.  I say all of that because you might find that there are times when you just don't feel attracted to your partner, especially as physical and even clothing options change, but there is still a good chance that as these things become regular and a feeling or normalcy returns your ability to connect with your partner may very well return.  Bottom line - if you think there is even a small chance that you could still love your partner I would stay for the ride. If nothing else, should you need to leave, you can do so knowing that you were there for her when she needed you. And for me, my partner's willingness to stick around while I do this, means the world to me."
mypartneristrans,3af026,tulips_onthe_summit,4,Fri Jun 19 16:18:27 2015 UTC,Glad you had a good experience!  My spouse sometimes calls places ahead of time to explain the situation and ask if they are trans friendly.

One lady was incredibly rude (I think she just blatantly laughed) but we also got ignored. I think maybe one person was cool about it. I like to get my glasses at Zenni Optical online. My partner needs to try everything on because of sizing and whatnot. Thank goodness we've been doing shoes via Zappos.

mypartneristrans,3afon9,deadpool101,8,Fri Jun 19 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"I Read about the case and although she may very well have been in fear of her life or of being raped, her prosecuting her attack to the point of 72 strikes and a slit throat indicate rage in place of, or in addition to fear.  Also in her defense it appears the deceased had made unwanted advances in the past as well.  I didn't drill down to find out where she's being held, but that shouldn't be difficult. If you did so, you could go visit (Ky?) or write a letter and have a written correspondence.   Life for her in prison must be hell on Earth, and just having someone to look forward to communicating with would make a difference for her, and give you a connection to someone that was once so important to you."

mypartneristrans,3afon9,jenlb714,0,Fri Jun 19 23:46:48 2015 UTC,"Well I would have to agree with SleepNowMyThrowaway. Find out if it is her by writing to her. There is also the option of checking the prison she is at for her arrest/incarceration details (usually includes a picture). Not sure if they do it in your area but I know back home in Michigan, you can view the criminals in prison. That way you can see the picture, if provided, and confirm it is her without writing her. However, I do think you should write her for her well-being. If she was depressed before, she will be depressed in her cell, maybe even worse because it depends on how far along with her transition she is and whether the prison allows her to be in the community she presents as. Some places don't care if you are trans or how far along you are, if your papers say you are a gender that you do not present as, you are going to the prison side that matches your paperwork. Stupid laws/regulations and bs!"

It's sort of going back into the closet to avoid hurting the people closest to you. In the long run, most people have to come back out again, as hiding who they are eventually takes a toll on mood, personality and happiness.   Once the transition starts, stability should come back. It sounds like your partner has a lot of concern for your well being but is torn between their needs and yours."

I have thought about this many, many times as my partner and I try to figure out this whole situation. I seem to be getting the raw end of the deal here. No matter what happens, he gets to be who he truly is and (hopefully) achieve more happiness and contentment as a result. I'm happy for him, honestly -- but I feel like I'm the one who has to sacrifice, over and over and over again. He's in the military, too, so it's like a double whammy.    As for your situation, I don't blame you one bit for losing trust in your partner. It must feel like every time you get your footing, the rug gets pulled out from under you again. I agree with /u/putmeinthezoo, though -- this sounds to me like a last-minute panic from your spouse, who is probably terrified. (That doesn't give them the right to play with your emotions, though.) Counseling sounds like a good step, and I hope it helps the two of you work out a solution together.    This is so hard, I know. I wish you strength and peace. hugs"
mypartneristrans,3acxkd,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Fri Jun 19 10:22:35 2015 UTC,"My wife's questioning period was long and difficult. There really was no pinnacle 'coming out' moment for us. I knew from very early in our relationship that she was a cross dresser and as the years went by cross dressing morphed into something more. For about the last 10 years, we have moved from questioning, to exploring, to repressing and back to exploring and finally, early this year, she began HRT. In that decade, our lives were not always dominated by trans issues, but they were always there. Sometimes very visible, sometimes very deep in the shadows. It was very difficult to understand where this was all going to lead. I've spent many years lurking on messages boards, contributing to some, but mostly just trying to find the answer to what happens to wives like me.    I did notice a small number of trans people on these forums who were very upfront that they would never transition, that they accepted being transgender, but transition wasn't in their future. Some made the decision due to their marriages, some due to careers, family, or many other reasons. For some, I watched as they reached their breaking point and changed course and realized that repressing the need to transition just wasn't possible. For others, I watched as they remained steadfast in their determination to not transition.    I totally understand your inability to trust at this moment. I don't think your spouse is being purposefully misleading or untrustworthy, I think they are filled to the brim with doubt, anxiety and uncertainty at their future. It is so difficult to go through this and I really feel for you.    I think it might be a good exercise for you to evaluate your feelings in the absence of 'what if'. You partner will never stop being transgender, it is who they are - regardless of whether or not they transition. This will be part of your life for the rest of your life if you stay in the marriage. You know that now, and you can evaluate if that is something you can be happy and move forward with."

I could see myself evaluating how I felt about those changes. But I feel like that was never and has never been an option. My spouse came out to me but just shows no drive into to actually transition. And they stopped going to therapy after just four sessions. They came to what felt like the very solid realization that they wanted to separate and THEN, and only then start to transition, while living on their own and ""discovering"" what they wanted out of life.   Now they have suddenly switched gears, afraid of losing me, and don't want to transition at all. I would prefer transition. I really would. I don't trust this sudden change of heart and I don't feel secure that this decision is coming from a place of self-realization and discovery... I don't know why there was a 180 but it seems based on fear.   I really need some stability in my life and I feel like I can only trust myself to provide that for my own life now, not my spouse. Living in this limbo state has made me live in a constant state of semi-depression and anxiety. And I feel like my spouse and now begging for me to stay in that state, because they are scared. I guess before I wanted to put my own needs aside for them and now I don't care. I just want to take care of myself."

mypartneristrans,3ac41x,saberaltersan,3,Thu Jun 18 22:07:33 2015 UTC,"So, if I'm understanding this correctly, your partner did not come out to you directly first, they came out quasi-publicly to friends on Facebook? That's really shitty.  It's sorta analogous to a father not telling the family about a big cross-country move until posting about it the day before on FB. Maybe your partner was taking the approach of just getting it out of the way and telling everyone, letting the chips fall where they may. Which, I suppose would be OK if they weren't in a relationship. But in a situation where you're sharing your life and intimate feelings with a person, the decent thing to do is let them in on it first.  The exception, of course, would be if they came out to a therapist or anonymously in an online community. For many people, being trans is shameful and coming out is scary/anxiety-inducing, so coming out in these contexts first can make coming out to a partner and then family much easier. But that's not really public in the same sense.  My advice is talk to your partner directly. Let them know that the way they came out really hurt, but listen and try to understand where they were coming from. Ask them where they see this relationship going, what transition will entail and the next steps they want to take. Let them know your feelings about the relationship. Then, give yourself some time to decide what steps to take next. Right now, you're kinda reeling from the shock and probably angry at the approach they took to coming out, but you need time to process your feelings and figure out what's the right move for you."

And he accident outed himself to his sister, which lead to the Facebook post in question. I've never been so angry and sad before at the same time. You're right it was devastating to me. But maybe he was worried I'd judge harshly? Nonetheless though I would rather the news in person.  I hope when he comes over this July since I'll have some time off we can talk this through because regardless I want to see if I can carry on the relationship without beginning to feel like some bigot because I end the relationship over this announcement :(  I feel at fault here because I'm questioning my love that I've had for him before the announcement...

mypartneristrans,3ac41x,saintartaud,2,Thu Jun 18 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying.  So this is a long distance relationship, he had already come out to a few friends and then accidentally outed himself to his sister, which then led to outing himself on FB, correct? That changes my understanding of the situation somewhat. Perhaps he originally did intend to come out in person but was waiting for the chance to do so. Maybe he came out to his friends because he needed the support and was afraid of your reaction, or felt it was better to wait. Either way, this is more complicated than insensitively telling the world before informing you.  I can't really say what he is thinking/feeling. The only way you're gonna know is by talking to him. July is two weeks away, that's enough time to process your feelings and figure some things out before having a serious conversation with him about where to go from here.  Do you meant that you were questioning your love before the announcement, or that knowing he's trans is making you question your love for him?"
mypartneristrans,3ac41x,saintartaud,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusion I didn't explain it properly, he lives in the same city as me. I've just been swamped with school and work, plus we don't live together. Sorry for the misunderstanding! I tried everything up at work and I didn't state we live in the same city my bad ;-;  I'm questioning my love post announcement because I'm not sure if he is going to go through hrt or not. We are going to talk all that over hopefully I just need to keep my head on right"
mypartneristrans,3ac41x,PANDADA,2,Fri Jun 19 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"No worries, sounds like there are a lot of pieces to the story.  Just remember that learning your partner is trans doesn't invalidate your previous feelings. It could change your feelings for him, and it will change you relationship, whether he goes on HRT or not.  Hope you and your partner are able to sort things out."
mypartneristrans,3ac41x,PANDADA,3,Fri Jun 19 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm so sorry to hear you found out that way! I hope you told him how much it hurt you. I would feel so disrespected. I was mad when I found out through Facebook that my best friend was moving across the country and he didn't tell me personally before posting that.   As for everything you're feeling, it's normal and okay. It's a lot to take in! Both of you really need to communicate and talk about your concerns. Even if you become okay with it, but your parents do not, is that a deal breaker for you? That is also something you need to think about. Many partners don't make a decision immediately and will sort of ""test the waters"" to see what happens. But you also need to talk to him about possible transition. It sounds like pronoun changes are wanted (and you're amazing for already hopping on board with that so quick!), but does he plan to transition with HRT? What about any surgeries? You will need to talk to him to find out what his plans are because not every transgender person follows the same path. Then you can think about it you're comfortable with those things. At the very least, I recommend not proposing for now until you're really sure what you want and what he wants and if it will mesh.   Also, don't get too caught up in your sexuality label. I referred to myself as straight before but I'm still attracted to and love my wife. The thing you have to ask yourself is if you can be okay possibly still having that attraction for your partner, but knowing others will identify you as gay or bi. There are partners here who still identity as straight, even though they're staying with their partner. So you have to determine if you can be okay being labeled one thing even if you don't identify with that label.  On the other hand, if you feel you're 100% straight and will no longer be attracted to him, then that is okay too and you have to do what's best for you. It's not your fault nor his. You didn't choose your sexuality, just like he didn't choose to be trans. It just is. And it can feel so unfair!   If you feel overwhelmed, therapy may help you work through your emotions. But you also need to be honest and open with him (and definitely tell him you expect it in return, and not through social media). If you want to take time to figure out what you want, do it. But also make sure you explain to him that it's very confusing for you and you need time to process everything, that you really don't know what you want right now. I'm fairly sure he's been thinking about this for quite some time, meanwhile you're just finding out, so he's had the time to process this, but you haven't. Many trans people forget that after coming out."
mypartneristrans,3ac41x,jenlb714,3,Thu Jun 18 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"I love him with all my heart and I know I'm straight. I support him all the way I really do but I'm still scared you know?  The only surgery he's confirmed is a breast reduction from what he told me. I'm scared because should he want to do the complete transformation I really don't think I could continue the relationship at all, that is what scares me the most. I've given him two years and I'd hate to end it because of something like hrt...  I think my mother would be kind of accepting of it. However my father not so much I just know he'll never approve of this. Or I may be wrong I'm unsure how my father stands on issues such as this.  He's promised not much will change in our relationship except the pronouns, but I'm iffy on that maybe I'm being too quick to jump ship here?  Thank you for your insight I have a lot to think about it's slowly eating away at my sleep because I have no idea how to proceed from this point.  Again thank you it feels good to talk about this rather than bottle it up!"
mypartneristrans,3ac41x,PickledPenguinPossum,2,Thu Jun 18 23:34:53 2015 UTC,"In regards to acceptance, sometimes people can surprise you. My mother is conservative Catholic and she has been very supportive!"
mypartneristrans,3ac41x,PickledPenguinPossum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"Surgery is something extremely important for you two to talk about, however, some trans people do not plan or even know what they want until it happens. My wife (MTF) has been out as a trans to me for nearly two years and she is still unsure whether she wants to get surgery for either top or bottom. You have to be prepared for him to tell you that he isn't sure. I do want to point out that bottom surgery for FTM is much more difficult and rarely done so it may not be an option for him. This means that he may have more emotional issues with his transitioning if he does want to go for the full transition but can't because there are no doctors to perform the surgery for him. Perhaps by telling you that he only wants top surgery means that he doesn't intend on getting bottom surgery. That is a possibility. Just know that what he decides now may change in the future after he begins his transition.   You have support here so never think you are alone. It could very well mean losing some close to you, but if you truly love someone, you will learn to adjust and cope. But don't think you HAVE to stay with them because of that either. Even if you do love him, if you cant stay with him because he is no longer a her, it is ok. It doesn't say anything negative about your love, or your character. It just means that the relationship can go no further, that it has a bittersweet ending. Nothing wrong with that. Better to have loved and lost, than to not love at all. Your love will continue no matter if you stay or go and being with a trans person isn't for everyone."
mypartneristrans,3a9569,SashimiGirl,18,Thu Jun 18 05:25:22 2015 UTC,"You both went wrong at the point you decided you both could date other people, yet still continue to live together.  With your past together, that was like throwing matches into gasoline; eventual disaster guaranteed.  As far as ""...seeing how things go."" They go quite well for some couples even when their partner isn't technically bi.   Preemptively dumping a relationship based on your experiences is foolish advice and would have cost quite a few women on here the happy, thriving relationships they've built.   Lastly, it's condescending and patronizing to inform your partner your relationship is now over because you're trans and you've decided she cannot handle it."
mypartneristrans,3a9569,SleepNowMyThrowaway,7,Thu Jun 18 06:51:26 2015 UTC,"You both went wrong at the point you decided you both could date other people, yet still continue to live together. With your past together, that was like throwing matches into gasoline; eventual disaster guaranteed.   Yeah, definitely. When my wife and I had separated, she wanted to be best friends right away. I was hurting so bad and its not like I just suddenly stopped loving her! But she had told me she was no longer in love with me. But yeah, I knew I was going to need space for quite some time before we could be friends, I had nightmares about her being with other people. And if even if you agree to live together and date other people, the first sign of feeling uncomfortable or jealous, it needs to be communicated because then it's obvious you're not ""okay"" with it."
mypartneristrans,3a9569,PANDADA,6,Thu Jun 18 11:43:54 2015 UTC,"The question of trying is always going to be up to the people in the relationship. I don't think it's as simple as whether both partners are bisexual. My spouse would not have been okay with giving up our relationship to transition regardless of either of our sexualities. I also don't think that exploring sexuality is a universal part of the transitioning process, even though it can be for some trans people.   The key is more about being open about the needs and expectations in the current relationship and whether those are being met. While you might have been more open about being transgender than others your talk to, your narrative does speak a lot about hiding your real feelings and not speaking up when clearly there were things that needed to be said. That's not good for any relationship much less one where there are fundamental changes that need to take place.  I do think that a lot of transgender partners tend to stay in the closet way too long, and only come out when the matter of transitioning is truly urgent for them. That's to the detriment of the relationship because time, if available, is probably one of the best resources to have when coming out and wanting to maintain a good relationship whatever that is."

Agreed. I told my wife I wish she had told me when she first started thinking about it again, which was many months before she told me. We had a discussion seven years prior if she wanted to transition, and she said no, and it never came up again until that moment last year. I was totally blind sided (like most of us are), and she was ready to jump in head first because she had all that time to process it, I didn't. Especially in a marriage, life changing decisions need to be discussed in the beginning stages, not only when you've made a final decision."
mypartneristrans,3a9569,PANDADA,12,Thu Jun 18 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it didn't work for you. But that doesn't mean everyone is you. I was a gay man whose partner transitioned to female. We're still together (engaged now, actually), happy as hell, and have more sex than we did before she transitioned. I still wouldn't consider myself bi. It's not like I walk down the street and check out women. But I'm attracted to my fiancee and she's definitely a woman. There are exceptions to every rule. One needn't be established as bi or pan in order for it to work out--they just need to be open to how they identify not having quite as much say over their attraction as they might think it does."
mypartneristrans,3a9569,PeeWeeMerman,3,Thu Jun 18 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's right to prescribe a single solution to many different individuals/relationships.  There are perfectly good reasons to wait and see. Some straight people do find that their sexuality is more fluid than they thought, or at least open to the exception of their partner. Some people remain together for children, or for mutual support. Some people are capable of managing an open relationship in a way you and your ex were not equipped for.  I also think there are good reasons for someone not to want to remain in a relationship through transition, but it should be up to individuals to decide what they're mutually comfortable with."

mypartneristrans,3a9569,StrobesNQueens,6,Thu Jun 18 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"Why do both partners ""have to"" be bi, though?  For instance, I'm polysexual, so I fall in that category, but my partner is a lesbian (mtf). She was bi for a little while in high school, but she stopped feeling attraction to men in freshman year of college.  Besides, sexuality is (or at least can be) fluid. Some people wouldn't realize they're attracted to their partner's gender until they see how things work out."
mypartneristrans,3a9569,SphirosOKelli,2,Thu Jun 18 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me that your situation is not very typical. I can't imagine my girlfriend destroying our belongings in a fit of rage because my date went well and her failed.  I for one and doing the ""wait and see"" with my partner. She wants to stay with me because she loves me, I want her to stay because I love her. If that doesn't work out in the end we will part ways, but I definitely don't see how ending things here and now would do anything except rob us of the chance to make it work on the other side.  I am very sorry to hear about how your partner treated you though. It is very clear that there was an inability on their end to maturely handle the emotions they were dealing with. And honestly, it sounds like you may need to cut the cord. You need to accept, at some point, that you are not responsible for your ex's happiness OR financial security. Or if you cannot bring yourself to stop supporting her, which I get as unhealthy as it may be, you should set up a certain sense of boundary. Tell her that as long as she is taking your money she is not allowed to make ANY derogatory comments or blow up your phone. You deserve happiness - clinging to that old tie in this fashion isn't going to make you feel better and could eventually poison the relationship you currently have.  Best of luck to you - please remember that you deserve happiness. You DESERVE IT."

What I loved about it was Ricky's personality and attitude. If one of my children announced that they were transgender, I would be so proud if they ended up like Ricky post-transition. She was so confident and self-assured. I thought her character was a really great role model for young trans people. We enjoyed it quite a bit :)"

I also thought it was really cool how her family is with her, and how she kind of took the role of mom for her brother once her mom died. I also liked how they threw in the drama with the marine. I feel like there are a lot of people that hate on transgenders because they are attracted to them or were at one point and it scared them because they didn't think it was ok.

It's not that I am trying to be racist or prejudice or discriminatory or anything of the like. I just don't understand why words like that are offensive. I don't use offensive slurs, and I don't feel like those are slurs to be. But I am not the one being called it so I guess that makes sense. Maybe I am just really naive and ignorant.

I guess they figured it described Robby meeting Ricki (realizing his love for her).

I still think it should have been called Ricki or even Ricki and Robby, anything is better than Boy Meets Girl."
mypartneristrans,3a1vay,PANDADA,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"I think the choice the name, because of the scene where they discus sex orientation and sex. And she keeps using the phrase ""Boy meets Girl""."

As much as I hate to say it, I have to say that my spouse's transition IS contributing to some instability in my daughter's life.  My spouse is currently exploring herself, doesn't know exactly where her life is headed, etc.  She's less focused on our daughter and more focused on herself and her transition.  Don't get me wrong, she's a great parent and loves our daughter very much, but I do feel like, to some extent, my daughter is clinging to me because she feels like I am the constant in her life, no matter how normal we try to make life seem or how positive a spin we put on my spouse's transition. Sometimes she frets and worries over my spouse's transition.  ETA: But she's always been kind of a mama's girl, so it's hard to say how much of this is her preference for me has to do with my spouse's transition and how much of it is just because.  Now, all that said, if a trans person is denied custody or rights to their child based SOLELY on the fact that they are trans, then yeah, that's pretty shitty."

Now that people are beginning to be more educated about and familiar with the topic, I hope that the courts will make decisions based on trans parents' parenting abilities more often."
mypartneristrans,3a1mio,bookwormxx,2,Thu Jun 18 15:30:27 2015 UTC,"Just found this sub. This was 20+ years ago, but in a conservative area it might still be applicable.   I'm the child of a MtF woman and a ciswoman who were married. When they divorced (due to the transition), cismom hired a lawyer to dig up any sort of shit to fling at transmom and transmom lost all custody. Unfortunately for me, cismom has major mental and physical problems, and ended up extorting transmom until I was 18 for childsupport that was not spent on me while barely taking care of me. Transmom had me the majority of the time, but cismom would 'spring the trans bomb' on people/school officials randomly to deny transmom access to me. For instance, once after school transmom was not allowed to pick me up because cismom had called the school and told them about transmom's status and lack of custody. Essentially, I was used as an extended way to get back at transmom while cismom raked in the pity points from the parents of my friends, and asked me to lie about transmom's existence until she could spring it for extra points. They grew to massively dislike her due to this manipulation. Legally, there wasn't much transmom could do to change the situation.  Honestly, I hope the court systems have eased up on this. Transmom wasn't the most amazing mom in the world but she tried really damn hard to make things work and made many sacrifices for me. Her identity only really effected me when cismom tried to use it as a weapon.  Anyways, hope this helps answer your question."

A few years later they got divorced and had joint custody (50/50 I think) of the kids.  This was back in the early 90s in NYC.  Bottom line, get a lawyer who is not transphobic and will work their ass off to represent your interests. A lot may depend on the judge, but I have heard of transgender parents who got custody for the same reason a parent would in a situation where both parents were cis, that the noncustodial parent was completely flakey and couldn't provide a decent home for their kid.  Also, I have heard that teaching a child to dislike a parent is considered child abuse, so if your soon to be ex is teaching your child(ren) to be transphobic that can be used as evidence that the child would be better off in your custody.  Sorry I don't have firsthand experience, just things I've heard.  Good luck to you!"
mypartneristrans,3a0lkz,UncleVampire,9,Tue Jun 16 08:00:45 2015 UTC,"In western society, and more particularly, language, the terms we use for sexuality are tied to the terms we use for gender. The two are functionally linked for most of society, but when gender becomes the variable, the terms lose definition. You love your partner and there isn't a widely accepted sexuality term for that.  As he (has he asked you to start using female pronouns, or a female name yet?) is transitioning, it will be a hard, stressful and long road for both of you. It's called a transition for a reason. There will be a lot of focus on him, and his ""becoming her"", your own emotional needs may not be met, you may fell pushed aside or ignored, or unimportant. It will be very hard on both of you.  Sex and intimacy will change, but the person you love will, at their core, be the same.  His reaction to estrogen will be fairly unique to him. He may, after a few months, be able to again maintain a decent erection, or you may need to explore alternative arrangements for both of you to reach orgasm.   I am also sorry to hear that you have lost your family closeness over this. I want to say it gets better, but expect to lose new friends, hardship, and in general a miserable attitude from the world around you. In a lot of ways, trans acceptance just isn't there yet. Treasure the moments when you and your partner are accepted for who you both are."
mypartneristrans,3a0lkz,unixbeardxd,8,Tue Jun 16 09:39:11 2015 UTC,"I genuinely am straight, I've been with a girl and wasn't into it the same way I am with men. On the other hand, when I look at my boyfriend when he's dressed up I feel like I really see him finally and I still am so in love. Does this mean I'm bisexual or is this called love going beyond gender? is that the same thing? Will I feel differently when my boyfriend because mostly female?   You can't really know how your attraction might change as your partner transitions.  In my case, I'm ftm and my partner is a cis man. He considers himself straight but has remained attracted to me as I've transitioned to male. He says it's because I'm still me and he loves me for who I am, not what I look like. He doesn't consider himself bi since I'm the only guy he has been attracted to. So in our case I'm basically an exception, sometimes the term heteroflexible might be used as well."
mypartneristrans,3a0lkz,taylor-in-progress,4,Tue Jun 16 13:37:46 2015 UTC,"The hardest part for me during my spouse's transition is the uncertainty. Of course nothing in life is certain anyway, but it feels so much more magnified now. I married them with some sort of idea of what our future would be like, but now looking years down the road, I see more of a question mark and I'm trying to be okay with that. But it can be hard because I've already spent eight years of my life with them, expecting I'd be married to a guy for the rest of my life. It's quite a shock to the system. You're saying goodbye and welcoming a new person at the same time.  I've had a couple crushes on girls, but that was back in high school (I'm 31 now) and I didn't have a crush on another girl since then. So back then I questioned my sexuality but eventually just labeled myself straight because I figured it was a weird phase or I was confused or something (I know bi and gay people never want to hear those terms used...). So it was really hard at first for me to imagine myself with a woman. But my wife started HRT in October and I'm still very much attracted to her and love her. I've kind of given up on trying to find a label for my sexuality and just say my sexuality is my spouse. I married her with the intention of spending the rest of my life with her and that still remains.  As for feeling lonely, I understand that. I've felt it too. But we are here to listen! However, the most important thing for any lasting relationship, during a transition especially, is communication and honesty. So you need to keep open communication. Your partner is stressed and worried, but so are you and your needs and feelings shouldn't be ignored either. It can become difficult to balance at times, but as long as you're both willing to talk, listen and work through it, it's doable."
mypartneristrans,3a0lkz,PANDADA,4,Tue Jun 16 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"My biggest advice is to not focus on how you think you think, or what you feel like you should think. Just check in with yourself to see how you actually feel. As someone who identified as 100% gay when my partner started transitioning, the questions I'd continually ask myself are: ""Do I love her as-is? Do I want to be in a committed relationship with her as-is? Do I want to be intimate with her as-is?"" If I could answer yes to all of those things (which I always could and still can), then how I felt about women or my sexual identity or any of that was all irrelevant. It's when you start saying ""but what if"" all the time--that's when it's a problem. The fact is that you have no idea how your partner is going to feel. Or how you'll feel. Just trust that your partner's transition should progress as is best for your partner, irrespective of you. And as that moves along, you'll be able to know where you land on it by checking in with yourself.   As for HRT and erections, everyone reacts differently. My fiancee has been on HRT for nearly two years, has had an orchiectomy, and still maintains full functionality."
mypartneristrans,3a0lkz,PeeWeeMerman,3,Tue Jun 16 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"Does this mean I'm bisexual or is this called love going beyond gender? is that the same thing? Will I feel differently when my boyfriend because mostly female?     These are great questions that I am still wrestling with myself. Until transition became a reality, I would've labeled myself as a heterosexual female. Now, I am apparently a queer cis female :) My spouse is a trans woman and began HRT about 4 months ago. I've been pretty confident all along that I won't lose my attraction to my partner and that we can make a lesbian relationship work - I'm even looking forward to some aspects of it! However, I don't know where that confidence comes from and I've begun to really explore that. I have found that as my wife's body changes, I am responsive to the changes and we continue to have a lot of intimacy and we are both satisfied. At the moment, I am unsure if it is my love that is truly transcending gender (pun intended, I stole it off a t-shirt!) or if I am unearthing a part of my sexuality that I wasn't aware of. I anticipate getting asked the question, ""If you don't end up together, does this mean you'll date women now?"" I'm not interested in imagining my life beyond my wife, but I am intrigued by the true reason for my flexibility.    You are certainly not crazy for being happy in your relationship. I love my wife, she brings me so much joy and happiness. Transition is tough, but it is also introspective and tender, it is an experience that will tear down walls and force you to evaluate things you may have not ever even considered. I'm so sorry to hear that your family is responding negatively, but glad to hear your friends are awesome!     There is a lot of information out there on the effects of HRT. I would suggest you read up on it. The Informed Consent gives a lot of information about what will happen medically if your partner begins HRT. You can read up on WPATH standards of care. There are a ton of youtube videos about transition and many subreddits focused on trans communities. Reading up on these things will help to set your expectations about what transition will bring.    Also, don't neglect you. I hear you about being lonely, this is a somewhat isolating process and partners can get neglected. Make sure that you perform self care: have someone to talk to (a therapist if need be, that's what I have), do the things that make you happy, be determined to learn and grow yourself as your partner make their transformation. You are an important variable in this equation and your future path, desires and dreams matter, too :)"

mypartneristrans,3a0lkz,kristendk,2,Tue Jun 16 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"Emotional distance is difficult... My partner and I started experiencing it when I first came out. It was extremely helpful when I told her that I needed to know how she felt, that I wanted to talk with her. Hearing this from you might give your boyfriend some reassurance. It also means a lot to me when my girlfriend references my transition is subte, silly ways. Like telling the dog to ""listen to your daddy"" and such. It sounds like you are being extremely supportive. Let him know that you are concerned about the distance, it helps to note that fear of losing a relationship can cause us to be insecure. I tell my partner all the time that I have difficulty distinguishing between her being upset at work vs her being upset at me. And to that end we have established a framework that allows me to ask for some reassurance without detracting from her ability to be upset at her boss. Communication is going to be key to helping you both move through this. It sounds like you guys are on a great track though!"
mypartneristrans,39x3ar,kaorte,4,Mon Jun 15 14:41:29 2015 UTC,"Its tough. Its really tough for her, but its tough for me also. I just don't know what to do. One persons carelessly chosen words can completely ruin her confidence for the day.       Thanks for sharing this whole post, but especially the line above. I'm really worried about this part when my partner starts presenting part time. She is extremely confident and really does well in the few times we've been out in public. Most of these have been in trans specific spaces (support groups) and last weekend we made a bold move by going to Pride (also a safe and accepting space). As we push out to part time, I'd really love to know some ways that I can help to 'cushion' the blow when/if she gets misgendered. You already mentioned that you don't know what to do, but have you found anything that works? Also, my spouse is pretty realistic about her expectations with people changing pronouns/name, etc...and I don't think she'll blow up or melt down over every mistake, but I worry I'm overestimating how much she can handle, or how much more vulnerable we'll both feel when opening up this experience into the 'real world'. How were your experiences moving through these stages?    Thanks so much for any thoughts you can share, and thanks again for sharing your story. It is so good to know that there are people out there who are getting it. It's also sad to know that there are people who don't. We're moving in the right direction, I think!"
mypartneristrans,39x3ar,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Mon Jun 15 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"In my head I think ""If someone misgenders her, I will politely correct them"" but then when it happens... I know the person did not mean any harm by it, and I know its partly because my partner still looks androgynous. So I just freeze up and don't know what to do.    She has only just started to go out in public presenting as female. Its been kind of trial and error. She expects me to pick up on cues and sometimes I just miss them. So we have done a better job of discussing before we go out what the expectations are. If she doesn't want to talk, I will do the talking. I still want to devise some sort of code word or signal that lets me know she is uncomfortable and to ABORT ABORT ABORT lol.    My partner is realistic in her expectations, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when she is trying to present female and gets misgendered. It is a huge blow. She doesn't breakdown right then and there, but you can tell it eats at her from the inside. I hate seeing her like that. It breaks my heart.    I think a lot of it is just learning as you go. Trial and error. Take it one step at a time. Try to talk beforehand about what your expectations are and maybe come up with a word or signal that indicated her discomfort. I know some people have levels of discomfort. Yellow, Red, Black. Maybe something like that would work."

I also got a lot out of the book, ""She's Not There - A Life in Two Genders"" by Jenny Boylan.   I've read up on the WPATH and my wife shared a couple versions of the Informed Consent to help me understand what we were signing up for.   My wife also shares articles, links, websites, etc...that she comes across as she interacts with the community.   We've watched Transparent and Boy Meets Girl and enjoyed both.   We go to the local BeingMe group - I join once a month on the nights that partners/parents/supporters are welcome.   I found a local parent/partner support group that I haven't yet attended because the initial information I got lead me to believe that it's a very negative place to go and I'm not sure I'm going to fit in, so.....I'll report back if I do...but probably not ;)     Edit: got bullet points?"

mypartneristrans,39ykw7,putmeinthezoo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"Well congrats on being someone your partner confides in and feels comfortable telling. Also, thank you for being the type of person that doesnt flee when something this important and fragile is shared. Too many times, relationships break up and its usually because the person doesn't fully understand what the transitioning person is going through. I completely understand what you mean about all the negativity that surrounds the transgender community and those in relationships, especially marriages, on the web. My wife came out to me roughly two years ago and then we kept her secret for next to a year and a half. The first professional we came out to was her electrologist (it was the first appointment we set her up with) and the woman sat us down and basically told us our marriage was doomed. I freaked out and cried and was just so upset thinking that it was true. But I realized that no one can make us fail but ourselves and that if we want to be together, we have to do everything we can to work it out and become stronger to survive and be the successful percent. So I applaud you for trying to make it work because it is definitely hard and a struggle but totally worth every minute!  As for resources, aside from reddit and the web in general, have you looked into the local LGBT community? I know here where we live, they have a chapter that is responsible for hosting meetings, get togethers and group therapy sessions. It could help you guys out. The group here is called Access Aids/PFLAG. PFLAG is the bigger group and you may be able to find a local chapter there. I know ours here isn't that great, but Access Aids is a good resource and we do have an excellent chapter two hours away that we could go to if we wanted to drive that far. They host all sorts of group nights, like Non-Transitioning Partners, Game night, Fashion Shows, even Bible Study, if you are looking for something like that. They also have a ton of resources in the form of pamphlets that could be of use. Just a thought. Here is Pflags website (https://community.pflag.org/), I'd share Access Aids but thats just the local chapter here, not sure it would be of use to you.  Its good that your partner is willing to see a therapist, I think that is a BIG necessity because your partner is unsure of steps and really everything right now. I know the therapist helped my wife and actually even suggested a doctor to help her get started on hormones. Most states require you to see a therapist and get a letter of recommendation before seeing a doctor to start hormones. If you have any questions or need someone to talk to, we are always here, for you and her!"
mypartneristrans,39xfnk,sbrandi74,3,Mon Jun 15 16:16:31 2015 UTC,"Just ask. My boyfriend is ftm. Its was hard at first because I'm gay and didn't have a great understanding of trans people at all.   Mostly, just talk. Make it apparent if it isn't already that sex is important to you (as it is to most healthy adults) and that you want to continue a sexual relationship with them. Maybe sex changes. There are still a tonne of ways to fuck that aren't penetrative, and maybe they aren't bashful about their junk. A lot of trans people are fine without bottom surgery. A good way of helping would be to ask what they want you to call the front stuff. Another thing that's important is maybe seeking out counseling for one or both of you.  So I'll reiterate, the most important things are communication and honesty. Just like any other relationship matter"
mypartneristrans,39xfnk,Royal_Robin,2,Mon Jun 15 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"When my spouse made the decision to transition, we drafted a set of expectations. (We thought boundaries and ultimatums were not quite the spirit of what we were looking for.) One of the expectations that we both agreed on very much is continued intimacy. I made it very clear that I'm not looking for a 'sister' or 'bff' (although she is my bff and always has been). I am fully supportive of transition and understand why she needs it; I am also committed to our marriage, regardless of her gender. I cannot, however, agree to a marriage without intimacy. My partner is about 4 months on HRT and things are going very well. There have definitely been some changes in our sexy times, but none of them have been negative. We communicate a lot about what we want, what has changed and what we like. Honestly, because of the enhanced communication and discussion, I think our sex life has seen an overall benefit. I understand that we may have challenges awaiting us, but if we are able to deal with them as well as we've deal with the initial ones, I think maintaining our intimacy will not be an issue the further we get into transition.    I think it's very important for you to communicate your need for continued intimacy and what it means to you. I've also tried to educate myself on what changes to anticipate and what new techniques might work. I'll just toss it out there that it may not be a bad idea for you to invest in a Hitachi Wand. I gave my partner one as a gift quite a while ago and we're still reaping the benefits from that one ;)"
mypartneristrans,39xfnk,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Mon Jun 15 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"Well in my case, my spouse doesn't really have any dysphoria over her genitalia. If your spouse is going to go on HRT, it's typical for people to lose libido for the first few months. It came back for my spouse, but of course her libido isn't the same as it was when her body was full of testosterone. It's mostly me initiating sex now, be when I do she's willing. She hasn't had any issues getting or maintaining erections and we still have PIV sex. If that becomes an issue for your spouse (assuming they even still want to do PIV sex), Viagra is an option. I've heard some transwomen say erections can become painful, but that can depend on how often they get erect. I've read it can become a ""use it or lose it"" situation, but it's always YMMV too. What works for one may not work for another. Unfortunately there are no guarantees and you just have to see how it pans out. But it's not a lost cause either. But do talk to your spouse and see where they stand with sex too."

She told me about her dysphoria almost 2 years ago and when I first found out, I was horrible and thought that it was my fault she wanted this and I also believed it was a fad, something that would come and go. After about 6 months, I realized that all of that was untrue, that it wasn't my fault and that it wasn't a fad, that this was for real and wasn't going to change. As soon as I accepted that, things started getting so much better. Our sex life before she told me was good but it wasn't great. I felt like we were on different levels completely. Once she began transitioning, our sex life became a thing of wonder, it was amazing! I am very much a straight woman but sex with her as she wanted to be has been awesome. I can see how much more she enjoys it and that makes me enjoy it more too. We haven't changed much from before, but the little things we have changed has done wonders. Aside from sex, we are more intimate and connect on a whole new level than we were before. I feel like I am getting to know the real person I was meant to be with. I couldn't imagine my life ever being the way it was before.   Dont get me wrong, it is hard at times and a struggle to get used to the fact that to the public's eye, we are a gay couple after being a straight couple for so long. But none of that matters anymore. I am in love more so now than I was before.   The best thing I can tell you is you both need to talk and I really do suggest that you both see a therapist, individually and as a couple. If you really want this to work and to stay together, you HAVE to try by learning ways to cope with the loss of him and the gain of her. It is an amazing journey, I promise, but it takes work. Nothing worth doing is easy! Please, if you want to talk more, feel free to message me or just respond to my post! You have people here that understand and can help you.

I want to transition, and my SO told me she wouldn't be into it. I told her the same thing. That I wouldn't do it if that was how she felt. She wasn't shitty about it, she's actually been VERY supportive.   I can't imagine a life without her. She REALLY wants to be with me, and I with her.   What I told her was that I wasn't willing to be EXTREMELY, CATASTROPHICALLY unhappy in one aspect of my life (our relationship), just so I could be happy in another (my transition). I'm fine with reaching a compromise, so I can still be going in the direction I want to, but still being with the woman I love and have been with for so long.   He still wants to be Rachel, but in a way where he can still have you. I understand that you can't change your sexuality, no matter how much some religious assholes think you can.  I wouldn't look at this as he's trying to take it all back. If he's anything like me, it would seem that you're much more important to him than transitioning, which is how I feel about my SO. This doesn't mean that he's trying to hide who he really is. I would try approaching it from that angle. There are plenty of couples who have gone through this kind of thing, and have chosen this course, and continued to be happy in their relationship.   Hopefully you two can make it through this. Sure, if you got a divorce, then you could still be there for him, but he may not see it that way if that were to happen. AGAIN, if he's anything like me, it would KILL him to see you move on with anyone else."
mypartneristrans,39vqju,Royal_Robin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:41:23 2015 UTC,"I think part of my trusting of what he says stems from the fact that when he was hiding all this from me, he sought out someone else. He didn't cheat, but he had the intention of cheating. He told me about it, but still didn't tell me about the dressing and everything else. That didn't come out until I stumbled upon the information. Then I confronted him, and he told me.   I love him, he's my best friend, but I think he just loves my company and the fact that I take care of things. Him, the kids, our finances, everything. So as much as I want to believe it would be a catastrophic degree of unhappiness if he wasn't married to me, I worry that it isn't the case. That it's just what he's used to, and there's been a lot of change in our lives over the last year and a half and he's afraid of more change.   Of course I am happy to continue working on our marriage, but part of me wonders if it is worth it if what he really wants is to be Rachel. Because if that's the case, all the work in the marriage would be fruitless because it wouldn't change how I feel about being married to Rachel."
mypartneristrans,39vqju,Royal_Robin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"I understand. The angle I was approaching it from was that he could have avoided telling you, because he was afraid of backlash, as your opinion matters SO VERY MUCH to him/her.   I wasn't aware of the cheating part. That kind of changes things. If he's/she's just wanting an amazing friend, then that's different, and I'm sure that you would be LEGENDARILY amazing. It just kinda sucks that you had kids together before you found that out. Not that I'm saying you both don't love your kids, but I'm sure it would have been better to find this out before hand.  I want to be with my SO no matter what. I love her more than anything else. At the same time, I CRAVE wanting to fully become Brianna. It's something that I long for. This being said, I would be MUCH happier just being as feminine as I possibly can be, but not passed the point that she would become uncomfortable. My SO has said MANY times that I can be as femme as I want to, but she may not be the most comfortable with some (not ALL) of the surguries, but would still be attracted to/want to stay with me.  I WANT to compromise, so I can be more of ""myself"" on the outside, so it at least somewhat closely resembles who I am on the inside. With that being said, I don't want to lose my SO in the process. Luckily, she's very open about her boundaries in the matter.  I know there are more possibilities to this situation than just mine. I was just wondering if it were closer to mine, than something slightly different.   I wish this were an easy thing to deal with, but it's probably one of the more mentally complicated things to sort through, and everyone come out in tact. There are so many things that come into play, and so many tiny little things that relationships can become snagged on in the process. It takes a strong person to hear your SO tell you things like this. Although you're confused, you do seem to be fairly strong in this regard. I'm so fortunate that my SO is the same way.  I truly believe that you love him/her, and want to be with him/her with all your heart. I wish you nothing but the best for you, your SO and your children in your journey, and hope that it causes the least amount (or better yet no) pain possible (you sound like you're at least a hair past that point though....).  I hope you weren't under the impression that I was being hostile. It was just in the attempt that I may potentially provide a fresh angle on things, so nothing is misconstrued. :)"

You've already made it clear that as a support you aren't going to go away. And you seem to have made it clear that you won't use the kids as a weapon.( good mom, my parents weren't so gracious). So just, wait.  Make him see a therapist. Maybe see a marriage counselor or do group sessions. You dont have to do this alone. You have options. Good luck."

I just am scared that he'll bury what he wants to avoid change that he doesn't want. We've had each other within arms reach for fourteen years (minus his three deployments), married for nearly ten years, and we're used to the knowledge that we are always there for one another. I think he thought that I would accept his desire to want more in the realm of transitioning. I really think it shocked him that there was finally a line he could cross that would end our marriage and now he's back pedaling. He's seeing a therapist once a week, and we've done marriage counseling, which helped with our communicating. The fear is just still there. I don't WANT a divorce, but I don't want him to hide who he is to keep me. That's not the right way to do this.  And goodness, no. I would never use our kids as a weapon. My parents did that when they separated. I could never put my kids through that. Not in a million years."
mypartneristrans,39shcw,pandageorge,2,Sun Jun 14 09:16:04 2015 UTC,"Hello.  My situation is a little different from yours (mostly because I'm not very heterosexual at all), but a lot of this is very familiar. You're right that when our partners come out, there's often parts of us that get shut away and big parts of our lives that leave our control. Also, the impact transition has on our relationships is very real and unavoidable. These things, in addition to the uncertainties that come with transition, may be difficult to handle and it's okay to acknowledge that.  When my spouse told me last year that she wanted to transition, she told me that she wouldn't go through with it if it meant losing her relationship with me. But from my perspective, I'd rather have her be herself and not be in a relationship with me than to be in a relationship with her that's built on her being someone she's not. I think we'll stay together, but there's never any guarantee of that outcome.   I think you're making a similar choice as well. Your relationship might not work out, but putting your partner's well-being over trying to secure your own romantic satisfaction is not something that horrible people do. In addition, attraction isn't something you can choose, force, or completely ignore. It's not your fault if the changes your partner makes mean that relationship no longer works for you, and it does not make you a bad person to acknowledge that if that's the case. Whatever happens with your relationship and whatever other people might think and say, please believe in that at least."

I have told my partner many times that while I'm having some pretty strong emotions about it, I am very happy that they are doing something for them that will make them happy. I don't want them to change their mind because I'm having a hard time about it. I think that means a lot mroe to them than I can even understand, but I don't know.  Thank you for your words, your comment really helped me with some of my anxiety. <3"
mypartneristrans,39shcw,canthandletrans,2,Sun Jun 14 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"<3s to you.  My partner also wanted to be more gender neutral. Yet somehow that came out as wearing dresses and growing out his hair and taking estrogen.   I also did not find my partner sexually attractive when he dressed as a female, and both celebrated and had a melt down when he pulled off a cute female outfit.   I can't tell you which direction to take. My partner and I separated. Their happiness is important, but so is my own- and your own happiness. You are not a horrible person if you decide this isn't what you signed up for."
mypartneristrans,39shcw,Nixiecap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the <3s and for your story. Their changes will include wearing women's clothing and their hair is already long. They've had long hair and painted nails for as long as I've even known them.   Just a lot of fears still, trying to find where my happiness fits here as well. <3"
mypartneristrans,39shcw,Nixiecap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:58:34 2015 UTC,"From a fellow anxiety sufferer - Stop. Sit for a minute. Take a deep breath. Huuuuuuuuuuug You're going to be okay. =)  You don't need to tackle everything or ""solve"" everything right now. Take it slow. Give yourself time to adjust to the changes. It may take a while, and you will likely go through a mourning period. That's okay. Change can be very difficult; let yourself feel what you have to feel.  Keep up the open communication with your partner. It sounds like you both do a good job explaining what you each need in your relationship.   Does your partner have a good support system in place outside of you? It's really important that they have other folks to reach out to and lean on as well during their transition.  If your partner is open to it, it may be a good idea to go to couple's counseling with them. Many people see couple's counseling as a last ditch effort to keep a struggling relationship alive. That is absolutely not the case. With couple's counseling, you'll have a therapist working with you and ensuring that you are both getting the support you need as a couple during these changes.  Give yourselves time to adjust in terms of romantic and sexual feelings. Again, it sounds like everything is very new. If your partner is open to it, ask if you can be at their appointment when they discuss taking estrogen with their doctor/endocrinologist. That way you can ask specific questions, and it may take away some of your specific worries.  Regarding your support circle and Christian friends, it, of course, depends on the ""flavor"" of Christianity and group of people, but religion is not an automatic disqualifer of support by any stretch of the imagination for trans* folks and allies. Many of us have had bad experiences, but I feel that is because of people using religious doctrine as a way to divide rather than unite. My girlfriend is no longer Christian, but her hometown church parishioners are still some of our strongest allies and biggest supporters! Love is love. The people who really care about you and your partner will support you!"
mypartneristrans,39shcw,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Sun Jun 14 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"your comment made me cry, and it a good way. That first line, I laughed with my partner, saying ""they get me, they really get me.""  Your comment really hits home for me, and it was great that it seems you responded to it with anxiety in mind, because my anxiety is why I'm in therapy in the first place. Made it pretty easy to talk to a therapist about the changes, because I already had one.  I really do love the communication I have with my partner. I showed them this post and the comments this morning and before even replying to anything, we went and talked about what was said, what suggestions were right for us to try, and are moving forward with more support than we had before.  Your comment made me actually think and we talked about their support system and how we are going to work through this together. We have a bit more of a solid game plan and that helps. Your post really hit a lot of things right on the nose and we talked about me coming to their appointments, which they are in complete support of. We are in this together, even if we don't end up in a romantic relationship after the dust settles.  I may be coming back to read this comment again later when my anxiety flares up, everything you said just makes me want to hug you, so thank you."

mypartneristrans,39shcw,dagalmighty,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:57:08 2015 UTC,"Welcome pandageorge! We can understand the confusing mess of emotions that you are feeling. It is totally ok, as Orgy said, your feelings are so very valid. As the partner of someone in transition, you are in transition, too. It is helpful to remember this. The changes your partner is making will have impacts on your life, and you should not feel guilty for the emotions that are evoked by these changes.    It's really hard to feel so alone with all of this information. Many of us can also identify with that struggle. I have my partner, my therapist and this subreddit with which to conversate about this part of my life. This subreddit can be very helpful, there are lots of nice folks here :)    You need and deserve some time to work through the complex set of emotions that you are experiencing. It's really great that you are confiding in your partner and sharing all of the reactions you are having - positive and negative. Communication is going to be a very important tool for you during this process.      In all of this, I've felt really emotional. I cry whenever I'm alone and thinking about it, or even alone with my partner and thinking about it.    You have a lot of concerns - your sexuality, intimacy, your faith. Early on, someone here suggested to me that I start a transition journal. It has been very helpful. In it I break down these big topics in smaller pieces and attempt to digest all the information in smaller chunks. When the journal wasn't enough, I sought out a therapist who has experience with couples in transition and this has been a huge help.    In the end, you may decide to stay, and you may decide to go. Either way, you need to make the decision that will allow for your happiness. You're right, it's a big deal to be the partner of someone in transition. It helps to know you're not alone - and you're not :)"

mypartneristrans,39shcw,SphirosOKelli,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"I am also a 'pleaser'. It is hard for us. Transition is pretty all consuming and I think people like us are in danger of becoming what someone else called a 'support-o-tron 3000'. It's really difficult, but important to speak up about your needs. I find that because of my heightened emotional state, issues quickly snowball and I have a responsibility to communicate my feelings with enough frequency to avoid that. Transition has actually taught me a lot about boundaries and expectations and how to work with both of these things more effectively.    Edit: to add some love :) <3"

I have talked a lot about my feelings and I have an extra appointment with my therapist next week, because I can't go one day without crying at some point, and talking it to death helps. Heck, even writing this out here helped. As a writer in my fun side of life, writing seems to help me a ton. haha.  I like the 'support-o-tron 3000' reference. I am trying to separate my support from my romantic relationship in a sense. I need to know that I can still support them through their transition, no matter what happens. When I first started freaking out, I was so worried that I was trapped, because I thought not staying with them made me not supportive. Again, I don't know hat will happen, but what I have been trying to gain more confidence in is that my decision to stay with them needs to be because of my own wants and needs, not anyone else's.  Thanks for the love. <3"

mypartneristrans,39mv2z,bookwormxx,2,Sun Jun 21 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for remembering! That's so lovely of you. :) The appointment was good -- we didn't get a chance to talk about a whole lot since the therapist was trying to get an overview of all our relationship, but I got some of my concerns out in the open and it seems like she can help us. She's a bit brisk for my taste, but I also spent the past 10 years living in the South so coming back to the Northeast has been a shock. Even though I was born and raised here, I got used to all the gentle ""honeys"" and ""darlings"" in the South. (My old therapist used to end sessions with a hug -- not so with the new therapist!) When we got home I expressed some concern to my partner about things the therapist said that seemed rude to me, and he told me that she didn't come across that way to him. Maybe I'm being too sensitive, although I won't hesitate to speak up if I feel like this isn't working.    She wants to get my partner to talk more, which I completely support. I do the majority of the talking in our relationship, definitely, and it'll be nice to hear what my partner is thinking for once. I feel like she won't let him get away with his go-to answer, ""I don't know."" Our assignment for the week is for each of us to make a list of all the issues in our marriage, which we'll read and discuss at our session on Friday. I'm interested to see what his list includes. We're also supposed to make a list of the good things in our marriage -- to soothe the burn of all the issues, I guess. :)    I can tell we have a lot to work on, but I am looking forward to seeing how it goes. Thank you again for checking up on me! I feel lucky to have people like you watching my back."

My spouse and I have found our counseling sessions to be a catalyst to more talking between us outside of the sessions.  We often go out to dinner afterward and continue the topics of discussion.  It really does get the thoughts rolling if you have a good therapist.    I'm glad that you are feeling positive and hope that your spouse continues to open up more. :)"

The military situation is a tricky one, but I actually know quite a few transpeople in the military, and the word is that acceptance of transpeople serving is just around the corner, depending on what service branch you are serving in. Hang in there!  I suspect the sexless marriage is coming more from spouse's dysphoria from seeing his own body than it has to do with a rejection of you. Hopefully, therapy will help him see that he cannot wallow in his own needs and ignore yours and expect the marriage to survive. This is a rocky road, and only communication and mutual support will get you to the end of the trip.  Please let us know how therapy goes!!"

mypartneristrans,39l2n6,achanonymous,4,Fri Jun 12 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"I've been working towards the same thing myself. So far I have found out a few things from some of the wonderful spouses on here. (THANK YOU GUYS)   While you have to do you changing ""small"" things like your shampoos, underwear, clothing, etc. can actually be stressful on your partner. I was advised to try and ask my partner for her input/feelings on decisions like this as it lends them a feeling of involvement and some form of control over a rather uncontrollable event. My girl got upset when I let my eyebrows go even though I've always been sporadic about it. Not because she cares about eyebrows, but suddenly it became a thing that she couldn't help but equate with the transition. Being able to have input eases some of that fear I guess. Ensure that while you transition you don't forget that your partner also has needs and emotions. I guess it's easy to get sucked into your transition, the meetings, the research, the hormones, the clothes, etc. Don't forget that you also have a life you guys live together. If there is a scheduling conflict that would have you choose time between your wife and maybe a trans meeting make sure that you sometimes - doesn't have to be always - make time with your wife a priority. I think it is really easy to accidentally leave your partner out and that makes adjusting to this even harder, on both of you. There has to be room for your wife to voice her feelings - even if they are hurtful. When I came out to my partner she tore into me a couple of times... It hurt extremely, but I let her say her piece because she deserves the chance to express the pain/fear she is feeling. After she has had a chance to express her feelings it's easier for you to try and address her fears, and to express your own frustrations and feelings. After a couple of gut wrenching discussions my partner and I came to the conclusion that I needed to move forward with this so she could see where she stood -like you guys. From my own experience - there is a certain kind of balance between holding everything in and forcing your partner to eat/breath/sleep your transition. My partner expressed to me that she felt overwhelmed and that she just didn't want to hear it. I expressed to her that I needed her - as the one I most love - to be able to listen to at least my moments of excitement. So now she listens, but when she asks we switch topics. This way both parties have a chance to deal with this as much as they are comfortable. Don't tell your partner that your changes aren't that big, or that you aren't changing who you are over and over. To us, the changes don't seem that big. We have been chewing over this for a looooooong time. For them, their world and identity was just altered in a way they never expected. I do point out to my partner that I will still be my goofy/playful/cuddly self but I have removed the words ""this isn't really a huge change"" from my vocabulary. Try to keep life as regular as you can. Transitions are scary and normalcy helps reduce the tension, for you AND for her.   The advice seems kind of negative... but honestly I was dead certain that my partner was going to leave, and she still could I suppose though she has explicitly stated that she won't leave even if I am a dude, but I feel like these things have really reduced the hurt and distance in our relationship. She is coming around, even makes jokes about being mom and dad but in Klingon.  Oh, ONE LAST THING - your wife's identity is important to her. I'm not sure how you feel about being ""stealth"" at some point in the future because that would sort of reflect how you would handle this, but my partner feels very strongly that she is a lesbian. So how can she be married to a man? For me I have tried to aleviate that a bit by making sure she knows that she doesn't have to refer to me as her ""husband"" - there are lots of gender neutral spousal refernces out there, and when I do transition that she can feel free to say ""oh my partner is trans"" if it comes up. That's a pretty personal decision and not everyone is comfotable with that, but it seems to have reassured her that I am NOT trying to destroy her identity by doing this. I tell her everyday that she is my favorite lesbian, and she always will be.  I wish you guys the best of luck - therapy is a fantastic start!! My partner isn't into therapy, but so far her friends have been supportive and even told her that I was the best thing that ever happened to her so she should keep me. Again, best of luck my friend."
mypartneristrans,39l2n6,SphirosOKelli,2,Sat Jun 13 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a long and detailed response! Some great advice there, and I'll do my best to keep as much of it in mind as I can.  I know her identity as a straight woman is important to her. She's told me that she knows you love the person, not the gender, and she wont stop loving me, but she doesn't know whether she could be with a woman. I don't feel any great need to go stealth (I feel like that's being somewhat dishonest. I don't mean to go around announcing to the world that I'm trans, but I don't intend to hide it either), so perhaps that might give her some comfort, and she can hold onto her identity as a straight woman."
mypartneristrans,39l2n6,Kaeryn88,3,Sat Jun 13 04:12:15 2015 UTC,"Direct her to this sub! It helps, while I'm not in the same situation I knew before we got married, and I support my partner, I am still going through emotions of my own. As someone said to me she's going through the transition too. It's both of you, you have to communicate negative and positive, it all needs to be said and put on the table so it doesn't start a downward spiral.   Just understand she may need time to come to terms with it since it's new. For me personally when I found out at 14 that my partner was Transgender researching and learning everything I could about it, to try and understand their point of view helped me a lot.   Edit: Forgot how to English."
mypartneristrans,39l2n6,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Fri Jun 12 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"I found it very helpful to get educated on transgender topics. Reading people's stories about their gender journey, reading books, learning about research, interacting with the trans community in these types off spaces. It really helped me to understand what it means to be transgender, the struggles that trans people face, what transition entails, etc...    Doubly helpful was that while I was reading all of this material, she and I would discuss. She would tell me if the story applied to her, or if her journey was different. It allowed us to open up a range of topics that had been difficult to address in the past, by connecting to it through others. This communication has been crucial, and we communicate a lot. I think communication is the key.    Be honest with her about where your future is headed, if you know yourself :)"
mypartneristrans,39l2n6,kristendk,3,Fri Jun 12 23:23:10 2015 UTC,I hear you.  I afraid I don't have much advice other than to keep communication open (and the therapy you already have planned).  Me: Married with a tween daughter. Out to my wife and some immediate family last year.

Coming out puts a big strain on a marriage, but it isn't always a death sentence to the relationship. Many of us come out the other side with a stronger sense of why we married each other. You're already on the right track by thinking about her needs as much as you think about your own.  Definitely direct her our way. We will welcome her!"

mypartneristrans,39gfgc,Kaeryn88,9,Thu Jun 11 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"Yes this is VERY normal! It's okay! While I'm okay with my spouse transitioning as well, I'm still mourning the loss of ""him"". I was with ""him"" for seven years after all. And change is always difficult. In a way I say it feels like being with the same person but someone new at the same time. We watched our wedding video for the first time a few days ago and it was strange to see ""him"" again. Made me realize how much she has changed already. The thought of her voice changing causes me a lot of anxiety too. I think it's just me trying to hold on. It's okay to have mixed emotions through this. It's okay not to feel happy about it 100% of the time. Your feelings are valid. If it does become overwhelming for you though, I recommend going to therapy to help yourself cope with the changes. Change is incredibly difficult for me. I'm a very routine person. So this whole thing is really forcing me out of my comfort zone and some days I just totally break down. And yes, I go to therapy every two weeks."
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,PANDADA,4,Thu Jun 11 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"It's comforting knowing I'm not crazy. I'll seek therapy if I need it, but I've been expecting this change and feel like I've been preparing myself for it. Just a bit overwhelmed at the thought of ""loss"" even though I'm not really losing anything, I'm gaining in a sense since he'll be much happier and happier with himself/in his own body."
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,tulips_onthe_summit,5,Thu Jun 11 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. You are transitioning, too. Please allow yourself this cycle and participate in it. I've also been aware of my partner's trans identity for many, many years, and married for 9. Once I realized that the decision had been made to transition, a switch flipped and I experienced everything you are experiencing. I have never been so emotional in my life. Even now, though I have worked through the cycle, I still feel in a heightened emotional state and sometimes experience small bouts of anxiety. Transition is a big deal. I've found it extremely helpful to have individual therapy to work through these feelings. It has been fantastic. I've also found that I have to be very straightforward with my partner about my feelings, constantly. Get them out before they fester and bloom into something you can't control! It's great that you're so supportive for your partner, make sure you give some of that support to yourself :)"
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,PANDADA,3,Thu Jun 11 16:54:58 2015 UTC,Transition is a big deal.    I really wish my spouse would stop saying it isn't. She says in the grand scheme of things it isn't. Yes it is. -_-
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,tulips_onthe_summit,3,Thu Jun 11 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"I can't formulate a good response to that one...wow, really? I have a hard time imagining that. Isn't it a big deal to her? I'm brainboggled - lol.    Is she trying to bring some levity into the situation, you think?"
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,PANDADA,3,Thu Jun 11 20:59:44 2015 UTC,"She just really doesn't want it to be a big deal because she doesn't want to feel special or different. She's not one to celebrate trans pride or remembrance days because she feels that is not ""equality"" or ""normal"" and it should be like that every day. She just wants to be seen as totally normal and equal. So by treating it as a ""big deal"" means it's not as ""normal"". She wants it to be seen as something that people just do.   At the same time, she was terrified to tell me, she gets anxious and scared about changes during transition (coming out at work, changing her name, etc). So she must recognize it is a big deal. But she tells me that she doesn't want it to be, so at times I feel like my feelings regarding the change and sense of loss are invalidated because I make it a ""big deal""."
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I understand. She wants the future that we are hopefully heading towards to be here today. Me, too. I hope that in the future, this doesn't have to be something that people are encouraged to hide away and that being trans is like being any other adjective, not subject to scorn, ridicule, hate. In that respect, I don't think it should be a big deal, either. Unfortunately, we don't live in that world yet. We do have to deal with the big deal that is still is, although not as much as those before us. Progress?    That being said, though, it must sting for you to hear that you are making it a big deal. Look at the roller coaster you've already been through. I worry about this aspect of things a lot when we come out to friends and family. I have already worked through a lot of my feelings on the matter, and so I want to be a supporter and cheerleader for my partner. However, I don't want to pretend that I didn't have to go through some (A LOT) of turmoil to get here. I'm not sure how to portray that to my close friends and family, and I fear I'm just going to brush it under the rug for the sake of the present and future state of happiness. I was never able to cry on anyone's shoulder and I know that it has put distance between myself and those close to me. It happened so long ago, though, that I don't know if it's worth it to bring that out in the open. At the end of this, I wonder, is my therapist truly my best friend :-/"
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,PANDADA,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"I understand. I didn't have anyone but the internet to cry on either. My immediate coworkers knew we split, but not the details. So it wasn't until we got back together when I shared it with them. Even now, I do not tell them or my family that I still struggle at times.  The thing is, even if trans becomes more normal in society, loved ones will always have emotions about it. I don't think just because you're accepting and supportive of it, and so is society, that you suddenly won't experience any negative emotions anymore. So even if it's not a ""big deal"" in society, I think it will always affect loved ones emotionally on a deep level. Her ideal is that you just say, hey I'm transitioning, and everyone is just like okay, that's cool, nonchalantly and life goes on like nothing changed at all. I just don't see that happening with the majority of people, even if they're ultimately supportive."

This is how I HOPED I'd react. So when the emotions started flooding in on me I was in shock with myself. I felt like I wasn't being fair, even though now I realize it's ridiculous and I'm going to have feelings on the change because it's CHANGE, something will be different, even though my partner will be the same person, physically I'll be getting to know an entirely different landscape."

mypartneristrans,39gfgc,kristendk,2,Sat Jun 13 00:22:17 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense, since things inevitably will be different. I guess it's just my way of adapting to the change, though nothings changed yet it's just been decided on. So I just feel silly being so upset when nothing has changed yet! I'll think about therapy, I'm not big on it. And I am completely open and honest with my partner. In fact he'll probably be reading most of this today as he knows my reddit and I know his. Sometimes talking out loud is really hard for both of us and writing it down is so much easier, but either way we keep the lines of communication wide open!"
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,not_in_kansas_Nymore,3,Thu Jun 11 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"I'll think about therapy, I'm not big on it.    I never was, either. I'd tried it many times in the past to work through various issues, relationships. I found that I was never satisfied with my results. In this instance, though, going to a therapist that has experience with transitioning couples has been such a different experience from my previous attempts at therapy. I don't know if I just struck gold with the therapist, or if it's this specific issue, but she and I have cracked open my whole can of worms and it's been really great. Just food for thought...  :)    It sounds like you are already practicing good communication, which is great. It will help immensely. Your responses indicate that you have a very positive attitude towards transition and are already pretty well educated. There is a lot of talk in this sub about guilt - you already have enough on your plate, don't beat yourself up for it, too. I know it's not that easy, but try to be easier on yourself. You are doing great!"
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,saintartaud,2,Thu Jun 11 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"I'll look into therapy, maybe there's a therapist near by that has dealt with these situations. I'd feel more comfortable with someone who's had other clients dealing with the same life changes.   I'll try not to be so hard on myself, I understand that this is a big change for me too even though I accept and support it, it is still change and a big one at that. I think having this sub and being able to communicate with others and lend my support/experiences etc will help a lot.  Thank you for taking the time to give me some advice! :)"
mypartneristrans,39gfgc,jenlb714,6,Fri Jun 12 18:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'm watching my daughter grow up.  The newborn was gone, and the toddler arrived. Then she was gone and the school girl arrived. Then the junior high student arrived. Soon, she'll be gone too and the high school student will arrive.  Am I sad? Is it scary? Yes, a little. Am I happy? Is it wonderful watching a person becoming themselves? Yes!"
mypartneristrans,39g95l,rosequartzuniverse,12,Thu Jun 11 14:54:48 2015 UTC,"One thing that worries me is how quickly he realized this female identity and made decisions regarding it. In one day he declared that he's a woman and in that same day he decided he wants both top and bottom surgery. (And that's not just my perception of it, he literally told me that he decided on those things yesterday.) Given A's recent breakdown, I wonder how sound his judgement is right now. Is it normal or healthy for someone to realize they're trans that suddenly?   This isn't the first time he's thought about it. And once that dam breaks, it can move very fast. He may be getting a little carried away for the moment, but there's no harm in it and he's not in a position to do anything irreversible for quite a while. As for whether it's normal, he's moving fast but not unheard-of fast.   I always hear stories about people who say they knew they were a boy or girl from the time when they were kids, even when everyone else treated them as the opposite gender.   That's an oversimplified narrative that only applies to a fraction of us.   Do people ever regret decisions like hormone replacement or surgery?   Yes, but it's pretty rare. On the order of a few percent, and that few percent is almost always because of bad results, not because they were 'wrong' about their identity. Genuine error is less than 1%.   And does anyone here have the experience of realizing that they were trans very suddenly as opposed to secretly knowing for years before coming out?   Me. I came home from a perfectly normal day, was curled up in bed and stumbled into a trans group, and realized why I'd been depressed for years all at once. Was by far the most important night of my life to date.   like how our families might react.   A valid fear. But you may be surprised at who is supportive and who isn't.   And will his personality change on hormones?   It can. Think of hormones as basically going through puberty, with all the attendant changes in emotions and body. Core things about him will likely stick around, but superficial details might easily shuffle around.   Will he stop be attracted to me, or women in general?   Possible, but not likely. Around 15-20% of people who report exclusive attraction to women pre-transition report exclusive attraction to men (or none at all) post-hormones. It is significantly more likely that he'll develop/discover (there's considerable debate as to which) some attraction to men, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50-50.   I'm also scared of the possibility of violence against him, as I've read horrible things about how trans women are treated.   A lot of that is heavily over-blown. Like, there's this ""1 in 12 trans women get murdered"" stat that does the rounds every once in a while, and it's just absolute flagrant bullshit - like on the order of 30 times too high even as a lifetime rate. We are disproportionate targets of hate violence to be sure, but hate violence is pretty rare to begin with so the absolute risk is not all that high.  Such things also usually target non-passing trans women, for obvious reasons. He's young enough that good results from hormones are pretty likely, which would enable him to go ""stealth"" (i.e., not be obvious about his status) post-transition if he so chooses."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,Chel_of_the_sea,3,Thu Jun 11 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for replying! I am glad to hear from a trans woman whose experience is more aligned with my partner's.  Also, thank you for pointing out the ""oversimplified narrative"" I mentioned. I think that, as a cis person, oversimplified narratives comprise most of what I know about trans people. I'm going to try to learn more about the varied experiences trans folks have. I've always been a supporter of trans rights but I realize now that I know very little about what it's actually like to be trans."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,Chel_of_the_sea,3,Thu Jun 11 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"I replied before you edited your comment, so I'm going to reply to the rest here!  A and I both identify as bisexual/bicurious though neither of us have ever been with a member of the same sex before. (Though I guess that will change now!) A has always said that he's more attracted to women than men and that he's not sure if he could bring himself to have sex with a man, though I recognize that could change. I know he loves me, but it would be heartbreaking if transitioning left him unable to find me attractive. I do recognize that him pursuing his identity is far more important than our relationship, though. If it comes down to it, I'd rather him be happy with a man than miserable with me.  I didn't realize that the violence was so exaggerated. That makes me feel a little bit better. The thought of anyone hurting A or being cruel to him based on his gender (or for any reason) makes me feel sick."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,Kaeryn88,6,Thu Jun 11 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"If A is bi now, he's very likely to stay that way."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,PANDADA,2,Thu Jun 11 15:49:31 2015 UTC,"I have this same fear, that once my husband transitions that he'll no longer find me attractive. I think it's a pretty normal fear, but as you said I'd rather him be happy with himself and with a man, then unhappy and miserable with me."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,tulips_onthe_summit,3,Thu Jun 11 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"What helped me get over that fear mostly is that most trans people who claim their sexuality changed after HRT tend to be on the younger side (teens/early twenties) anyway and aren't in a serious relationship. I'm not saying I'm not still scared about it, it's still there a little, but I'm not as scared as I used to be once I realized this."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,putmeinthezoo,3,Thu Jun 11 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"A couple of years back, A told me he thought he was non-binary. He said that he didn't feel like a man or a woman and that it caused him a lot of confusion. I remember asking him if he wanted to have surgery and he said no, that he didn't want to be or look like a woman but that he didn't feel fully like a man either.     Others have already made the point, but I thought it might be helpful to hear it several time...the questioning portion of the journey can be long and confusing for our trans partners. They may or may not share much of that journey along the way. I was aware of my partner's gender struggle, but also was told similar things about being happy as a man and not wanting to be a woman. Your partner likely did not lie to you, they have been trying to figure out what this means for them and did not have a complete truth to offer up. Now, it seems, they do. It is likely that they have not only 'realized' that they are trans, but have started to 'accept' it and the implications that has on their future - their need to transition, their relationships, etc...There do seem to be trans people that get laser focused on transition once they've come to this realization, this acceptance, and you may be feeling that now. Regardless, transition is not a fast process. Surgery is likely a long ways off, even if they want it.    You both have other issues to overcome, as well. Your health issues and their self harm are things that need to be addressed. Make sure you keep focusing on what you both need to be healthy, outside of transition. This is a scary time, but there is a community here for you. The more you learn and understand, the less scary things may seem. The more you communicate with your partner, the more you will learn about their thoughts and feelings regarding their trans identity and potential transition. Take time to reflect on your feelings, perhaps seek some therapy (it has been fantastic for me to have individual therapy). Try not to focus on all of the details and the whole picture right now, it helps to break down these things into more manageable pieces and start examining them one by one. Work on it together. Flex your team muscles. I will say that it is tough to debate the merits of HRT when you watch the impact it has on your partner's happiness :)"
mypartneristrans,39g95l,bookwormxx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:35:57 2015 UTC,"This is beautifully put, thank you. I don't believe A lied to me about this. I think he told me when he was ready to. I'm sad that A was struggling through this and I wasn't aware enough to help him through it. Hopefully it will be different as he transitions.  I agree that our other problems need to be dealt with as well, and I'm so hoping that his desire to transition won't hinder the progress he's been making with his anxiety and self-harm. It's something that I plan to discuss with our counselor when A is ready."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,kristendk,3,Thu Jun 11 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"All of your fears are legitimate, and sometimes bad things do happen to trans people. But not everyone has the experiences that you hear about in the news. I'm well over the hill, as my wife of 15 years transitioned 3+ years ago, and frankly, we have had very few problems from the experience. A lot of it has to do with where you live, your religion, ethnicity, what your relationship is with your family, your boss, and your personal resources (financial, educational, interpersonal, and even access to healthcare). The more you have in your favor, the easier transition is.  My experience with older transition is that there's an awful lot of denial and a belief that ""If I just do xyz, these feelings will go away..."" Sometimes it is a problem of not having the language to explain one's feelings, or exposure to others that have similar circumstances. But living your life feeling ""wrong"" can definitely cause anxiety, depression, and self-harm. The popularly quoted statistic, which is several years old and may no longer be accurate for younger generations, is that 41% of transfolk attempt suicide. I can believe it. My wife got along just fine until she hit about 35, when the depression and self-hatred took hold. I never would have guessed it in our 20s, but she could easily have tried harming herself after so many years of finding ways to be ""him.""  Speaking from the other side of transition, not much really changed. I ended up with a happier, more peaceful version of my spouse, who is now a better parent than when she didn't like herself. She didn't change who she was as a person, although she did become more aware of the marginalized people in our society and has become an even bigger advocate now than she was pre-transition.   All I can really suggest is to keep talking. Check locally to see if you have a spouse support group. Don't be disheartened by the marriage collapse statistics - many of those that collapse had issues even without the transition, no different than cisgender couples. Sometimes, marriages don't survive transition specifically due to the transition. But others get on just fine. You're an individual, not a statistic. Only you as a couple can work on your relationship."
mypartneristrans,39g95l,kristendk,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"This was very comforting to read, thank you! I'm glad to hear that your wife is happier and that your family has had few problems. Reading the comments here has overwhelmingly convinced me that transitioning will likely make A a happier person and I am happy to support that.  In terms of resources, we're worried most about A's job and how to pay for hormones/possibly surgery in the future. We're going to look into what the insurance covers after A tells his parents (he's on their healthcare plan). To give you an idea of A's workplace culture, literally every employee of the branch where he works is (or at least appears to be) a straight, white, cis male and several of them use slurs such as the n-word frequently and without consequence. A's boss and coworkers probably won't be super supportive. And in our state, it's actually legal for someone to be discriminated against due to gender identity. :("
mypartneristrans,39g95l,bookwormxx,2,Sat Jun 13 15:19:04 2015 UTC,"My spouse came to the realization that she was trans when she was 30 years old.  She says that she 'felt different' as a kid, but even then she didn't have thoughts like 'I'm a girl' or wishing she was a girl.  She just knew she felt different and couldn't put her finger on exactly what that meant.  She didn't even start experiencing depression or anxiety until about a year before she realized she was trans and always seemed like a perfectly happy and very masculine man.  It was through counseling for said anxiety and depression that she was finally able to understand what was different about her.  It still boggles my mind sometimes, but I think it's hard for someone like me, who has never questioned my gender, to understand.    All that said, I agree that your partner didn't just decide in one day.  When he told you that he felt non-binary, that was likely a starting point of a long internal struggle for him as he tried to figure out who exactly he is.  I would recommend finding a counselor who is knowledgeable about gender issues.  He or she would may be able to help your partner work through all of these thoughts and may even help you to navigate the changes together.  If you feel overwhelmed with the changes, find a separate therapist for you as well.  I had a lot of feelings I didn't want to say to my spouse, because I feared making her feel guilty, so I bottled a lot of those feelings up.  Once I started being able to talk to others about it, I felt so much better."

Wear your left shoe on your right foot and your right shoe on your left foot. Walk around for a while, and try to imagine that you've always worn your shoes on the wrong foot (even back as a newborn and toddler and your parents were dressing you) and you've never had any other experience.  Also imagine that your shoes look correct to the rest of the universe when they're reversed, and they look reversed to the rest of the universe when you actually put them on correctly!  Might the sensation seem ""normal"" because it's your everyday experience, until one day you ask yourself, ""does everyone just put up with this feeling?"""

mypartneristrans,39j0ax,potatosoup12345,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:34:51 2015 UTC,"No, his entire personality will not change. He'll probably just be happier, since he'll have the right hormones for the first time. If you end up not liking him after he starts T then you guys would break up, obviously, and move on. It's OK and allowed if that happens because you're allowed to break up for any reason, at any point at all. Whatever the reason, if you stop liking him so much, it's valid to reassess the relationship.   He's probably not into talking about it because it's all a big unknown and that's stressful enough as it is, without feeling like you have to help someone else process their feelings about it. It's his body, and it's a big personal decision to pursue medical transition - and if he wants to take a break from talking or thinking about that for a while and just hang out with you, let him do that.  If you google FTM trans timeline you'll see what you'll be able to expect as far as visible changes. There are blogs by trans men also that talk about their transition experiences, check those out."

I'm so sorry for the anxiety you have about coming out to your family. If it makes you feel any less alone - I am also terrified of this event. I know to expect a negative reaction (although I will continue to maintain a small amount of optimism - that's just me). It's a hard thing to anticipate. I'm trying to understand that it took me a long time to get to where I'm at with transition and the changes that are happening in my life - it's only natural that it might be the same way with others.

Of course no one likes to know a marriage is ending, but we all wish the best for everyone and if you and/or your spouse will no longer be happy in your marriage this way, then divorce is the best choice for you. But ""best"" is used loosely because divorce is incredibly difficult and painful regardless. I came so close to it and don't wish it upon anyone. I do think there are some trans people that may project their feelings of rejection onto others who are not staying with their spouse because they're still coping with the end of their marriage/relationship, but it's not fair. I don't doubt that you didn't try, as you didn't immediately run away and gave everything a lot of consideration. So don't blame yourself or listen to those who tell you otherwise.  I can't give you advice really. I told my parents over the phone about my wife, but that was when we were separating. My parents just wanted me to be happy, so I would hope that's what your parents want for you too. I know my mom (maybe my dad too) had some hesitation about us getting back together because she was afraid I'd just get hurt again. Honestly, so was/am I. In the end you can only do what's best for you, and only you can know what that is. hugs"

Sometimes the happy ending is a recognition that a relationship has come to the end of the road, and that it's time for those in it to walk separate paths.

Yours sounds like it's gone a lot better than most. She was upset, and bitter and I wanted to push ahead with things. We weren't terribly happy as a couple at that point, but separation was still difficult for us.  Family, it turns out, helped her very much. It was a mixed bag for me. Some were super supportive (and still  are) Some didn't care, and a few I don't talk to anymore. For her, they were very loving, and helped her a lot. Even were understanding (if a little put off) of my chosen direction.  I think, because of the nature of your split, your parents my be dismayed, but understanding, and certainly caring.

The only thing that made it better was getting it done and over with. Once it was done, it felt like a huge weight had been lifted from our shoulders.   Her parents, which we thought would cut off communications with us, have so far been supportive. They weren't thrilled and are very confused, but peoples' reactions can surprise you. My parents freaked out and we aren't really talking, but that has more to do with my mom trying to guilt me back into the closet.  Whatever their reaction will be, you are getting the truth out, and that will make you feel better."
mypartneristrans,39dtb1,Kaeryn88,3,Thu Jun 11 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way you do about this sub sometimes.  Because of that, I try to make a point to comment and show support to those who are experiencing feelings of uncertainty and/or sadness to let them know that they are not alone and that they have every right to be their true selves just like their partners do.  ETA: I find most here to be supportive and understanding, but I also think that occasionally there are posts from people who don't seem to understand that every situation is different.  You don't need to justify your divorce to anyone, not even your parents really, but of course they will have questions and be concerned with your happiness.  You have a right to answer only the questions you feel comfortable answering and tell them that some things are too personal to discuss.  I have done that with both my parents and my spouse's dad.    I agree with others who have said that you will probably feel better once you do talk to your parents and get the truth out, and hopefully they will be another source of support for you while you are going through the difficult time of separating.  Good luck!"
mypartneristrans,39dtb1,not_in_kansas_Nymore,3,Thu Jun 11 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize for seeking comfort, or advice from people going through the same things or similar. Divorce is hard, and it's better for that to happen and you both have a chance to be happy with yourselves then to stay together and one or both partners be miserable. What is right for one person isn't always right for another.  As for coming out to your parents,I don't have much advice. I told my Mom my partner was Transgender when I was 14 and it's not been mentioned since (almost 14 years later)."
mypartneristrans,39dtb1,bookwormxx,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"Many MANY supportive thoughts to you! And a wall of text ...   I think this subreddit is for sharing ALL parts of what it's like to have a trans partner. I see you're getting a lot of support here already and that's great. The early downvotes might have been a robot thing.   Since you want to have kids, and know you're not lesbian, I agree that this decision sound right for you AND is truly supporting your partner. You love her and you know this marriage doesn't meet either of your needs any more. In fact it sounds like you're being the tough one, making things start to happen ""at last"".  I was the cis partner coming out to my own parents. My situation was a bit different, but based on my experience: YOUR PARENTS WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT and they want you to be happy. If you explain that these changes will ultimately make you and your partner both happier then that's how they will get behind it. Also I bet they'll be thrilled that the ""announcement"" is not a life threatening illness but something that will leave you (especially) standing up ready to move forward. WITH YOU they will grieve the imminent ending of your marriage and the dreams you two had together, but it'll also be a relief that it's ending for something like this and not because you didn't work hard enough, live up to your vows, etc.  It will comfort them to know there is something they can do (even if it's just being a sounding board that you can vent to). So be sure to say, ""Here's what you two could really do for me / us ... "" They can study the subject (beyond Vanity Fair) and maybe help you look for a new place.  [I've also told them about two divorces, one they were sad about and one they were beyond ecstatic about ... they have kept their marriage together for almost 60 years but they were really helpful and supportive anyway. ""You did your best,"" is what my mom keeps saying that comforts me most. Except my best wasn't that good! But once you have kids, and I HOPE YOU WILL (you're fighting for those kids right now), you'll understand that emotionally healthy parents just want their kids to be safe and happy, bottom line.]  The most fraught part of this is that it sounds as if your partner is CLEAR about being trans, but has many many fears. I am myself ""probably trans but have done almost nothing about that"" and lots of us wrestle with fear. (Yes, I came here because my partner is trans, but the whole thing made me take a look at myself. I'm out to partner and parents and have done some counseling and clothes shopping :).)    I know your partner is IN AGONY. And may be in agony for awhile. My experience with lots of kinds of ""coming out"" is that other people are less of a problem than I myself am. Yes, discrimination is a thing, but due to internalized homophobia and transphobia, I built it up to be a bigger thing than it was, or rather, it wasn't anywhere as big as MY fear, which was the size of the Midwestern sky, horizon to horizon. So this is something that only SHE can grapple with, and you putting your life on hold just doesn't sound healthy to me.  If it was me, I'd tell my friends we are separating immediately. ""It's my choice, I'd like to keep my reasons private right now while I'm going through it, would you please help me find a place to live?""  OF COURSE sex has come back, because your partner feels authentically ""seen"" and known and real, at least to you, and that generally makes a person feel sexy. My partner felt that, but also felt that using the wrong-feeling genitals made the dysphoria worse ... yes I went on the long trip through surgery and recovery and becoming orgasmic again and ... if you are not attracted to your partner's true gender, that would be very very hard. (It's been hard WITH attraction.)   Again, lots of support for this difficult but lucidly clear choice you have made. You will both be in my thoughts and prayers."

mypartneristrans,398twl,SleepNowMyThrowaway,2,Wed Jun 10 03:52:45 2015 UTC,Do you know what the effects of stopping hormones would be? I would assume similar to menopause. I'm hoping that changes to brain chemistry could be reversed.
mypartneristrans,398twl,DigitalGarden,6,Wed Jun 10 04:07:02 2015 UTC,"It can be reversed.    Effects? From a partner's point of view:  Tiredness, hot flashes, bitchiness, low libido."
mypartneristrans,398twl,DigitalGarden,5,Wed Jun 10 05:09:37 2015 UTC,"Tiredness, libido, malaise, all check. I just don't know why she felt like there wasn't enough of a change when going off mess to do something about it without me pestering her.   Edit: I forgot to ask, is it possible for a dosage of estrogen to become less effective over time, like with a drug, and need to be increased?"
mypartneristrans,398twl,SleepNowMyThrowaway,3,Wed Jun 10 06:33:45 2015 UTC,Yes. Also can be necessary to fight with docs over increasing dose.  Don't let them badger you.

On the long-term, she could get osteoporosis, changes in cholesterol levels and even a greater risk at heart diseases (just google for ""long-term effects lack estrogen""). Sex hormones are used in a lot of organs, by not taking them for a long time she could really damage her body :s I hope you can convince her to start taking them again asap."

I guess she's trying to find a doctor who will prescribe pellets so she doesn't have to remember. She's concerned that stopping and starting due to forgetting to take meds will be worse health-wise than just not taking them until she can get back on full time.

mypartneristrans,396ex5,Teadgh,3,Tue Jun 9 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"My spouse is 5 months into HRT and is more emotional.  Overall, she's happier and seems more at ease, but she also has times when she sulks or gets moody.  She seems a more sensitive about things that in the past she would have just brushed off, but I'm not sure if that's because she was putting on a tough guy fa√ßade in the past or if she really has changed.  She seems to be more patient, which I think stems from feeling less irritable.  I think her sense of humor has changed a little bit, less sarcastic maybe."
mypartneristrans,396ex5,bookwormxx,5,Tue Jun 9 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it has. Not like a revolution, more like an evolution. Like everyone else has said, she is definitely happier and more at ease. She used to liken dysphoria to a hive of bees buzzing around in her mind and when she first began HRT, she was amazed...""The bees are gone"" she would tell me incredulously. This is such a happy thing for both of us :)    I wasn't so much worried that my spouse would become a stranger, I was more worried that they would become a woman I didn't like. The more I get to know her, the more I like her and the more I fall in love with her. She is different, but she is still very much the same. It's quite hard to explain.    What I've learned is that when people say communication is the key, they really mean it. I tend to be a conflict avoider, a 'pleaser' which leads me to push my feelings down a lot and bury them until they build into something that makes me explode. That will not work in transition. I have had to learn to communicate my feelings about everything, right away, before it blossoms into something that can't be overcome. In this way, I'm sure my changes have contributed to our improved communication just as much as the changes that being on HRT have made to my partner.    These changes were so very intimidating to me when they were on the horizon, but when happening in reality, they feel very manageable. Much of the stress of this whole transition has been about the unknown and each time we get to the next new place, it's like, 'Oh, ok, we can totally do this.' and we grab each other's hand and walk forward.    If you approach it in the right way, it may be an opportunity for you and your partner to let go of some baggage from the past (assuming you have any) We've cleared out entire warehouses, it seems :)"
mypartneristrans,396ex5,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Tue Jun 9 21:48:24 2015 UTC,Not really. She's more confident and happy. Also more emotional. But other than that she's pretty much the same. She's been on HRT since October.
mypartneristrans,396ex5,PANDADA,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to agree with the other comments here that her demeanor changed more than her personality. She was happier, more outgoing, less moody in social contexts. This was all before we started dating, but all of our friends said the same thing. She was a much more pleasant person to be around post-transition. I most likely wouldn't have been romantically interested in her before transitioning, because she would have been a shitty boyfriend.  Her main interests didn't change, but she added a few new ones. She got into collecting shoes. She started going to concerts. After several years, she dropped some of the girly stuff and is now happy wearing jeans, t-shirts and toeshoes on a daily basis. She's basically the same person, but a lot happier."
mypartneristrans,396ex5,brotkel,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"The only real change I have seen during my wife's transition is the amount of depression/happiness. When she is presenting female, she is super happy and more outgoing and fun. When she is presenting male (not by choice but because of her job), she is always depressed and sad, irritable and just angry, and she doesn't want to do much of anything. The biggest change that has occurred and only happens on occasion (not every day) is that she seems jealous of me for being female. She's super impatient with her transition. She wants to be a woman now! Otherwise, she is the same person. Still likes computers (but more of a hobby than for work like she does right now), still games and listens to music. She seems more attracted to me and more in tune with her feelings and definitely more willing to share.   Not sure what you are going through but if you are worried that things are changing between you two for the worse, you need to talk to them. If you don't talk about it, things will just continue to get worse and it might end up destroying your relationship when it could have been saved by simply having a conversation."
mypartneristrans,391pze,user3924835,6,Mon Jun 8 16:45:50 2015 UTC,I'm FtM but my SO has been in the same boat as you. I felt guilty for feeling like I ruined things for him because he couldn't just be with a normal girl. Most times I kept thinking why couldn't I have figured out myself before dragging someone else into this mess without them knowing? The biggest thing for us is just continuing to be open and communicate about everything - that's really brought us a LOT closer. I've stopped feeling guilty now because of how supportive I've seen him continue to be. It makes me feel like he was put in my life for a reason and maybe he was meant to be in my life to be the one to help me through this and have my back if no-one else does.
mypartneristrans,391pze,twinCitiesClone,2,Mon Jun 8 17:07:32 2015 UTC,"Aw, that is super sweet to hear and I'm glad things are going well for you two. :) I really do think this is the best thing that could have happened for us as a couple, and I'm looking forward to it bringing us closer. I definitely am trying to keep an open line of communication; right now I can tell she is hesitant of overwhelming me and I'm hoping soon she'll see that I want to be with her through this."
mypartneristrans,391pze,twinCitiesClone,3,Mon Jun 8 17:18:56 2015 UTC,I think that's a problem for us too - there is just so much information out there and I'm still trying to figure myself out too so I find myself spending a lot of time looking at things online. I sometimes don't share it all with him for fear of overwhelming him with too much information at once. I actually enjoy when he brings up anything related to transitioning - it makes me feel like he actually cares and wants to be involved. It kind of gives me an opening to bring up anything I've found when researching and wanted to share or bring up but felt scared he'd be freaked out or too overwhelmed to discuss.
mypartneristrans,391pze,originalme1,3,Mon Jun 8 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"Just continually show her that you're committed to her, you love her, and really want to make it work.

I can't control her reactions to my feelings, but I'm not going to bottle up my feelings because of the way she reacts. I don't even tell her I wish she wasn't transitioning or anything like that. It's just when I express my own struggles or how I'm trying to cope with the changes.   I don't know what to say or do other than tell her if I truly didn't want to be with her I wouldn't."
mypartneristrans,38wklj,Mtfsothrowaway,13,Sun Jun 7 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"You are not selfish, you are human. Let's get that out of the way first and foremost. When my spouse told me, I grieved too. I didn't want to... I felt like I wasn't being supportive if I cried over the thought that they wouldn't be the same, that I was losing someone that I loved. You are allowed to grieve and you are allowed time to adjust and accept the way your lives are shifting. You need to grieve that way you can adapt to changing the color of the love you have for them in your heart. I know that sounds stupid but the way I see it (I have to look at it this way or I fall apart) is like this... Say the color of the love for them is, I don't know, yellow. Now they're changing, and while they change, your love for them changes. You begin to love them for the new mannerisms, physical changes, etc. And it's a new color. You're not losing the yellow that was there, red is just getting added to it. You can slowly see the color changing from yellow, to pale orange, to a vibrant red orange until one day, it's vermillion and you don't have to wonder where the yellow went. It's still there and will always be a part of this new color because you never could have found the vermillion without the yellow having been there in the first place.  As for the grief, sometimes you can't hide it. Communicate. You can't ever let the lines of communication break down. Let them know that you love them and want to stay but you need time to process everything. Just like their transition can't happen overnight, neither can yours. Let them know that if you cry it's because you're going through an emotional shift too. Love each other, be there for each other, and talk to each other. Try to be as involved as you can. My spouse came out to me last August. It'll be a year soon and in a way, I'm still coming to terms. But it does get easier and the rough patches do smooth out. It just takes time, and if you ever need anything, you also have this community. You are loved."

But on the flip side, I'm sure she hates that you're hurting too. Unfortunately at first everyone hurts, I'm talking you and her. No way to avoid it, it's like ripping off a really stuck on band aid. Once the initial sting is gone, you can start focusing on getting things to heal. (holy shit I'm super deep today!) Unless you actively say, 'screw this, screw you, I'm done and I'm not supporting shit', you're fine, and if you're worrying about it then you're supportive because you still care about them.

But if you can find someone outside the relationship to talk to it will help, and maybe take some of the pressure off of the relationship.  But feeling ashamed of these feelings won't help you at all. It's normal and valid and ok and you need to take care of yourself too.   I felt very alone when I went through this myself, both before she came out, when I literally couldn't talk to anyone, and then after when almost everyone was super supportive of her changes and I still felt like I couldn't talk to anyone. I didn't want to be a voice of dissent when she was getting nothing but love.  I remember having a good moment early on when she was shaving her beard. I burst into tears and said 'but I'm gonna miss it' and she said she would too, and I felt like for a moment there was a space for me to be mourning loss without being unsupportive of the future.  I think having that space to be sad about the changes and the things you'll lose is important. I think the struggles we go through are mostly underestimated or overlooked by onlookers like friends and family and it's important for yourself and your relationship to process this stuff all the way through or else you will resent her for it."

Educating proud liberals about the word 'transvestite' and what that specifically implies...  It's those little things... things like that... the little ignorant jabs from the well-meaning that can be... exhausting.  I am still grateful to have a life where I can be burdened with a dozen tiny irritations rather than having to fight a war. I see the big problems happening out there, and in other families... and it makes me ashamed to even complain about the 'little things'.   But I think we should sometimes. If that makes sense.

I totally get what you mean about educating the well meaning liberals and how irksome it becomes which is why I think it's something you have to decide on the fly depending on your emotional state. You can try to be the Great Trans Educator, but I think it's most important first of all to take care of your own mental health and that way you'll be much better at making your point when you do decide it's worth your time."
mypartneristrans,38y074,WeirdTransgirl,10,Sun Jun 7 20:22:39 2015 UTC,"Listen, your boyfriend knows who you are, and chose to be with you. Give him his own agency! He is a free person who can date who he wants, and he wants to date you.   All the things you list as possible negatives are also possible positives. There is nothing wrong with you, and he sees that. He sees that are are worthy of love and it's because you are.   You've only been dating a month! Maybe he wants to adopt one day. Maybe he doesn't want kids. These are not things you have to worry about yet. Regardless, your boyfriend knows the reality of who you are and chose to date you.   Even if this relationship doesn't work out in the end, it's not because you don't deserve a relationship or because someone different than you is better. There will always be people who love you for YOU!"
mypartneristrans,38y074,Gallifreyan_fez,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:11:42 2015 UTC,Thank you. These thoughts are really irritating but like you said he's with me because he wants to be. I just have to remind myself of that whenever I have doubts.
mypartneristrans,38y074,sparksflyup2,3,Sun Jun 7 23:08:39 2015 UTC,"Why are you deciding on your partners behalf what they deserve in a partner?   This person, knowing who they are and knowing who you are has decided that right now and for the foreseeable future YOU make him happy. The best way to love him and give him what he ""deserves"" is to continue being yourself.   In the beginning we usually fall for the people we see on the outside, who they are appearing to be. But relationships are built on things like love, trust, a bond that is not entirely dependent on the things you are worried about.   If you both want this relationship, are willing to work on it everything else like your infertility will end up being issues you resolve together.  Keep hope."
mypartneristrans,38y074,SphirosOKelli,2,Mon Jun 8 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"To address the child fears, there are ways for you two to have kids. It isn't unheard of to use a surrogate mother if there is a desire to have children that are biologically related to you. I'm uncertain how hormones work with sperm - I confess I haven't researched it - but I would suspect that there might be some way for you to be biologically related to a child if you are pre-op as well.  I have been with my partner for almost 2 years before I realized that I was ftm... So I feel you on the ""how do I even deserve this person in my life"". But the bottom line is - you DO deserve to have someone in your life that makes you happy. And your life is now. Now it is time for you to learn to embrace your own happiness - especially if the guy you are dating is aware and accepting of your transition. hugs"
mypartneristrans,38y074,Luhdk,2,Sun Jun 7 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"I get this sentiment from my partner sometimes. I do my best to combat it. I think there are 2 things it is important you remember: 1. this feeling isnt specifically a trans condition- though aggravated by it, it boils down to self esteem and self worth and those are both things you have the power to work on all by yourself. 2. your SO is with you because they choose to. and that's wonderful. It means that he has taken in all the things that come with dating you and decided 'this person is worth it to me. I want to be with her more than I want to not deal with all this extra crap."" and that is a wonderful thing. You have no need to feel guilty. It is his choice to make, and he made it."
mypartneristrans,38y074,jenlb714,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with Gallifreyan_fez, he is with you because he wants to be. If he felt burdened by your secret, he wouldn't be with you. Yes he deserves to be happy but so do you! There are plenty of ways to give him what you think he deserves. Just because you can't birth children, doesn't mean that adoption isn't a possibility, or even surrogacy. And like Gallifreyan_fez, maybe he doesn't even want kids or at least anytime soon. You have time, you are young. Enjoy your relationship and your happiness. Don't pressure yourself or hurt yourself emotionally by thinking you don't deserve to be happy and with him!"
mypartneristrans,38y8da,Rrroxy,2,Sun Jun 7 21:26:03 2015 UTC,"Believe me when I say that I can relate to your situation, a few months ago I was in the exact same spot when it came to coming out to my own parents about my partner, and somewhat myself (closet female-leaning bisexual for years). When we first started planning on telling my parents, I was terrified. I too have the highly conservative extended family, my own parents are also fairly conservative- they were never the ""stand on the street corner with a sign that says 'God hates gays'"" sort, but due to their religious beliefs they have said they don't agree with homosexuality, but it isn't their place to judge anyone about it.  We decided that in our case it would be better if my parents heard from me about it, so I told just my mom over a phone conversation so she could relay it to my dad. It actually went way better than I had ever expected, my parents aren't suddenly LGBT advocates, and there are some aspects of it that they have a hard time grasping, but they have said that they still love me, and they still love my spouse, and that they will always be there for us. It hasn't been easy, but it's getting better all the time. My mother in particular seems to be more supportive (my dad was always the more conservative one of them), she sent my wife a personalized coffee mug for her birthday last month, with her preferred name on it, and almost always uses the correct pronouns in conversation.  So, yes, this part of it is probably the scariest, but at least in my own situation I likened coming out to ripping off a bandaid, I felt so much better after it was over. I had gotten tired of rainbow-wallpapered closets, and it felt good to not have to hide anymore. As for how specifically you come out to them, that's for you and your partner to decide, you should do whatever would be most comfortable for you. Face-to-face or a phone call if you're wanting to face the problem head-on, but emails and letters are also a viable option, being able to better plan your words gets the intended message across without having to worry about an emotionally-charged conversation.  Best of luck to you, I hope I was able to help somewhat."
mypartneristrans,38y8da,omgitsjackattack,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:39:28 2015 UTC,"I sent my parents and siblings all letters. It was easier and less stressful than having to say everything over the phone or in person. I actually based my letter on my SO's coming out letter for her parents and siblings, because it already summed up a lot of the details I would have wanted. Plus, her father said that it was a good letter and really helped him understand everything, so I figured why reinvent the wheel?    I also put off writing/sending the letter for months, it was causing me so much anxiety. My family's probably more liberal than yours, they're not terribly religious (cafeteria or lapsed Catholics at best), and part of me felt like acceptance/support wouldn't be too difficult. But you always try to predict the worst (especially when you're prone to anxiety) and I did figure at least a couple people were gonna be uncomfortable with it and feared the impact that might have. They did, but it was manageable and things are improving.  Giving your parents resources to learn more will go a long way to better educating them. I think I included a link to the PFLAG transgender pamphlet, which is a good one for the kind of aucience you're trying to reach.  I think if you just work on talking to your parents first and ensuring that support, dealing with the rest of the family know will be easier. If your mother is the kind of person who has poor boundaries with family and caves into their influence, that'll probably wind up creating problems. But it's also possible that she grows a backbone if her family starts shaming you and your partner, and it's easier to do that when she's had more time to get used to everything and accept it. Might help to let her know of your concerns with their influence on her, etc."
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,happywithus,14,Sun Jun 7 05:11:42 2015 UTC,"This is an immensely personal and hard time for her. But thats not an excuse to be a terrible person.  Don't let her get away with it. This effects you too, to a very large degree and you deserve to be happy just like her.   Be frank. Tell her youre not happy. Tell her you need couples counseling. You don't have to do this alone. Talk to her family. Have an intervention.   But the bottom line is, she's changing. A lot of people say that when someone transitions that they are still the same person on the inside, and for the most part that's true, but everyone changes at least a little andsome people, some people change everything and become unrecognizable as the person that you loved.   Be prepared for the worst, that if this continues to be an unhealthy relationship for you, to jump ship. Your happiness is worth just as much as hers"
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,SphirosOKelli,7,Sun Jun 7 06:41:41 2015 UTC,Came here to say basically this. Being trans is no excuse for being a bad partner etc.    Its ok to walk away if you need to for your happiness.
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,Nisengo,2,Sun Jun 7 12:36:23 2015 UTC,"We will be going to marriage counseling. Our first session is this week.  She's knows I'm not happy, though at this point, what I've been getting from her through this whole transition is a ""Well it sucks you're unhappy, but I am the happiest I've ever been and so far away that none of your sadness can touch me""  I don't want her to feel sad, or bad, but at this point, I would take anything if it meant that she gave a shit about something other than herself...If not me, then at least my children.   I have talked to her family. They are very upset with her, and none of them are talking to her besides one of her brothers. They are very hurt by her behavior and lack of empathy. I've urged her to talk to them, to try to apologize and fix things with them, but she refuses because she doesnt care.  ""A lot of people say that when someone transitions that they are still the same person on the inside, and for the most part that's true, but everyone changes at least a little and some people, some people change everything and become unrecognizable as the person that you loved.""  You're so right about that. All of the little things I loved about this person are going away. It's not the slow kind of fading where you can brace yourself for what's happening next, it's more of a ""now you see me, now you don't!!"" and I don't know how to handle it well. She doesn't give me any time to breathe and brace myself.   I'm terrified that they'll become unrecognizable."
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,Nisengo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I hope that you two get through it. I hope she realizes that her happiness doesn't have to cause other people unhappiness and that if your happiness is causing unhappiness, then it isn't real happiness.  I hope you stay together because you seem like that's what you want. But just, if walking away is what's best for you and your kids even, don't be afraid to take that option."
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,Nisengo,4,Mon Jun 8 17:34:22 2015 UTC,"No recommendations here. You put it perfectly when you said, ""she's married to her transition."" I feel your pain. I've been there and am still trying to figure out how to move forward. hug"
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,stainedblueglass,2,Sun Jun 7 15:45:08 2015 UTC,Do you have any advice for me on moving forward? Is there anything you have been doing that helps?
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,glasswings,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:34:07 2015 UTC,I think once I move out it will help me with moving on. I've finally scheduled another appointment with a counselor. Last time I went was in November. I'm hoping therapy will help.
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,amyl_and_disco,3,Tue Jun 9 07:45:06 2015 UTC,"I worry everyday that my partner will feel this way... I am so sorry that your wife has sprung forward and she should never have gone behind your back.  Your feelings and needs are just as valid as hers are, but I think maybe it can be easy to forget that someone is hurting when you are on this path. I know for me that steps forward in my transition are almost like being high - I feel SO happy and SO exhilarated, its hard to come down from that feeling and return to reality where I have my partner crying because she thinks that I am going to turn into a gross abusive lumberjack...   We are moving past that part but only because we are both willing to discuss this. If your partner isn't willing to even talk about it my suggestion would be to ask her to go to therapy with you where there is a little more accountability, a little more pressure to sit down and consider the needs of the other.   We are all rooting for you two, and I hope that things settle quickly for you."
mypartneristrans,38vlzj,Sarahjan,4,Sun Jun 7 22:50:25 2015 UTC,"Speaking as the trans person in my marriage, I have to confess that this is exactly how I went into my transition. I rushed in without regard for my environment too. There was sooo much energy pent up over the last 19 years that I just had to get it all out.   That said, it is vitally important that your spouse slows down. She should be allowed to run with it a bit, but she should also see that you have massive troubles keeping up. This will require a lot of communication.  My wife had pretty much spent two weeks crying over what I was doing to myself, her and our marriage. It was only with counseling and many, many nights of crying on our pillows that we could reach a plateau where I could find enough space to slow down.  If she's up for it, get some marriage counseling, and talk. Talk about your feelings, your hopes, how she has destroyed your future together (If she cares for you at all she'll want to give you a new one, depend on that) and most of all, accept your emotions and make them clear to her.  What really helped us was the knowledge and our explicit affirmations that we want our marriage to work, and that we'd work on it together. If you can get her and yourself to find the will to continue together, you'll be just fine.  Finally, if she is not open to your input at all and won't slow down, I'm afraid that your marriage may be a lost cause. It hurts me to say it, but a one-sided relationship is not a relationship, really. And your happiness counts every bit as much as hers."
mypartneristrans,38u43w,SphirosOKelli,5,Sat Jun 6 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad you're making some head way there. I would must say make sure you're there to listen to her too. Let her talk to you about her fears and concerns, even if it hurts. Let her talk about her own struggles through this transition. We know our trans partners need a lot of support, but sometimes so do we. It can be hard to keep that balance."
mypartneristrans,38u43w,PANDADA,5,Sat Jun 6 23:31:13 2015 UTC,"When we talked later this afternoon she apologized again for going off. I made sure to tell her that I wasn't mad, or even upset, that she felt that way and that I wanted her to feel free to tell me how she felt. She's my partner ya know? I'm so ready for us to go back to just being us... I think we both know that there are going to be more bumps in the road during the transition, but seriously if we can get through this I am marrying her... I love the crap out of that woman...."
mypartneristrans,38u43w,RainbowPinata,3,Sun Jun 7 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"I can tell you what not to do here, because it's what my partner did to me when I expressed concerns about having to present as straight. He told me that I shouldn't be upset because he has to change the way he labels his sexuality, too. He said that I could just call myself queer. He asked why I care what other people think. He said that if I have that big of a problem being seen as straight, we need to just end this relationship now because it's not going to work. So yeah ... don't do any of those things. It belittles and minimizes what your partner is feeling, and speaking from personal experience, it will only make her resentful.    I love being a lesbian. I fought hard for this identity and I'm proud of it. To be honest, there isn't much that I like about men -- cisgender men, anyway. I don't have much experience with trans men. It's going to take me a while to come around to this idea, and some of the feelings I have about it aren't going to be pretty. I imagine your partner feels the same way. It's a big deal to have to change your identity, and to know that you can't identify as a lesbian without outing your partner. That's a tough spot to be in.    It sounds like you're doing the right thing by listening to her and supporting her. She might say some hurtful things, but please resist the urge to minimize her experience. (By all means, though, if she's being unfair you should definitely call her on that.) This is a big change for all involved, and we all need lots of love and support -- partners included.    If your partner ever hops on Reddit, please tell her to look me up! You can also feel free to PM me anytime if you need a partner's perspective on something. :)"
mypartneristrans,38u43w,RainbowPinata,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:41:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! We had that talk, briefly, where she said ""how can I be a lesbian if I am dating a guy?"" I told her that my trans identity did not, in my eyes, take away from the fact that she was a lesbian, and that she would always be my lesbian. When all of this is said and done I suspect that I will fall into more of an ""intersex"" category, though I'm uncertain how all of that works... I wish I knew more trans guys here who were in relationships with other lesbians so she could see successful relationships more tangibly.  Recently I ensured that she knew that I have no issue with her discussing this with her friends, and that seems to have helped. She brought up that her straight friend even told her that I was worth holding onto, even with me being trans. (I have got to go thank that woman...) And that seemed to help because my partner brought the topic up to me with some more ""imma love you anyways"".   God... if she stays with me I don't even know how I'm going to repay her... Like I'm trying not to lay it on too thick because I don't want her to feel obligated or anything but I just wanted to spoil the crap out of her right now..."

Sometimes people just don't know what jokes go too far, and sometimes they use humor as a justifiable medium for their hate. I think you're doing a good thing, trying to help others understand what a joke can mean and how hurtful it can be.  Maybe you can find solidarity and comfort in my experience. I haven't had jokes made in open places where people can be held responsible for what they say, but I've been dealing with sick jokes and fierce hate on Yik-Yak (anonymous university posting platform thingie), where people can hide behind anonymity. My Facebook feed is filled with people either trying to be supportive and understanding of Caitlyn, or moralizing and calling her Bruce. I haven't recently had to confront anyone, but I'm not shy about wanting people to respect the dignity of trans persons as human beings, even if they disagree with transitioning. It's a struggle. Keep it up <3 (For context, I attend an extremely conservative Catholic university, and I'm trans, and I've been publicly out for a while. I really appreciate your mindset.)"

I have gone off on a few ""friends of friends"" commenting on the mutual friends status. It wasn't pretty. I was pissed. Probably didn't go about it in the best way but I was SO ANGRY. I couldn't help myself.    Generally though, poking fun is different than blatant hatred. Your friends might act differently if they knew someone who was trans or if they knew about you and your partner. Not saying you should tell them, but when people you care about fall into a group you've previously criticised or made fun of, it makes you change your tune.. If you are a good person that is.

People in the trans community who leap to calling you a bigot and leap to instantly trying to disqualify you because you arent a certified trans authority in their eyes can suck a big fat one.

She posted online about how people who don't understand the situation need to stop being ""supportive"" because she knows they're not REALLLY being supportive, but rather following the crowd and talking about Caitlyn.  She puts herself on this pedestal because of her sexual orientation (pansexual).  She bitches and moans on a regular basis about people not understanding the trans community, and that there needs to be more awareness...

The hospital she was in had a very generous visitation schedule (12-1 & 6-8 daily & 12-8 sat & sun) so someone (mostly me) in her support system went to visit almost every day. Her biological family is in Ohio (we are in Minnesota) & they didn't even try to come visit her.   I told her in the ER she had to open up & be honest with her team. She didn't want to talk about anything. Said she'd try to kill herself again in a heartbeat if given the opportunity. They gave her the option of voluntary check in or involuntary. She chose to voluntarily check herself in. What she didn't know was she couldn't just check out. She had hoops to jump through.   Because I stuck by her, visited almost daily, showed her support, etc, she realized pretty quickly I/we acted out of love/caring & forgave me for getting her hospitalized. She now knows it was the best thing for her.   Keep your chin up. You are under a lot of stress right now. Make sure you are taking care of yourself. Hugs! Let me know if I can help in any way."

The other one spoke over her and rushed her out without really understanding her circumstances that led to her taking all those pills. I honestly don't think someone like that should be working with intensive patients. She also called my girlfriend a liar. So... There's another really unhelpful thing to say.  I really hope that if she opens up, it will not only help her get out faster, but will also genuinely be cathartic for her. She wants to exercise there, but they don't allow it, which truly hurts their patients. Exercise can be more beneficial than SSRIs in some cases. Also, it isn't a holistic approach like they claim if it doesn't offer fitness as well.   The visiting policy where your loved one was staying seems far more reasonable to me than twice a week. :/"

There's one worse feeling than the feeling you have right before you decide to end your life. And that is waking up in a psych ward restrained, because you have failed to even kill yourself. That is total failure. That is the lowest low. No freedom, no clothes, no shoes, no booze, no cigarettes... every single thing that might comfort you a little in that horrible moment is gone. All you have is the beeping of the machine, some nurses prattling about the television show they watched. You have the taste of medicine and carbon and vomit in your mouth from when they pumped your stomach. If you beg, you might be granted a half cup of water and some saltines. The nurses all gather and stand in silence and watch you eat the crusty flavorless wafers. They then remove the napkin and cup, and it hits you- using a plastic cup unsupervised is a privilege you have definitely lost in the time between passing out and waking up. They begin to explain that you will be staying here, they outline the rules. No clothes with drawstrings, no being alone. No going outside. Group is mandatory, it is in the morning, 8 AM daily. They are working to assign you a room. Your attention falls to the faint haunting sounds of other people who are confused, psychotic, or in agony moaning or screaming intermittently in the background. What time is it? Is it day or night? You look for a window anywhere in your line of sight. There are no windows. You look for a watch. Not a single person is wearing a watch, or jewelry of any kind for that matter. The nurse takes your blood pressure and then 2 more whisk the machine away to a presumably locked safe place. Everything is a weapon here. You miss your plastic cup. You wish you could have it back- just to hold it, just to feel normal, just to be a person who can have a plastic cup again. You realize your heart rate has increased because the machine announces it to the room like a teacher reading your intercepted love letter aloud to the class: Beep. Beep. Beep. You are afraid. And pissed. You have failed to obtain peace on your terms. This is the opposite of peace. You have never been this thirsty before; but you don't dare ask for water, because you can't bear to watch them take the small plastic cup away from you again. It doesn't hold more than a mouthful of water anyway. Fuck. You want a bottle of water more than anything in the world. Tears well up in your eyes just thinking about it. The nurses resume talking about reality TV. To them this is just another day at work. A young girl screams in the distance- her voice is like a slaughtered animal. It sounds as if someone were cutting off her toe with a dull knife.  Your feet are cold. These blankets are terrible. Your dry tongue feels like beef jerky in your mouth. You are alone. You need a hug so badly you feel like it might actually physically kill you in this moment. This is the worst moment of your life.  Beep. Beep. Beep.  So, there you have it, some perspective on what it really feels like to find yourself in that place. I have been there, and it sucks.  *Now, in retrospect, I can tell you that time to dry out and be forced to go to idiotic group and work through my issues definitely saved my life- let me assure you that taking that many benzos IS a serious attempt, VERY serious, and the note just confirms it. *  The ones who really want to die tend to be the calmest- they say anything just to get out of there and try again. Your SO sounds like shes either trying to do that, or really is that deep in denial. She obviously hasn't learned to ""play the game"" yet if shes insisting that wasn't a serious attempt. that means that she still belongs there, and that is her best shot at life, sadly.   Being there is terrible, and yes she might be angry in all directions for awhile, but let me assure you- she needs to be there, and being away from professional supervision is the worst most dangerous thing she can do right now.   Right now shes pissed and in a world of hurt because she doesn't have access to anything she can abuse to numb the pain. the isolation, having to eat finger foods only, no going outside, and being stuck in there with other ""dangerous"" people is going to be taxing on her as well. Its easy to lash out at you, but you did the right thing.   Now; as someone who struggles with a BPD and Narcissistic mom; AND has a long history of substance abuse, please listen to me: Making a committed life decision to distance oneself from a constant source of agony like that can be a lifesaver. It is a difficult thing to do, but it sounds like the only option here. Once I got away from her for good, I stopped feeling that miserable, that trapped. I really did, it helped tremendously.   If she lashes out at you, let her. Stand by your choice to call 911. Anything less would've made you not only a terrible person, but legally liable as well. All you did was panic and seek medical help for a legitimate suicide attempt. Keep telling her you care too much to stand by and watch her kill herself, keep it loving, don't enable, and don't shame her, and that's really all you can do.   I'm sorry you are going through this.   She didn't die. She's alive right now probably largely because you called for help. So remember that. And please remember even though she IS in hell and ALL she wants is the comfort of her own bed, and a real meal... that isn't the help she needs right now to get better."
mypartneristrans,38liq9,Luhdk,2,Fri Jun 5 13:14:12 2015 UTC,"I decided to throw in some real practical advice for you: Some of the most meaningful things you can do are small things, like working with the nurses to get some real socks and yoga pants (no elastics no drawstrings) to her if possible. a sports bra if permitted. a sweater without drawstrings that meets their rules. And real shampoo and conditioner if possible. Again, they will likely need to supervise her use of that, but they might let her shave and wash with her own supplies if you work it out so she can do it supervised. Other than that, things that helped me was talking about what we were going to do and eat once i got out of there. Visiting on Visiting day. Not acting weird around me like I was fragile or crazy even if I was... Try to get a few of those little things back, try and make her feel as normal and respected as possible. It's easy to feel patronized or infantalized."
mypartneristrans,38liq9,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Fri Jun 5 13:59:28 2015 UTC,Suicide is such a dark cloud on this community. Thank you so much for sharing such a personal experience to allow others to understand. This really meant a lot to me.
mypartneristrans,38liq9,Luhdk,3,Fri Jun 5 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"thanks... it took me a long time to be able to articulate to my closest friends and family just WHY i was so angry upon waking up there... It actually took me years to be able to put it into words.. In the end, it all really boiled down to the simple dignity of a plastic cup; the feeling that even though you had already Decided that you couldn't take Any More, that you are indeed trapped and will have to endure much more, and worse, alone. Without clothes, without hugs, without the food you love, without cutlery, you are going to have to endure this, you are going to have to live through this humiliating degrading affair, surrounded by other broken human beings and apathetic nurses and incomplete decks of cards... all this when you were already running on empty; and now instead of peace you are going to have to bear all of the pain without anything to numb it out, all at once, in this terrible terrible place. Cold turkey.  That's where the anger comes from. That's where the despair comes from. If she really puts in the work, OP's SO will eventually come to see that turning her in was the only thing to do, and she will recognize that it saved her life.  But that's after she makes it through, IF she makes it through. That's a long ways off, and it isn't important right now.  I wasn't trying to guilt or scare anyone going through this. I'm just pointing out that 1. OP did the absolute right thing 2. the anger isn't really about you, and lastly, 3. OP's relationship at large needs to be put on the back burner for a bit because right now, OP's SO is literally fighting to survive one day at a time. The anger isn't the important thing in all of this. Survival is. The point at which you are committed by force is no joke, it is no mistake, and it is not an inconvenience. This is not a game. This is life and death.  I have also lost family members and friends to Suicide, and I know how that feels too. It SUCKS a LOT- the key difference is, once you lose someone like that... you are stuck wondering what you could have done differently Forever. Avoid that at all costs, it is terrible.  If you have a loved one who is suicidal or an addict or both, and they need help, they will be LIVID with you to take that stance. LIVID. Please remember: Survival First. Only then you can have concern for things like love, happiness, relationships, and tiny plastic cups. Once you are dead, none of those things are remotely important. Only the living get to worry about those things. So concern yourself with preserving life first and foremost. Then and only then will you get the chance to sort things out.  That's the perspective I would want my SO to have if I were in that horrible place again.  OP- please keep her there, insist she get real help and not comfort, no matter what horrible shit she says when she's thrust into a pit of pain- if you care more about her life than your feelings, it is the only thing to do."
mypartneristrans,38liq9,baronsmom,2,Fri Jun 5 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, you did the right thing. That much Valium & ambien could have killed her. It is not your responsibility to keep her alive.   A little back story here. My ‚Äùadopted daughter"" (lesbian who had recently broken up with her ftm fiance/roommate) attempted suicide a couple of months ago. I helped get her into the psych ward of one of our local hospitals. She was pissed at me, her roommate, the world, but with therapy, she has changed her mind. We have also learned it was not our fault for getting her help.   Anytime someone talks about suicide or makes an attempt it is serious & you should call 911. Don't try to handle it yourself or let the person talk you out of calling for help. Any attempt needs therapy. She needs to open up & trust her therapists in order to get better & get out. You should get it too to help you process & figure out where to go with your relationship.  I don't mean to be harsh. Totally the opposite. I care about you. Dealing with the aftermath of a suicide attempt is HARD. Feel free to pm me. Hugs!"
mypartneristrans,38liq9,Luhdk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your input. I know she needs help, I promise. I have been trying to get her to see a counselor that is well liked among my trans* friends... She just didn't see a need because she wanted the medicines to fix everything. I study public health, and have a minor in health ed. I am usually very intuitive about health related needs assessments. It is so hard to be rational though. None of my feelings are logical, which makes me feel so stupid for feeling them. I have been trying to keep myself busy so I don't let this interfere with an internship I must complete to finish my degree. I haven't missed a day, and have been working through lunches. If I pause to think, I won't be able to focus the rest of the day.  I see a therapist regularly, and have an appointment Tuesday with her. I saw my psychiatrist on Tuesday of this week, and she was very supportive, but I can't have the support of the one person I really need it from most: My girlfriend. I can't even speak to her. She can only call for a minute or two, and has only called her mother. When I visited her, I couldn't talk to her about how I was feeling. I couldn't ask if she still loved me. This isn't about me. It is about her feeling better, seeing clearer.  I wasn't about to complain about not having her when I have my freedom and still some dignity.  How long did it take for your loved one to stop resenting you? How did you start the process?"
mypartneristrans,38liq9,dustfp,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"From my experience, she has to accept that she belongs there and scrape together a will to live 1st... then combat the shame and anger from an honest place.

Even if you can't entirely relate to the situation, it means a lot to have someone listen to me like it matters. It sucks, because even more than feeling guilty about having her involuntarily committed, I feel worse for what happened the night before. We got into an argument about our living situation and her not being approved to be put on my lease because of her poor credit score. She told me I didn't realize how mean I could be. I apologized and told her I would talk to my counselor and psychiatrist about being irritable lately, because she didn't deserve my short temper. That night, she wouldn't sleep in my bed. She chose to stay in her room all night, which never happens. When I kissed her goodbye when I left for work, she didn't kiss me back. I just feel like I was the straw that broke the camel's back. Maybe if I hadn't argued with her, none of this would have happened. We never argue, so it was very distressing for both of us. Obviously, I didn't realize how bad it was."

mypartneristrans,38liq9,brotkel,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:40:32 2015 UTC,"I'm MTF trans, pre-everything, university student. I was having issues and attempted suicide before coming to terms with my gender identity. Was hospitalized against my will for a week.  I think you did the right thing at the time, given everything you knew, in taking her to the hospital. Her safety is important.  I don't know what else is going on in her life (and you should make sure you have a long conversation with her about everything that has been upsetting her), but for me suicide was about escaping pain and asserting control. Although she says she wasn't trying to kill herself, she seems to have been thinking about it. Her mother, who hopefully is very loving, is being a bit of a bitch, using male pronouns. She didn't lose a son; she got the opportunity to know her daughter better. Pronouns aren't for others to feel comfortable; they're for the referred person. That could be very dangerous in the future, outing her in a very bad situation.  What are the laws in your state or province or whatever regarding how long an adult can be held in a mental hospital against their will? There should be a limit. Look into that. The hospital, with the reputation it has, probably isn't going to be very helpful, so you might want to ask around in your area, like any therapists and psychiatrists or lawyers you might know.  Those visiting hours are atrocious. There should be laws against that, unless there are, and they're breaking them.  Make sure that she knows that she is loved. Make sure that she knows that you miss her. Make sure that you don't blame her for what happened. The last thing someone who's at least seems to have been entertaining the thought of suicide needs, is to be blamed and made to feel a burden, and to have the focus directed away from the seriousness of their issue towards your feelings about it, making them feel slighted and unimportant.  Make sure you let her know that she can talk to you about everything and that you'll be loving and won't de-legitimize her feelings, and that you act so that she knows that she is beautiful and loved. Talk to her mother some more about why pronouns are a big deal: that means her mother is at the heart unaccepting and unsupportive and attached to someone who doesn't exist, not her living, breathing, feeling daughter who needs her love. Good luck, OP, and if you have any questions, I'm more than willing to help. Could you keep us updated?"
mypartneristrans,38liq9,baronsmom,2,Fri Jun 5 05:27:58 2015 UTC,"As far as understanding why she was in so much pain, she does have depression and anxiety. Recently though, she has been denied to every rental she has applied to because she has bad credit. Additionally, her car, which was in her stepfather's name because it was a surprise gift, was taken back by him because her mom is divorcing him and he can legally have the car until the judge decides where it is going (she made all the payments, roughly 11 k, except for the minimum downpayment that he paid, which was 1 k). It has been a year since she had a vehicle. I think it makes her feel burdensome to ask for rides out to borrow my car anywhere (it isn't, to me, as long as I can go to work/school). She has a lot of self hatred regarding her gender identity. I think all of these things combined are just too much for her to handle without professional help.  The law in my state is that they can be held for 72 hours for examination if the court thinks she is a danger to herself or others. They can renew this every 72 hours as long as the psychiatrist still thinks she is dangerous. This can extend for up to 90 days. Also, the visiting hours are a privilege so yeah, I guess what they are doing is legal. Florida is really strict about the Baker Act. Also, this facility is a 12 step type of place, and my girlfriend is atheist so I am positive she is super frustrated about that.  I have tried talking to her mom a million times about using her preferred gender pronouns, but she is always resistant. ""You could never understand, you aren't his mother."" Like, that makes it okay for her to misgender her child? No. One of the mental health technicians said the same thing to her, but she said it will take time to adjust. Honestly, she should have started adjusting when her kid told her she was trans. I guess she felt exempt? Honestly, my girlfriend is super non-confrontational, which has reinforced her mom's idea that it doesn't really matter.   I told herstraight up that she could be mad at me, because I can't imagine how she feels to be put isolated by the person who is supposed to love her the most. I told her I wasn't upset either, just afraid because I can't stand to think of losing her. I also told her that I don't think this is her fault, because she felt she had no other options. Her mom has been all ""how could you do this to us wahhh?"" I specifically told her that it isn't about her or me, it's about my girlfriend feeling better and like she isn't stuck. It is so hard to handle her mom, honestly.  I appreciate your response, I will keep you updated for sure. I am just dropped off a composition book, some of her school books, a travel shampoo, a travel conditioner, face moisturizer, and a pack of facial cleansing wipes off for her tonight. She had told me during visitation that she was really afraid her facial hair would start growing in. I can't give her a razor though, unfortunately. She called me for 1 minute today. She said she was still miserable. I told her I was so sorry that she was in that awful place, that I loved and missed her. I asked her to consider switching her status from involuntary to voluntary to show that she understands she needs help. She said she might.  Thank you for letting me vent."

mypartneristrans,38ikfl,user3924835,2,Thu Jun 4 13:26:34 2015 UTC,"Hi there and welcome! What you're feeling is totally valid and normal! It's okay to be scared of the uncertainty! If you're open to this and supportive and don't mind the changes, I think you'll be okay! I identified as straight before too. Many partners here still do and that's okay. You can identify as whatever you want and feel comfortable with. I've decided not to really pick a label for my sexuality. Others will perceive me as bi or a lesbian and I accept that. But for me, when I was with my ""husband"" I didn't find myself attracted to other men. But I'm still attracted to my now wife, but I don't find myself attracted to other women either. And because of my lack of attraction to anyone but my spouse, I just feel that my sexuality is my spouse and that's it. Of course not everyone is like that and that's okay too. Sexuality is complicated!  Just keep talking together, always be open and honest. The changes are slow, so that could be beneficial to you as well. It will give you time to adjust."
mypartneristrans,38ikfl,PANDADA,3,Thu Jun 4 14:25:55 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards not identifying as anything, or identifying as pansexual because I just don't feel like lesbian or bi is the right label. I hate labels in general, so I may just not identify, which I personally think is fine. That's EXACTLY how I feel! We had a long talk and she felt guilty because she thought I ""signed up for a relationship with a man"" but I don't want a relationship with a man, I want a relationship with her who I know and love. I hadn't really felt much attraction to anyone before her, but damn am I attracted to her.  It's so good to hear from people that feel similarly and to hear I'm not crazy.   You're totally right, sexuality is filled with so many more grays than I'd ever imagined before, but I'm glad I can explore them, even though it's scary at first."
mypartneristrans,38ikfl,PANDADA,2,Thu Jun 4 17:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's how I feel about my spouse. I've been asked if I'd consider dating women now if we divorced, but I can't imagine dating anyone else, man or woman. So I can never answer that question. I married her because I wanted to spend my life with her, and I still can't imagine a future without her."

mypartneristrans,38ikfl,kaorte,2,Thu Jun 4 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds similar to what happened with me and my girlfriend. I've only been in heterosexual relationships before so this was new. But I also admittedly find women attractive so the physical changes are not off putting to me. I mean, smooth legs, smooth face, soft skin? Its pretty nice lol.    I like to call myself pansexual now, even though I don't really like to label my sexuality as it is no one's business but mine and my partners.    You have every right to be scared but know that transition doesn't happen overnight. It happens over a long period of time and fairly slowly. It will give you both a chance to adjust to the changes."
mypartneristrans,38ikfl,kaorte,2,Thu Jun 4 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks <3 I've always been very attracted to people based on their personality, not their looks, so I'm not super worried.

mypartneristrans,38ikfl,tadzioizdat,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Personality before looks. My partner is certainly attractive (boy mode or girl mode).    Yes the unknown is scary! I think the first thing I noticed was a complete drop in sex drive which has been the hardest part of her transition for me. She cries a lot more and gets lady angry (think PMS) which is something I understand because I have been going through it most of my life.    The other scary part is telling friends and family. Now most of my friends know, but my family still does not...and it terrifies me.    Her transition is the best thing that could have happened for us as a couple. We are closer and we do a lot more together... well actually everything. We have the same shoe size so we can share shoes, awesome!

Yeah that's a big one. I have NO idea how my family will feel. They're liberal but sometimes they say very ignorant things concerning gay rights, so it could really go any way. I am worried about losing a few friends but I know the vast majority of them will support us. But somehow I'm actually not too worried and kind of excited to tell my friends.

That would mean you fall in love with someone regardless of their gender, so you can still be openly attracted to men while not othering your girlfriend.   Alas, the attraction thing is something you will have to figure out as you both go through this voyage. Being open to trying new things helps a lot, but sometimes it just doesn't work and it's no one's fault. Good luck!"
mypartneristrans,38ikfl,shruggin4life,3,Thu Jun 4 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"It's true, but it's worth considering that whatever she calls herself, people on the street are [at least eventually] going to see a lesbian couple, and treat them accordingly. It's important for some people to find words that fit well, but social reality needs to be a factor in consideration, as other comments mention.   Of course, this process may unfold slowly! But chances are, when OP's partner begins presenting differently, they're likely to be read as some kind of queer couple when they go out, so that's something to consider. Luckily, it sounds like both partners are communicative and wanting to see things through - keep that up, and you may find yourself falling in love all over again, in some surprising ways!"
mypartneristrans,38ikfl,NizaTheBrickWizard,3,Thu Jun 4 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm definitely aware of what others will call me (lesbian, or whatever it may be), but I'm okay with that. I've actually been called a lesbian many many times by my parents and exs, and I feel like I know how to deal with it. What's more important is having a concrete foundation for how I see myself. I'm glad though that I'll have a few months to come to terms with that though.   Thanks for the support <3 I'm excited to be there though this but I know that there is a long road ahead of us, and a bumpy one at that.

mypartneristrans,38in9m,RainbowPinata,5,Thu Jun 4 13:47:41 2015 UTC,"As much support as a transition needs from a partner, any relationship, yours included should be a fair arrangement where everyone's primary needs are being met. It currently isn't, and that is concerning.  I would say that if your partner isn't taking your concerns and needs seriously and isn't willing to talk about it with you or work on it with you, then the bigger issue here is you as a couple, and not as much something that can be explained away in regards to transitioning.   if there are things your partner is holding over your head as things you aren't allowed to talk about or ask for, if certain subjects are just off the table, then that is a huge red flag. Transition or no, dysphoria or no, you need to be able to talk about it. That's only fair.  I would suggest having a serious talk about how this makes you feel- approach it not as a list of demands or complaints, but from the stance of ""I feel like I can't even talk about sex without upsetting you, and that makes me feel like less of an equal in this relationship. I need to feel like my needs are important too, like yours are to me- and as much as I am here to support you or any issue you might be having, I can't be your partner if you shut me out. Please talk to me."""

He'll cry and talk about how terrible he feels for ""fucking up my life"" (his words, not mine) and how this is all his fault, but then once we're finished talking everything stays the same. He knows I feel unappreciated and invalidated. He knows I am lonely and struggling with this unwanted celibacy. He knows I feel like he isn't listening to me. He just can't find the time in his day to call a therapist and make an appointment for us. If I point that out, he gets defensive and calls himself an asshole.    Is this hopeless? It feels hopeless."

Yes, it hurts but, I think if you take a step back and look at this as a whole relationship; this is a toxic situation that is beyond your capacity to solve- especially if your partner isn't willing to participate in working towards a solution. :("
mypartneristrans,38in9m,SphirosOKelli,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"He and I talked last night and I was just so defeated -- I cried and told him I was going to move into the spare bedroom and we could go from there as far as deciding what happened next. I reminded him that I've been saying for months now that I'm tired and I can't keep this up anymore without some help, and that my happiness is now being sacrificed because he can't get himself together enough to lend me a hand. I think that scared him -- I've been telling him how drained I am but I've never made a move towards separation or divorce before. I think he figured that as long as he kept telling me he was ""working on"" getting us to a therapist, I'd stick around.    Long story short, we reached a compromise on a therapist (careful budgeting and cash-only so we don't have to worry about military insurance) and I called today to request an appointment. I am hesitantly optimistic. My demands requests are as follows: we learn to communicate more effectively, we come to a compromise on our sex life, and we face the future together instead of back-to-back, at war with each other. I feel better now that I put my foot down. I feel powerful. If our marriage fails, it's not because I didn't put in my best effort."

There is a difference between mood swings from hormones and just being a dick overall and your boyfriend shouldn't be trying to indicate that his behavior is solely transition related.  My ex pulled passive aggressive shit on me all the time and used silent treatment to punish me, and eventually just berated me for stuff. Some partners are just assholes. You ultimately have to decide where you draw the line and what you are willing to accept from your partner, but don't be afraid to leave him based on his shitty behavior just because he is transitioning. Holding him to a certain standard of fairness might be what it takes for him to grow up a little.  hug"

mypartneristrans,38in9m,Chel_of_the_sea,2,Fri Jun 5 21:45:43 2015 UTC,"The toughest point in our marriage (related to transition) was while my spouse was questioning. Before she made the decision to pursue HRT, we were in a dark place. Our communication was not good, our sex life was confusing and there was a lot of conflict between us. In my mind, I tell myself that if I was as educated then as I am now that things would've been different, that I could've been different and that we wouldn't have had to live in that dark place. Maybe that's not true, maybe there truly was nothing I could've done - I really don't know. Maybe it's true for you - maybe there's nothing you can do to make this part easier. If you get to the point where your happiness is so compromised that you need to leave, then you probably should. You have needs and those are clearly not being addressed.    I did some rotten things. In the time leading up to my partner's decision, I was the least accepting of their trans identity that I had been at any point along the way. We had been through so many cycles that confused the heck out of me and I was just done. Done. I literally said that I didn't want to be included anymore, I didn't want to hear about it anymore, I just wanted to be done. We had recently made some huge life changes (moving across the country, sending our kids off to college, etc...) and I was ready to relax and enjoy myself. When these things came up again, I just simply couldn't take it and I said go explore without me, leave me out of it.    Well, soon enough, her decision was made. She was going to start HRT. And just like that, the switch flipped. Ok, this is real. We both changed quite a bit during this short time. Although it was a time of really intense emotions for both of us, we were able to talk about it. She brought me to her therapy appointment. We started communicating. We adopted an attitude of 'this is our transition' and the love started flowing. Even though I had to go through the process of grieving during this time, it was still so much better between than it had been in a really long time. Our intimacy returned with a vengeance. It's like the dam that had been erected that was holding back all our love had stored all that love all that time and it then washed down over us as we let the dam fall. It really was beautiful. Our relationship is so much better now, we communicate better than we ever have, we have intimacy and I really feel like we are going to transition together, and come out so much happier in the end.    I can see the happiness that HRT has brought her. She deserves that and it fills my heart to see it. I am really glad I weathered the storm prior to her beginning HRT, it was worth it.    I don't know if going on HRT would do this for your partner, but I offer up the idea as a sliver of hope if you are looking for one. Sometimes I wonder if me being so disagreeable and putting my foot down about being involved in her issues allowed her the freedom to make the decision that with or without me, she was moving ahead."
mypartneristrans,38in9m,amyl_and_disco,3,Thu Jun 4 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like HRT and transitioning are the only things that will save our marriage, and I had been holding onto that hope until about two months ago when he told me that he doesn't plan to transition anytime soon. His career in the military is important to him, which I completely understand, and he can't transition and remain in the military. So that's that, and it feels like I just have to be OK with it. And you know, I would be supportive of his decision if it wasn't so damn miserable in the meantime. If we could go to a therapist and learn to communicate with each other, if we could strike some kind of compromise on our sex life, if we could figure this out together, we might be all right until the time comes that he can start HRT.    That's a lot of ""ifs,"" though, and a lot of uncertainty. It's been a year -- I feel like something's gotta give."
mypartneristrans,38in9m,amyl_and_disco,2,Thu Jun 4 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"It is a lot of ""ifs"". You have really been patient. I find it ironic that so many trans people feel like they have to slow down for their partners and here you are saying 'go!' and he is stagnant. Do you think his career is more important than his marriage? Maybe you could put it on the table that you can't continue anymore without transition? How unfair is that, though? Didn't you enter into this marriage after leaving a heterosexual one because you realized you were a lesbian? If so, this must feel like such terrible irony to you."
mypartneristrans,38in9m,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"Those are some really good questions! I feel stuck because, like I said in a comment somewhere else in this thread, I haven't been able to find a full-time position here, so I'm pretty dependent on him for a place to live and my car payment. I don't want to force his hand and give an ultimatum that would make him choose between me and his job because I can't support both of us right now. I'm barely supporting myself, although I am socking away every spare penny and have a nice little cushion saved up. He wants to at least finish his first contract with the military, which lasts until 2019, and I respect that. He has a history of quitting, and he wants to see this through. Unfortunately, although that's what's best for him and his career, four more years of this is going to tank our marriage.    The word I think of most often to describe my current marriage is ""karma."" I was married to a wonderful man for three years, but we divorced because I fell head-over-heels in love with my current partner and went on a mystical journey of self-discovery. I finally admitted to myself that I liked women and had always liked women, and spent a blissful few years unabashedly crushing on girls and wearing rainbow everything. Then my partner came out to me, shortly after we got married, and I felt like this must be the universe's idea of a cruel joke. My partner is the only woman I've ever been with, and it's torture every day to finally be in a relationship where sex is something I want instead of something I try to avoid ... but my partner doesn't want me. It hurts, that's for sure.    Thank you for listening, and for your validation. I think often that there must be something else I could be doing, but you're right -- I have been patient. It's time to make a decision."
mypartneristrans,38in9m,amyl_and_disco,2,Fri Jun 5 13:04:25 2015 UTC,Please don't convince yourself that you are being punished.  It is obvious that you are a good person with a good heart.
mypartneristrans,38in9m,tulips_onthe_summit,4,Fri Jun 5 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"It feels like he wants me to be happy as long as he doesn't have to go out of his way to make it happen. Like, maybe one day I'll say, ""A chocolate bar would make me happy,"" and that will solve everything without him having to make an effort.    I think you've hit the nail on the head. This is pretty classic passive-slash-spoiled ""I want things to come to me"" behavior."
mypartneristrans,38in9m,bookwormxx,2,Thu Jun 4 15:21:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely. This attitude is frustrating enough from a cis person, but being trans involves a tremendous amount of effort, at least at first. It sounds like you're willing to see him through the process, and are willing to put in work right alongside him where you can, but this is his process and it's unfair to expect you to abandon your needs and wait around. I'm glad to hear that you're in therapy, and hope you have other support through this time - I've heard being a military spouse can be incredibly isolating. Really hoping you're able to have a serious conversation soon, like Luhdk suggested: you deserve some honest answers, so you can continue moving with eyes wide open."
mypartneristrans,38in9m,bookwormxx,4,Thu Jun 4 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"You're right -- being a military spouse is very isolating. I gave up a full-time job and a nice house in the country and a circle of good friends to move with my partner to his current duty station, where I haven't been able to find a full-time job and we live in a tiny apartment and I don't really know anyone. We go to events on base and I have to remember to call him ""she"" and pretend like everything's fine because no one can know we're having trouble. Anyone I meet can't know the truth or else it might get back to his Sgt. and all hell will break loose. So we laugh and act like we're newlyweds crazy in love, then go home and cry because we don't understand each other. He acknowledges that we need counseling, he just doesn't take care of it.   I know it was my choice to give up my life and move here, but that doesn't stop it from being hard. I told him during our argument the other day that it feels like he's the only one benefiting from this marriage: he gets his house cleaned, his meals cooked, his grocery shopping done, and he has a ready-made pet-sitter every time he gets sent away on a mission. I am the one doing the cleaning, cooking, shopping, and pet-sitting, and feeling more and more alone. I have made a few acquaintances here, but I'm so scared I'll slip up and call him by the wrong name or pronoun and be the cause of his dismissal from the military.    Honestly, one of the biggest sources of support I have is this subreddit. I am so happy to be a part of it!"
mypartneristrans,38in9m,bookwormxx,2,Thu Jun 4 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"Oof, that's rough - I found myself crying just reading this response. I'm sure your partner is going through his own kind of hell right now, but he's incredibly lucky to have you supporting him and shouldering his secret this way, and he can't expect it to continue without some sort of sacrifice. You may have chosen to give everything up in order to make a life with him, but the life he's offering you right now just doesn't sound sustainable. It sounds as though you're spent, in so many ways - and if you can let him know that before you hit that point of no return, I'd advise it. I feel you so hard right now, and am sending you strength from far, far away. So glad you've found some support on this sub. Please keep us posted!"
mypartneristrans,38ify0,muycoqueta22,3,Thu Jun 4 12:50:06 2015 UTC,"Oof, this is rough. I know this is gonna sound impractical, but I see that he works at B&N, and know a lot of trans people working for franchises who have relocated to states with better health care options. Expensive, yes, but so is surgery, which is why I mention it. A huge factor in my relocation to California was the fact that they don't allow trans exclusionary policies, so my top surgery and hysto were overwhelmingly covered. It seems like your fundraising endeavor's off to a great start, but if you hit a point of desperation, you might look into states with better coverage options. Good luck to you both!"

mypartneristrans,38gmqy,freshsurprise,8,Thu Jun 4 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"I lived with a partner for years who threatened suicide over my behavior.  It's not healthy in any way for you to remain. It is not your responsibility to ""keep them alive."" It's abusive emotional blackmail.  As much as this sounds terrible, your best option is to put distance between yourself and them. I've never, ever seen it end well for people who stayed. They need professional help, and you won't be able to give it."
mypartneristrans,38gmqy,TheScarlettHarlot,6,Thu Jun 4 08:38:53 2015 UTC,"Threatening suicide to keep someone around is abusive, and if you believe he's genuinely at risk of hurting himself then you should consider getting him outside help  - NOT your friends, who have no idea what it's like to actually be in the relationship. It's very different when you're the partner. I guess I don't have much to say that hasn't been said, but please, look after yourself, because it doesn't sound like anyone else is."
mypartneristrans,38gmqy,bookpig,4,Thu Jun 4 11:11:39 2015 UTC,"You cannot change your sexual orientation or force yourself to be someone you are not. You may need to change the parameters of your relationship but that doesnt mean your wife is losing you. You can still love him and support him and be there, but maybe you can't do it romantically. That doesn't mean you're abandoning him it just means you're being true to yourself. If your wife isn't able to respect that about you, then he is the one being unsupportive, not you. And your ""friends"" should all get booted right up the ass for not supporting your spouse through his transition AND helping you grieve and process a situation that is a huge loss for you. Even if you can stay married it is still a loss and it does require some empathy. If your wife is emotionally blackmailing you with the threat of suicide, there is way more to address than just transition. Hopefully he gets a good therapist. I'd advise you to do the same. It helps so much to be able to vent to someone who isn't emotionally invested in a situation.  Please don't get turned off by the pronoun police. Please continue to reach out for support! It's so rough in the beginning but it can get easier and lots of us are here to listen."
mypartneristrans,38gmqy,zuzu240,12,Thu Jun 4 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"So two things.   1) he's a he. He may not look like it right now, but you're married to a guy. The question is primarily whether you're going to stay. It's always possible he won't transition, but don't hope for that; not transitioning, he's likely to do rather poorly. If you stay with him, it may be a choice between a dead ""wife"" and a living husband.  2) that said, if he's threatening suicide in an attempt to guilt you into staying in a marriage to a man, that's severely manipulative and raises major warning flags. Ultimately, he has a right to expect you to believe him, understand he's a man, and respect that, but he has no right to force you into a marriage to a man. If you can't do that and he kills himself, that'd be truly appalling, but it would not be your fault.   It's fine to grieve and to be angry at realizing that the person you meant to spend your life with can't do that the way you wanted him to. For your own sake, I'd suggest you work very hard to stay calm and avoid being sucked into giant fights. Your marriage may well not survive. I'm sorry. I lost my marriage when I transitioned, and it sucked. Try to figure out your next move with a clear head and not from a place of shocked betrayal though."

That isn't the way to go if you want to garner support from your SO. At the end of the day, the decision is yours. Try to get yourself acquainted with the idea of transgenderism. But if you're really not feeling it, that's okay too. My SO showed me a couple of MtF trans timeliness on YouTube and instead of being freaked out, like I thought I would be, I felt happy that one day she would be able to be her true self. That's when I knew everything would be okay. But it doesn't work like that in every case and you can't beat yourself up about it.  One last thing- I want to stick up for you and your pronoun usage.

It can be comforting to realize that you don't have to decide everything right now. Your spouse seems to have made their decision - they are going to transition. You now have some options. If this is completely a no-go, you have every right to end your relationship and be honest about the fact that you will not accompany them on their journey. It sounds to me that you are not saying you want to leave, but instead you are trying to figure out how to stay, or maybe take some time to figure out if you want to stay. If that's the case, give yourself some time. You may find as you learn more about your transgender spouse that you do have the capacity to expand the love you have for them in female presentation into love for them in male presentation.    I have found that reading books, doing research and individual counseling have really helped me to work through my own thoughts and feelings on my spouse's transition. Also, extremely open and honest communication with my partner have helped us to understand how we can work together through a successful transition. You could ask if your spouse is open to embracing their transition as a team effort; we have found this very helpful for my marriage."

If he's feeling overwhelmed by dysphoria and asking you to provide a level of support you're not equipped to give, then it's really important for him to have someone else to talk to, someone else to help him work through these feelings.   If you don't feel like you have any support system to help you deal, then you need to build one. Find a therapist or partner support group (these can be harder to find, but you're technically posting to one right now).  Try to keep in mind that you found out 2 weeks ago. The quotes around ""he"" indicate that you're still in a phase of denial, that you don't want to believe this is really happening, or hoping he'll change his mind. Odds are he won't, that he is a man, and you're going to have to accept that, whether or not you're able to be in a relationship with one. Broader point here is, be patient, give yourself time to examine your feelings and figure out whether this can work and, if not, what steps to take next."

And trust me when I say being married to someone and then later finding out how they truly feel is devastating and upsetting (married for 8 years/together for 11 before I found out my husband wanted to be my wife) but you have to make the best of it. You married him because you loved more than just appearances. You loved the person he was and is. That will never change. It can be a blessing to be with someone who is transitioning, if you let it. He will become the person who he had always wanted to be and you will get to learn all sorts of new things about him that you didn't know. It will be amazing! But you need someone to help you learn to cope and he needs someone to talk to about transitioning and about his suicidal tendencies. The fact that you feel he is giving you an ultimatum means that he is manipulating you and that is not healthy for any relationship, especially a marriage. It is difficult to cope with such a change when all you can think about is if you decide you want to leave, he will die. You feel trapped and its not fair. There is nothing wrong with not being able to handle the change, its a huge thing to accept and cope with. Its not easy but if you work on it, and if you get the help you both need, things will get better. But you both need a support team, not just him."

Forgive me if I step out of line here, and feel free to tell me so, but....You have every right to do what you need to do to be happy. Your spouse has closed the door on intimacy; I don't think I could handle that. To me, it feels as though she has made the decision to end your marriage, but is making you be the one to actually execute on it. That feels so unfair to me. I could be totally misreading this and totally off base. I'm just trying to say that I have seen you talk about your guilt over and over again and I wish there was a way to share that burden with you. You shouldn't feel guilty. You really shouldn't. You have a right to your life, the way you want it, just like your spouse does.    I'm not making a recommendation to you, I'm trying to gently say that your decision should be about you.

I've actually also wondered if my spouse just wants me to be the one to make the move to end our marriage.  I have actually asked her about it, and she says that part of her wants to fight for our marriage but the bigger part of her feels like she doesn't have the right to do so.

And I've been trying to tell her for months that I want nothing more than for her to fight for us and make me feel like more than a roommate, that it's the only way that our marriage can survive.  In a strange twist of events, after we separated our bedrooms, she came into my room one night and initiated sex.  I was like ""is this a sick joke?""  Lol.  I was finally at a place where I felt like I was ready to move on (and even felt optimistic about our new arrangement) because she had told me that we would never have that kind of relationship again.  Right now I'm comfortable with our separate bedroom arrangement.  I honestly think it has helped to clear my head a little and not feel quite so trapped.  We still spend time together, go out to eat as a family on the weekends, etc, and a lot of nights the 3 of us end up piled in my spouse's bed watching TV (there's not a TV in 'our' room, but she bought one for her room).  It's comforting for each of us to have the other nearby, but at some point (if we move forward with separating), I'm going to have to make an effort to pull myself away more often so that I'm not just going through the motions of a marriage that isn't a marriage...if that makes sense.  So...the roller coaster ride continues.  Thanks for listening and again for the support and advice.  I may take you up on your offer to PM sometime. :)"

If she wants tone arms I suggest nothing over 10lbs with lots of reps. I suggest checking out /r/Fitness.  I have just started hiking. I been walking 3-5 miles every other day. and its kicking my butt for now."
mypartneristrans,38fus0,Wannabkate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:16:47 2015 UTC,"I think she will be surprised at the effect the hormones have on her ability to buff up.  Despite the fact that my spouse works in construction and does a lot of heavy lifting for her job (and has always had masculine muscular arms), her arm muscles are shrinking since starting HRT.  She has been doing a ton of cardio and has lost about 30 lbs.  She looks a lot more toned."
mypartneristrans,38au2b,gingerdread,5,Wed Jun 3 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"No, that's completely unrealistic and unfair. Don't forget that you are partners, and that's how it should feel. You are both there to help each other through each day and to add happiness to each other's life."
mypartneristrans,38au2b,Mastry,3,Wed Jun 3 02:34:07 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. It's nice to get some outsider input and head in not crazy
mypartneristrans,38au2b,honestmelon,8,Wed Jun 3 02:36:26 2015 UTC,Its unreasonable of her to do that to you without explain why. Its unreasonable of her if she's 100% ignoring your needs. Intimacy is 1/3 of the formula for a successful relationship.   Obviously this is a hard time for her but that's no excuse to make you miserable. So my advice is to just have it out. Tell her what's up and listen to her concerns while voicing your own. And if she refuses to at least compromise then talk about what that means for your relationship.  And you aren't a terrible wife. Youre just a person with feelings and needs that aren't being met.
mypartneristrans,38au2b,thewanderingmind,4,Wed Jun 3 01:18:23 2015 UTC,"I guess so, thank you.  I wish that sex weren't so important for me to feel connected to my partner.  I'm trying to be very up front with my needs and I just feel like she thinks I am being completely unreasonable. I appreciate your input."
mypartneristrans,38au2b,SphirosOKelli,2,Wed Jun 3 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, sex is sort of expected in every relationship that's not specifically asexual. Besides that its a basic human imperative. Don't feel guilty about it yo"

Clearly you weren't doing it out of malice or hate. Just apologize and make sure they know that you weren't trying to make them feel bad then move on."
mypartneristrans,388fm5,ansermachin,3,Tue Jun 2 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks! I really appreciate it, because I've been so worried I might slip up again."
mypartneristrans,388fm5,ansermachin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"Let them know you'll be there for them no matter what, and be open and supportive when they talk to you about their feelings.   Mostly, this won't be something you can really help with; your partner has to figure out their own identity for themselves. But you can make it less painful by being supportive and by being available when they do have something they can talk to you about.  I am a (mostly) gay guy in a relationship with a transgirl, so hit me up if you want to talk about anything."
mypartneristrans,387opm,PotatoFemmeIn,8,Tue Jun 2 13:10:36 2015 UTC,"Aw dude, its no biggie. You've been together for seven years. That's a little less than a third of your life. Thats a very long and significant portion of your life. Your relationship is about to change in a massive way, no matter what your partner decides. And its okay to mourn the way things were. I'd be worried if you didn't feel scared about the future and sad about the past. The thing is youre doing it a little early. There are still a lot of what its here. Time will tell how things play out. Just keep an open dialogue with your partner about your feelings. This is a weird hard time for them but that doesn't and shouldnt discount your thoughts and emotions. And just because you know this is a hard time for them doesn't mean that you can't or shouldn't talk about your feelings. Good luck to both of you!"
mypartneristrans,387opm,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:37:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, I do think that how long we've been together makes it both easier and harder in a way. Easier, because we love each other so completely and are fully committed to each other. Harder, because I've known them as a man for so long. We got together just when they were becoming a man, and it's all I know.   You're exactly right about the what ifs, I'm catastrophising a little about the whole thing, and I think I need to realise that none of what I'm worried about has come to pass yet.   Thank you!"
mypartneristrans,387opm,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Tue Jun 2 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe I was little more lucky in that my partner was already vastly transitioned when we began seeing each other. But You will get through this, and because you say that you love who they are inside I think that you will get through it just fine. Just take it one step at a time and don't look too much into the future."
mypartneristrans,387opm,FortuneDays-,6,Tue Jun 2 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"It's the unknown and it is scary. My spouse began transition 3 months ago and I'm scared every day. I'm completely supportive and we are committed to our relationship through transition.    I also have suffered from a bit of anxiety since realizing that my partner had made the decision to transition. So many thoughts. So many emotions. So little precedent. So much hiding and secrecy. Your partner's journey is your journey and your feelings are valid, and totally ok to have. I've found individual therapy extremely helpful for this. I also have a transition journal to help organize my thoughts and have gotten active in  the trans community to learn more and to be a better supporter.    I went through (and am still processing) a full grief cycle as she began her transition. I won't lie, it was hard. Like you said, I was always on the verge of tears, it was a really wild emotional roller coaster. These feelings are what prompted ne to seek out a therapist (with trans experience) and it really has been so helpful."
mypartneristrans,387opm,jenlb714,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. It's really hard to feel like my feelings are as important as my partner's at the moment but I need to let myself feel this I think.   I'm glad that the grief I spoke about isn't uncommon, I felt guilty for feeling that way. I'm not sure if you know what I mean, but I'm afraid that my grieving or crying breaks my partner's heart and makes them feel guilty. I've been struggling to hold in my tears so they don't see how hard this is for me. A therapist with trans experience would be great, I'll have to look into something like that because I'm sure both my partner and I need some extra support these days as there's so much secrecy surrounding the whole thing."
mypartneristrans,387opm,autowikibot,2,Tue Jun 2 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"I think both partners struggle with guilt in this situation. If you peruse the posts here, you will see many people speak about it at length. You can make the decision as to how much of that you share with your partner. What I can tell you is that I have found that my spouse and I have made the greatest progress and have had the most productive conversation when I share these difficult things with her. We are honestly communicating better now than we did pre-transition.    It also helped me a lot to learn and do research. I've read lots of books, read so much info online, I participate in transgender forums, etc...it clears up a lot of the confusion and uncertainty to learn about the process.    I know what it's like to feel under the weight of the secret. I've been there for a really long time and still am. There are a lot of helpful, friendly and informative people on this sub. I hope you find valuable information here and feel not so alone :)"

mypartneristrans,389o7w,Thessalonike,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"Speaking from personal experience, even just that was doing tons. Not doubting me, supporting me, being there to help me when I was coming out to people, reproaching me during moments of weakness when I would start referring to myself as a freak or as a monster - she was my rock when I needed her to be.  Mind you, part of that was also that she did let herself be honest with me about how hard the transition could be for her sometimes - because if she was honest about the bad parts, I could also trust that she was being honest in her support. We finished planning our wedding, and got married, after I came out to her, but we both understood that there was no guarantee she would keep finding me attractive. She was honest about being worried about what would happen to our sex life, if I lost function down there, or if using it starting making me feel dysphoric. She shared her concerns about potentially facing rejection from her family and from the community. There were also a lot of nights of her crying in my arms as she shared how hard all of it was on her, and me telling that it was alright, and completely understandable, for her to feel that way, and that it didn't make her a bad person at all - just human. Telling her that she's not the only partner who's described the transition as kind of like going through morning, though the person isn't actually dead."

mypartneristrans,385gc3,jenlb714,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I am sorry you're in this situation. My boyfriend and I are pretty religious, and it's our faith in Christ that helped us both to be supportive, loving, and accepting of people of all genders/orientations. We certainly know a fair number of 'Christians' that can be spiteful and mean (we actually are having a falling out with one of his past teammates because I lost my temper with him for demonizing a rather standard, helpful approach for trans* children), but I hope and pray that maybe someday people like her parents may learn the true meaning of unconditional, Christ-like love and provide her with the support and understanding you both desire."
mypartneristrans,37znq2,aigisaurus,8,Sun May 31 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, its fine yo. It'll be tricky. Just ask her. Be direct.

mypartneristrans,37znq2,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yes of course. I also told her I refuse to bring a child into that situation. So if we ever want to adopt, she needs to do something about it. Not to mention she already has high expectations of her young nieces and nephews to be able to flip back and forth because her other siblings are already teaching them her new name and that she's their aunt now."
mypartneristrans,37znq2,kaorte,2,Wed Jun 3 11:50:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that switching-over period is really hard. I have a very easy time switching pronouns entirely when someone comes out, but a very hard time going back and forth"
mypartneristrans,37znq2,Thessalonike,2,Mon Jun 1 12:39:58 2015 UTC,"Yes! I totally have this problem. I thought it was going to be so difficult to change name/pronouns - so I started practicing really early on. It's so ingrained already that I now have the same problem as you, I rethink my sentences before I talk. It's so strange. My partner isn't out to anyone and so I shouldn't use their female name and pronouns to others yet. Unfortunately, I have no advice - but I sure can relate!  Edit: typos"
mypartneristrans,37znq2,Thessalonike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the message ! Hope you'll work it out too. Maybe ask her to tell you clearly ""the female pronouns are between us, outside you have to use the male pronouns"" ? If you work a bit like me it might help you."
mypartneristrans,37znq2,HerpDeDerpJen,2,Wed Jun 3 08:35:03 2015 UTC,"I still have to flip back and forth with pronouns depending on what setting we are in. It is hard. It will get easier the more you have to do it. Just spend a few extra seconds thinking about what you are going to say before you say it and you should be good. When I am talking about my gf in public to people who don't know she is trans, I will often say ""you, we our"" and talk in a more general way to avoid the pronoun altogether. The only time I need to use pronouns is when I am talking about her and she isn't standing right next to me.   Its a bummer, but it does get easier."
mypartneristrans,37znq2,jenlb714,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:27:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips ! I think it'll come in handy someday :) Hope you'll be able to switch easily in the near future !
mypartneristrans,37tg69,OMGbecky_,9,Sat May 30 06:34:30 2015 UTC,"First of all I want you to thank you for being so considerate about your gf, not everyone is.   If you two move forward as a team this will change both of your lives. I would say that what has helped me the most is just  remembering that it's not just my partner that is transitioning, that this is a transition time for me as well. Just take things one step at a time and there is no use trying to address situations before hand, just wait until you have to cross that bridge.   Acceptance has to come from both ends. And some decisions sometimes take time, so be patient.   Personally the hardest part of the process has been explaining to everyone why I was ok with all of this. I love my partner not for their gender but for who they are and not whatever bits they have.   Good luck to you and just remember that sometimes it is worth to live in the question rather than try to find an immediate answer. Seek help not just for your psychological and physical issues but your spiritual ones. If you meet someone that questions you and what you are doing just remember that most of the time they just need to be educated and that whatever pre-conceived ideas they might have come from being ignorant and that most people need time to learn and some just can't be taught new tricks and you need to move on."
mypartneristrans,37tg69,pstatiana,3,Sat May 30 13:06:20 2015 UTC,The part about living in the question really resonates with me.  That is going to be difficult for me. Its frustrating for me to have so many questions and so few answers.
mypartneristrans,37tg69,bookwormxx,1 point,Sat May 30 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you wrote but wanted to point out that sexual and romantic attraction often goes deeper than the 'bits' and has to do with overall presentation.  Gender often plays a huge role in the dynamic of a relationship, and if one partner's gender changes, it often changes the entire dynamic of the relationship in ways other than physical ones.  Obviously, I love my spouse for more than her bits, but I was very attracted to her masculine presentation (more than just her penis).  The attraction factor has changed a lot in our relationship despite the fact that she has the same bits."
mypartneristrans,37tg69,PANDADA,4,Mon Jun 1 14:54:29 2015 UTC,"You should talk to my partner so you know all the things you ARE NOT supposed to do....lol.  Anyhoo. To make this short so I don't turn it into an angsty rant because I am still horribly upset about my situation.   Be straightforward and honest with her. Don't hide things about your transition from her in fear that you'll hurt her. In the end it just ends up hurting more. Don't leave her behind. If you want to be together at the end of this, you have to stand by each other through all of this. Through the good, the bad, and the ugly. Not just when she is fun and happy and supportive. AT ALL TIMES. DON'T be selfish and obsessed. When a partner is transitioning it is already overwhelming enough and the transition basically takes over the other persons life, as well as yours...It can be really easy for your partner to feel like all you care about is yourself and your transition. Focus on your partner because I can guarantee your partner being as supportive as she is will spend all of her energy focusing on you. My partner spent all of her time and money making herself happy that she forgot about me. All she wanted to talk about was her transition, and every conversation stemmed off of that.   OH and -DON'T RUSH. My partner was light speed ahead from day 1. She was already presenting full time in a matter of weeks after she came out to me. She lied about her appointment, and then went to it anyway, and is now on hormones, less than a year before coming out.    Basically all of the advice I've constructed is from all of the shitty things she's done to me and our relationship.     I have a lot of built up resentment and pain and some days it is hard to keep it to myself. Our relationship will never be the same, and I don't mean that in a good way.  Whatever solid foundation we had has been shattered."

mypartneristrans,37tg69,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:32:06 2015 UTC,"I will try to explain it without sounding like a whiny baby, LOL.  I often feel that I have no control over what is happening in my life.  My spouse decided to start HRT without talking to me about it first.  In no way do I think she needed my permission if she felt transitioning was necessary, but as her wife of 8 years and the mother of her child, I think that there should have at least been a conversation about it.  It made me feel very left behind and like I was not important enough for my spouse to discuss major life changes with.  We've since worked through that, but now our life is consumed with my spouse's transition.  I often feel like I am sitting by the wayside, because she is so focused on transition that she can't take an interest in me.  I am not high maintenance, so it takes a lot for me to feel that way.  We no longer have a sex life, so I don't feel as connected with my spouse as I did in the past.  She can't help that HRT has killed her libido, so my needs have to take a back seat.  All of these things together just build up and often make me feel alone and like I am just along for the ride.  I'm not sure if any of that makes sense.  My mind is a little jumbled today!"
mypartneristrans,37tg69,bookwormxx,3,Wed Jun 3 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's awesome you came here! For me, I just tell my wife to let me have my emotions. Let me go though them. I may not be stoked all the time about everything, but I need to adjust to the changes. She let's me talk to her about everything I'm feeling. A lot of things I read here, asktransgender or talk about in therapy, I end up talking about with her. Most of the time our feelings align. I think she's surprised at herself over feeling nervous about her upcoming name change. But of course it didn't surprise me when she told me. So many times we end up feeling a lot of the same emotions and don't know it until one of us says something."
mypartneristrans,37tg69,saintartaud,2,Sun May 31 02:38:07 2015 UTC,"That's one of the first things I thought about too. We both grew up in the Midwest, so being candid about our feelings is not exactly a strong suit. lol"
mypartneristrans,37tg69,SphirosOKelli,2,Sun May 31 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"It's really awesome for you to come here and ask this!    My partner has embraced their transition as 'our transition'. I can't tell you what this has done for my level of comfort, support and acceptance. We discuss everything, in great detail, often multiple times over. We make decisions together. We are honest when we are feeling sad, happy, confused, even just plain weirded-out. Literally, at times we've sat back and said, 'this is really weird' and fell into laughter. This spirit of togetherness has strengthened our bond at a time when it feels very vulnerable.    I would also suggest you have a lot of patience with her if/when you tell her you really are going to transition. For me - It was a shock. It elicited feelings I didn't know existed. It was all consuming and it was really scary. I spent a while in this place before going to seek out individual therapy, which has worked wonders for me. Think about the amount of time you may have spent questioning, doubting, etc...don't expect her to have a perfect reaction or to be cool with everything right off the bat.  Encourage her to read books, do research and really learn about the trans community. It helped me to correct any preconceived notions I had about being trangender. It also helped me be a better supporter.    Answer her questions. Be honest when you don't know the answer. Give her the hard truths. Share with her how you came to your decision. Tell her it's ok to cry or feel anger or be extremely confused. Tell her you love her and want to share your journey with her. Good luck :)"
mypartneristrans,37tg69,bookwormxx,2,Mon Jun 1 13:46:22 2015 UTC,"As some others have said, just be patient with her, answer her questions, and let her have her roller coaster of emotions.  I think it's also important that she has someone besides you to talk to about it, whether that be a friend you feel comfortable having her share information with or a counselor.  When my spouse came out to me, I didn't have anyone to talk to about it for several months, and I held a lot in because I didn't want to make my spouse feel guilty.  It was one of the darkest and loneliest times in my life.  Once I was able to start talking more openly about it, I started to feel so much better."
mypartneristrans,37tg69,SphirosOKelli,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"Communicate with her about your feelings and expectations about transition. Don't let your transition take precedence over her feelings or personal needs. I think those are the biggest things that help people, and where I think some transitions go wrong. Like: secrecy, rushing transition without any input from the partner, not being open about what transition will mean, not providing emotional support while assuming full support/accommodation for transition, etc.  Understand that this isn't just about you, that this is something that affects her as well and will force her to examine (or re-examine) a lot of her own gender/sexuality as well. Possibly also the nature of the relationship.  If you can provide her with any resources to help her understand what you're going through, that can help too. Even as someone who considered themselves fairly well informed before my partner's transition, it helped to seek out more knowledge/awareness. Things that were initially scary and uncertain became less so, once I better understood what they entailed."

It's hard to see my gf cry saying she didn't want to be married to a man, upset that taking T will turn me into a roid rage psycho with a body full of man funk and hair...   I want desperately to talk to her, but how can I when she is so afraid? What can I say to make her feel better? I keep telling her that I'm not going to change, that I'm still going to be me, but I can see she doesn't trust that.   What's worse is I want to bring with me to the center where the other partners are but she thinks everyone down there are freaks...   She sounds super unsupportive I know, but even when she says the most hurtful things she follows it up with - ""you know I'm not going to leave you, I just need time. We will get through this together."" I'm afraid I'm going to lose her..."

mypartneristrans,37r7bm,cheekyfnpartner,3,Fri May 29 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"Geez. I am stressed out just reading that. So sorry...    A little over a decade ago, my partner's relationship with their family completely broke down, too. It wasn't trans related, but it ended in a huge blowout followed by no contact with her family for almost 5 years. Like you, initially it was kind of a relief for me. As the years went by, my spouse became increasingly upset about the zero contact with her family. With very small and hesitant baby steps, we re-entered the family with a completely different attitude. To my surprise, it has completely worked and we now have a relationship with them. We are not very close, but we spend holidays together and have built an entirely new type of relationship with them.    Maybe a break from Mom, followed with evidence of the therapy you spoke of on her part may allow you to consider rebuilding down the road. For now, it sounds as though removing that toxicity from your life is the right way to go.     Good luck to you and kind thoughts to your spouse. This must be really hard for them, regardless of the state of their relationship with their Mom. It's tough to close the door on your parents/be rejected by them :("
mypartneristrans,37r7bm,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Fri May 29 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Unfortunately, their Mother does not feel she needs therapy. She is already on antipsychotic/deppressant medications for her various conditions. She just had her meds tweaked a bit by her family doctor, so sometimes the idea gets thrown out that maybe she just couldn't control herself because her meds got changed...  But this blowup was well on its way to happening. We've been putting our feet down and standing our ground against her boundary stomps more and more lately (and it gets easier each time), this is the first time that my spouse has geniunely stood up to her without caving to her guilt trips and manipulation. Ever. And she freaking lost it as a result.  My spouse is understandably upset and wishes they didn't have to end the relationship, but I really don't see any other way. We knew, as soon as they came out, MIL would lose it hardcore. I'm very firm on the stipulation that she get real, professional help on a regular basis before we even consider trying to let her back into our lives. And she doesn't want to get help.  I honestly can't see her ever being okay with my spouse's gender changes or our lifestyle choices, either. This woman is the biggest bigot I've ever met."
mypartneristrans,37r7bm,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Fri May 29 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"I hear ya...I am so nervous for when the time comes to come out to her family, I hope we don't have to go through another episode.    Well, take lots of deep breaths, enjoy the pressure that has just been released from that situation and give each other lots of love as you recover from this one. I hope you are incident free from now on :)"

mypartneristrans,37r7bm,bookwormxx,2,Sun May 31 13:49:33 2015 UTC,You should write stories. That shit was intense. The suspense had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
mypartneristrans,37r7bm,kaorte,2,Mon Jun 1 05:45:33 2015 UTC,Wow.  I have no words other than I'm so sorry that you and your spouse have to deal with that.
mypartneristrans,37omhk,RedSparxxx,5,Fri May 29 04:32:55 2015 UTC,"1) If you haven't already, consider finding a therapist. The weight of all these questions can be crushing and just having someone to talk to about it (who is not your SO) can help tremendously. Speaking of... 2) Find a close friend or two who you can confide in. If your SO is not in the closet OR okay with you ""outing"" them in this way. My spouse originally didn't want me to (deep in the closet) but after I had a panic attack, they decided it was something I needed. Keeping these intense emotions and fears bottled up can be harmful. That said, you want to be understanding of your SO's feelings about it.  I'll say this. Wanting to physically transition to another gender is not something that most people experience. If your SO is telling you they want this and seems happier and more at peace those times they do present more feminine, I would have to say it is real. It is really happening and he likely really wants it, even if he's taking it slow. My spouse is taking things very slow... as in afraid to make any ""permanent decisions"" like HRT, laser, telling ANYONE but me about this. But at the same time on those few occasions they put on their wig and clothes they seem so much happier. So I know it's just a matter of time.   Now... you sound like you're being supportive (good for you!) but there is a difference between being supportive intellectually and being emotionally invested in their transition. Are you happy? This is something the therapist can help with.  As for questions about your SO's libido and orientation... don't jump too far ahead. If the sex is good now and you're not turned off by their becoming a woman and having sex then... don't worry. It's a remote possibility but unlikely their your SO's orientation will change.  In conclusion, keep being supportive while making sure to find support for yourself. Don't get too overwhelmed with things that are still so far off in the future. If you can be at peace with uncertainty try to take things month by month."

Don't get too overwhelmed with things that are still so far off in the future. If you can be at peace with uncertainty try to take things month by month.   I really appreciate that. Thank you.  It's hard though, one moment I'm fine because we communicate how we're both feeling about this to each other, and the next moment I'm questioning our entire situation and over thinking things. This has been really hard for me to process all of this in such a semi-short period of time. And it's all happening so fast."
mypartneristrans,37omhk,PANDADA,3,Sat May 30 04:35:16 2015 UTC,"It's okay to be scared! It's a lot of change, and big change is generally scary regardless!  But do understand, no one ""wants"" to be transgender, they just are. Just like no one wants to be gay, bi or straight, they just are. But your SO makes the decision to transition. But for many, it's necessary to do so to not live in misery. The levels of dysphoria vary from person to person.  Most transwomen do lose libido on the first few months of hormones, but many do get interest back. But also remember, it may not be at the same level it was when their body was full of testosterone. As for sexuality changes, that was a big fear of mine, but from what I've seen, the people reporting this generally aren't in a serious relationship anyway. Of course there ate no guarantees in life anyway. That's for sure...  I do recommend talking to your SO and see if they'd be open to couples counseling. You both need to be very open, honest and communicate A LOT through this. Transition is hard. For your SO and all of their loved ones. It's perfectly normal to have mixed emotions. I'm certainly still coping with anxiety over changes and some grief, my spouse came out to me last June. This sub has also been very helpful. You could also look for a support group in your area. Most of the time they're for trans people, but you might be lucky and find one near you for loved ones."
mypartneristrans,37omhk,saintartaud,1 point,Fri May 29 11:50:52 2015 UTC,"No one ""wants to be trans."" They want to transition because they are trans, because doing so will help them live a happier, healthier, more authentic life. And the scare quotes around ""transitioning"" are indeed concerning. Some of the things you mention can be ways a person who isn't transitioning deals with their dysphoria, but if your partner intends to transition, they are in fact part of the process. I can excuse the pronouns because it seems like you're still adjusting, but I would suggest talking to your partner and seeing what they would prefer. I can't refer to my SO as she/her in many situations right now, but outside of this, that's what I prefer and what helps validate her identity.  It's important right now to talk to your SO, develop a clearer understanding of their feelings, their desires, and a clearer idea of what transition will mean for them. I would also think really hard about what this means for you. Are you OK being perceived as visibly queer? How do you feel about just being with a woman? It may be a good idea to seek out a therapist or simply a close friend to confide in.  There are also support groups for partners, or trans support groups that welcome partners and allies.  And yes, her libido will decrease while initially on HRT. In most cases, it does not disappear and will increase over time as her body adjusts. Though it may never return as strong. Mileage varies. True shifts in orientation are rare, or at least most cases it seems to be less a total shift from men to women (or vice versa) and more an expansion in preference. Not sure to what extent HRT is responsible. My partner's libido has decreased but not disappeared, and she has experienced absolutely no shift in orientation."
mypartneristrans,37omhk,Luhdk,1 point,Fri May 29 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"Several things worry me about this post. Putting the word ""transitioning"" in quotes, using male pronouns the whole way through, saying ""wants to be"" trans (instead of saying they ""are"")... You are flat out in denial. Do you love Her? Are you attracted to Her? Are you ready to let go of 90% if not all of your PIV sex?  You need to ask yourself these questions and answer them honestly to move forward.  That said, I assure you, anyone who is actively going on hormones is NOT uncertain about this. Transitioning your gender is such a colossally hard thing to do, with SO many stigma attached...  do you really think anyone would do this because of a passing flight of fancy or a phase? You need to accept that this is real, it is not a phase, and it is happening."
mypartneristrans,37omhk,Newlywed_No_More,6,Fri May 29 11:33:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't assume pronouns either way (it's why I usually default to they). Some MtF, like my spouse, don't feel comfortable using female pronouns when they're pre-everything and still in the closet.   It's more helpful to gently correct the OP than to shame them (scaring them by saying PIV is going away for instance). They did a good thing by coming here and asking for advice. I do agree with your last couple sentences though. She does need to accept that this is reality now, not a phase."
mypartneristrans,37omhk,Luhdk,1 point,Fri May 29 15:20:41 2015 UTC,"My partner choose male pronouns...for now, at least. He hasn't fully transitioned yet. He's only in process. Like, transitioning without the HRT, per se.   I didn't mean to sound ignorant about these things, I just only very recently started learning & researching about the transgender community. I'm a straight cis female. I'm clueless. I really had no idea about this until he came out to me. Though I'm still-semi confused about all this and I'm still trying to take it all in faster than I thought I would. I'm still new to all this and I know I still have a lot to learn."

mypartneristrans,37omhk,amyl_and_disco,0,Fri Jun 5 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"yeah- I wasn't trying to sound harsh or make assumptions. Sounded like OP needs a reality check. I'm not one to use kid gloves on adults. I try not to be harsh, but we are all adults here, and I treated her as such.   She did seem vulnerable, but open to honest advice.   I think that by coddling spouses that are deeply in denial we actually do tremendous harm to them.   I choose not to coddle adults, though I respect your point of view. That's how I feel most helpful. shrug  no hard feelings or anything. I was just pointing out a couple easily recognizable linguistic red flags and asking some real questions. She said she was scared of hormones- I'm not going to sugar coat it- OP came here for real insight and lived experiences. I choose to honor that.  I think we can all (as adults) assume that anything anyone says on here is based on their personal experience, and Isn't meant to be taken as 100% applicable to every instance everywhere."
mypartneristrans,37omhk,Luhdk,2,Fri May 29 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"FWIW I find your approach immensely helpful, and am always glad to see you chime in on these threads because you don't dance around the hard truths. So many posters come here in distress, and I get why the common response tends toward comfort-at-all-costs but I do think think the coddling's more harmful than helpful. Dating someone through the process of transition isn't easy - and I say this as a trans person who's dated many throughout their transitions. From questioning to coming out to struggling to find and maintain community/stable employment/access to competent health care, it's an uphill battle and (at times) a very selfish and consuming process. Trying to minimize that, or encouraging partners to stick around in situations which make them incredibly uncomfortable, isn't fair to those transitioning or to their confused partners. They come here because they're grappling with overwhelming revelations and painful lines of questioning, and being anything less than honest seems untoward."

That said, and please believe i say this with all the love in the world: Please Brace yourself for the other contingency. It might be awesome, and I really hope it is, but I want you understand that group can also be a bit of a traumatic experience for optimistically curious  first timers who have a good support system. There might be creepy lurkers claiming to be ""allies"" that are CLEARLY old men just looking to jack off later. There might be some women going through an AWFUL divorce, losing their home and custody of their kids... young teens thrown out of their home... people losing their job with no legal recourse... Im just pointing out there could be very real agony there that your partner comes home burdened with, and newly terrified by.  They should still go, and you should cheer them on. Im just pointing out that depending on where you live, your partner might experience the other side of the coin- homelessness, abuse, despair... and I want you to be prepared for that so you can be supportive if your partner needs you to be.  I'm hoping your partner the VERY VERY BEST. I really mean that. And I hope you dont scare them out of going. Just please do your best to be there with open arms when they get home, ready to give out a metric ton of well earned hugs and kisses if it wasnt as great as you both had hoped.  Just be ready for either one.   Sometimes my spouse comes back from group refreshed. But I always have netflix, cookie dough and doritos on standby on thursday nights, just in case its a ""bad thursday"".  My advice: hope for the best, be cheerful, be encouraging, your pride and positive radiance is great, and perfect! Don't worry your partner in any way, there is no need to mention any of this to someone who hasn't gone yet... but I want you to be ready just in case."

They did get a lot out of their time there, but also heard a lot of really difficult stories from the other participants. Fortunately, I think my partner feels confident that their friends and family will be very supportive if and when they transition. It was also just so so nice for them to meet other people going through the same stuff and make some trans friends. They weren't sure if the support group setting is a perfect fit, but it's a good first step. I think they are slowly gaining the courage to see a gender therapist one on one."

I think maybe because the people there are usually still really struggling and depressed.  She has come home quite a few times feeling down in the dumps and discouraged after hearing some of their stories, but recently she joined a new one and it seems to be a lot more positive, and she is seen as kind of the role model for some of the members, so maybe she has finally found one that is helpful!"

I find that when people are trying to get a reaction out of you, that is the best way to feel good about yourself in the end. Don't get me wrong, I expect it will be incredibly difficult not to get angry and I anticipate a lot of failure at the beginning, but I believe it will be the healthiest outcome for me in the end."

mypartneristrans,37j1vv,SleepNowMyThrowaway,3,Thu May 28 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in a very similar boat, though we haven't been tested by going outside yet. I've been in therapy since about mid-February, it's helped immensely with our communication and my aggressive streak.   Take the hint from your wife. She is reacting to these nasty people the way that she wants you to react. It's going to be difficult, especially since you're probably feeling vulnerable and nervous, but she doesn't want a scene. Try deep breathing. It's become my best defense against my anger issues, and has gotten me out of trouble a LOT. Close your eyes, physically turn your back on whatever is bothering you, and breathe in, hold, then breathe out. Gradually you'll be able to calm yourself with just breathing, but I needed the physical cue at first.   This is going to take a lot of effort on your part, and let your wife know that you're trying your best to follow what she wants. Slip ups happen, we're all human, the key is to keep moving forward.   Number one thing to keep in mind- the reactions people have to your wife aren't reflections of her or you- it's those people, their ugliness showing. They can't comprehend anything outside their shallow world view, and unfortunately your words won't get through to them at all."
mypartneristrans,37j1vv,brotddcc,2,Thu May 28 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"I just want to say I feel the same way. We went clothes shopping once after work. Since she's not out at work she was presenting male (she looks more androgynous in male mode now though). She was heading back to the dressing room and the attendant there counted her clothes and then my spouse kind of hesitated because she wasn't sure which dressing room to go into, so the lady was like ""Huh?! You man or woman?!"" while sort of laughing. My wife ended up going into the men's dressing room, but I gave that lady the stink eye when she looked at me after saying it.   I haven't had to deal with anything like you described (yet) because most of the time my wife seems to blend in really well. Though she's still pretty concerned about her voice, but hasn't started voice training yet. I think people see her as female though and just accept she has a deep voice, which some women can have."

Medical fees are a part of tuition, so you should be able to access their clinic - free.  If not, look into planned parenthood and other ways to go informed consent.  Cheaper than paying out of pocket for a few doctor's visits to get on HRT.  You may have to add more hours / take on another job; I'd recomend something with flexible hours and tip income such as Pizza delivery, uber driver, waitress, bartender etc.  I also had a midnight job holding down a desk at a long stay motel as the night clerk when in school; quiet and plenty of time to study.  Laser can be tabled for now to save money, but the sperm banking needs taken care of if she's going to be on HRT.  Sounds like you are on good terms with parents? If so, they might pony up for the banking so as to insure grandkids.  It might be something they would help out with if you explained the cashflow bind you're in and the fact that you've got a narrow window to get stuff banked.  All I can think of off hand; really hope you two can get things sorted as it sounds like you've got a great relationship :)"
mypartneristrans,37ifgu,SleepNowMyThrowaway,0,Wed May 27 23:21:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the school clinic thing. She just turned 26 and is off of her mom's insurance, so we're scrambling to find her a new provider.   Informed consent?   I don't have a job, and due to physical issues I can just barely handle part time schooling and house work. She tried a job before to pay off other student debts from failing a class- dropped it as soon as she paid off the debt.   Laser has already been paid for, so that's pretty much done. Apparently doctors will take you more seriously or something if you're done or close to being done with laser hair removal? I'm a bit fuzzy on my specifics, but that's her general reasoning.   Her dad isn't in the picture (and it's a good thing!) and her mom is doing the best she can. She's had to help us with a car- my girlfriend's was at the point of no return- has fixed numerous things in the house like the sewage (ceramic pipes and tree roots, yay!), bathroom, ect. and really just helps as often as she can."

Also, if you and your wife haven't already talked about how to keep the relationship balanced during/after her transition, do so.

mypartneristrans,36x93o,lemonadeghost,2,Fri May 22 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"Hi. My wife is mtf & i am cis straight. We've been married for 23 1/2 years & have just recently been coming out of the closet. She started with her sister face to face & then they strategized how to tell their parents. She decided to send them a letter. It was actually received better than we had anticipated.   I then told one of my brothers. We discussed what information needed to be in the letter going to my family members. Before sending those letters, my brother read them & gave us feedback. We also had our therapists read the letters & give feedback. My family is rather dysfunctional & has boundary issues so my therapist suggested I write a cover letter, then there was my wife's letter & finally I write a follow up letter answering a few questions family members may have (are we staying together, job situation, etc) & a list of ways they can support us. These included: continue to love us; be respectful, keep your negative judgmental comments to yourself; don't suggest conversion therapy, it doesn't work & it's harmful; don't tell me to divorce [ ]. Reactions from my family have been mixed. Mostly they were shocked & are still processing. I still haven't heard from my ultra religious sister. Oh well.  We are in the process of coming out to friends/neighbors. The ones we've come out to have all been supportive. So far, these have been face to face encounters, but we are working on letters which will be sent out to our extended families & the rest of our friends within the next couple of weeks.   Coming out at work for my wife has been a gradual process. She first came out to her supervisor & then to the human resources rep. They have been working on a plan for telling everyone else. Her company has a zero tolerance policy for discrimination & is being very supportive. There will be an email sent out to all employees letting them know about her being trans (still presenting male at work for the time being) in a couple of weeks. She has told a few close coworkers herself, but not many.   If you would like copies of letters, pm me. If I can help in any other way, lmk. This is a hard thing....coming out. It has felt all consuming lately."
mypartneristrans,36x93o,baronsmom,2,Sat May 23 08:00:46 2015 UTC,"Hi! We are in the same boat... I am a lesbian cis female married to a gorgeous MtF woman. We were known to everyone as a straight couple. To EVERYONE. The reactions we got when we told people were completely all over the scale. As far as telling my family, it was difficult. It did not end pretty. I knew it wouldn't, so I made sure a close friend was there - he has a clear head, deals with emotional people well, and made sure to keep everyone in check. My family has dis-owned me. I'm pretty sure I am seen as the devil incarnate from their point of view.  Her family was amazing, they have been supportive, kind, and even used the right pronouns right off the bat.  My friends, since I tend to hang out with relaxed, accepting people anyway, did very well, although it took a few of them a while to adjust.  The key to all of it, I guess, is just being as bluntly honest as you can. I tried to ""dance"" around certain topics like sex, legalities, uncomfortable topics for most people, and I learned by the end not to do so. The few people that didn't react well (for the most part) just didn't understand what ""Trans"" was, and had so many questions. Just answer them. Be honest.  Now with that said, of course like what baronsmom suggested below... don't allow negative comments, absolutely don't suggest divorce, and make sure you and your spouse are okay with whatever is being discussed.  I am suprised everyday with just how accepting most people are... my neighbors love us, her family has adopted me completely, our friends back us up 100% to death even though some don't understand it completely, and our work has made it clear management supports us as well. All this, in the middle of Oklahoma!  There are some things I can't really offer advice on, like the work situation. Hang in there... I guess I would just say that it gets better, most people are more accepting than you think they will be, and just love your wife! If you cling to each other, and it sounds like you have an amazing relationship, then everything is gonna be okay!! Hugs for both of you!! =)))))"
mypartneristrans,36x93o,dragonkat,2,Sat May 23 14:45:11 2015 UTC,"First, let me say that is amazing that you guys are staying together and working it all through together. Not many couples do, even after trying to do so. So bravo! My wife (MtF also) and I (cis straight woman, though this experience has brought me to realize that I am just as attracted to her as a woman as I was when she was a man, even more probably) are going through a similar scenario. She came out to me roughly 2 years ago after being together for 11 years (married 8 years) and I feel that though we struggled for the first year, we are so much closer and way more in love now than we ever really were. She is my best friend and I can't imagine life without her. I know the struggles that you both are facing. It is hard to tell exactly how someone will react, regardless of their background with the community. When we began telling people (we still have only told a few), she told a close friend, who was very accepting and then her brother, who was not at all (seriously a bad experience). We have been lucky so far that her brother has been the only negative reaction. We still have only told close friends and other than her brother, none of our family knows. We are prepared for unacceptance and possibly even shunning because of our backgrounds. She was raised in a very conservative, Christian household. her father was the head deacon and her mother was a deaconess. My family doesn't have the religious aspect but my step father is a d*ck (he's extremely racist, prejudice against anyone different from himself, even his family) and my mother is a pushover and does whatever the bastard wants her to do, even if it means abandoning a relationship with her children. Hence why we haven't told family yet.   However, when it comes to friends, I think the best thing you can do is think about what you want to say and be completely prepared for the typical questions (hows your relationship going, will you take  hormones, are you having surgery, are you going to change your name, how long will it take, how long have you known, how do you know, etc.) and not just when you come out. Friends may not think about questions they might have until later as the transition is happening. They also may not realize that some questions are insensitive since they are your close friends and are used to talking about anything. But, just tell them that it is inappropriate to ask the questions that you or your wife are uncomfortable with and I am sure they will understand. My wife has answered questions with some people and not others. It is really all about how comfortable you and your wife are with the person asking and how much information you want to share. They aren't asking out of malice. It is all out of curiosity. In terms with how you should do it, I think it depends on the person. We have close friends that do not live in the same area as us so we sent them a very detailed email that also included answers to typical questions they may have. We haven't had any negative responses to that. Those that do live in the same area, we sat them down at our home or theirs and basically said ""hey, he's transgender and would like to be referred to as female"" and then went from there.   In terms of employment, she hasn't come out to her employer or her direct supervisor and team. We are nervous to do that because it is an unknown. You never know what will happen and we are concerned about her losing her job, especially when I do not have one (finding one has been extremely difficult, even with my degrees). I do suggest that when she does come out to work, she take notes of when and where it happened, who was around at the time and what reactions were (including facial expressions). This way, if she is fired for any reason afterwards, especially the stupid unjust reasons, she can use that for unemployment or even a discrimination lawsuit. Do keep in mind that it is a federal offense to discriminate based on gender and most states include transgender issues within that federal law.   As far as your neighbors are concerned, I would just live normally and if they are concerned, they can come to you about it and you can explain then. We haven't told any of our neighbors (as we aren't close with any of them, just casual Hellos and Goodbyes) and so far there haven't been any issues or odd looks or anything of the likes since she started leaving the house in ""girl mode"" as we call it since she is still living as both male and female until she is ready to come out permanently. The landlord is also bound by discrimination laws (I believe) and cannot terminate a contract (your lease) without a legitimate reason nor can she raise the rent if it is stated in the lease that the rate is locked in. However, if it is a concern, I would address it as I suggested with the job. Take a note of how she reacts and when/where the conversation happened. Protect yourselves.   In terms of fallout, like I mentioned, the only (fortunately) negative reaction we have had to deal with was her brother. He basically said that it was unfair to him and everyone to be transgender and he is not sure if he can ever accept that she is no longer his brother or refer to her by her chosen name instead of birth name. Since he was told, there has been very little communication and it has mostly been via email. The emails never really mention much about the transition and are more about his life. We have accepted that if he does come around to it, it will be a long time as it does not seem like he is willing to even attempt to accept.   If you are truly concerned for your safety when telling anyone, I would avoid telling them in person and instead use phone or email as the means of communication, at least until you know how they react to it.   If you want to talk more about our experience or even just as gaining new friends, feel free to message me! Good luck with coming out, keep us all updated with how things go as you begin telling people. And again, congrats on having the strong and amazing relationship you do!"
mypartneristrans,36uhn7,Ironard,3,Fri May 22 05:53:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't make a thing about it - since chances are, he wants to ignore it as much as possible - but do what you can in the most lowkey ways to make him comfortable. Put darker sheets on the bed if you've got them (I had soooo much anxiety about ruining someone's sheets that I could barely sleep, which only made me crankier), offer him backrubs/footrubs, if you have a heating pad on hand it's a nice touch. Offer him ibuprofen or whatever you've got for pain. Basically handle it like you would if he had a cold or a sports injury, just some extra TLC and consideration. This post is really sweet, by the way!"

mypartneristrans,36l3pc,SA-wife,9,Wed May 20 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"So... When you wrote this post, why didn't you use male pronouns to refer to him...? This is a good space to practice. Practice all the time, even in your head. It will take time."
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,markoyolo,8,Wed May 20 05:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, this! Writing is a great way to practice this, as it's lower stakes and allows for you to edit. One exercise a friend suggested is to write about some of your memories of the person, using their preferred pronouns all the way through. This helps you practice in the moment, but also can help reframe your understanding of those situations as well as reminding you of their importance in your life and the journey you're sharing.   When you slip up, do correct yourself - it doesn't need to be a big apology, just a quick ""he"" interjected will mean a lot to your partner. I can't tell you how much it means to have someone get your language right, that early in transition - and when it's the person you come home to at the end of the day, it can offset all the long exhausting days of being misgendered out in public.   Practice all you can in private, and if you find it too hard in person, maybe just use your partner's name (if they're comfortable with that - sometimes we change all our words at once, which makes that tricky) and terms of endearment until your perspective shifts a bit. The more you practice, though, the quicker you'll settle into the habit, and the more your partner will appreciate your efforts."
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,amyl_and_disco,2,Wed May 20 09:43:48 2015 UTC,Thank you for all your help and suggestions! We live with my family and no one knows which is mainly the reason  as its only in private that I can refer to him like this. I will keep practicing as I want to be as supportive as I can!
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,PANDADA,3,Wed May 20 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's a process, especially when not everyone knows and you have to switch back and forth depending on who you're talking to! My wife continues to present male around her mom so whenever we visit I'm always afraid I'll slip up. Not with male pronouns/name, but with the female and then her mom will flip out! I really don't want to be the person to ignite that fire."
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,meagan51422,4,Wed May 20 21:54:26 2015 UTC,"It gets easier. It's awkward because it goes against what you're used to. It took me forever to refer to my wife as her current name and pronouns. I couldn't imagine thinking of her any other way now. I promise you, it gets easier until one day you wake up and realize you're not even trying anymore.   I can only speak for myself when I say this but my problems were rooted in the fact that I didn't recognize her as a her yet. I felt supportive of her but in my mind she still very much felt like the person I had known for the past two years and that was a guy. It's like I was holding onto a memory of who she used to pretend to be and it was hard to let that image of the person I fell in love with go. I guess I wasn't ready to see her as a woman yet and so it was hard. As I started making new memories with her as a woman  it got easier. Your problem probably lies with the fact that you haven't given it enough time to get used to yet.   Correct yourself everytime you say it incorrectly. He will be very thankful that you are trying to change your habits. If nothing else, avoid pronouns all together until you get used to the idea of him."
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,PANDADA,1 point,Wed May 20 06:17:56 2015 UTC,"Like everyone is suggesting, use male pronouns when writing/typing and it will help you when it comes time to say it verbally."
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,kaorte,1 point,Wed May 20 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"It is difficult at first. Writing does help tremendously, as well as having friends who are in the know to talk to. It took me a while to switch over. I mainly avoided pronoun use until I knew I wasn't going to slip up. Having to still switch genders in front of certain people is difficult, so I mainly just avoid pronouns in front of people who aren't in the know."
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,bookwormxx,1 point,Thu May 21 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"I completely understand.  It takes time to adjust.  For me, it's still hard, because I've known my spouse as my seemingly masculine partner for 10+ years, and she is still presenting as male most of the time to most of the world.  It's also hard to just switch over to 'my wife' when talking about her to coworkers, because I know it will trigger a lot of questions.  To top all that off, I have a stubborn 6 year old who asks me to stop using female pronouns when I make a point to do so.  It distresses her sometimes, and I feel that her feelings are just as important as my spouse's.  Eventually we will have to force it more, but when her dad looks the same as other people's dads, I can understand her discomfort with female pronouns.  My spouse is really laid back about it, so I guess I haven't had the motivation to change in all settings like I should (or would, if it bothered her more).  I agree with PPs that it was easiest for me to start with using female pronouns in writing, or starting with 'they' and then slowly working my way to female pronouns.  My hope is that it will become easier as she begins to look more feminine and present as female all or most of the time.  I'm grateful that my spouse has been patient with me.  I have noticed that some people get attacked on here for not using correct pronouns from day 1, and I think that's a little unfair.  I have said it kind of reminds me of when I got married and took my spouse's last name; neither name felt 'right' for awhile until I adjusted, and sometimes my maiden name just slipped out of my mouth out of habit."
mypartneristrans,36l3pc,saintartaud,1 point,Wed May 27 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"As already noted, you don't address him as ""him"" in your post. It's ok, it's only been a month and you're still adjusting. Took me a while to get consistent with pronouns too and I still mess up sometimes, partly because she's not full time and I have to use different names/pronouns. Hard to keep it all straight!  But yeah, one thing that helped me was writing about my partner as she/her. I also started using some pet names at home that were more girly, like girl and lady. Which is silly but helped me adjust. It's also validating for her. :)"
mypartneristrans,36dnfm,SweetHaunches,8,Mon May 18 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize. Being supportive doesn't always mean staying together romantically. You have to trust that she will make the best decision for her, and then you have to trust yourself to make the best decision for you. You may always love her, but if that aspect of your relationship won't work without a penis, then it won't work. You've been up front about it, and that is the best thing you could do. The hardest part about all of this is being honest that you have no idea if it's going to all turn out okay."
mypartneristrans,36dnfm,eatlifenow,3,Mon May 18 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"Its ok to mourn your sex life. It's ok to not stay together. You also need to make an unbiased decisions for what will make you happy as well. As others have said being supportive doesn't have to mean continuing in a romantic relationship.  Before I say this I know that many people are hetrosexual and can't change their orientation. However, have you tried more lesbian oriented sex? Have her wear a strap on? Before you write off your sex life maybe experiment with someone you love. Lots of women have satisfying sex lives together. Of course it's not for everyone, but just a suggestion if you haven't tried."

(As an aside, I find it really interesting that you go from using female pronouns to male pronouns in the course of this post.) Transition is an intensely personal process, and while it deeply affects the people closest to us, and we may ask for and honor their input, at the end of the day we ALL have the right to self-determination. She needs to decide for herself what feels necessary and where she's willing to compromise, just as you must do the same for yourself. She may have thought she could live with her body as is, and probably tried her damnedest - the fights lately may well be heightened because her best efforts feel futile. But turning her anatomy into a dealbreaker stings because trans women (and women in general, honestly) are so frequently reduced to their anatomy and treated as sex objects. It may feel to her as though you love her, or stay with her, because of her anatomy, which is causing her distress.  It sounds right now as though your needs are conflicting. Give her the time and space she needs to check in with herself and decide where her lines are and how she'll proceed, and use this time to get right with yourself and take stock of your own needs and boundaries. Transition is rarely all-or-nothing, and these changes require time and communication."
mypartneristrans,36bha7,AzaleaFlower,25,Mon May 18 00:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'll confess something to you: I miss him too sometimes.   Thankfully, I have always been more sexually attracted to women. I think that's key here. I sort of saw this coming all along, ever since we were kids.  It all kind of made perfect sense when she came out to me, and I was elated. and I love the T&A, and I love makeup time, and god... i just CHERISH our lives together- I have fallen completely in love with my 'Bae 2.0'... I truly have from the bottom of my heart.  Sex is great, it is all great. I would sooner die than wake up next to anyone else.   But sometimes, I miss him. It barely ever happens, but hey... 'he' was my 1st love... my only real love. And it isn't even missing the convenience, the EASE of being a straight couple. Sex Kids Getting Dressed in the morning Job Friends Going out on a Date... SO many things were just easier, but in those quiet little moments, it Isn't even the convenience of that context that i miss. I just miss the person my therapist coined as ""the only boy I ever loved in a sexual and romantic way"". That said, that complicated ""trans"" context is real, and it is overwhelming. The awkwardness you reference sounds like you are trying to take on more than you can by yourself. You have to be real with your spouse if you are suffering so you can both support each other.   I will share this with you, as someone who truly is delightfully happy and in love and accepting: even I cry occasionally because I'll never have my spouses kids. That fact hangs over me every day. I don't bring it up all the time, but when it is wounding me particularly badly, when facebook shoved too many babies in my face and I just feel like crying for ME, I do, and my SO knows why, because I tell her.  Sometimes the light just catches her green eyes and I cant help but remember when we were teens, when I would lie in 'his' arms in my college dorm room and fantasize about having an adorable quiet son with those beautiful green eyes... It is hard when you have memories stretching back over a decade.  It makes it harder to reconcile the simple pain of letting go of this person you loved. I really do understand. Its more than circumstance. Its the person. You miss him. It's okay. Of all the COMPLETELY justified crap that I could RIGHTFULLY complain about on a daily basis about trans-existence at large... That simple occasional pang of ""I miss him"" is, in fact, the hardest to deal with. And the hardest to say out loud. So, I get the guilt and shame, I get the sorrow- honey, I feel you.   Now I am going to say some things you probably don't want to think about, but should. Do you Love Her? Are you attracted to Her? Are you ready and excited to continue on this adventure of life with Her?   Sometimes I think about how everyone changes. Sometimes that helps. I have put on some weight, gotten older... I'm 30 now, I fell in love with my SO in high school. I'm sure sometimes My SO misses the person I used to be when we were just kids- I'm sure she misses my short hair. We just happened to fall in love all over again in this different context, and I'm so grateful for that. I'm seriously one lucky woman. The Luckiest.   I digress. My point is: Gender aside, people change all the time. Sometimes they lose their legs in a car accident. Sometimes they gain a lot of weight. Sometimes brain injuries leave a person different.   Sometimes a person will make a sudden 180. Sometimes someone will take out all of their piercings, dye their pink hair blonde, quit the performing arts, don a suit and join corporate america to make BANK as an executive by turning their back on their dreams as an artist. [<---me]   Sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, sometimes physically, sometimes emotionally, people change. Sometimes the change can be so drastic that it isnt the same person anymore. It happens, it is okay. Sometimes couples adapt and cope, sometimes they do not.  It sounds like you really don't want this, and for that I am sorry. I am not going to tell you that you need to move on. I will not tell you there is no way you can make this work without a compatible sexuality to base it on. I think you are actually perfectly aware of that, and it terrifies you already. At least acknowledge what you have already said yourself: you need to get over the lingering denial, let go of 'him' and accept that this is happening. You need to clear that hurdle with yourself and let go of 'him' before you can know for sure what the future holds for you and your spouse as a woman. And that is a hard hard thing to do... so hard. Especially when you have been together for so long.  There's definitely real mourning that needs to happen. Let it happen. Ask the hard questions. Work with a therapist.  Even if you do manage to fall madly in love with her, I am not going to tell you that you'll ever stop missing 'him'. You will.   As painful as it is, my advice is, start to talk to your SO very directly about the ""pretending"" and how it is affecting you personally.  I wouldn't go so far as to push them to come out to family, but I would certainly mention the toll it is taking on you. It sounds like you aren't talking about it enough. You really cant let this fester under the surface, it will destroy you. Confront it with as much love as you can muster.  It's okay to hurt, It is okay to miss ""him"". It is okay to want to keep those thoughts inside, because you don't want to hurt the person you love. At least you seem to know that you need to look forward to what the future holds and reconcile it, whatever that means to you.  That's a step in the right direction.  Whether you go your separate ways, or whether you keep working at it, I wish you the best.   Edit: Wow Gilded! Thanks Kind Stranger! That makes my day! :D"

My spouse has moved into our spare bedroom (as of this past weekend), and so far the arrangement seems to be working out.  We still get along great and enjoy each other's company, but the sexual/romantic connection is just no longer there, and I feel so much better now that I have my own space.

mypartneristrans,36bha7,PANDADA,4,Tue May 26 13:11:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I felt the way you did a lot, especially a few months into it all. It's okay to miss the person you thought your partner was and who the two of you were together. As much as transition changes the transitioning person, it also changes those closest to them and those relationships. I missed who I was and we were before I found out, as much as I missed my husband.  ""I don't want this"" became a bit of a mantra early on for me when I found out. I railed on the injustice of it, the tragedy of it. I got angry, depressed, denied that it was what it is. I did not want that to be my reality. But I also didn't want to call it quits and didn't want to lose my best friend and life partner. I still wanted my partner's love and companionship. I still get sad that the man I married will never be a father to my children. But I still want us to have children.  For us, there was a lot of awkward feelings (and still are) about the changes we're (still) undergoing. It's a lot to get used to and it's okay for that to be hard and awkward and unpleasant sometimes. And it is different when it's one's partner as opposed to a friend or acquaintance, because it affects you and who you are and who you are as a couple. I will always hold my husband in my heart. We shared so much and he is still a large part of who I have become. But I am also making space for who she is now. And have let go of most of the visions I had of our future when we were still man and wife and replacing them with plans for our life as we are now.   And as easier as it would be otherwise, I'm not attracted to women, either. I'm not a lesbian. I'm not bisexual. But I also am not going to let my sexuality determine with whom I make my life. I don't think of us as lesbians. I don't even think of my partner as a woman in that sense...more just a person. A person I love. Gender is outside of our relationship, for me, at this point. And I know that should our situation become more or less than I want, there are other options we can explore. We can live as friends. We can explore having an open relationship or polyamory or whatever we feel like we need. We can even part ways if that's what's best. But for now I remain true to my commitment to a life built together. I live in the present and take it day by day, week by week.  And having others be unaware is both a blessing and a curse at times. It gives me a sense of normality sometimes to know that most people have no idea, but it can also be isolating. I would encourage you to find someone you can trust, whether a friend or a therapist or whoever and let them know (discuss with your partner first). You probably need someone to unload on and give you support (beyond internet folks)--someone other than your partner, especially since you mentioned feeling so guilty and ashamed. My personal belief is that we should not feel ashamed of (most) of our feelings. A person cannot help how he, she or ze feels, though one can help how one understands and responds to those feelings.   Mourn your loss if that's what you need. Because it is a loss. Even if folks think that a transperson is the same person, they might not be the same person to you. And that can feel like a loss, one as deeply felt as a death. It is great that you have been as supportive as you can, but do not forget to support yourself and seek support from your spouse, and it'd probably be a good idea to seek support from a counselor (couples and/or individual) if you haven't already.  I wish you the best."
mypartneristrans,36bha7,SleepNowMyThrowaway,2,Mon May 18 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I have no doubt that you really do know what I'm going through. It really does feel like a loss of that person sometimes, and I really relate with you about feeling isolated since there's that normalcy since no one on our outside really knows what's going on.  Sometimes I can almost pretend that everything is how it was and his parents, my parents see us as the same two people we were.  But when we get home, my spouse goes in their room and I sit in the living room and  everything becomes gray again.  That sounds overly dramatic but it's truly how it is.  I'm taking this one day at a time. And some days are better and we smile more and joke more. But most are very isolating and lonely.  Thank you for your sharing. Really."
mypartneristrans,36bha7,bookwormxx,2,Mon May 18 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"""I don't want this"" became a bit of a mantra early on for me when I found out. I railed on the injustice of it, the tragedy of it. I got angry, depressed, denied that it was what it is. I did not want that to be my reality. But I also didn't want to call it quits and didn't want to lose my best friend and life partner. I still wanted my partner's love and companionship. I    This sounds exactly like what I went through...."

I believe it's important to realize she is still the same person, as kind, thoughtful, and her smile is the same and likely bigger now that's she's becoming her truest self.  I don't know if couples therapy can help you, as it's not going to rewire your brain, but you could still try a few sessions?  I think of my transition, and invert it to imagine how I'd feel if my wife came out as a trans man.  Today, I'd have no problem with it, but 10 years ago? Five, even?  I don't know.  You're mourning as though your husband is dead, but he isn't.  She's becoming who she always was, and that takes a special kind of courage.  If you can't be with a woman, as you've stated, hopefully you'll be able to remain friends and help her at what's most likely the most difficult, and lonely part of her life.  There's no shame in being unable to stay, you cannot change your sexuality by force of will.  I hope you both find peace no matter how your situation resolves."

It would be shitty if she said it but then expected me to stay with her even if the relationship no longer suits my sexuality, but she wants me to be happy, too.

mypartneristrans,36bha7,bookwormxx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:09:18 2015 UTC,"It each their own. It's good that her honesty helped you.  However, transitioning and asking her partner to stay (even if she didn't expect you to) is a double standard when she admits if she was the one with a transitioning spouse she doesnt think she would stay. It's ""I'm transitioning to a woman but I still want you to be my wife"" but ""I really want a female partner though, so if you were transitioning to a man we would break up.""  I personally would find that hurtful. That said, partners do share hurtful thoughts with their SOs from time to time, and are able to work through them."

It's a great way to make friends, and having something to do that isn't dependant on him will help a lot, for both of you. Are you crafty or music oriented? There's tons of options for both of these. Lots of local community colleges have classes that you can take on weekends or evenings for fun. I have done photography and sign language this way. You really need something you can enjoy on your own and you might accidently make friends that way."

When you are in a relationship with someone transitioning, it really is all about them but what people don't realize sometimes is that YOU are in this as well. You are there support at home. You are making changes as well, not just for them but for yourself too. You have to learn to be comfortable with the fact that what started as one relationship is now becoming a totally new relationship. It is difficult and you do need support. You can definitely find people on here to chat with but I do suggest seeing a counselor to help you deal with coping and the adjustment and feeling left behind even though you are right there next to him. It helps, I promise. I wish you the best and hope that you find a support structure soon. We are all here for you!"
mypartneristrans,36b4fh,crumbletwig,3,Sun May 17 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"You don't have to tell everybody, and your partner may be thrilled to skip out on the wedding anyway. But it's worth considering that a lot of trans women rightfully are upset to be hidden away, because it happens so damn much. I've heard so many transfeminine friends lament that, while dudes are clamoring to sleep with them, no one wants to date them or be seen with them in public. Visibility is a major concern here; feeling claimed by our loved ones, like they're proud to be seen with us, is a really big deal. This may not be an occasion where you both feel comfortable showing up, and that's fine. But I think that it's worth talking with her about it, and letting her know that, as you said, you love her and are proud to be with her. She may not want to go anyway - but it means a whole lot to be given the option."
mypartneristrans,36b4fh,amyl_and_disco,2,Mon May 18 17:53:14 2015 UTC,"Would have said pretty much exactly this, but u/amyl_and_disco beat me to it. :)  I will add that even in the most WELCOMING and IDEAL of circumstances, there are still bumps in the road. Personally, I would recommend practicing dealing with that. But that's just what works for me, and I realize it isn't for everyone.   I have kind of the opposite situation: My family and their close friends are queer old hippies. Both of my parents are admittedly ""on the spectrum"" in terms of queerness- they have trans friends, and LOTS of gay and lesbian friends, and they raised me around that group. Just a bunch of friendly, truly lovely very open minded people. I never thought that it was at all a difficult thing to be gay or trans until I grew up and left the compound so to speak. They're great. We like them.   Anyway, fast forward to last year- I'm bringing my MtF SO to meet the whole crew and friends of the family for the 1st time. It was my dad's 60th birthday party. My SO packed an adorable mustard yellow skirt- I really thought that in that safe space, it might be her 1st time wearing a dress to a party. I was super proud, and so excited for her. When the time came, well, it was just too much too soon. She just couldn't wear that outfit in front of people she had never met. I was, I'll admit, a teeeensey pinch disappointed when she opted for something more gender neutral- but my point is, its her experience that matters most to me at any given moment. 100%. My selfish desire to show my parents and their friends that 'we' were 'comfortable in their space' was absolutely trumped by my genuine concern for her happiness and her comfort. That's the takeaway here. When it comes to your comfort at being out as a lesbian, that's perfectly fair- Your comfort matters too! I would just second the above sentiment and reiterate that yes, in this instance you have to be very mindful while you reconcile your own sexuality that you are making absolutely sure that your beloved doesn't end up feeling like a secret, or like less of a priority.    TLDR: Sometimes I need to cool it on the 'outness'. My advice: talk about your feelings honestly, listen to hers, and do whatever makes you both most comfortable as a whole couple."
mypartneristrans,36b4fh,Luhdk,2,Mon May 18 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's in large part up to your partner, isn't it?  You guys should definitely be communicating and making decisions together as a couple, but at the end of the day the choice of who and when or even if to come out about being trans rests in her hands."
mypartneristrans,36b4fh,churakaagii,1 point,Mon May 18 01:59:49 2015 UTC,"My partner is openly out for a couple of months.  In hindsight this post might be more about me not being completely  out about living in a lesbian relationship now (which is a realisation that still sneaks up to me from time to time) So far she opted not coming to bigger gatherings with my family so it has been too easy and convinient to avoid the issue.  I don't want her to think I'm ashamed of her or some bs, I don't want to lie about my relationship, but do I have to tell everybody?"
mypartneristrans,36b4fh,kaorte,2,Mon May 18 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"I think it is fine to want to keep things quiet, I know I sure as hell do for the time being. Coming out to my immediate family and then extended family is terrifying. I think it is reasonable to want to avoid the impossible fight.   I've slowly shared the fact that my partner is trans with my friends one by one. This does not usually involve me telling anyone I am a lesbian as I feel like my sexual orientation is really not relevant or any of their business. I personally identify as Bi or Pan-sexual.   I think eventually you will have to spill the beans, but its up to the two of you when that happens. What does she have to say about it? If she is comfortable keeping it on the down low for a while then I think its fine. It's just as much about your comfort level as it is hers."

Of y'all decide to come out I think talking to your sister-in-law about how she thinks her family would feel or how to let the cat out of the bag is important. She would have the best insight into their minds. Buuutttt Like everyone else says though not revealing is fine. The physical and emotional safety of you and your gf is most important.
mypartneristrans,369czl,practicalBanana,4,Sun May 17 13:19:26 2015 UTC,"I wish I had advice, but I just wanted to say I empathise with you on the feeling of having no control. I do feel as if I'm just being swept along in the current sometimes.   To be honest, you're doing more than me to try and look after yourself, so I don't have much to add - but I think it's ok to just be sad sometimes. Try not to make the mistake of just making yourself busy. It sounds like you could use some quiet time."
mypartneristrans,369czl,bookpig,3,Sun May 17 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, healing and coping is a long process. When my wife and I separated and were heading for divorce, I was crying randomly at work, and then I'd come home and cry a bunch too. That was the first couple of weeks. I had also lost all of my appetite so I was barely eating too.  I had therapy every week, where I'd also cry. I also went back to an old psychiatrist to get anxiety medication. In the beginning, there were times where I felt so anxious I was just shaking. My hands were shaking at work. I tried a tiny dose of Xanax at home once and it knocked me out, so I couldn't take it at work. But at home I just wanted to sleep so I didn't have to feel the pain. But I'd usually have nightmares too, so it wasn't really much of an escape anyway.  I had no motivation or energy. I also had no local friends to spend time with to distract me, so I was pretty much alone. My mom said some pretty insensitive things so even being around my family was painful so I told them I needed space. Eventually I pushed myself to start going to board game meetups every Saturday to at least kill a few hours out of the weekend. That's all I was doing really, just trying to find things to pass time because nothing was fun or enjoyable to me anymore. I was severely depressed. Then I posted an ad on Reddit to try to meet people in my area (for platonic friendship only). I was hoping to meet new people, people that didn't know what I was going through, that didn't have to know. Someone I could meet outside of the situation. But even that was difficult. One guy started talking about his ex and I just broke down. That was terrible and I felt so bad breaking down in front of this guy I barely knew. He was really nice though and we went to a bar. We stayed in touch for a while, but he seems to have disappeared now.  In short, you're doing all the right things. My therapist was impressed that I was trying to meet people and pushing myself to go to meetups. It doesn't make things instantly better though. I knew it'd be a very very long time before I'd feel truly good again (if we had stayed on the path to divorce). I'm still going to therapy every two weeks and still taking anxiety medication. Regardless of staying together or separating, it's a lot to cope with and adjust to."
mypartneristrans,369czl,PANDADA,2,Sun May 17 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"I am also a programmer (yay!) and am pretty sure my mom isn't too far from having NPD. I could have written your post myself a few months ago. Everything can be OK and then suddenly that 'one too many things' happens and it all goes to crap.   The move. It sounds like you can't deal with this right now. Try to tell your partner how overwhelmed you're feeling and agree to discuss it again in a couple weeks?  Feeling like everyone is all up in your business. Get your partner to deal with her mom - hopefully now that the mom isn't there anymore you can breathe a little easier. And your co-worker... ugh. Is working from home a possibility? even a couple days might help you gather yourself back up. Taking care of yourself. What I do is pretend I have an identical twin, and then think about what they would want. It's much easier for me than thinking about what I want (which I realize sounds crazy, but it works for me). The standard advice of taking a hot bath, or going to get a manicure etc is just not as satisfying to me as putting a new spice rack up in the kitchen, or purging some baby clothes. Work hard on identifying what makes you (or your pretend twin) happy and then do that. At work, I practice checking in with myself by asking 'what do I want right now' each time I finish a chunk of code. It's surprisingly helpful.   Try to be gentle with yourself, and gentle with your feelings. I have had more feelings in the past few months than I have in the past few years! I dislike being emotional, and feeling everything has been very uncomfortable for me. I've found that Reiki helps me process my emotions better than I can on my own.  And remember that having a partner transition IS hard. All the things you're currently doing to take care of yourself are amazing, especially under the circumstances."

There is nothing worse than being swept along in the current of everyone else's agendas.  Are you married to your partner as you talk about a visit by the mother in law?    Firstly whilst your work environment does not sound great from the perspective of being a conservative place of work in which fellow workers express misogynistic, homophobic and trans phobic views.   Are they aware of the status of your relationship i.e. That your partner is Trans and you are in a lesbian relationship.  It sounds as if you currently have a secure job (as secure as any job can be) if you followed your partner across the country would you be moving a job or just hoping to find one.  I can understand your partner wanting to have a fresh start when he goes a women full time but again are they moving to a job or are they hoping that where you both move to will offer better opportunities that your current location.  If it is just hoping for jobs then I would suggest that it is a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire.  It really does sound like you need some professional help to help get your life back on track for you and s*d everyone else.  If getting your life sort happens to meet the objectives of other people in your life great but the person that matter the most is you.   Is your partner getting counselling if so it sounds like the Therapist needs to include you in some of the sessions"
mypartneristrans,367h4u,ladymrsa,9,Sat May 16 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"What I advocate is the ""hard love"" stance. This particular stance is basically sort of like avoidance therapy. Every time she starts being nasty, saying something like ""Mom. I know your opinion. You're allowed to have it, but I will not allow disrespect to me and my boyfriend. If you continue pushing the issue, I'm going to walk away."" And do it. Or hang up, if you're on the phone.   Now, obviously, this won't work for the truly nasty sorts, but the more you disengage with things like ""Mom, we've talked about this. Drop it, or I walk away."" the more she'll hopefully realize it doesn't work. Rather like dealing with children who are demanding negative attention. You don't give them any attention until they stop being a pill."

mypartneristrans,3673dz,amyl_and_disco,3,Sat May 16 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"Ugh this post is really fucking cute, okay. I'm functionally FTM and can report that navigating sex and especially dating with cis gay guys can be a really unsettling process, because gay culture is so phallocentric and so many gay men express utter disgust for vaginas. So if you're down to please him and find him really hot, by all means, voice it! I definitely second-guess with gay men more than any other demographic and having someone express their interest and enthusiasm is paramount in these encounters.   Your post doesn't make clear whether you're already hooking up, or how that's going, but in general you want to follow his lead, starting with language. Plenty of trans guys enjoy penetration and receiving oral but you definitely don't want to assume - queer transmasc tops are out there, and some of us experience hella bottom dyshoria. I'm all in favor of vague ungendered terms when talking about genitalia until your partner expresses a preference - 'junk', 'equipment', 'business' are safer, sillier options than technical names for parts. Personally, I find mutual masturbation a really hot and low-pressure way to get a sense of what someone's into and how they like to be touched - your guy may be shy around that, but could be worth a try! If you feel comfortable initiating contact by placing his hands on or gently pushing his head toward the spots that feel good for you, he may feel comfortable guiding you in the same ways, which is one way to cut out the awkward guesswork around language. I'm happy to answer any awkward questions you're unsure about asking him, 'cause I know how that goes, but ultimately what matters is showing him that you're not afraid of or weirded out by his body, that you're really into him specifically and dying to know what makes him feel good, and that you have solid communication skills and a sense of humor - those are pretty crucial. Good luck!"

We've made it to second base, heavy petting, dry humping, stuff like that. We've only been seeing each other for about a month and then the summer came and we had to go home from college. We aren't even labeled as boyfriends or anything I just really really freakin like him.  We have sort of talked a little about his stuff and I've made it clear that while vaginas have never turned me on, they've also never turned me off and that if he wants me to mess around down there I certainly will.   Oral is actually the thing that worries me the most. I imagine its a lot more complicated than eating to booty. And I've heard it changes with hormones so I don't even feel like reading up on vaginas would help."
mypartneristrans,3673dz,thewanderingmind,2,Mon May 18 13:09:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, no apologies - I just wasn't sure whether y'all were hooking up and it was going weird, or if you were gettin' all nervous ahead of time, or what! It must be agonizing being apart just when things were heating up, huh? But you can use the distance to your advantage and enjoy the build-up, and maybe a little phone/Skype sex if it gets hot & heavy. And hopefully y'all can see each other before fall - that would drive me crazy!  Re: oral, just go slowly and you'll get the hang of it in no time (if he's down for it!). I may be biased 'cause I'm into all kinds of genitalia and have a serious oral fixation, but I don't think it's wildly dissimilar from eating ass, there's just more of everything (textures, fluid, contours). Giving head to that anatomy (if he hasn't had phalloplasty) is someplace between rimming and your standard beej, and if you're into both and all about this guy, you're probably golden. Testosterone causes clitoral growth, and you can lick and suck just like you would a dick, and to great effect, if he's into that. (If y'all use barriers, dental dams or cut-up gloves are the way to go for this.) Some of us love having our holes eaten out, too, while others ignore our vaginas and opt for anal penetration, if anything. He may also like/prefer using a strap-on - even if his physical sensation is limited this way, the visual and applied pressure alone can get some guys off!   Of course, what he likes may change over time, as he adjusts to hormones and social transitions stuff, and depending on how dysphoria effects him. But if you keep talking to him, and making it clear that you're sweatin' him hard and eager to find ways to make him feel good, you'll surely hit your stride in no time. :D"

They suddenly glared and said ""don't call it that. That's the second time you've done that today and you know not to do that."" or something along those lines. I felt horrible.

mypartneristrans,35sltw,bookwormxx,5,Sun May 17 05:09:37 2015 UTC,"My partner is 2 years HRT and has fairly regular erections. A few things about them though:  First, the frequency is way lower than with boys. I was never with her in the pre hormones days but apparently her sex drive has gone down considerably.   Second, I'd second the ""use it or lose it"" from above. If she goes a few weeks without an erection the next one she gets hurts quite a bit.  Third, her penis is way more sensitive than it was before. That is, it's now pretty fragile and cannot take hard stimulation. Hand jobs require tons of lube and oral is totally different than with a man.    However, in light of the fragility, PIV can be really nice sometimes because her penis is so sensitive so being inside someplace warm and soft is really nice for her.   Keep in mind what many others have said: a lot of trans women do not want to use their penis for penetrating. If you really like it and she's okay with it you guys could get a strapon and use that.   Your sex life will probably change at least a little bit but keep in mind that lots of non-PIV sex is very fun and satisfying. Enjoy the exploring and be sensitive of her body."
mypartneristrans,35sltw,bulldykebeer,3,Wed May 13 15:49:56 2015 UTC,"Just had PIV sex with my wife last night and she's been on HRT since October. No issues. We haven't had sex as much (been super busy) so I think the last time we had sex was maybe March? She still masturbates too, though not as often as she did pretransition.  It's a really YMMV situation though. Yes, atrophy is common (though I hear it's more common with the testicles than the penis). I also hear it can be a ""use it or lose it"" issue too. For the first few months of HRT it's very common for sex drive to go down drastically. It did for my wife, bit after 3 months or so she was getting her interest back. Some couples have no issues, others struggle a lot. It also depends on how dysphoric your partner is too. My wife doesn't really have any genital dysphoria so it's not an issue for us, but it can be for many couples.   Even if your partner does want PIV sex and has trouble with getting and/or maintaining erections, Viagra and other similar drugs are an option too."
mypartneristrans,35sltw,PANDADA,2,Wed May 13 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"My spouse and I still do sometimes, and she's been on hormones since August 2014. Erections are less consistent than they were before HRT. I'd say about 2/3rds of the time we're able to do PIV and the other 1/3rd of the time we're not. They're also not as hard as they used to before HRT, generally.  The other consideration is whether your spouse is comfortable using her equipment for PIV. My spouse is, but that's not going to be the case for everybody, and you'll definitely want to clarify that with your spouse."

It is probably worth looking into lesbian options (let's face it it, you're looking at a same-sex/same-gender relationship here), and possibly strap-ons in the future, depending on how things go.

It's incredibly frustrating since no matter how many times we talk about it nothing changes. My spouse doesn't seem to notice or care how much it bothers me, despite all the times I've told her it does. It's demoralizing being rejected, and it tanks self-esteem. Hang in there, I'm clinging to the hope that her drive will come back in time, I'm not sure what I'll do if it doesn't. Take care of yourself, and I'm not saying that in the ""go buy a vibrator"" way that some people do when this problem is brought up. Be as kind to yourself as you can, it's easy to get caught in a beating-yourself-up-over-it-cycle."

Orgasms are not only possible they're pretty much a given, and much better than before. Even had multiples a few times.  I think it important she routinely gets erections as it seems to be the case that ""if you don't use it, you lose it.""  I've read comments from quite a few women who didn't have erections for some time, and when they finally did, it was extrely painful.  Also some women dial back the Spiro for a few days before planned activities, or use Viagra.  Understand the above presumes she has no problem using her OEM equipment; some trans women are uncomfortable doing so as it induces Dysphoria.  Oh, I'm 14 months along on HRT BTW."
mypartneristrans,35sltw,SleepNowMyThrowaway,2,Wed May 13 11:44:46 2015 UTC,"My partner has been on HRT for ~8 months, and we only very, very rarely have penetrative sex (and even then it only lasts a minute). It's partially a biological impact of the hormones (it's more difficult now and very uncomfortable), and partially a psychological aversion to her maleness, but it's a lot easier to accept that PIV is no longer an option and appreciate the rare chances it does happen.  It sounds like your questions stem from whether or not you want to continue your relationship, and less from the sexual aspects. Sex is something you can figure out (seriously, there are some pretty great alternatives out there). Please don't question how she feels: she is not gay, she is not confused, she is doing a very very hard thing and needs the support of her partner and best friend right now."

Orgasms seem less of an issue.  My SO has been on HRT for about 7 months, and its does take her more effort to get an erection. More noticeable is her libido, which is a lot lower. We don't have as much PIV sex anymore, partly because it makes her slightly dysphoric (vaguely disorienting, not emotionally traumatic) and partly because exploring other options is fun. Last time we did, though, we both enjoyed it."
mypartneristrans,35sltw,saintartaud,1 point,Wed May 13 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"My partner is approaching 3 months on HRT. We are still having PIV sex - not exclusively, but often. We are probably more touchy feely with each other since she began HRT, and she gets really 'grindy' sometimes :)     So far, the frequency has been about the same as pre-HRT, or maybe even a bit more. At the very beginning, I was really alarmed because I lost my ability to orgasm for about 3-4 weeks. I'm not sure what happened there, but it came back full force and we are both having lots of fun now.    Her doctor suggested she double her dosages of her medications to get her levels where they should be and we are both a bit nervous at what changes that may bring. I'm hoping that like the first round (beginnning HRT to now) we can makes whatever adjustments we need to keep the intimacy where we want and need it to be.    From all the stories I've read here, I don't think there is a textbook answer to your question I think it has a lot to do with what you and your partner want, what compromises or sacrifices you are both willing to make and what type of attitude you approach the situation with. I've found that this situation has led to some of the most open honest communication that my partner and I have ever had, take advantage of that, keep the lines of communication open and speak honestly, gently and openly - I think it will yield good results."

Sex is totally doable and totally possible to find deep satisfaction sexually. and in some ways its like being a teenager again and finding out fun ways to do things in new ways. have fun...and work with each other to have a no stress time where you figure things out, in an adult and open minded way."

And when the day is done and we are watching orange is the new black, she is mine and i am hers and that is what matters. and no i am not a lesbian, im no longer hetero either, its something different and new.  sex is not the same, we touch more kiss more, she is more attentive to what i need. she can still orgasm but it takes time, and thats part of the fun. we have our kinks in the bedroom and still play, toys are used more, I've always used a vibrator even during piv so that hasn't changed much.  my final ray of light...consider...love conquers all, marriage is supposed to be a final connection between two souls/people/mates what have you. if you are really committed at the level of your vows then this is an issue that can be overcome.  hope my share helps you and you newly came out wife. good luck and love."

Not everything is gender related, and I really think that your partner is making this a gender issue when it doesn't need to be.  Females can leave the seat up, too, maybe not as often or for the same reasons, but it happens. Gender aside, she DID leave the seat up, and it DOES bother you.  And with your eyesight problem, it would be courteous of her to make more of an effort to leave the seat down.  Not to be harsh, but she can't expect you to double and triple check every single thing you say for fear that it will have a gender spin on it.  That is ridiculous, and you will end up feeling like you are walking on eggshells all the time if anything and everything you say can be misconstrued to be about gender.  You are allowed to have pet peeves and be annoyed by things that your partner does.  You're human.  Also, things are often blown way out of proportion when alcohol is involved.  Your conversation probably would have gone completely differently had you both been sober. :)"
mypartneristrans,35rev9,bookwormxx,0,Wed May 13 15:45:13 2015 UTC,"Very True. We Seem alright now.  I still endeavor to work on my phrasing if she promises to be patient with me. It's not really eggshells as long as I know that she knows I'm trying.  like, for example, I've caught myself saying ""girl problems"" or ""lady issues"" when alluding to vagina problems- but I understand how that can feel exclusive, so I'm trying to just say ""i have bad cramps today"" or ""my vagina reacted badly to some soap we bought yesterday"" instead. :) I'm sure by some standards shes a bit sensitive, but that's one of the things I cherish about her, and I would never want her to change."
mypartneristrans,35rev9,gnurdette,3,Thu May 14 12:56:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, jeez.  As a trans woman, I endorse everything /u/bookwormxx said, and I really think she should give YOU the strong benefit of the doubt about whether something you say is supposed to be viewed as transphobic or not.  You don't go around practicing your ""prickly transperson"" act with your closest ally, dammit!  If you feel like calling people transphobes, go take it to the internet, that's what it's for!  :/  The trouble is, I don't know how to get from ""she should"" to ""she does"".  :("
mypartneristrans,35rev9,amyl_and_disco,1 point,Sat May 16 01:29:52 2015 UTC,"""You don't go around practicing your ""prickly transperson"" act with your closest ally, dammit!"" ^ It sounds less like an act than an honest reaction. When I'm out in the world, I'm armored and unflappable because I know better than to expect that anyone will respect my identity or treat me with integrity. So when I come home to someone at the end of the night, I need to know that they're going to provide me a safe(r) place where I'm seen and valued and not misgendered by proxy or subject to assumptions about my socialization, etc.   I recognize that it's a process, but the OP is asking our perspectives and seems to be taking critique and revising her language and approach so as to ward off further flare-ups like this one. Saying ""Your partner is too sensitive and needs to calm down!"" isn't helpful in a case where a partner values that sensitivity and is seeking better ways to respect her partner and improve communication. It may well be that, through these efforts, OP's partner comes to trust more in her support and is able to give her the benefit of the doubt down the road."
mypartneristrans,35rev9,amyl_and_disco,2,Sat May 16 09:00:11 2015 UTC,"First of all, and everyone already said it first: just leave the seat down. And if you're squicked by the notion of having to touch the seat every time, maybe clean it more. (I think it's strange you'd assume you're the only one fussed about touching the toilet seat just because your partner routinely moves it to suit her needs. If you don't want to touch it, chances are she's not stoked at the prospect either. And if you expect her to touch it more, you could at least offer to clean it more, since you come into contact with it more often. I feel like making this her issue is a bit unfair.)   But as you said, this goes way beyond the toilet seat. In the time it took to type this, you could have lifted and shut the lid hundreds of times. You say this isn't the first time things have blown up this way, and it's unlikely to be the last. I (FTM) read this post with my spouse (MTF), and what struck us both was the fact that you jumped to a WMP argument despite your assertion that this has nothing to do with gender. I know you feel bad for saying it, and I know you were drunk, but bringing that into the argument suggests a certain undercurrent in your interactions, even if it hasn't been addressed before. When the toilet seat debacle came up with your cis female partner before, I'm betting you didn't suggest it was a result of male privilege. When you jump to the defense of ""another [ostensibly cis] woman's toilet etiquette"", when you say that your partner's perspective ""directly conflicts with ideology. . . fair to women at large"", you're at the very least implying that your partner's concerns are distinct from those of women as a whole (because women sit down to pee??). That's the charitable inference - it comes across like you're treating your partner as though she has residual maleness, or is operating with male privilege. There's absolutely a way to have this conversation without it being heavily gendered - if your eyesight is the issue here, that's legit, and worth addressing! But you can't throw out an accusation of male privilege and then ask why your partner had to get so offended, or why it had to be about gender. Even your ""PAINSTAKINGLY constructed"" explanation implies that your partner is being somehow unfair to ""women at large"". It sounds as though you were the one to bring gender into this argument initially, which of course put your partner on the defensive and made the conversation super charged. If this is an issue of sharing space with someone respectfully, then treat it as an issue between individuals. If you're going to treat preferences like this as inherently gendered, this loop is going to spin out catastrophically."
mypartneristrans,35rev9,flyonthwall,1 point,Wed May 13 13:29:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  Clearly this evolved to be about more than a toilet seat; which is sort of why I spent so much time to write about it, and ask for some thoughts and opinions on what it means when ideologies clash as they will sometimes. I appreciate your insight.   I think my issue with the charitable inference thing, which did come up, is I would have made the same argument to anyone. I really would have, and indeed I have, in the past, with my ex, (Cisf) who was bulimic, who would constantly leave the seat up as well. In that case I did not get accused of insinuating that she had any 'residual maleness' for saying that it was a ""thoughtless MWP thing to do in general to women at large""... In fact the language I used in that argument was SUPER harshly gendered, and no one got offended. In that situation it was 2 cis lesbians arguing about toilet procedure. It is an interesting comparison. Perhaps the concept of deeming an act or a thing male and male as inherently bad is a nasty and inherently offensive thing that I do. I have thought about that. I have thought about all of this quite a bit.    I got tangled up in the idea of this argument, principally speaking, because deep down whenever I find myself needing to tiptoe around saying something that I would just outright say otherwise... I feel like Im not treating her fairly- it's like, I know I have the kid gloves on, and all she wants is to be an equal, and if in my heart I'm not truly doing that, and it saddens me a bit. Even If I'm the only one that knows. I still know.    But then again I was raised by militant progressives, and I can't deny that there is a lot of disdain and bitterness towards maleness in general that rubbed off on me. I'm kind of hateful towards men. I can see how this could be triggering, and at best, inappropriate. But if it is the problem, why is it? My partner is a woman, why should she care about my personal disdain for 'the man'? Or even if she cares, why would she take that personally?   Perhaps I just need to get out of the WL mindset I was raised in; which is essentially, 'there is a war of ideas to be waged, and we haven't won.' To me, ""we"" IS inclusive of my spouse, and all women. Whereas I don't deign to speak for all women, I can and do speak to my own experience, and I do so often, whenever I disagree or feel slighted, as it is all any of us can do.   But yeah, the points of I spent a long time agonizing over this and I should have made it about my eyesight are well met, I acknowledge that fully.   It just Isn't about the toilet seat anymore. I think this is about a militant man hater raised by very angry queers trying to wrap her head around new ideas regarding the delicacy of what respect might entail in a trans relationship for the sake of someone she loves very very much. But you seem to have picked up on that. :) Thank you for responding so thoughtfully."

Just like she checks every time before she sits down OR pees. To demand that she be responsible for your own absentmindedness is unfair. I would never dream of complaining that someone left the seat down and i accidentally peed all over it.  Because that would be my own dumb fault.  Not theirs.   Situation may be different for OP because of eyesight.  And if that's the issue then THAT is what should be discussed. And nothing else.

Simply put, your SO needs to put it up everytime and then back down again, which is two movements. She also checks to see if it's still up from her last time or if you've been there in the mean-time. I think it fair if you split it in half i.e. she puts it up before and you put it down before.  Then again your eyesight might be a determining factor. Address this if it's a real struggle for you."

Leaving the toilet seat up is an etiquette issue for ALL penis havers/people who stand to pee. It's SUPER GROSS to fall in the toilet. It is less gross to put the seat down.  It's not an issue of being trans, it's an issue of respect. OP asked her partner to be more conscientious about toilet ettiquette, and her partner made it into a big issue about her gender.

mypartneristrans,35pdql,bookwormxx,1 point,Tue May 12 12:54:20 2015 UTC,I don't think he was nervous as he was very dominating during (which is what I like) and I see no reason why he would be preoccupied or worried about our friendship as he never expressed any of this during the time we planned everything out.

I know it's not impossible and that some people just naturally feel comfortable with the role from the start, but in my experience people with less experience are more comfortable letting someone else take the dominating role.

Let her know how you're feeling and that you know it's not intentional on her part, and that while you know it's not actually happening (or not happening) because you're unattractive, it's making you feel that way. Nine years in this is still something my partner and I struggle with. It's all well and good to intellectually know that a heavy dose of female hormones and anti-androgens have severely hindered my hunny's already-pretty-low sex drive, but that doesn't make me stop feeling like its a failing on my part from time to time when she's not feeling intimate. But I have to keep reminding myself that (at least in her case) it causes her severe dysphoria and makes her feel really poorly about herself in a multitude of ways. In turn, she's found other ways to make it clear to me that she finds me attractive, sometimes with foreplay/alternate types of intimacy, sometimes just by making a more concerted effort to compliment me, give me additional attention/affection, etc when she knows that it's been awhile since we've been intimate or if she's recently declined intimacy and knows I'm likely feeling a little low about myself.  TL;DR As you already know, don't take it personal, and talk with your gf about the issue if you haven't already."

I can't exactly say that it affects my self-esteem, because I know it's not me, but it is killing our relationship.  Others have said things like ""get a vibrator"" or suggested that we have an open marriage, but they are missing the point.  I miss the connection with my spouse, and without a romantic/sexual connection, there is nothing that sets the relationship apart from my relationship with other friends.  I used to try to talk to my spouse about it more often, but it always left me feeling rejected and her feeling pressured, so I honestly don't even try anymore.  ETA: Wanted to add that my self-esteem has actually improved since my spouse came out to me, because I had an explanation for why she had stopped initiating.  It just sucks that I am someone who enjoys sex and pleasing my partner (and spent quite a few years doing what my partner enjoyed to keep her interested), and my 'reward' has been a partner who does not even want to have sex with me anymore!"

No one understands is about the physical connection of pleasing someone and being pleased by someone instead of letting off sexual steam.  The fact that she doesn't want to have that connection with me makes me feel like I'm not attractive enough for her or she finds me repulsive which really affects how I feel about myself.  I just feel like that if we don't talk about it, it will get worse because we won't ever talk about it. I tried doing that for about a month and that whole time, we didn't do anything and she thought that everything was fine and dandy even though I was miserable on the inside.  You see, my explanation for why she didn't want to initiate was because she didn't want to be put in a dominant position at any time (by default putting me in a dominant position every time) or just didn't want to initiate because it was awkward because she didn't know when it was okay to do things..."

What he doesn't get, no matter how many times I tell him, is that I don't want to have sex with other people. I want to have sex with him. And you're right -- it's not just about getting off. It's about being connected to the person I love, and feeling like he wants me more than anyone else.    I'm a little relieved to hear you have the same problem with bringing up difficult subjects. If I'm not actively trying to talk about an issue -- as in, if the words aren't coming out of my mouth at that exact moment -- my partner assumes everything is fine. It drives me crazy because he'll just go through his day like nothing is wrong while I'm crying myself to sleep at night and playing a torturous mental game of ""should-I-stay-or-should-I-go."" Yet when I bring up these issues so he knows I'm still struggling, I feel like a nag.

mypartneristrans,34u7op,bookwormxx,2,Tue May 5 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, bookworm. I'm so tired of having the same conversation and nothing ever changes."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,bookwormxx,1 point,Tue May 5 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"I understand that entirely. I guess it was really prominent when discussing things that we were into. Everything that she suggested, she needed and almost non-negotiable and everything that I suggested was a want and ""you really don't want that, do you?"" And even when talking about sex, the conversation at its essence was ""you don't actually need sex, you just want it. You shouldn't want it because I don't want it."" It sucks because I feel like my needs just aren't as important as my partner's needs."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,Baron3ss,2,Tue May 5 15:48:12 2015 UTC,"You see, my explanation for why she didn't want to initiate was because she didn't want to be put in a dominant position at any time (by default putting me in a dominant position every time)   This is us as well.  For the majority of our marriage, I have taken the dominant role in the bedroom, because I knew that my spouse liked it and I wanted to keep her interested.  There were times that I went outside of my comfort zone, but overall I did learn to have fun with it.  Still, I would become emotionally exhausted with it, because I wanted my spouse to just want me without all the role playing (what I saw it as at the time, and what it was for me).  It never occurred to me to wonder if my spouse was trans because of this, because to be honest, I didn't really know much about it.  Your comment about her thinking everything is fine and dandy resonates with me, too.  That's kind of where my spouse and I are now.  I honestly got tired of talking about it and never finding a solution, so I stopped trying, and I think because of that my spouse is under the impression that everything is fine between us.  We really only talk about it in counseling now.  Every appointment, our counselor talks to us about setting time aside to explore, and it never happens.  She's out of the country, so we had to go a month between appointments, but we will be there again in a couple weeks, and it will be the same old story.  Nothing new."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,Baron3ss,1 point,Tue May 5 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"I was okay with being dominant until I had to be dominant in bed all the time for everything. I had to initiate, tell her what to do, control her, tell her what act to do when, and so on. I was in control all the time and I hated it. It felt like making love to a wet mattress. I wanted the same thing in return (clearly not as controlled at that) but it turned into a big fat no because she wasn't okay with it. I told her that I didn't want to be dominant all the time and she told me she wasn't okay with that because it's something she wanted in a sexual relationship and because we were having sex, it was implied that my needs were being fulfilled. Mainly, I was tired of being turned down almost every time I was frisky and wanted to see if there was actually a subconscious ""schedule"" of some sort going through her brain, that I know nothing about. Even though I was still initiating most of the time, she said that she was bored ""starting"" everything. Of course, I'm thinking ""Now you understand! Please tell me you understand how it feels!!!"" but nothing has clicked yet. Almost like when I have a problem with something, I should just get over it (even though it's horrible to say) because I'm cis and she is allowed to not be okay with it because she is trans. It's so strange and frustrating sometimes.  We were seeing a therapist for a while also. As soon as he found out that she was trans, he latched onto her which I was okay with at first. But then he made it seem like SRS was the end goal and only goal, couldn't even remember my name, he took time out of the sessions we were supposed to have together and spent it just on her (which again, I was okay with until later), apparently, he would talk about me behind my back, take sides (mostly hers), pick favorites, pushed me out of conversations, or downplayed my feelings because of my age and ""lack of experience with relationships."" The explanation for what I was feeling was ""that's because you're young and don't understand"" which isn't something you should tell a client... I could really go on about how terrible he was but I don't think that's appropriate."

Sure, there were times it was fun and I used it to my advantage (lol), but on the other hand I felt like I always had to force my spouse to want me, and that's a sucky feeling.  I'm sorry that you had such a hard time with your therapist.  He doesn't sound very professional at all.  I am considering seeing one alone in addition to the counselor that my spouse and I see.  Maybe not long term, just a session or two just to get things off my chest.  Sometimes I hold back in our sessions together, because (again) I hate making my spouse feel bad about everything."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,RainbowPinata,1 point,Wed May 6 13:11:06 2015 UTC,"Her issue is more likely something to do with her, and not you.  For me, the longer I've been transitioning the worse I feel about my genitals.  On one hand, I had a lifetime of people beating ""big penis = good.  Small penis = worthless"" into my head.  So when I have trouble getting it up or if its not particularly large that day, I feel a weirdness about it.  But on the other hand, I want a vagina and my genitalia feels more foreign to me as time goes on.  Adding to this, I have a trans partner whose sex drive has been unaffected by hormones and she wants sex a lot more frequently than I do.  All of this makes me feel really inadequate and like I'm a disappointment, or like there's even more wrong with me.  It becomes a giant bundle of frustration and sadness.    I guess my only advice would be to take it really slow and see what happens.  If you have needs that aren't being met, I don't think anybody would fault you for leaving."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,bookwormxx,2,Mon May 4 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"How slow can I take it? We've been talking about it for almost a year and nothing has changed. I was hoping there would be something I could do to motivate her instead of taking the backseat again and being let down. I was kind of hoping that there would be an answer that doesn't include breaking up, buying a dildo or saying that ""i chose this path so it's your own fault."""

If you get to a month and there's absolutely no progress...you may want to consider your options.  I was in a sexless marriage for 3 years.  At that point I had a normal sex drive.  It was brutal for me.  Our relationship didn't necessarily end because of that, but I certainly felt what you feel :/"

On one hand, I want to try to understand my spouse's point of view and figure out a way to make things work, but on the other hand, I feel like it shouldn't be so much damn work to connect sexually with my own spouse.  I understand that things are difficult for my spouse, but it hurts when I feel like I'm the only making any sacrifices and that my needs, when they are expressed, go in one ear and out the other.  I'm tired of feeling like a nag and tired of feeling guilty about the way I feel."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,tulips_onthe_summit,5,Tue May 5 14:49:07 2015 UTC,"I promise I'm not just following you around this thread, but everything you say strikes a chord with me.

Last month I wrote in my journal, ""I don't think it's supposed to be this hard."" That's been my feeling lately. I'm the only one trying, and that really sucks."

I'm so glad that we have this forum and are able to vent to each other, because I don't know anyone in the ""real world"" who has experienced this."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,omgitsjackattack,2,Wed May 6 13:13:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. I try to be as attentive as possible but sometimes I feel like I'm not getting the same treatment in return. I know that when my girlfriend has a problem with something, I will do everything possible, even if it's something I wouldn't normally do to make things better. If it's something I can't find on my own, I ask people, I post things and get desperate. However, with things like this, when I have a problem with something, I get excuses until I actually start breaking down, crying only to be met with anger and probably a half-assed attempt of getting things done. I really hope this time is better than all the other times we have talked about this."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,omgitsjackattack,2,Tue May 5 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"I hope so, too.  In my case, my spouse doesn't get angry, but she feels a lot of guilt, and then I feel bad and wish I had never said anything (we both feel a tremendous amount of guilt).  So I find myself bottling things up, and then it just simmers inside of me until I blow up or break down.  Our counselor (who is great about understanding both sides - she's familiar with both trans issues and with how it affects families and relationships) told my spouse in one of our sessions that if there is no attempt to meet my needs or at least some compromise then she has to be prepared for the possibility of me moving on and possibly entering another relationship.  It seemed as though that was an eye opener for my spouse, because she hated the thought of it, but that was well over a month ago and nothing has changed.  We haven't even talked about it again, really, except in our last counseling session (seems to be the only place we talk about it, but nothing ever gets resolved)."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,omgitsjackattack,1 point,Wed May 6 13:01:23 2015 UTC,"I tend to overthink a lot of the time and hyperfocus on things I have problems with if they are big. So sometimes I talk about it for days on end after the sessions we used to have (which isn't a good thing clearly and probably why my partner snaps at me most of the time. I'm surprised she hasn't smothered me with a pillow because of that. sorry for the morbid humor).When she says she's going to work on something, I give her the time and don't bring it up. However, we do work with a time constraint. For example, if she says that she is going to do research or talk to someone or anything else, I give her a week for it to be done. If the end of the week comes and I see nothing, I bring it up and ask her about what is going on. I learned that ignoring the problem only makes it worse and bottling it up only adds to the resentment (the only good piece of advice that the therapist gave us). We're going to start seeing a better therapist together more consistently and we're also going to start seeing therapists separately also."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,ihq,3,Wed May 6 16:54:02 2015 UTC,"I've got the same problem. My partner does care - she's not just making excuses - but her drive just isn't there. She's gone back to her endo a few times and gotten hormones readjusted, but that didn't really help. She's just really dysphoric so even if she does get turned on, that in turn triggers a shame spiral and sends her downhill.   I think it helps for her to have some time to explore by herself, because otherwise she gets stressed out and her body learns to associate sex with stress. Other than that, though, I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping that she'll get better after she has surgery (which could happen soon)."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,RainbowPinata,2,Mon May 4 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"I know that sometimes my girlfriend talks about stress during sex because she doesn't know what she's doing. Maybe set aside some non-sexual time to have her ask questions about your body and vice versa. I feel like this helps somewhat because that was a problem for a while and why she didn't want to have sex.  You see, I can't rely on surgery because I don't know when it's going to happen (or even if it's going to happen) because of our funds. Also, surgery might help with the dysphoria but I don't know what it will do for the sex drive."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,ihq,3,Mon May 4 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"Heading into HRT, my partner and I drafted a set of 'expectations'. One of the expectations was that we both are committed to intimacy with each other. Intimacy isn't defined as anything in particular, but the intent is that we still share our bodies with one another. In that expectation, we also set up 'checkpoints' and agreed that we would sit down periodically and check in with each other about intimacy. We've had a number of conversations since then about the changes that are ongoing, how her libido is impacted, how my body/mind are responding to the changes, etc...most of the conversations so far have been quite positive. There have been a few tough things to talk about, but we reinforce with a lot of compliments and positivity to make it easier to discuss the negative or hard to talk about items.    So far, so good. She has definitely experienced a decrease in libido and sex between us has changed considerably, but this is not a bad thing. Due to all our communication and our willingness to explore, we have found several new tricks to add to our sexy time toolbox. I've found that I am happier and more satisfied with our new sexual paradigm than I was when she was still questioning and it felt as though there was a wall between us.    This topic is so tough and so sensitive and really plays into our most vulnerable selves. I'm hoping that our attentiveness to our thoughts and feelings coupled with an open-minded for intimacy and play will help to stave off some of the potential issues.    It sounds like you are trying to have these conversations, but you aren't finding them successful or they don't produce the results you're looking for. Are you sure that you are clear in your communication? Have you written your feelings down? Do you only talk about this when trying to initiate or have you set aside 'neutral' time to discuss? Is she open trying medication for her libido? I'm just tossing out questions to perhaps spark an idea for you.    It is important. Your needs are important. I hope it gets better for you :)"
mypartneristrans,34u7op,RainbowPinata,1 point,Mon May 4 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"You see, she started HRT before us and it never occurred to either of us that her sex drive would drop so low. HRT in combination with Citalopram isn't good unless it's completely necessary (they both kill your sex drive and make it hard to be intimate and a combination of the two makes it almost impossible to have a sexual relationship). We thought that it would drop a little, but not this much.  I try to be clear with my communication, like asking if she understood or to tell me what she thought I said but sometimes I get shut down and my thoughts are played down or my values are played down and judged. Because it's the clearest way, I write everything down and share them with her through text messages or FB messenger or something where it's easier to speak up without speaking (I'm a terrible at talking my thoughts out).   Since i've stopped initiating because it actually hurts to know that she's going to shut me down, we only talk during non-sexual times.  What medications are you talking about? She wants to switch to Welburtrin and get on progesterone but she needs a doctor to prescribe Welburtrin (obviously) and there are no doctors in the area that will prescribe progesterone because they don't think it's necessary. I don't know what other medications that will help. Any suggestions?  Thanks for your help!"
mypartneristrans,34u7op,bookwormxx,1 point,Mon May 4 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"My partner told me progesterone and Viagra would be options for us if she were to start having difficulties that negatively impact us. From what I understand, progesterone can help restore her libido and Viagra will help with erections - some people have had success with one or the other, depending on the source of the issue.    Did she have a high libido before? Do you think she may have some shame associated with her low libido? It could be an explanation for why she would play down your thoughts/values and judge you...not a healthy one, but it could give you a window into her feelings, as it doesn't seem like she's sharing them with you.    Have you asked her about her view, desires, etc...about sex? Does she have anything to say? Is she satisfied? Does she wish her libido was higher? Maybe if you got her talking and just listened - is it possible?    I'm sorry for your struggle."
mypartneristrans,34u7op,ihq,1 point,Mon May 4 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"She would do progesterone but not Viagra. She associates it with men and will not touch it. I know even the suggestion of that would piss her off because she thinks that it's weird and wrong that a woman is taking something for cismen and old men at that.  She did have a libido before. Before me, She would masturbate multiple times a day everyday. Then when we got together, we were sexual two or more times a week (depending on where our roommates were). Now, it's nothing. Maybe once every couple of months of her own accord. She is ashamed of her low libido because she knows that she can't please me. She hurts because it hurts me. She couldn't care less if she was by herself but because she doesn't want to lose me, she hates her low libido. I spent a lot of time looking for ways to boost her libido naturally which is where the aromatherapy and meditation came in. We tried having more sex (the more you have it the more you want it), we tried just pleasuring me (courtesy of our horrible couple's therapist who wanted to break us up to focus on the fact that she was trans) which was uncomfortable because it seemed like she wasn't into it and ""spicing it up"" if you know what I mean.   All we do is try and figure out what she is into and what she likes. We've been doing that since day one. She has two fetishes and nothing else can satisfy her. They are VERY focused and it feels like I can be pushed out of sex altogether because they are so focused. Again, it wasn't always like this.   You see, she doesn't have a sex drive so there is no way for me to tell if she is sexually satisfied or not. She also doesn't care about her own sex drive or her libido. She could live without it for the rest of her life and I feel like she's going to start dragging me down that path if things don't change soon. I have talked to her and just listened and it makes me feel so hopeless. I mean, a little part of her wants progesterone because it rounds out your boobs and boosts your sex drive but the sex drive things is one of the last thing on her mind."

I'm so sorry that nothing seems to be producing results for you. I think it's a bit understandable as your partner is not only on HRT, but also SSRIs. I don't believe that is the recipe for high libido.    That being said...you are clearly frustrated and I think you have every right to be. I don't know what I would do in your situation - I'm not interested in living like BFFs or sisters with my partner, and we've discussed and set that expectation up front. Expectations aren't always met, though, and I would be hard pressed to come up with a solution to my situation, if I were you. I would also be pretty frustrated that she seems committed to her fetishes, but completely turned off to you. That doesn't seem fair at all.  I totally get the need to connect with your partner. The need to pleasure her and feel that she desires you. I really hope you find that connection again. I don't know if you read all of the trans subs here, but there is a lot of talk about changes in libido all over the place. Lower, higher, up then down, down then up, etc...it's possible that it could work itself out. Maybe?     Edit: spelling"

Unfortunately I don't really have any advice to offer, I don't even know what to do in my own situation. My partner's sex drive started plummeting a few months into our marriage, and now a month after hormones it's completely nonexistent. It's really hard to not feel wanted, to not have any sex at all (when my libido is through the roof), and to lack the non-sexual intimacy. She doesn't hold my hand much lately, cuddle, or even kiss me beyond a quick peck. Talk really has gotten us nowhere, I just end up in tears of loneliness and frustration and she just sort of shuts down. Sometimes it feels like she's not even trying, or doesn't care about my needs, it's certainly the thing I struggle with most.  I really wish I could help, but like you I have tried just about everything. I'm just trying the best I can to ride out the hormone side-effects and hope it'll get better in time. I would still bring it up every so often, you have just as much right to have your relationship needs satisfied as your girlfriend does- and you have just as much right to speak up when those needs aren't met. It's just a difficult time for everyone, so everybody has to sacrifice, and it sucks.  edit:typos"
mypartneristrans,34u7op,Craylee,1 point,Mon May 4 20:54:08 2015 UTC,I agree. It is difficult. Either she's upset because she's tired of being annoyed or I'm upset because I don't feel wanted. Sometimes when we talk about it and I stress that I want to feel wanted she kind of downplays it. I really do think that it came with her changing views of sex. I'm really thinking that maybe we should both have discussions with our partners about what sex really means to us.
mypartneristrans,34u7op,Craylee,1 point,Mon May 4 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, it's just hard to be optimistic about the outcome of said conversation when none of the previous ones have changed anything.

I guess my best advice is that it's too many chances if that attitude starts to bleed over into other aspects of the relationship. At some point you need to put your foot down.  Sorry I don't have much that's particularly helpful to add, but I don't even really know what to do with myself.

mypartneristrans,34rbep,nickfoos,3,Sun May 3 23:56:26 2015 UTC,I had the same thoughts.
mypartneristrans,34rbep,bookwormxx,3,Sun May 3 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"Question then. Would you prefer it if this sub was only for partners of trans* people? As in, your partner is trans* and you have a question, and somebody who's partner is trans* answers it for you? Because as I have understood it in the past, it's also for trans* people to share their insights and thoughts, in order to help the OP. Is that a misconception?  I don't mean to sound snarky at all, I'm genuinely curious."
mypartneristrans,34rbep,creepynaomi,12,Mon May 4 10:31:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think it needs to only be for partners of trans* people. However, I do think trans* people who visit this subreddit (to ask for advice or to provide their perspective or leave resources) should be mindful that this is one of the few spaces available for partners to talk about issues and get support and resources specific for their process.    A lot of the expectations I've seen for partners in trans* spaces online around how to deal with a partner coming out as trans and transitioning have been almost Stepford-like, as far as needing to be the perfect supportive partner through what's a very rough time in our loved one's life with our happiness being secondary, if it matters at all. I know when I looking around for the perspectives of other partners, there's a lot more focus on how to be the good supportive partners, and not a lot of actual support for ourselves. Many times, we're also isolated from our usual sources of support as part of the need to respect our partner's privacy. Having a space where we can talk honestly and anonymously about our situations is important, and I do think it helps us treat our partner's better because we don't feel as trapped or isolated in our situation.  And FWIW, I think most trans* people are pretty respectful of this place and it's purpose, but since I've started coming here a few months ago, there have definitely been responses from trans* posters that have come across as aggressive and judgmental. I understand it's not easy to see people talking about leaving their trans* partners or being put in a tailspin because their partner came out, but this needs to be place where those kinds of topics can be talked about and understood as valid."
mypartneristrans,34rbep,jaisofbase,4,Mon May 4 15:25:54 2015 UTC,You took my thoughts right out of my head and put them into writing. :)

It was never my purpose to argue that trans* peoples have a right or more of a right to talk here, and I agree with you. It should be a platform for partners. I just believe that trans* people can also provide some insight into what it's like being trans* or being the partner or a partner who's partner is trans*.

So I feel like I also have a place here. If the general consensus is that it should be only partners, then I shall of course yield and stick to other subs."

That was certainly not my intent.  I personally find the input and insight from trans people (especially MtF, like my spouse) to be very helpful most of the time.  I have gotten some great advice to help me with my relationship from both trans people and their partners, and I have found most people here to be caring and compassionate.  It doesn't happen often, but occasionally a spouse or partner is attacked for their feelings, especially if they are uncertain if they can stay in the relationship or if they decide to leave the relationship.  However, I can't say that I've never seen this same attitude from other partners in the past, so I guess I shouldn't generalize that it's only from trans people.  I was just thinking of a couple recent posts, and that is what I was referencing."

I haven't seen any partners attacked for their feelings, just some critique which I think is useful for cis people who are trying to relate with trans people in their lives consciously and respectfully. Like, if I'm saying things that might offend or upset someone I held dear (or even a stranger, really), I'd want to be called on it so I could find more effective ways to communicate.

I'm thankful to see that I speak it well enough to convey my feelings in a genuine manner - which seems to aid me in connecting to the people around me.  In all honesty, I just really needed to get this out and to feel understood - in a safe place. Most of all I was scared of hurting anyone.

I'm the kind of person that wants to do 'the right thing' - whatever that means - no matter what. I'm strong, I have it all figured out. But that's not true. I'm still torn in a whirlwind of emotions. I'm mourning the loss of my boyfriend, I feel like it should be wrong. Seeing them happy though makes me so relieved and happy that it all feels right, too.  I still feel lacking. The one thing that I wanted most for them - being loved just the way they are - turns out to be the one thing I just can't provide, no matter how much I want it. I want to deny that, I want to be the person that they deserve, give back all the love - but I can't. I feel selfish. It is truly confusing.

Reading this stirred up such conflicting feelings for me; as a trans person who's mainly dated other trans people, I've weathered many emotional coming-outs and never felt as though my partner's identification threatened or diminished my own identity. Your pain comes through so clearly, here, though, and I'm amazed by the honesty and sensitivity you've both shown in all this shifting.  Here's the thing: transition is a long, intense, often agonizing process. Most of us go through at least six months of utter self-absorption, which is necessary to get our bearings and recalibrate, but it can be hell on even the most understanding partner. I still carry heavy regret for the ways in which I let my partner down while I was caught-up in my own process, even though I can't envision it going down differently. I think it's really important to remain honest throughout transition; if you know you can't continue to support them as a partner, the best thing you can do is to express that with love and find ways to let go gracefully. By admitting this upfront, you've both got a much better chance of moving forward as friends, which it sounds like you could both use right now. I wish I'd handled my own situations more gracefully, and wish you all the best through this trying time. Keep focusing on what you've got, and use this time to explore and enjoy your independence - it's time to get back in touch with your own dreams and desires, and figure out your own next steps. Good luck, and stay strong!"

mypartneristrans,34op3t,quirkyqueer,2,Sun May 3 21:17:21 2015 UTC,"I had top surgery 12 days ago, in NYC. It was covered by insurance and I stayed overnight in the hospital.   My spouse was with me at the hospital but didn't stay overnight, and took off work a couple days to care for me. My mom came up to visit and took care of me a couple days, and then over the weekend my spouse took care of me again. About a week after surgery, I could do most things on my own, at least enough that my spouse could go to work while I hung out at home taking naps and watching Netflix. The caretaking involved: making sure I took medication at the correct time, figuring out meals for me (I couldn't even reach the freezer to make frozen foods until a little over a week post-op), emptying and measuring the drains (I could have done this part myself but it grossed me out so my spouse helped), make sure I was drinking lots of fluids, that sort of thing.   My experience has been wonderful, and same with the experiences of my spouse. We're both very happy with the results so far! :-) I would say, emotionally, she was very worried about me being put under and waking up from surgery, and was a little worried when I was home alone for the first couple times after surgery. I've been a roller coaster of emotions, but mostly good ones.  I hope everything goes wonderfully for you and your husband!"

Inlaws do not have money, but their Mother does make considerably more money than we do. They definitely couldn't afford to drag out any lawsuits, though.  My spouse has made vieled ""jokes"" and references to the possibility of being trans with their Mother (testing the water) and she always gets worked up and offended - has even looked at me afterwards and said she'd pay for the divorce lawyer and to help me get custody of the kids (I of course brushed it off and made no assurances one way or the other). I know she knows about ""grandparent rights"", but as we've never cut her off before (not that I haven't wanted to) she's never brought it up except in the usual ""grandparents have a right to spend time with their grandchildren"" strain.  I know it's not a for sure thing, but their Mother is the explosive reaction type. She overreacts and jumps on the offensive in an instant when it comes to things she doesn't agree with. For example, she found out we had had premarital sex with each other and actually said ""I'm going home to kill myself"" before storming out once.

While I'm concerned about this, I certainly support my spouse's want to get things moving earlier than ""in the next couple of years"". We still know that MIL's reaction could be dramatic or even violent (our kids will not be present), and we still think the chances of an attempted custody battle (which she's got no grounds for, the kids don't even spend time alone with her and aren't terribly attached) or false CPS claims.  Should we tape record the coming out and confrontations thereafter? To possibly document any threats or claims against us? The law seems to say that in a private conversation (which you are a party in) you are able to do so legally.

I am unable to talk with anyone outside of my partner & my therapist. I've known a version of 'the secret' for about 15 years and only just began seeing a therapist two months ago. The most difficult part of that for me was keeping it from our daughters, they are in college now, but when they were younger they would ask lots of questions about things they noticed and I often was forced into a situation of choosing between lieing and outting my partner. Sometimes I could find a way to evade the questions, but that made me feel terrible, too. We plan to come out to them this year and I've considered addressing the dishonesty and trying to make up for that.    I am also not a makeup fan. I've worn it off and on throughout life and although it's fun and can enhance my looks quite nicely, I don't like how I become dependent on it. That feeling of 'I look bad without my makeup'. When I'm not regularily wearing makeup, I never feel that way. So, I don't wear it at all. My partner will, though, and wants makeup mirrors and to play makeup together. I'm going to give playing makeup a shot, because I think it would be a fun experience, but I'll have to be careful not to grow dependent on it. Only for playtime.    Sounds like you two have a nice relationship. I'm glad to hear of all your happiness :)"

She will come out eventually so you may as well do it now; sucks to forced into early disclosure, but there it is.  Alternative is take a second job, and then a third if needed.   2 You don't discuss your sex life with her, right? Does that mean you're lying to her?  Nonetheless as per above you should explain things to her and ask her help - with your wife's permission of course. 3 You won't know until they get here.  But even if they don't appeal, your wife's responses as you massage, cup, and suck on them might encourage you.  Ask me how I know ;) 4 Meh-a great number of women don't wear it or only do so on special occasions; sounds like she'll be the same... So help her with it if you can as no matter how little you know, she probably knows a lot less!   Identifying as ""lesbian"" ... No one requires you to label yourself and you seem confident enough to shrug off any attempts to pigeonhole your relationship.  Won't be hard to develop a boilerplate answer to nosey ""So, like, what are you now, a lesbian?"" questions.  ""What an odd question.  Why is this important to you?""  Just have something ready for the inevitable dreaded questions, and remember you owe nobody an answer - on anything about your relationship or love life.  If your friends freak, well, what does that reveal about them and the depth of your friendship?

I'm close to my mom too and worry about how she'll react, if and when, they decide what's best for them. One thing that really helped me feel better was when a commercial came on for the Bruce Jenner interview. She said she ""didn't understand what the big deal was, that they felt like they needed to change to be happier. So what."" So in retrospect, sometimes family members will surprise you on their opinions. Granted, I don't know how she would feel if he transitions, but having her say that about the interview helped me feel better.  I don't know if that helped shed any light on the subject...

I just wanted to say, thanks for sharing your story - sounds like you two make a great couple :)  Is there any kind of info in specific that you are looking for? I have a habit of hoarding links and stuff, so I might have some of the answers you are looking for, lol :P"
mypartneristrans,34elsm,Thessalonike,2,Thu Apr 30 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"thank you! (: and just like maybe natural transitions, maybe things on coming out. Anything really to make things easier on the two of us. Like I know we're gonna lose some people. Just the other day my uncle posted a link about Bruce Jenner and how he's sick and not a woman, maybe if there's ways to better deal with things like that would be helpful too, because at this point I just want to punch all of those closed minded people in the mouth lol"
mypartneristrans,34elsm,Thessalonike,3,Thu Apr 30 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"Alright. Well, I am going to assume that you have nothing, and present you with a whole bunch of stuff! :P  First, this is the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)‚Äôs Standards of Care. Based on the best available science and expert professional consensus, its goal is to provide clinical guidance for health professionals, so it‚Äôs very dry ‚Äì but there is also definitively a lot of useful information in there.  Want a less dry source of info? I personally liked True Trans ‚Äì it‚Äôs a documentary made by Laura Jane Grace, lead singer of Against Me, and some other member of the trans community that does a pretty good job of discussing a variety of things. There also the CBC documentary, Transforming Gender, that was produced earlier this year, and that I felt did a pretty good job.  If you like webcomics, you might also want to check out Rain, Validation, or Assigned Male  - I find them cute, and they provide a good medium for covering certain more complex aspects of being transgender.  As for advice on how to deal with some of the hateful people out there‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. I guess just try to remember that there are also plenty of people out there for whom this is not something controversial, and who are supportive? I‚Äôve been pretty lucky, most of the people in my wife and I‚Äôs lives have been pretty supportive. But I am about to come out at work, and will no longer be going out in boymode in the community, so we‚Äôll have to see if that changes."
mypartneristrans,34elsm,Thessalonike,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I'll definitely watch those with him when I get home from work. I'm not as worried about the judgements as he is. As long as he's happy, I could care less about what people think of me. He makes me happy, so I'll be fine. He's just always been afraid of being judged about anything lol. I just keep telling him the people who care aren't true friends, or they'll eventually come around. But Hey congratulations on taking that big step! if you don't mind-and remember-let me know how other goes! Basically I just keep trying to learn things through other people, and it's nice to talk to people going through similar situations. Have you been taking hormones?"
mypartneristrans,34elsm,jyiloveher,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"I have, since December last year. Took me about a year to get them, lol - not because of gatekeeping, just took a while to first find a family doctor (my wife and I moved back to her hometown two years ago), and then for the various appointments (blood testing and a physical to have an idea of my health, etc).   My wife's been really awesome, even though I told her transitioning was something I needed to do one month into planning our wedding, lol. Though afraid and worried at times - there were definitely times where she cried a lot (very similar to the stages of grief, actually). So a heads up, you may also discover that, though you are 100% supportive, you will still have emotions to work through. If this does happen, don't feel guilty about it - just keep being honest with yourselves and with each other, and let yourselves work through them :)  And yea, I definitely understand his fear of being judged, lol. Coming out to people was hard at times - I know it was really helpful to me that my wife was good about actually saying what was up to the people I was ready to come out to, instead of letting me awkwardly drag my feet and beat around the bush for an hour before I'd say the words, lol.  But yea, if you ever have questions, or even just need to rant about things, feel free to give me a shout! :P"
mypartneristrans,34elsm,Speed__Racist,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, I'm glad you're progressing towards happiness! Thank you so much for your time (: I am somewhat worried about all of the emotions I'll go through, but I've been through much harder and worse situations, and loving my SO definitely won't be a problem."

He's just always been afraid of being judged about anything lol. I just keep telling him the people who care aren't true friends, or they'll eventually come around.   That is exactly how I feel about my wife. She came out to me last week and after a few tears that was my conclusion. I love and accept her. Gender has never been an issue for me I always thought I just happen to marry a man because he was the one I fell in love with. A small part of me feels selfish at how happy and excited I am that she will  be completely woman in a few years..."

mypartneristrans,34elsm,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Wed May 13 13:32:40 2015 UTC,Thanks!
mypartneristrans,34elsm,Lunalily5678,3,Wed May 13 13:33:40 2015 UTC,"It sounds like this is the beginning of exciting and positive for both of you! I think it's possible that you'll go through periods of uncertainty as things move along, but it sounds like you have a lot of empathy and good communication between you, and those are the essential things...  We are also in that stage where my partner is not out to everybody yet, and I know it can be hard to feel like you're keeping a secret! Especially when it's something this big, and you want to be able to share it. I find this forum has been a good outlet for me in the meantime. Welcome!"
mypartneristrans,34elsm,TotesMessenger,2,Thu Apr 30 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"We are also in that stage where my partner is not out to everybody yet, and I know it can be hard to feel like you're keeping a secret!   I can identify with this statement so much. My partner and I have been in the closet for years and there have been times when it's really tough not being able to say anything. I'll admit that now that we are approaching coming out conversations, the closet feels kind of nice and cozy...there are certainly a LOT of clothes in here ;-)"
mypartneristrans,34elsm,Coundel,0,Thu Apr 30 21:57:28 2015 UTC,Yay welcome its nice to hear about a couple on this subreddit doing well right off the bat :D you can always pm me if you have questions or add me to Facebook if you like too :)
mypartneristrans,34bomg,takingonedayatatime,2,Wed Apr 29 21:34:24 2015 UTC,"Hello & Welcome!     Before this (about a year ago) he told me that he's interested in cross dressing.      My partner also identified as a cross dresser initially and after much exploration identifies as transgender. I think it's a great sign that your partner is including you this early in the process, many times the exploration is done privately. You are being invited into the process, I think that's really great!     -Did you go with them? And did you going to an appointment(s) seem to help or hurt things?      My partner and I discussed individual and couples therapy and how to handle it, and also got advice from therapists. Our therapist(s) suggested that it is important for us to each have our own place to explore these topics, and I agree that our individual therapy has been extremely helpful. We have an agreement with our therapists that they can discuss us with each other to aid in our therapy and they are both willing to allow the other partner to join a session, when needed.     -From your personal experience, is a gender identity therapist extremely pricey?     I've found this type of therapy to be more expensive because the therapists that specialize in it are often not in-network for insurance companies and so we get less coverage ($25 copay versus 60% of the entire bill). Most therapists we have seen are in the $175-$250/hour range.    -Lastly, do you have any advice for me?     Be patient with yourself and your partner. If you're anything like me, this will raise to the surface thoughts, feelings, etc...that you didn't know existed. Communicate your thoughts with your partner and keep trying to learn what they are thinking and feeling, too.  Be gently with yourself and your partner. They may not have the answers to the questions you want to ask. This was really frustrating for me. I ask why a lot (I am a scientist!) and had to really learn how to accept the responses I was getting.    I have found that by reading books, participating in places like this subreddit and educating myself as much as I can about transgender topics and issues, I have found it to be much easier to relate to my partner and work together with them to determine our path forward. It can be very scary at times, for me, but we have been in a really great place lately :)"
mypartneristrans,34bomg,tulips_onthe_summit,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"First off congratulations on a seemingly working relationship, you're still together 4 weeks into a potential crisis!  I'm not so sure if your ""boyfriend"" is, as you referred to them, a cis male. By the sounds of it, more the opposite would in fact be the case. But if you're unsure, maybe you can hold up with the labelling while they're figuring it out.  Going with them to appointments: I think it's generally a good idea to have them go to at least the first session on their own, just so they can get a private talk with the therapist. Often times there are years of thoughts stowed up and it can be very revitalising to be able to tell them to someone in private. After that, sure, I think it's a great idea for you to go along, given that your partner is a-okay with it. I'm sure you can learn a lot and maybe the outside perspective of a therapist can help you understand your partner's point of view if they're having some difficulties explaining themself.  Price: The therapist itself is usually not very pricey if you compare it to potential costs involved. None of these are obligatory by any means, but HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy), FFS (Facial Feminisation Surgery), SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery), lasing away hairs, shaving the cochlea, et cetera are all legitimate considerations, some more commonplace than others. Just want to iterate this again, none of these are obligatory for any transition, but your partner may be thinking about them. The surgeries can be of significant financial impact. You can ask around here for recommendations for doctors of any kind and may find advice from someone living in your area.  Advice: Honestly the best advice I can give you is never assume, always ask to be sure. Your partner may have very specific things in mind, or be very unsure about other things. You will only know if you talk about it. You said that you talk a lot, that's great! Oh, and, if your partner does figure out what name and pronouns they feel comfortable with, it really helps out if you go with them. You might screw up a lot at first, but if they get the feeling you're trying then that's usually already a great feeling - having someone else to back them up. It is very demoralising to have people you consider close refuse to refer to you in a way that makes you feel comfortable.  Good luck and (hopefully don't) break a leg!"
mypartneristrans,34bomg,creepynaomi,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:04:20 2015 UTC,"Offhand, I couldn't tell you how much my partner's therapist charges. I don't go with her, though I believe her therapist does offer couples therapy. I haven't personally felt the need to do so, since I already had some understanding of trans issues before she came out and managed to work through what few issues I had on my own. However, I would say that if you had issues accepting the crossdressing and need help working through your feelings, going to at least one session as a couple might be helpful.  My general advice is to take a moment to breath and give yourself time and space to sort things out. Communication is really important, and I recommend educating yourself as much as possible."
mypartneristrans,34bomg,saintartaud,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"My spouse came out to me almost a year ago.  She had dabbled in cross dressing but had always seemed very masculine otherwise, both physically and otherwise.  I did not know much about what it meant to be a trans woman, so it never occurred to me that she might even consider transitioning.  After realizing that she was trans, she began seeing a gender therapist who is very familiar with trans issues.  At first, I did not go with her, but later, when she decided to begin HRT, I did start going with her.  It has been very helpful.  It's not exactly couples counseling, because technically my spouse is her client, but because a lot of my spouse's anxiety was related to my feelings and turmoil with the situation, she agreed to let me come as a ""guest"" and she wrote me into the treatment plan as well.  It's not pricey for us, but I think this varies greatly depending on therapist, region, and whether it's covered on insurance or not (ours is).  My advice to you would be to expect your feelings to be up and down for awhile, especially if you are heterosexual.  You can be supportive of your SO without losing yourself or being a martyr.  I kept a lot of my feelings bottled up in the beginning, because I didn't want to seem unsupportive.  The counseling has helped me and my spouse both communicate a lot better, and has helped both of us to let go of some of our guilt about our feelings.  Give yourself time to figure out how you feel about it."
mypartneristrans,34bomg,bookwormxx,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"Hello and welcome! Therapy is an awesome idea, especially in the beginning. Cost will vary a lot depending on where you live, but it's definitely worth the expense.  I also highly recommend hanging out on here! It is generally a warm and supportive environment, and it's one of the few places I've found (maybe the only) that is truly supportive both trans people and their partners. Especially early on in my girlfriend's transition, it was really great to be able to vent, ask questions, and just know other people were going through the same challenges I was. More than anything, don't worry. It feels huge and ungraspable at first but take your time and be kind to each other and it will fall into place."
