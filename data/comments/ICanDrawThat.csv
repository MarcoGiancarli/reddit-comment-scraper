Only reason I took this request is because quite a few members of my family are deployed and I know what it's like to want to have a patch for your mates. But my profession is as a designer. I usually get paid to do this. I can't really call myself a designer without saying something about how you're asking for a free ride.  There. Are. Hundreds. Of. Sites. I got these just through google within a few seconds.  I'm not saying that /r/ICanDrawThat isn't for requests. But most of it's asking for fun doodling art. This is most definitely a patch design which more often than not should be made and paid through the normal market.  You don't go on reddit and ask people to come and repair your car for free. Or to come over and hang some pictures on your wall for free. All I'm asking is, please, don't treat art like it is, literally, worthless (aka worth asking for without pay.)  I'm sorry for the preaching. I've got friends in this business. They're not doing well. They're barely scraping by. People don't like paying for art because of the rise of clipart and things like this. It just...makes me sad.  Alright, rant over, hope your squad does well and if you do get a patch made, send a picture over of it embroidered :)  Just let people know. Art's worth paying for. You're going to wear that patch with pride, aren't you? Wouldn't you rather know you had it made and designed by someone whose paycheck and livelihood you contributed to, rather than a random person on reddit?"

I played D&D with my friends up until we had to go our separate ways. Ahh I miss those days.  We made up our own races/story/classes, but I'll give you the basics. I was an elven lady knight who specialized in healing magics and attempted to use the crossbow. However, for some darn reason, the first few times we played I only ever rolled increasingly lower and lower numbers for my healing spells. The GM got tired of this, and started saying my spells were backfiring so much that they blew up my teammates.  I then became known as the worst cleric ever, and decided to explode my enemies with healing spells instead.  By the end of the campaign I had defeated the entire enemy army and destroyed my fellow cleric-guild-gone-evil with my poisonous healing spells.  Good times.  Also. I'm a guy. Lost rock paper scissors and had to play as ""the one chick"" our group said we needed. I was a lady knight in name only. I acted and looked 100% like a guy. It was hilarious watching new players try to refer to me as a 'she' without bursting out laughing.  (Feel free to draw as guy or girl, really either would be fantastic.)"

He once betrayed a prince when he got stiffed on his fee, came back looking like a completely difference person, and got an advance on the request to go kill himself. He convinced a platoon of guards that he was a foreign dignitary and then convinced them the real foreign dignitary was as assassin, tricking them into kill him and starting a war. And his favourite pass time is to turn into one of his friends and convince the rest of them he isn't the changeling. He is a psychopathic asshole who plays with peoples lives, but toys with being ""just good enough"" that his allies don't ditch him."
