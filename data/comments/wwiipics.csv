wwiipics,3dote0,mingy,2,Sat Jul 18 01:41:04 2015 UTC,What are you trying to insinuate with this?
wwiipics,3dote0,MooDexter,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"If you look into the real story of PT 109, JFK made stupid mistakes which cost him his boat. Most of the PT 109 story was manufactured to make JFK look like a hero. If he would not not have been Joe's son, he would have faced court martial, not been awarded the Medal of Honor. Bonus points he won the Pulitzer Price for a book largely written for him, not by him. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiles_in_Courage#Authorship_controversy.   Whatever you think of Kennedy as president, you should at least know what parts are true and what parts were made up."
wwiipics,3dote0,mingy,5,Sat Jul 18 02:11:55 2015 UTC,"He never was awarded the Medal Of Honor, he got the Sailors Medal. Basically a non-combat Bronze Star. Check your facts maybe?"
wwiipics,3dote0,Orlando1701,2,Sat Jul 18 06:25:05 2015 UTC,"Could you provide a source for that claim?  As far as I'm currently concerned JFK was a man with Addison's Disease who tried relentlessly to join the service and serve his country. When his PT boat went down he swam and towed another man 3 and a half miles to land.   JFK was a decent writer. His thesis, Why England Slept,  was even published. This of course also was with serious help from editors, but what book isn't?"
wwiipics,3dote0,MooDexter,2,Sat Jul 18 02:24:49 2015 UTC,"With respect to PT-109, the wikipedia article on the subject shows that he lost the boat because it was run over by a destroyer, a comparatively sluggish ship compared to the much faster and more maneuverable PT boat, however, PT-109 was idle and they wefd obviously not paying attention. As commander, loss of the boat and crew were directly Kennedy's fault. That's what command is all about. In isolation (if he was not Joe's son) this would very likely have led to court martial (other google searches can find this out). He may not have been found responsible after court martial but the fact he was immediately branded a hero for losing his boat in such a ridiculous manner.  He did help save one crew member, but he won the navy cross for saving them all, despite the fact the situation was arguably due to his own negligence. The other crew members had a lot to do with their subsequent survival and rescue.  Of course, because of the mythology and his assassination, these are very sensitive questions.  As for the Pulitzer, well I never said he was stupid (he was obviously a very smart guy), but the evidence strongly suggests he managed Profiles in Courage and didn't actually write it. Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't usually win a Pulitzer. Again, Joe's money and influence at work.  Don't feel bad: Churchill, my personal hero, won the Nobel Prize in Literature and most of his work was similarly managed, though he had a much larger body of work and did very closely manage the production of his books"
wwiipics,3dote0,mingy,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:31 2015 UTC,"I won't disagree with the peculiarities, but I haven't seen anything before implicating Kennedy with the loss of the PT. Or for that matter the consequences of similar situations which did not involve Kennedy."
wwiipics,3dote0,MooDexter,0,Sat Jul 18 02:50:16 2015 UTC,He was an aggressive captain of his boat and PT boats were built to die is the reason it was lost.  So are you going to court martial him for being aggressive in a time when we needed that against the Japanese?  And then he did all he could to save his men.  He did nothing wrong beyond that.  His father did nothing to intervene.  Of all the mistakes that where occurring with in the Solomons to label this as something worthy of court martial is a joke.
wwiipics,3dote0,MooDexter,2,Sat Jul 18 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"I think we have common ground in believing that it was Kennedy's courage and valor in saving his crew from this tragedy that made him deserving of the Sailor's Medal. This was the focus of the whole ordeal,  not the sinking of the PT itself.   However, I'm curious as to how it sank. ""Agressivly"" manning a boat is kind of a vauge circumstance especially for the collision that is described. I don't know enough about WWII naval engagements to assess whether it could reasonably be Kennedy's fault.   I wouldn't doubt involvement from Jospeh P. Kennedy.  He was a very prominent figure on the national scene with allies in diverse fields. Most importantly he cared about the wellbeing of his family more than just about anything else.   Edit: Purple Heart not Sailors medal or Medal of Honor"

As a German he is the only western allied commander I hold as much distain for as for several Nazi higher-ups.  Got an interesting book about the Luftwaffe in 1945. Basically the Luftwaffe had almost no staunch Nazis left and everyone knew the war was lost, but they still did their utmost to fly missions not because to give the regime a few more days but because they knew every bomber shot down meant some civilians would survive.  EDIT: Book is ""Luftwaffe '45: Letzte Flüge und Projekte"" by Manfred Griehl"
wwiipics,3daubv,SeasRough,4,Wed Jul 15 08:21:24 2015 UTC,"USAAF made two runs over Dresden too.  Bomber Harris' ostracization included: ""After the War, Harris was awarded the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta First Class on 12 June 1945, advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 14 June 1945 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross of Brazil on 13 November 1945. He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the United States on 14 June 1946 and promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force on 1 January 1946.  In February 1953 Winston Churchill, now Prime Minister again, insisted that Harris accept a baronetcy and he became Baronet.""  I would love to be ostracized like that.  While area bombing certainly would not win the war, the US did no better with daylight bombing or in Japan.  As far as Dresden was concerned, Max Hastings and others have plenty of documented, justification for it being a target. You can argue the strategy that Churchill and others were gullible enough to believe, but any claims of war criminal are a joke when compared to the Germans burying what they did at Treblinka and other extermination camps."

Anti-tank rockets were developed to provide a more man-portable weapon that could deal with armored targets such as tanks, and even these were often effective only against the rear, top or tracks of a vehicle, not necessarily the front/sides and not from any great distance.    Many of these were used throughout the war and even after by partisan units and on the Eastern Front, but didn't see as much favor in the west.  The bazooka began to appear in '42, and the German Panzerfaust and Panzershreck (itself a bazooka copy) found greater favor against armor.  They were cheaper, easier to handle and more effective, although the older 12.7mm and 20mm anti-tank rifles were often very sturdy weapons that could themselves take a lot of abuse that a light rocket may not tolerate.  A damaged bazooka could be as dangerous to the operator."

The Republic of China, which succeeded the Qing Dynasty in 1912, was fraught with factional warlordism and foreign incursions. The Northern Expedition of 1928 nominally unified China under Kuomintang (KMT) control, yet Imperial Japan loomed as the greatest foreign threat. The Chinese urgency for modernizing its military and national defense industry, coupled with Germany's need for a stable supply of raw materials, put the two states on the road of close relations from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. Although intense cooperation lasted only until the start of the war with Japan in 1937, and concrete measures at industrial reform started in earnest only in 1936, it had a profound effect on Chinese modernization and the capability of the Chinese to resist the Japanese in the war.

Clarence Smoyer:   We were told to just move into the intersection far enough to fire into the side of the enemy tank, which had its gun facing up the other street [where the Sherman had been destroyed]. However, as we entered the intersection, our driver had his periscope turned toward the Panther and saw their gun turning to meet us. When I turned our turret, I was looking into the Panther's gun tube; so instead of stopping to fire, our driver drove into the middle of the intersection so we wouldn't be a sitting target. As we were moving, I fired once. Then we stopped and I fired two more shells to make sure they wouldn't fire at our side. All three of our shells penetrated, one under the gun shield and two on the side. The two side hits went completely through and out the other side.   link"

I would assume that if the king of Belgium took control of a country, he would do so using Belgian forces whether they're privately contracted or not.

wwiipics,3bncm2,Lord_Ciar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:13:51 2015 UTC,"Belgian Congo:       The Belgian Congo (French: Congo Belge, Dutch: Belgisch-Congo ) was a Belgian colony in Central Africa between 1908 and 1960 in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).  Colonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of the Belgians persuaded the government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. Their ambivalence resulted in Leopold's creating a colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885.  By the turn of the century, however, the violence used by Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and a ruthless system of economic extraction led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.   Belgian rule in the Congo was based on the ""colonial trinity"" (trinité coloniale) of state, missionary and private company interests.  The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied, and the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers raised by the indigenous population.  The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set ""native policy"" (politique indigène). This was in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. The Congo had a high degree of racial segregation. The large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum, but were always treated as superior to blacks.

The really big improvements to the infrastructure and such where obviously after WWII hence my comment on late 1940's-1950. Unless you think that Belgium somehow managed to better the situation while it was occupied by Germany.  I find it strange that some people still try to make the Congo a good thing, a better thing that it was. It's much like the Turkish trying to make the Genocide of the Armenians purely relocation with unfortunate results. Belgium went there, occupied, conscripted and brutally oppressed a huge swath of land to exploit it and did so out of purely economic interests. Ancillary support by priests/missions (although not all did and some where worse) and other organisations improved the way of life slowly after Belgium officially took over but the same people stayed in charge with the same modus operandi and only one goal, exploitation of resources and labour. That's much what patrice Lumumba, a man who lived through it and took action against it, said but off course he was killed not long after."

Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation. The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new. When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again. The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids.

wwiipics,3bhd7n,doodeman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:44:36 2015 UTC,"Combat box:       The Combat Box was a tactical formation used by heavy (strategic) bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. The combat box was also referred to as a ""staggered formation"". Its defensive purpose was in massing the firepower of the bombers' guns, while offensively it concentrated the release of bombs on a target.   Initially formations were created in keeping with the pre-war Air Corps doctrine that massed bombers could attack and destroy targets in daylight without fighter escort, relying on interlocking fire from their defensive machine guns, almost exclusively the Browning M2 .50-calibre gun. However the use of high altitudes by USAAF bombers resulted in factors that demanded a tighter bomb pattern and the combat box continued in use even after the advent of fighter escort — and especially starting in the spring of 1944 over Europe, with USAAF fighters flying far ahead of the combat boxes in air supremacy mode instead against the Luftwaffe's fighters — largely mitigated the threat of fighter interception.   Creation of the concept is credited to Colonel Curtis E. LeMay, commander of the 305th Bombardment Group in England.    However the Eighth Air Force had been experimenting with different tactical formations since its first bombing mission on 17 August 1942, several of which were also known as ""boxes."" LeMay's group did create the ""Javelin Down"" combat box in December 1942, and that formation became the basis for the numerous variations of combat boxes that followed.

My grandfather tended towards humility and had a habit of downplaying his participation so most of what I know about his career in WW2 came from third parties (men who served under him, my grandma after he passed in 2006). Most of what he would tell me personally was pretty tame stuff, I don't think he wanted his grandchildren to see him as a soldier who killed people.   He talked alot more about the Korean war, by then he was a major and I don't think he saw a lot of action and maybe found that to be an easier topic to touch on."

They were, by their very nature, part of the Nazi propaganda campaign to show that Parisians were happy and prosperous under German occupation - which was never the case.

Brazil was the only independent South American country to send ground troops to fight in the Second World War.   This air-land force fought in Italy from September 1944 to May 1945, while the Brazilian Navy as well as the air force also acted in the Atlantic Ocean from the middle of 1942 until the end of war. During the eight months of the Italian campaign, the Brazilian Expeditionary Force managed to take 20,573 Axis prisoners, consisting of two generals, 892 officers, and 19,679 other ranks. Brazil lost 948 of its own men killed in action across all three services during the Italian campaign.

One is the absolute clarity of the image, the technical mastery of early photographic technology. The other is just how human the whole damn thing is, from his twinkling eyes and Mona Lisa smile, to the quaint Bavarian farmhouse in the background.    German photographer August Sander aimed to document a cross-section of the people of the Weimar Republic. He was not a Nazi or even a sympathizer though; in fact the Nazis seized and destroyed the original plates (negatives on glass instead of cellulose film) from his first book, Faces of our Time, which had originally been published in 1929. He remained in Germany during the war, however he moved from Cologne out into the country to try and stay out of everything. His son however was an active Socialist and he was jailed by the Nazis, where he died in the last year of what was to be a decade of incarceration."

wwiipics,3761ut,michaelconfoy,3,Mon May 25 04:36:00 2015 UTC,"Can anyone explain why this  trench was built in a roughly linear fashion as opposed to the sterotypical ""zig-zag"" German WW1 trenches? Was the need for efficient communication + supply greater than the risk of enfilading fire and shrapnel? Were the small bends seen as sufficient for this purpose?"
wwiipics,3761ut,BullMoosePartyAnimal,3,Mon May 25 06:17:43 2015 UTC,Were the small bends seen as sufficient for this purpose? I would think so; Trenches weren't nearly as effective as they had been in WW1 so it wouldn't make much sense building a extremely complex trench with lots of zigzags/zigzaging. In addition WW2 trenches weren't nearly as large as WW1 trenches so maybe the zigzaging pattern wasn't needed due to the size of the trenches.    These trenches probably aren't finished; look at the guy standing in the trench in the center of the image the trench doesn't even reach his knee so it's probably about 30cm deep. Compare that to the guys in the top right where only their head is sticking out.
wwiipics,3761ut,FunkyForceFive,2,Mon May 25 07:15:18 2015 UTC,One reason might be is that they probably arrived via armored personnel carriers.

Plus the three guys near the T-intersection partway back look to be standing up straight and the trench wall ends near their stomach.  Were these trenches incomplete or were they designed to be shallow?

That wasn't the whole point of the matter though the point was that the Tirpitz was never active in that area and my question was related to that.

wwiipics,36qv7z,blackjacksandhookers,19,Thu May 21 12:04:39 2015 UTC,"Background info:  Leni Riefenstahl lived a very long and interesting life. She was a popular filmmaker, actress, author, dancer, and photographer. But she is best known for directing the famous ""Triumph of the Will"", which covered the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. Riefenstahl was on friendly terms with Hitler and released other projects during his rule.   In September 1939 she and a film crew accompanied the German Army as war correspondents. The unit she was with suffered casualties near the town of Konskie. Their response was to round up male Jews in Konskie and make them dig a pit, apparently to serve as graves for the killed soldiers. Under unclear circumstances the Jews fled from the pit, and the Wehrmacht proceeded to kill  22 of them.   Riefenstahl reacted with horror. She complained to German officers about the incident. Generalfeldmarshall Manstein and one of his aides confirmed this. Yet this did not stop her from maintaining a close relationship with Hitler or from continuing her work under the Nazis (one of her films used Gypsy prisoners as extras). And soon after the massacre she filmed the Wehrmacht's victory parade in Warsaw."
wwiipics,36qv7z,MGJon,7,Thu May 21 12:53:19 2015 UTC,"I imagine it going like this:  Leni: ""Führer, I am outraged!""  Hitler: ""We need more films.  Here is a bunch of cash.""

The wars in iraq and the global war on terror has since the nineties lead to the death of millions through both sanctions and outright application of force.  Even tho people might be or should be outraged by that i still see most of us still acting as members of the very societies that has perpetrated this. This is a grey area  as some of the actions have been justified and some haven't.  And acting on this like Reifensthal did is not something we all would have done. Most would have been horrified but going through with an actual complaint through the chains of command is another thing. Its one thing to be horrified about a drone strike on some wedding in jemen killing a bunch of people but to act on it in a time of war and in such a totalitarian system as the third rich, im not sure i would have done it, i hope i would but im not sure."

Second, her relationship with Hitler was friendly and not in any way a ruler-servant dynamic. Finally, there is no chance that she'd be sent to a camp if she simply stopped her film work. She took advantage of her position in the Nazi regime and in the end wasn't stopped by any moral scruples."

I really wish I knew more about the very few anti-aircraft rockets used in WW2. If anyone has any ideas on what specifically causedd this please share. I would have just guessed high density 3.7cm Flak and 8.8cm Flak.
wwiipics,36hyvr,Deepseat,3,Tue May 19 15:18:32 2015 UTC,can you imagine surviving that?  You hear an explosion and then the sound of pops and breaking metal. You turn around to see the half the fuselage of your plane almost gone. Flak going through a human body isnt a pretty or fun experience.

It was introduced into service in 1918 by the German Army during World War I as the primary weapon of the Sturmtruppen, assault groups specialized in trench combat. Although MP18 production ended in the 1920s, its design formed the basis of most submachine guns manufactured between 1920 and 1960. [citation needed]  The firepower of this new class of weapons made such an impression on the Allies that the Treaty of Versailles specifically banned further study and manufacture of such light automatic firearms by Germany.

But, giving Hartmann's usual tactics - skydiving to attack an unsuspecting target from above, then immediate withdrowal back to high altitude, regardless of the results of the attack - there were no dogfights as such, so enemy's skill does not really matter, it is indeed more about opportunity and planes' service ceiling."

wwiipics,35mjz8,guidoninja,1 point,Tue May 12 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"At one point, the C-47 grew a pair of water wings. Initially, planners thought the Navy and Marine island hopping campaign in the Pacific would require an amphibian float plane since they knew many of the islands were without airfields.  The Edo Corporation, of College Point, N.Y. designed, and built twin, 1-ton floats, (the largest floats ever built). Each float was 42 feet long, five feet, eight inches wide, and displaced 29,000 pounds of water. The cellular construction of each float had 14 separate water-tight compartments. Each float also had a 325 gallon fuel tank. The floats had fully retractable, hydraulic wheels, and could land on water, snow or land. The float rudders were connected to the air rudder.   They could be disconnected in flight.The C-47C weighed 34,162 pounds and had several serious deficiencies. Pilots found the C-47C difficult to launch in rough water, and performed like a pogo stick when landing on anything but a mirror smooth body of water. It had a high tire failure on land, and was difficult to handle in a crosswind landing. The C-47C was slow on take-off and JATO bottles did little to improve its performance. It was also about 30 mph slower than its sisters without floats."

Douglas MacArthur, for years hailed as an American ""hero"" was most certainly not. In truth, had he been tried in a military court today, MacArthur would likely be found guilty of being a traitor, or at the very least, a war criminal.  He was almost single handily responsible for the fall of the Philippine Islands, which resulted in the single biggest military defeat in US history....responsible also for the infamous Bataan Death March and thousands of deaths.  Progressive-thinking (not revisionist) historians acknowledge that the history books lied...big time, as MacArthur was not only a coward who refused, out of fear for his personal safety, a direct order from the White House to prepare the islands for the imminent Japanese invasion (immediately after Pearl Harbor), he took $millions$ from the Philippine government.  But America needed heroes during and right after the war and MacArthur had the arrogance, political connections and theatrical skill to hide his cowardice...and in spite of his clear guilt, politically he was important and was tasked with writing the Japanese ""constitution"" after their defeat.  There are living survivors of the Bataan Death March...ask them if they are aware of this repressed US history, and they will tell you they certainly are... and most all of them despise, even hate, MacArthur, which is, historically, more than justified.

wwiipics,34be39,11thArmored,8,Wed Apr 29 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"Ray Miller was my grandfather and was always very proud to have served with the 11th Armored during WW2 as a radio man for artillery spotting. He always told us how one day he bulls eyed a Panther tank with an artillery round called in perfectly on the top turret. Late in the war, Ray and a handful of his unit were called to the front to check out a camp up on the ridge, it turned out to be Mauthausen concentration camp. Ray took many photos of the camp and has told us many stories over the years and I believe it was one of his most proud, yet sobering accomplishments. In the last few years we took him to the world war 2 memorial in DC and the Holocaust museum, where children were rushing to take pictures with him, they were in awe of a real life hero amongst them. He couldn't take the museum anymore once it moved to the camp section, but I'm happy he got to see the value of what he did through his service. Although later in life he developed severe dementia, his last memories he had were of service in world war 2 and the liberation and living condition of those camps. I always wanted to find someone who was affected by the liberation or a survivor who has stories as I would like to share them with his family during the funeral.  Ray worked from an M3 mark B half-track command carrier (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3_Half-track) and is pictured here in front of an M7 self-propelled artillery piece (the ones he called in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M7_Priest), commonly called a priest by the British), which fired a 105 mm shell. I have many more pictures as well I will upload of the camps and 11th Armored in action."

Excellent photo of him in front of the M7, and I for one, and Im sure many others, would be honored to see any other photos Ray had taken/etc. Sounds like a very interesting album.   Im happy to hear that you guys took him to the Memorial and he got to see the Museum. If you haven't done so already, you can request his service records from the NARA. You might learn some extra info, and sometimes they have photos/etc.  It takes some months to reach you, but it is sometimes worth it.  I wonder where he was when he called in the Arty strike on the Panther? That would be interesting to know, as I could possibly pin down the unit the Panther was from.  Anyway, may he rest in peace. we are losing these heroes daily now, and they will never be forgotten."

The G-1 and G-2 had narrow wheels and the G-3 and G-4 had wider wheels necessitating a bulge on top of the wing not visible in the photo.  /u/Louie445's comment has me confused.
wwiipics,33w3vk,Duke_of_Fritzburg,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:31:14 2015 UTC,Maybe he's implying that the canopies were different between variants? I'll check that in a bit.

That's probably what he meant, but from what we can see, it looks like one of the earlier canopies, as the later ones were more rounded. Also, about the bulge on the top of the wing, the undercarriage would have to be wider for that, as the bulge would be half inside the wing roots where the undercarriage is now."

Laid down in May 1940 as the third of the Yamato-class battleships, Shinano‍ '​s partially complete hull was ordered to be converted to a supercarrier following Japan's disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at the Battle of Midway in mid-1942.  Her conversion was still incomplete in November 1944 when she was ordered to sail from the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to Kure Naval Base to complete fitting out and transfer a load of 50 Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka rocket-propelled kamikaze flying bombs. Hastily dispatched, she had an inexperienced crew, serious design and construction flaws, lacked adequate pumps and fire control system, and did not even carry a single carrier aircraft.

wwiipics,33a8hr,Skudworth,7,Mon Apr 20 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"I am a member of an Armoured unit and this is common practice even today! A soldiers feet (even in the armoured corps!) is one of the top priorities to remain combat effective. So keeping your troops feet healthy falls directly on the soldier himself and his patrol leader. After long marches or extended time in the field we periodically assume this exact position and have our feet looked over by our patrol leader/section commander.   Soldiers have a nasty habit of not reporting injurys or illness due to the stigma of ""looking weak"". This inspection ensures no trooper is hiding his damaged feet and risking further injury."
wwiipics,33a8hr,Johnny_Gage,6,Tue Apr 21 04:37:01 2015 UTC,It's not the particular environment it's the fact that a soldier's feet are just about the most important part of his body. A soldier who can't walk can't march and can't run and he is of no good use to anyone. Taking care of one's feet is of paramount importance and for a British Army that witnessed what happens to feet that don't get the proper care during WW1 I would assume what we see here is a routine inspection by a medical officer to ensure the soldier's feet are in good shape.

I met a veteran who was a heavy machine gunner. he said the guy who he replaced just put the gun down and refused to pick it up again so the sergeant made him carry it."
wwiipics,32u77r,Crack_is_whack140,2,Fri Apr 17 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"For the curious:    The large gun in the foreground is the M1917 Browning machine gun.  That large cylinder at the front is the water cooling system which kept the barrel from overheating during extended firing.  This gun was belt-fed (as you can plainly see) with .30 caliber rounds.  As others have pointed out, this weapon could be fired for long periods without the danger of the heat generated by this much use causing deformation of the barrel.  This beast weighed in at over 100 pounds inclusive of the ammo, tripod, and water needed to keep it cool.  Though it had been invented years earlier, the US Army had no interest in this gun until America entered WWI.  Hence the ""1917"" designation.  The gun saw action in WWI, WWII, Korea, and Viet Nam.    The other gun is the M3 submachine gun.  It was made to replace the very expensive and beautifully handmade M1928 Thompson submachine gun.  Both weapons fired the same .45 caliber ACP ammunition.  It was nicknamed the ""Grease Gun"" because of its general resemblance to the tool used to grease automobile chassis of the time.  The nickname also gave rise to the phrase ""Grease 'em!"" or ""We greased them"" as euphemisms for killing the enemy.  The weapon was constructed mostly of stamped steel parts which were welded together.  There is no beautiful wood shoulder stock or any wood at all in this gun.  Only the most essential parts of the gun (the firing mechanism and the barrel) were machined steel.  This further reduced the cost to produce them and greatly shortened the time required to produce one of them.  The odd thing is that while the M3 was cheaply made, they are considered to be more accurate at range than the Thompson they were designed to replace.  Many thousands of these guns and their variants saw service from late 1942 through the 1990 Gulf War."

They had bugged Trent Park from top to bottom and as a result recorded extraordinary tales of massacres and shootings etc. After the war, although Churchill had wanted to use the evidence gathered at the Nuremberg trials, MI19 chose not too so as to kept their methods of subterfuge a secret. The Cold War had begun in earnest and it was believed these methods could be used again.   The man on the far left is Dietrich von Choltitz, he was military governor of Paris when he surrendered the garrison to the Free French.   Next to him is Generalleutnant Heinrich Kittel, commander of 462 Volksgrenadier division.   In December 1944 he was recorded while speaking with General-major Paul von Felbert. Here's a transcript of what he said.    ""The things I've experienced! In Latvia, near Dvinsk, there were mass executions of Jews carried out by the SS. ""There were about 15 SS men and perhaps 60 Latvians, known to be the most brutal people in the world. I was lying in bed one Sunday morning when I kept hearing two salvos followed by small-arms fire."" On investigating, Kittel found ""men, women and children - they were counted off and stripped naked. The executioners first laid all the clothes in one pile. Then 20 women had to take up their position - naked - on the edge of the trench. They were shot and fell down into it."" ""How was it done?"" asked Felbert. ""They faced the trench,"" Kittel replied. ""And then 20 Latvians came up behind and simply fired once through the back of their heads, and they fell down forwards into the trench like ninepins."" Kittel gave an order forbidding such executions from taking place ""outside, where people can look on. If you shoot people in the wood or somewhere where no one can see,"" he told the SS men, ""that's your own affair. But I absolutely forbid another day's shooting here. We draw our drinking water from deep springs; we're getting nothing but corpse water there."" ""What did they do to the children?"" asked Felbert. Kittel - who sounded ""very excited"" at this point, according to the transcriber - answered: ""They seized three-year-old children by the hair, held them up and shot them with a pistol and then threw them in. I saw that for myself. One could watch it."""

On April 29, 1945, during the oflag assembly a plane with Polish insygnia had appeared in the sky, circled above the assembly square, tried to signal something and went away. Soon on the road to the camp appeared American tanks. At the same time from the other side of Murnau 2 German cars approached. They stopped upon noticing the tanks. Germans had been taken by surprise. SS officer in the first car opened fire from the machine gun, at the same time his companion jumped out of the veihicle. Both men were killed on a spot by Americans. The same fate met the passangers of the second car. Among the killed Germans was SS general Fik. His briefcase contained the letter signed by Himmler. It was an order to kill all 5000 Polish officers in Murnau. To execute this task Fik had had at his dsposal an SS group in 40 armoured vehicles that started from Munich. Most likely the SS-man intended to assemble the POWs and killed them with the machine guns fire from guard's towers.   Source"

This goes perfectly with the discussion I was having with another ww2 enthusiast yesterday, who thought the US had it easy when advancing through Germany in 45. Far from it, from my opinion. Uneccessary casualties on both sides at this time in the war, when the average German soldier had lost much hope."

wwiipics,3235rz,BaxterParp,2,Fri Apr 10 12:18:57 2015 UTC,"There was a German training unit in Normandy that was equipped with French vehicles of all sorts. That unit participated in the fighting but was quickly taken out (1940 tanks). The equipment everybody is wearing though would suggest 1940. On the other hand there is a big american like star on the front of the tank. I'm curious about what is atually going on on this photo.  Edit: I found this website that said the following: (tldr: recaptured 1944 tanks, that we know the German used)  After the Allies had invaded France in 1944, some B1s were recaptured. Several were used on an individual and incidental basis by resistance forces, such as those fighting the German garrison of Paris in August 1944. On 7 October 1944, the Provisional Government of the French Republic formed the 13th Dragoon Regiment of the Free French Forces. The majority of the regiment fielded SOMUA S35cavalry tanks, but Captain Edmond Voillaume's 2nd Company was equipped with 19 B1 bis tanks, which included a mixture of standard and German modified B-2s. They were stationed in Orléans until 2 April 1945, when they were mobilized for the Allied siege of La Rochelle."

Interestingly, mentioned within the same article is Sergeant Tillison who is presumably the gentleman featured in the other photo which you posted and lends credence to the idea that we are looking at the right people.  Nate Bradlin is listed as having had fours years of High School and had been a Retail Manager in civilian life, enlisting into the army on August 5th 1941 and joining the ""Philippine Department""- interestingly the photo you have posted has a blurred map titled ""The Mediterranean Theater of War"" in the background.   Bradlin graduated from the Signals Corps Officer Candidate School Association, class of September 1942 and joined the 504th Infantry Regiment who in 1943 were operational in North Africa, Sicily and, most likely, Italy at the time the above article was written.  I have struggled to find anything regarding his later career, blocked by paywalls etc, however, he is listed here as having died October 1st 1980 at an age of 61 years.

wwiipics,2zqp8e,guitar_vigilante,1 point,Sat Mar 21 05:25:13 2015 UTC,"I'm interested, elaborate?"
wwiipics,2zqp8e,Matta174,2,Sat Mar 21 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"So if you are a manufacturer the very last thing you want is high levels of inventory. Inventory represents wasted costs because it's just sitting there doing nothing. Imagine if they had half of the tank treads sitting their, that represents a lot of money that the manufacturer could spend on other things, like expanding production lines, improving efficiency, paying down debt, buying working capital, etc.   So basically after World War II, the Japanese, especially Toyota, invented a system of manufacturing called Just In Time, or Lean. Lean made the entire manufacturing process much more efficient, more cost effective, and vastly decreased the amount of inventory required to be kept on the factory floor at any one point in time."
wwiipics,2zqp8e,guitar_vigilante,0,Sat Mar 21 20:09:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah no, war time manufacturing is vastly different from pure profit driven modern company manufacturing."
wwiipics,2zqp8e,eldrich01,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:57:00 2015 UTC,"No, it really isn't, at least not what I am describing. Suppose that factory isn't working for a profit and is in fact working as a part of a planned economy (as in this instance it was). That extra inventory doesn't necessarily represent wasted money, but the opportunity cost of holding all of those treads is going to be higher than the opportunity cost of say producing more rifles, bullets, bombs, etc.  Manufacturing is manufacturing, and being more efficient as a manufacturer is better whether you are in war or not, unless for some reason being in wartime means that you can be more inefficient?  Imagine if Nazi Germany had lean manufacturing; they would have been that much harder to defeat as their war machine would have been more efficient and able to produce more."
wwiipics,2zqp8e,guitar_vigilante,0,Sun Mar 22 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"No this is just an assembly plant, they most likely didn't make the treads. In war time logistics can get fucked big time and you can't rely on your daily delivery of treads for the day etc also output can be vastly different based on what's needed in a specific timeframe, you really can't compare it to normal manufacturing."
wwiipics,2zqp8e,eldrich01,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they made the treads. And guess what, in peace-time logistics can get messed up big time as well (see the California Dock Workers' strikes for a recent and very big example), that's why you do want to hold some minimum inventory, but it is absolutely comparable to normal manufacturing. Manufacturing doesn't change because the buyer is now the state when it was a private agent before. Does Raytheon or Boeing change its manufacturing policies when it's selling to the defense department and when it's selling to Delta or American Airlines? Of course it doesn't."
wwiipics,2zqp8e,guitar_vigilante,0,Sun Mar 22 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"Ofc they don't why would they change it? It's perfectly normal peacetime manufacturing, doesn't matter who the buyer is.  This however changes greatly if you are in a war and your railways and other ways of transportation get bombed daily. You really can't compare that to peacetime messed up logistics lol."

The United States insisted that both its people at home and its armed forces abroad should receive fantastically generous allocations of food, even when shipping space was at a premium. For every pound of supplies the Japanese transported to their island garrisons, many of whom – at Rabaul, for instance – spent the second half of the war engaged in subsistence vegetable gardening rather than combat operations, the US shipped two tons to its own forces. American reluctance to feed their men on local supplies was increased by the shortcomings of some nations’ canning processes: eight US airmen died in an outbreak of botulism after eating Australian tinned beetroot. American specialists were thereupon dispatched to raise local standards. Major Belford Seabrook, of the famous New Jersey agribusiness, introduced its principles to Australia.

It will ask for your email but its a trustworthy website. Once you're signed up you're free to read through all his writings and research papers, free of charge. Most of his writings cover the Soviet Union specifically but he does cover the US/UK/Germany too. I was astonished at the wealth of information available for nothing...  Here is a paper written by him that covers the production of munitions from 1935-1945 for the USSR/UK/US/Germany. Without experiencing combat on its native soils its large factory base was quickly rerouted for arms production and the US became the worlds factory for a time, outproducing all other countries combined! Germany at fist lagged behind and then increased production to match the Soviets, but this doesn't account for production by the US & UK. They were able to produce significant quantities of materials in spite of the Allied bombing campaigns. Makes you wonder what would have been capable had that bombing never taken place.

If one takes into consideration the numbers at the outset of Operation Barbarossa, I think by sometime around Dec. 1941 - Jan/Feb. 1942, numerically speaking, the Red Army had suffered casualties larger than what it was comprised of before the war. In essence it was a completely new army that was fighting by the middle of that first winter, while the original army had either been completely destroyed or captured. The munitions industry would struggle to get back online in the beginning of 1942 but by the close of the year it was at full production, producing around a Tank Battalions worth of T-34s a day (25-30 T-34s and that's not including artillery/support vehicles/aircraft/ammunition/everything else).  Cheers!"

wwiipics,2z6vig,vet_laz,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"Anytime man!  I was giving it some further thought and what I linked too was all info about arms production. If you wanted to get to know more about how the countries got their arms from the factories to the front, that's a topic I'm not too familiar with. I know the American Merchant Marine played a huge role, considering almost all weapons had to be shipped across the Pacific or Atlantic. Similarly the submarine fleet of the US Navy essentially blockaded the Japanese home islands from importing and exporting war materials. That would be a partial explanation for 1 lb. of supplies vs 2 tons. For somewhere like the Eastern Front I think everything was moved by rail for the most part."

I've been reading about Market Garden for a while and taken an interest in that particular battle.  It seems it was a reaffirmation for the Allies that the Germans hadn't given up.  I'll paraphrase from other war stories, but there was no shortage of valor despite some major problems in planning.    There are dozens of great books about Market Garden, and it's funny that many of them use these photos as their covers.    A Bridge Too Far is the classic starting point.  One of the best WWII books in my opinion.  Cornelius Ryan helped popularize the battle and the war for the general public, and his other books did much the same.    Martin Middlebrook's Arnhem 1944 focuses on the British 1st Airborne fight largely, and is a good read, if more modern and detail-driven.    John Frost, Colonel in the 2nd Battalion that made it to the Arnhem Bridge, has a great memoir called A Drop Too Many, that reviews his efforts from North Africa to capture in the Netherlands and as a POW at the end of the war.    Other significant figures in the battle such as Roy Urquhart (Cmdr of 1st Airborne), James Gavin (Cmdr of 82nd), and even a private in the 1st Airborne named James Sims have great memoirs/autobiographies that detail their experience in the battle with varying degrees of high-level strategy.   Robert Kershaw's It Never Snows in September details the battle from the German perspective and is an interesting read.  It will build your knowledge of and appreciation for the complexity of German names, from surnames to units and ranks.  But it's good character-building regarding the battle and understanding the Werhmacht and SS.    For probably the best pictorial perspective, there's a great 2-book coffee-table style collection from After the Battle, a British military history magazine with great then-and-now type photo-sets.  Really excellent stuff."

The Germans went with a hardened projectile that actually penetrated."

The infallibility of the Wehrmacht has been dispelled in this respect since the mid-nineties. Numerous accounts of ""ordinary"" soldiers either witnessing mass executions or actively taking part have been recounted, most recently in Soldaten: On Fighting, Killing & Dying. The Wehrmacht was also heavily implicit in the extermination process, either in orgainsing the roundup and transportation of ""enemies"" to the killing fields or death camps, or actively taking part in mass executions.   However, the problem still arises when people go the opposite way and brand every member as culpable. The higher echelons in the OKH & OKW surely knew the full extent of their murderous regime. Yet, there was roughly 20 million men who served, on fronts that spanned hundreds of miles. The idea that they can all be branded as ""evil Nazis"" is as ridiculous as also saying no member of the Heer ever committed a war crime.   The ""evil Nazi"" persona is a fail safe in my opinion though. It blinds people to the fact that ordinary men can commit horrific crimes. The common call, to express the Nazi hierarchy as evil monsters negates the horror of what happened. Camp commandants had families, wives and children. The men of the Einstazgruppen had girlfriends, wives, sisters, daughters and mothers and yet they shot women in there thousands. By blindly saying these men were ""evil"" fits a narrative that this was something out of the ordinary and can never happen again.

wwiipics,2wdhxy,ffemt300,2,Thu Feb 19 00:37:21 2015 UTC,"Sturmgeschütz:       Sturmgeschütz (or StuG) meaning ""assault gun"" was a series of armored vehicles used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War that primarily consisted of the StuG III and StuG IV. The most common of the two, the StuG III, was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III. The StuG III was initially designated ""StuG"" but with the creation of the StuG IV it was re-designated the ""StuG III"" to distinguish the two. Initially they were intended as a mobile, armored gun platform, providing close fire support to the infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes and other entrenched positions. As the war progressed a number of aspects of the StuG series made them a valued supplement to the panzer forces.

wwiipics,2wdhxy,fleadh12,2,Thu Feb 19 11:05:11 2015 UTC,"Seeing those concrete pillars with the steel beams running across in the background made me think of the fighting in the factory district. That type of construction is primarily used for buildings of an industrial nature, right? As for the weather, extreme conditions had yet to become a factor in the battle in late October although it was quickly cooling down around this time.  This picture looked really familiar so I went through some books I have on the battle and managed to find what I was looking for. I'm relatively certain this is one picture from a series of several that depict the 79th Infantry Division as it conducted assaults on the Red October factory late in October. Around mid October the 79th ID was pulled out of its defensive positions at Serafimovich along the Don River to the North East and was sent into combat owing to the severe casualties being suffered within the city. That would also explain why you think the soldiers pictured look so well equipped. They're fresh chops for the meatgrinder that Stalingrad had turned into. I'll post an album later of some really famous pictures from this very assault.   source book ""Winter Storm"" by Hans Wijers"

I've googled around the 79th a bit and it does make sense that this photo marries up with the articles details - persumably the troops were, as you say fresh meat for the grinder meaning it would have been the first front they've been to for many of them - so sad!"

Those men are of the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf, a unit that suffered a lot of casualties during the campaign in France, and like a good SS unit also committed its first of many atrocities of the war in the campaign as well after they murdered more than 90 Royal Norwiches who had surrendered after running out of ammo.   Their uniforms point to a time period post-invasion of Russia. The Division has a particularly vile history, it was first recruited and manned with guards and staff from the prison camps in 1939 and it's initial commander, Theodore Eicke, was a former commandant of Dachau as well as the man who murdered Ernst Rohm on the night of the long knives."

The earlier ones were lacking the foliage loops. The (what seems to be blurred edge) helmet cover is older (lack of foliage loops is the first model).

wwiipics,2vuhio,Rainpath,5,Sat Feb 14 14:47:36 2015 UTC,Juno sustained the highest % of casualties of all beaches on D-Day.  And in the coming week's they dealt with 70% of all the armor thrown at the invasion beaches.
wwiipics,2vuhio,Rainpath,1 point,Sat Feb 14 15:44:27 2015 UTC,"No, that is incorrect. Omaha sustained the most casualties due to lack of support from the 79th, which Juno had."
wwiipics,2vuhio,Rainpath,7,Sat Feb 14 16:46:17 2015 UTC,"Number of people killed/injured?  Yes, it was Omaha as they landed twice the amount so even though the % of casualties was lower you are correct they did indeed have a higher number of people killed/injured.  It seems we are both correct, it's all in how you spin your numbers.  Omaha struggled for a few hours because the bombers missed and the navy essentially sank their own tanks.  Juno was going to be nasty regardless, Omaha had the air force and navy not fucked up wouldn't have been anywhere near as bad. That being said if you had to pick one of those 2 beaches to land on on D-Day mathematically you'd be safer on Omaha."
wwiipics,2vuhio,Rainpath,2,Sat Feb 14 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Both had fierce opposition and many brave lives were lost. After the first hour, Juno received little no no opposition on its beachhead, the fighting had moved into the villages which were extremely close to the landing,  comparative of the other beach heads. The amount of space in between the water and the enemy was far longer at Omaha, not to mention the shear rock cliffs and man made defensive posts. Now, if we want to get into numbers.. Juno had an 18% casualty rate and Omaha had a 23% casualty rate.   Like I said, I'm not discounting the fight at Juno but, if I had to choose which beach to assault, I'm definitely choosing Juno.  Edit: Grammar."
wwiipics,2vuhio,Rainpath,2,Sat Feb 14 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"Juno had 20, Omaha had 19.  Omaha was terrible for a few hours but then things calmed down (calmed down by d-day standards).  Juno had unknown rocky bottoms on the approaches to the beaches so the landing craft had to unload much further out than was planned.  I'm too lazy to go look up numbers but the differences might not be as big as you think (even with that Omaha had a longer run up)  Juno did have tanks with them, had the navy at Omaha took into account the weather that day Omaha would also have had some tank support.  Even without the tank support if you landed at 2PM on Omaha your chances of getting through that day raise considerably.  If you landed at 2PM on Juno you would likely still not have figured out how the Germans kept popping up behind you after you had just cleared the street.  If you were going in first wave, sure take Juno, if you are landing on June 6th on one of the beaches but don't know when, no doubt Omaha is the one to choose."
wwiipics,2vuhio,ww2colorizations,3,Sat Feb 14 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"Where are you obtaining your numbers? I have Omaha at 43,250 and 10,000 casualties. I have Juno at 21,400 and 1200 casualties."
wwiipics,2vuhio,Rainpath,2,Sat Feb 14 17:27:05 2015 UTC,So Juno is at 5%?  That's fairly low.  When I finish work I'll give you a couple of books where I pulled my numbers.  Authors Zuehlke and Ambrose for certain but I'll come back with books/pages.

Had it rough when they pushed past the beachhead though. They met the 21st Panzer Division and other Grenadier Regiments who were waiting for them in the villages.  As a side note to U/InternalExile, I personally wouldn't use Ambrose as a factual source, as he has been called out many times for false info, fake interviews, and regurgitation from unchecked sources himself, amongst incorrect (jumbled) unit/factual info.

Upper left is the upright USS Maryland.  She took 2 armor piercing bombs and took on water, but her anti-aircraft batteries continued to fire throughout the attack.  She was repaired and fought throughout the war.  Outboard of her is the capsized hull of the USS Oklahoma.  A total of 429 crew died from a combination of 5 torpedoes and the capsizing.  Some 32 of her crew were saved by efforts to cut open the hull.  Next up, we have the USS Tennessee (inboard) and the USS West Virginia.  The Tennessee took two bombs which didn't completely detonate, she stayed afloat, and sailed 10 days later to the mainland for repairs.  She served the rest of the war and survived a kamakazi attack during the operation to take Okinawa.  The West Virginia took 7 torpedoes and 2 bombs.  She sank in 40 feet of water.

The German logistic supply train was stretched so thin that they had to adapt to whatever was available. America simply didn't need to, or want to bother with the hassle. Keep in mind if you're using enemy equipment, you have to use their replacement parts as well. Now for a bunch of T-34s, where tens of thousands were produced, sure why not? Not the case for a couple over engineered King Tigers. Plus since by late 1944, the allies had air superiority, the risk of getting strafed your own plane would be a problem."

In November 1940, he went on active duty.  In April 1941, President Roosevelt sent his son on a secret, world-circling diplomatic mission to assure numerous governments that the United States would soon be in the war. James met, among others, Chiang Kai-shek, King Farouk of Egypt, and King George of Greece. During this trip, James came under German air attack in both Crete and in Iraq.

Troops of the 23rd Tank Battalion of the US 12th Armored Division led by Lieutenant John C. ""Jack"" Lee, Jr., anti-Nazi German Army soldiers, and imprisoned French VIPs defended the castle against a small force from the 17th Waffen-SS Panzer Grenadier Division. The French prisoners included former prime ministers, generals, and a tennis star. It may have been the only battle in the war in which Americans and Germans fought as allies. Popular accounts of the battle have called it the ""strangest"" battle of World War II.

So if the driver is killed the other crew members jump out and abandon the tank which might otherwise be in perfect condition.  But it's more common to capture a tank that had a mechanical failure and couldn't be repaired in time before the enemy arrived. Or a tank that drove into a ditch and needs heavy equipment to be pulled out.  See http://beutepanzer.ru/Beutepanzer/main.htm for a list of tanks and photos the German Army captured.  When conquering territory you sometimes capture repair shops full of tanks, you capture supply trains full of tanks."

By the end of the siege on 4 July the city of Sevastopol lay in ruins, and 30,000 tons of artillery ammunition had been fired.

wwiipics,2uthwd,onesafesource,2,Thu Feb 5 14:34:14 2015 UTC,the whole unit could be disassembled onto 5 trains. Together with 3 or 4 construction trains it could move on all existing railways. When arriving at the fire position 3 parallel tracks were built to assemble the gun (the gun needs 2 and one for the construction trains). After that 2 parallel firing tracks were built. These were curved and 900 meters long so the firing angle could be adjusted by moving back and forth on the firing tracks.  The 5 trains not only carried the whole gun but also all tracks and workers necessary to built the construction and firing tracks.  If possible 1 extra track was built on each side of the 3 construction tracks to move a portal crane on it. This way the whole assembly could be done in only 56 hours.

There are many possible explanations (environmental, dietary, even social pressures and beef hormones have been blamed) but generally girls develop earlier now compared to when this picture were taken, meaning this girl would look younger than we normally picture it in our minds today.

However, even in the higher echelons of the SS they realised, despite intense indoctrination, killing and executing people is a tough task. This is an execution of Partisans, or those they perceived as Partisans, so I'm sure they would hold less empathy. Albeit, by having the firing squads outnumber the victims, it lessens the impact on the individual soldier. In such a huge barrage of gunfire it is hard to differentiate between the bullets. No one is entirely sure who killed who. It leaves it open to a sort of moral ambiguity I suppose."
wwiipics,2uhetz,fleadh12,1 point,Mon Feb 2 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"And in some cases soldiers in the firing squad where issued with a special set of rifles instead of using their own. To further diffuse responsibility some of those rifles where loaded with blanks (firing squad members didn't know which ones where blanks, only the fact that some of them where blanks). I remember from a research published some 10 years ago that about half of firing squad members usually miss on purpose, so using 18 men to kill 6 people is understandable."

wwiipics,2uhetz,Bolibomp,3,Mon Feb 2 10:49:58 2015 UTC,"I  think it has something to do with the psychological effects on the members of the firing squad. A member of the firing squad doesn't know whether it's his bullet that has killed the victim or the bullet of the man standig next to him. So they feel less quilty, but I don't think the Germans thought of this aswell when they disided to outnummer their victims."

It is stated well here on Wikipedia:   A group of teenagers in San Rafael, California, calling themselves the Waldos because ""their chosen hang-out spot was a wall outside the school"", used the term in connection with a fall 1971 plan to search for an abandoned cannabis crop that they had learned about. The Waldos designated the Louis Pasteur statue on the grounds of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 p.m. as their meeting time. The Waldos referred to this plan with the phrase ""4:20 Louis"". Multiple failed attempts to find the crop eventually shortened their phrase to simply ""4:20"", which ultimately evolved into a codeword that the teens used to mean marijuana-smoking in general."

wwiipics,2t9sls,Crack_is_whack140,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"He would have to be in training then?  The year could still be right.  Here is what one person says: ""There is a published photo of the carry handle in use by a US Marine on Page 180 of Rock In A Hard Place by James Ballou. The caption reads: ""A BAR in action on Okinawa, near Shuri Castle."" This is the one and only photo that is known of in the BAR collectors circle and has been published in support of the Carry Handle being used during WWII. To my knowledge as of the time of this writing, there are no other known photographs of the Carry Handle purportedly from WWII published.  I believe this photo may have a correct caption but has been attributed incorrectly as a WWII photo. I assert that this is not of a Marine in WWII but rather is of an Army BAR Gunner during the 1950's on Okinawa, near Shuri Castle. Okinawa was used as a training base extensively post WWII, with exercises being carried out on many of the battlefields of 1945.   The gunner is wearing a M45 pack, which did not see any appreciable use during WW2 by the Marine Corps. The Marines continued to use the USMC pattern 41 haversack through the 1950's in many instances - not fully transitioning to different patterns till the 1960's. Some M44/M45 packs were used on Okinawa, but only by US Army units and not Marines. The BAR is equipped with the canvas sling, which shows up first in the 1945 ORD8 SNL A-4 as part number D44058. The combination of M45 pack, Carry Handle, Canvas Sling and Army can easily draw the conclusion that this photo actualy being from 1950's training conducted on Okinawa. The caption may be right as it is stated in the book - simply having the date left off and the incorrect assumption made that it was WWII."""

wwiipics,2ssp5r,KazCarpent,2,Sun Jan 18 03:08:13 2015 UTC,The nearest tank appears to have rubber pads on the tracks to allow it to travel on roads without tearing up the surface.
wwiipics,2ssp5r,ridger5,1 point,Sun Jan 18 07:21:53 2015 UTC,The main reason for the rubber pads is to extent the life span of the track as such. Especially when travelling on paved roads.
wwiipics,2ssp5r,Swazi666,1 point,Sun Jan 18 10:00:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, I thought it was the other way around, to protect the road surface from being chewed up."
wwiipics,2ssp5r,ridger5,1 point,Sun Jan 18 18:39:47 2015 UTC,"That plays a role, too. But the enormous wear on the tracks is the main reason behind this construction. Also the connecting rods of the track links are cushioned in rubber.   It has to do with the fact, that a track, on a tank travelling at e.g. 30 mph is moving at a speed of 0 mph at the portion which contacts the road and 60 mph on the top part travelling over the return rollers. In the moment a track link touches the ground it is decelerated from 60 mph to 0 mph in a split second only to be accelerated to 60 mph a second later a.s.o. These are enormous forces on the material. And the development of rubber cushioned track links was a way to deal with it (Plus: it also is nicer to the road).  Afterthought: the other tanks in the picture also have rubber pads. Just a different type with an even fancier V-shaped profile. They might be newer versions (I am no Sherman expert though)"

I would guess the reason for using a Storch over an ME109 would be the lower operating cost, as well as its ability to take off and land in very short distances from unprepared ground. The visibility from the cockpit is also much better, and they could also be modified for use as medical transport. :)"

IIRC the Chauchat, another light machine gun, was also used by France during the war.  Both were pretty unreliable, though, as they were both too delicate to be of any use. The Madsen was nicknamed the ""Virgin Madsen"" during the WWII Norwegian Campaign since it couldn't take the caliber for long without jamming, and the Chauchat was poorly made and got dirtied up frequently. By 1the end of the war they were being phased out in favor of better designs.  The concept was pretty sophisticated for the late 1800s, but by WWI and especially WWII they had been well surpassed at a squad level by better designs like the 1918 BAR and MG34."

And the hat may not even be an actual SS or Wehrmacht item, rather something modern with a patch on it. Maybe the boots are legit, but I don't know, they look new. So I don't think we can call it an SS uniform, because it's not official at all.  And even if it was an SS uniform, he can wear it, no problem. I personally believe they had the most bad ass, fear-inspiring uniforms in the entire 20th century. It is a great design, unfortunately belonging to a terrible and vicious military group.

Approaching the target from the inland direction, this A-20 dropped its 250 lbs bombs and strafed gun positions. Hit by antiaircraft fire at low level, this A-20 crashed into the sea off Kokas, exploding on impact.  The other A-20s, involved in their own runs and evasive maneuvers were unaware of the fate of this aircraft, until the mission's photography was developed and printed.

The Wehrmacht threw a lot of resources into this battle, trying to defend a strip of land against the enemy who was suddenly in their own country.

The battles took place from 19 September to 16 December 1944, over barely 50 sq mi (130 km2), east of the Belgian–German border. The U.S. commanders' initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area to keep them from reinforcing the front lines further north in the Battle of Aachen, where the Allies were fighting a trench war between a network of fortified towns and villages connected with field fortifications, tank traps and minefields. A secondary objective may have been to outflank the front line. The Americans' initial objectives were to take Schmidt and clear Monschau. In a second phase the Allies wanted to advance to the Rur River as part of Operation Queen. Generalfeldmarshall Walter Model intended to bring the Allied thrust to a standstill. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking full advantage of the fortifications the Germans called the Westwall, better known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line. A few days later, the Battle of the Bulge began, leaving the battle of Hürtgen Forest largely forgotten.

Photo taken in Germany, May 4, 1945.  Because of chronic problems in finding the manpower to fulfill military and industrial tasks, the Soviet Government recruited some 7.75 million women, of whom 800,000 served in the military. Sniping was a precision tole, which many women soldiers performed with expertise. It is estimated that in 1943 there were more than 2000 female snipers in the Soviet armed forces. Female snipers have been credited with more than 12,000 confirmed kills.  The Soviet Union used women for sniping duties extensively, and to great effect, including Nina Alexeyevna Lobkovskaya and Ukrainian Lyudmila Pavlichenko (who killed over 300 enemy soldiers). The Soviets found that sniper duties fit women well, since good snipers are patient, careful, deliberate, can avoid hand-to-hand combat, and need higher levels of aerobic conditioning than other troops. Women were regarded as having the skills and nerves required for accurate marksmanship. Notwithstanding male skepticism, Major General Morozov, “the father of the sniper movement”, attributed superior female marksmanship to the fact that “a woman’s hand is more sensitive than is a man’s. Therefore when a woman is shooting, her index finger pulls the trigger more smoothly and purposefully”.  The most successful Soviet use of snipers during the second world war were during their defensive stages of the war (1941–1943), after which the advantage of defense shifted to the German side and German snipers became a real danger to the advancing Soviets. Soviet military doctrine used snipers for providing long-distance suppressive fire and for eliminating targets of opportunity, especially leaders, because during World War II, Soviet military leaders and combat theorists (Vassili Zaitsev contributed greatly to Soviet sniper doctrine, although he was officially neither of these) found that military organisations have difficulty replacing experienced non-commissioned officers and field officers during times of war. They also found that the more expensive and less rugged sniper rifles could match the cost-effectiveness of a cheaper assault rifle given good personnel selection, training, and adherence to doctrine."

wwiipics,2qh83w,Quarterwit_85,6,Fri Dec 26 23:58:51 2014 UTC,"I think the Soviet claims are rubbish, highly inflated for propaganda purposes during the war and have done nothing but gain traction since.  There's very little account in German sources of Soviet sniper activity. Whether they be first hand accounts of combat or after action reports.  Footage of a female sniper is available on YouTube somewhere shows her firing with a terrible, terrible flinch (eyes closed, jerking the trigger etc) - it's doubtful she could hit anything at all, let alone under combat conditions.  Captain W. C. Shore who wrote 'with British snipers to the Third Reich' set up a few friendly target shooting matches with some Russian snipers immediately after the cessation of hostilities. They were, without exception, dreadful shots.  Meh, all bullshit and bluster in my opinion."
wwiipics,2qh83w,Quarterwit_85,2,Sat Dec 27 04:36:48 2014 UTC,"The books ""Enemy at the Gates"" and ""Stalingrad"" document much sniper activity there."
wwiipics,2qh83w,ka6emusha,2,Sat Dec 27 04:45:14 2014 UTC,"The book 'Enemy at the Gates' was a great read but the duel that is depicted in the book didn't actually occur. There's no historical basis outside of Vasili's account that confirms it taking place. He refused, later in life, to confirm or deny whether or not it happened. The narrative is also remarkably similar to that surrounding the Australian sniper Billy Sing who fought in Gallipoli. It's a historical trope.  'Stalingrad' is also an excellent read. Much better in my opinion. He talks often about sniper action which I've no doubt took place but cannot believe it was as effective as the Soviet forces kill count said.   Every reliable source states that Soviet Snipers were awful, and looking back on the way they operated and footage we have of them actually in action it's highly doubtful they were anywhere near as effective as what they claim. The same goes for their tank units, pilots etc."

First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the Berthier and Lebel series of service rifles, it saw service long past the World War II period. It was manufactured by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Because production was initiated late in 1937, not enough MAS-36 rifles were available to arm French infantry when the war broke out in September 1939. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the First Indochina War, the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.

The front is a corridor between burnt out rooms; it is the thin ceiling between two floors. Help comes from neighboring houses by fire escapes and chimneys. There is a ceaseless struggle from noon to night. From story to story, faces black with sweat, we bombard each other with grenades in the middle of explosions, clouds of dust and smoke, heaps of mortar, floods of blood, fragments of furniture and human beings. Ask any soldier what half an hour of hand-to-hand struggle means in such a fight. And at Stalingrad, it has been eighty days and eighty nights of hand-to-hand struggle. The street is no longer measured by meters but by corpses. Stalingrad is no longer a town. By day it is an enormous cloud of burning, blinding smoke; it is a vast furnance lit by the reflection of the flames.

wwiipics,2pmb4z,dirtysubie,5,Thu Dec 18 01:54:56 2014 UTC,Each had slightly different reasons for joining. The British Free corps was initially made up of British fascists but also included prisoners who were courted to the Nazi ideals as well as those who joined to get more food and spy on those that joined.  The Indians saw that Germany was the greatest threat to the UK and anything that could them would help India gain independence. The Japanese also had a similar unit. They saw that it was better to fight against Britain then for them.  Units recruited in the USSR were similar. The Nazis had stirred up a lot of nationalism and many groups believed there ethnicgroup/relgion would be better of with Germany in charge.  The Balkans were a whole different story. The Nazis had created an independent Croatia. And they began forced removal and mass killing of non Croats. The ethnic units were formed to try and defend their own ethnic communities. They rarely operated far from their own area.  SS units from Western European countries tended to be made up of people in with Nazi ideals in occupied countries.

wwiipics,2pmb4z,Emmo2gee,2,Thu Dec 18 20:38:46 2014 UTC,I think your right there is a lot of information on a six year war so large parts are go to be missed (the war in Asia was briefly covered but not much detail). It may be covered better I places like Norway that were under occupation and had quite a bit of collusion. But you have to put it into context that the number of volunteers was still low.

It took two months to clear out an area only a couple thousand meters long thereafter. The way the 81st Infantry Division finally managed to clear it is pretty remarkable. Because the coral was too hard to entrench into, they would haul sandbags all the way up from the beach and would literally use a pole to push the sandbags in front of them to advance, inch by inch.

wwiipics,2ot42x,KazCarpent,8,Tue Dec 9 23:46:08 2014 UTC,Looks like they chopped up a couple aircraft to get enough for one? Or is that a different plane to the right of the Jug?
wwiipics,2ot42x,ridger5,4,Wed Dec 10 00:00:17 2014 UTC,The one next to the P-47 is a P-51 (wings and fuselage disassembled). The aircraft in the background near the wall is a Mosquito.

So after the Blitzkrieg war with western Europe, during which they conquered France, Belgium, Luxembourg and The Netherlands, and well before Operation Barbarossa.  So spirits, at the time, couldn't have been any higher. They were, after all, promoting 12 Generals to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall, a rank that was banned since WWI, which was done so to boost the already insanely high prestige of the Wehrmacht.   EDIT: Technically Generalfeldmarschall, as Wikibot points out."
wwiipics,2oigpm,Noatak_Kenway,1 point,Sun Dec 7 06:18:42 2014 UTC,"1940 Field Marshal Ceremony:       The 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony refers to promotion ceremony held at the Kroll Opera House in Berlin in which Adolf Hitler promoted twelve generals to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall (""general field marshal"") on 19 July 1940. It was the first occasion in World War II that Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements.  The prestigious rank of field marshal had been banned after the First World War. As part of the Nazi expansion of the military, the rank was revived. Hitler promoted twelve selected generals to field marshal during the ceremony in Berlin for their role in the swift victory over France and the Low Countries and to raise morale. The ceremony highlighted the power and prestige of the Wehrmacht; France was considered to have a the strongest army in Europe, yet had been humiliatingly defeated in just six weeks.  The ceremony was the first time Hitler appointed field marshals due to military achievements and was celebrated like no other promotion ceremony of the war. Even though Erich von Manstein was most directly responsible for the victory he was not promoted to field marshal, something that sparked speculation within the military.

Indeed, the size and enormous amount of maintenance and effort required to move the gun (It required its own special railway tracks to move and the turret couldn't rotate) made it so it was only used in the siege of Sevastopol. It was destroyed by its own crew in 1945 to avoid capture by the Soviets. It is a prime example of how WWI technology and tactics (the railway gun and using heavy artillery to try and tip the scales in a prolonged stalemate) were quickly deemed useless because of the rapid mobilization of warfare."

While the Gustav may be an extreme example, I would agree by saying that perhaps if Nazi Germany focused on making more average or slightly above average weapons instead of diverting massive amounts of resources and effort to creating technology years ahead of its time they could have been more successful. I think the focus on making advanced and powerful machines and weapons gave the Germans the early edge over their opponents but it aught up with them especially after the Soviet Union became actively involved with their vastly superior numbers against the Germans."

The tank was a license built American copy of the French Renault FT-17,    Lots more interesting details at the source I referenced.  edit I can't resist quoting this gem:   In deer season, poachers thrived.

When German dictator Adolf Hitler received word that Hungary's Regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy, was secretly negotiating his country's surrender to the advancing Red Army, he sent commando leader Waffen-SS Lieutenant-Colonel Otto Skorzeny and former Brandenburger Adrian von Fölkersam to Hungary. Hitler feared that Hungary's surrender would expose his southern flank, where the Kingdom of Romania had just joined with the Soviets and cut off a million German troops still fighting the Soviet advance in the Balkan peninsula. The operation came on the heels of Operation Margarethe in March 1944, which was occupation of Hungary by German forces, which Hitler had hoped would secure Hungary's place in the Axis powers.

RTC (after some internet looking) might stand for ""Regional/Regimental/Replacement Training Center/Camp"" (hopefully it makes sense to you).   The 227 is his Battalion, which was a Field Artillery battalion within the 29th Infantry of the US Army. The D probably means Company D, which is just a smaller division of a battalion or regiment.   I can't find anything about what the 227th actually did. The 29th Infantry was involved in the D-Day landings but nothing about the 227th is ever mentioned in the information I found.  Field Artillery is, in basic terms, cannons and mortar fire. If the information I found about all of this was correct your grandfather was most likely not a ""front lines"" soldier.

After 67 years of common life with my grandma, he passed away 2 weeks ago. He was 90.  He was a truly incredible man, an awesome grandfather and he will be remembered fondly in my family and beyond.  RIP grandfather"

I think there are plenty reasons why you wanna cover up a body. Even from a basic sanitation stand point. With the heat on the island I'd imagine the smell getting unbearable at times. This is taken near the beachheads where there were relatively few defenders. So there should be some time to do a quick cover up like in the photo.  Most of the American landing casualty came from the cannon fires on Mt. Suribachi.

Common nicknames are *Pe-Pe-Sha from its three-letter prefix and Papasha (Russian: папаша), meaning daddy.  The PPSh was a magazine-fed selective fire submachine gun using an open-bolt, blowback action. Made largely of stamped steel, it could be loaded with either a box or drum magazine, and fired the 7.62×25mm Tokarev pistol round.  The PPSh saw extensive combat use during World War II and the Korean War. It was one of the major infantry weapons of the Soviet armed forces during World War II. Around 6 million PPSh-41s were manufactured. In the form of the Chinese Type 50 (a licensed copy), it was still being used by Vietnamese Viet Cong as late as 1970. According to the 2002 edition of The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II the PPSh was still in use with irregular military forces.

The CIB and its non-combat contemporary, the Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB) were simultaneously created during World War II to enhance the morale and prestige of service in the infantry. Specifically, it recognizes the inherent sacrifices of all infantrymen, and that, in comparison to all other military occupational specialties, infantrymen face the greatest risk of being wounded or killed in action.

wwiipics,2k20kt,wriddell,2,Thu Oct 23 13:16:51 2014 UTC,"Yes, I myself have pondered the camouflaged US Army uniform before.  My general M.O. is to label US Infantry men wearing camo in the Pacific as Marines. It's just more likely that's the case. I've found marines also appear more ""disheveled"", and their uniforms are simpler and less form fitting. They do not concern themselves with appearance, just action.   Apparently the US Army had a few camo patterns they used during the second world war. However, these designs were short-lived and taken out of circulation when friendly-fire incidents reared their nasty heads (as you stated).   While photos of US Army personnel wearing camo are rare, they do exist:  Here members of the US 2nd Infantry Armored Division are seen in their camo uniforms in Normandy  and here is another photo of a US Army soldier in camo somewhere in the ETO.  Here are a few more photos of camo being used by the US Army in Europe:  1   2  3  I've read that most of the ""prototype"" camouflage uniforms were given to the 2nd Armored Infantry Division, with some members of the 30th and 2nd IDs getting some as well.

wwiipics,2is9a7,unbalanced_kitten,4,Fri Oct 10 09:15:41 2014 UTC,"As I understand things, it was fairly common for officers to carry carbines (such as the Thompson, or the M1 carbine) rather than a full-length rifle, for reasons of mobility and the like....less weight makes it easier to be in several places at once when commanding a platoon, or a company of men who require nimble physical leadership."

wwiipics,2is9a7,AgaveNeomexicana,2,Fri Oct 10 16:54:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that was somewhat mist-stated. My understanding (I'm not a professional historian) is that full-length rifles such as the M-1 or Springfield were less-wieldy that the shorter carbines, which is why they were issued to officers and some others (such as mortar squads, and artillerymen), as these combat roles relied less on direct rifle combat and more on command roles, and indirect weapon combat respectively.   Maybe theres someone who knows more about this than I who can clarify these policies/guidelines in a more verbose manner."

I won't speak out of place here, my focus is on 8th Air Force operations (Veteran Grandpa) and the German forces in the Normandy campaign.  I don't know enough about this to make any claims but I can't imagine the hate and intensity flying around after the Germans left. I would imagine a few were punished very severely for questionable ""infractions"" brought on by 4 years of occupation and a recently liberated mob mentality. Again, I'm not claiming to know what this individual deserved or what he didn't deserve. I suppose my point, if any, is that throughout history we see brutal reprisals against collaborators that are sometimes unjustified. Hope I'm not stepping on any toes here, just a thought."
wwiipics,2im7uy,Deepseat,2,Wed Oct 8 02:00:36 2014 UTC,"When you live under brutal military occupation, you get to know who is collaborating and who isn't.  It isn't hard to tell.  Some are quite overt about it.  Others operate very deeply under the radar and get away with it, but many give themselves away.  The rewards for collaborating - even small ones - get noticed by friends, neighbors, relatives, and co-workers.  Sure, there are false accusations made - but even France had a well-functioning court system after the occupation by the Nazis.  Did any innocents die?  Probably a few.  Did other, guilty, people get away with it?  Probably a few.  I'd bet my mortgage that the vast majority of those punished for collaborating with the Nazis were quite guilty of the crimes for which they were punished.  Not all were executed.  Remember that the Nazis weren't the only ones with spies.  The French Underground used even children to keep tabs on the comings and goings of people at the German offices all over France.  Little old ladies would watch from behind the curtains in second- and third-story windows.  On the night before D-Day, the Maquis went into action against the German military forces and kept up their attacks for weeks to come.  The Resistance in the cities - especially in Paris - eliminated those who they believed to be a particular danger to the Resistance or of particularly valuable help to the Germans.  Most of the rest received trials, but not all.  I learned high school French from a man who was a member of the Maquis.  He had been captured by the Nazis and sent to a camp where they tattooed his forearm.  Then he and a couple of friends escaped one night and he re-joined the Resistance in the countryside.  The man was a serious badass.  I learned much more than French from him."

It's hard, black grit of varying sizes - and none of it is small enough to call ""sand"" by our normal definition.  The edges are sharp.  You sink into it when it isn't packed together by the ocean water.  It gets into everything - like your weapons, food, clothes, boots, and hair.  It is one of the most annoying substances I've ever encountered.  SOURCE: I've never been to the island itself, but I have a small container of Iwo Jima ""beach sand"" sitting on my computer desk.

He taught me to ride a bike, helped me with my English homework, put up with my naive political and economical theorising over the dinner table and was the voice of reason in my many disputes with my mother.  Sonny was a keen cricketer, a smoker of roll-ups, a proud Conservative and a lover of Bournville chocolate and tea. He was also a member of the British Eighth Army - a Desert Rat - involved (as far as I can ascertain) in both battles of El Alamein in 1942. I remember that he always wore at least four layers of clothing (vest, shirt, jumper and suit jacket as a minimum) even in mid-summer; he used to say that after his time in the desert, he never felt warm again in England. He never married: he had one true love and somehow, he lost her and never sought another. Sonny worked as an auctioneer's assistant and school caretaker after the war and lived with his sister in a rented flat in Thornton Heath, South London, until his death in 1990.  Sonny was also an amateur photographer. These photos from Libya were kept in a small album and are only 1"" x 2"" in size.

He had an allotment next to Sonny's. Soon after joining the LEB, Dad dropped a cooker on his foot and was off work for some time. Sonny got worried when Dad didn't visit his allotment, and went to check on him.  My parents and Sonny got on famously from that point. He used to come to our house every evening around 6:00pm for dinner, and then stayed until bed-time. He basically lived with us but slept at his flat. He took a great interest in my upbringing and was as much of a father to me as my Dad."
wwiipics,2ie5xz,WiseCynic,2,Mon Oct 6 17:22:40 2014 UTC,"Due to the language difference between us, I'm going to ask for clarification on a couple of words - because I find the story interesting and want to understand it well.  Does ""de-mobbed"" mean discharged from military service?  Is an ""allotment"" the same as an American ""apartment"" or an English ""flat"" - or is it a parcel of land?  This ""cooker"" - how would you describe it to an American?  I actually enjoy learning these words.  I watch a TV program called ""QI"", and pick up a few things here and there.  I Google Mapped Thornton Heath.  Seems like a decent place, certainly.  The houses are (by American standards) smaller and very tightly packed together, but they all looked to be constructed of brick and have been nicely maintained.  The style of the older homes - with the woodwork around the windows and doors - is attractive.  The stonework at the library entrance is impressive.  You grew up there?"
wwiipics,2ie5xz,professor__doom,2,Tue Oct 7 02:18:52 2014 UTC,"I am sorry - if I'd have thought about it, I would have realised my vocabulary could have been clearer! I hope the following clarifies things.   Does ""de-mobbed"" mean discharged from military service?   Yes.   Is an ""allotment"" the same as an American ""apartment"" or an English ""flat"" - or is it a parcel of land?   It is a small parcel of land, owned by the local council, and available for a low rent to residents. Historically used to grow vegetables and once very popular due to the small gardens of suburban homes. My father's number one hobby!   This ""cooker"" - how would you describe it to an American?   A range or stove. Generally containing a hob with 4 gas burners or electric rings, and one or two ovens set below the hob. Circa 4 feet high and 2-3 feet wide/deep.   I Google Mapped Thornton Heath.  Seems like a decent place, certainly. [...] You grew up there?   Yes, I did. Thornton Heath is about 8 miles south of London and is a typical commuter town. In the '60s, '70s and '80s it was quite well-to-to but, in recent years, it has become very run-down. It has a large immigrant/ethnic population and high levels of crime.  The homes are large 3-4 bed Victorian family houses (built early 1900s) with fair sized gardens but many have been converted into 2 or more apartments. It was a pretty little town that has lost its boundaries due to house building and has therefore merged with Croydon, Norbury, Streatham and Brixton to become nothing more than a run-down quarter of Greater London."
wwiipics,2ie5xz,Cho-choking,2,Tue Oct 7 07:44:02 2014 UTC,"So a cooker is a stove.  I couldn't figure out how a big pot would have caused such injuries.  Dropping a stove on your foot would do the trick, though!  Understanding ""allotment"" makes clear why your father only visited it - to tend it and collect the vegetables.  I thought it may have been a place to live.  Silly me.  Shame about Thornton Heath.  I blame landlords out to suck money from the place for such things happening to nice places.  They'll rent to anybody with money in their hands and, since they don't live there, don't give a damn what happens to the neighborhood.  Thanks for the clarifications.  Learning Brit English is fun.  If you ever have questions about the American version, feel free to get in touch.  Always happy to help out."
