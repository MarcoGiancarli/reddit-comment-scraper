Since then, you have made my mouth drop in awe on dozens of occasions with your ability to mix spectacle and thought provoking subject matter.  You made your stamp on blockbuster filmmaking with CIA Rises, and now every film you make seems to be a next-step toward some grander and greater experience. You've taken us into dreams and out to the furthest reaches of outer-space and beyond, so what else is there to cover? Fantasy? Horror? War?  I used to think it would be great to see you reign in your scope for your next outing: like an indie flick, but...I don't want to see that. I want to see you take your ambitions even further.  Chris, I want you to do a Bond movie. Everything you've done so far has shown me that you might be the only director remotely capable to handle the story and SCOPE that Bond 25 would need to be made. One more important thing, you can swing your weight around, and we all know it which will mean the budget would be...just great. The large-scale destruction in Dark Knight Rises. The mind-bending tricks in Inception. The battle of ideas in The Dark Knight and finally the awe-inspiring visuals of space and beyond in Interstellar show just how perfect you'd be to do this.  This would also be a calculated risk for you due to the incredibly dank subject matter and the sheer scope of visual effects. Could you stick with your brand of practical effects heavy film-making or would have have to concede to a more digital approach? How would you deal with the terrifying, monstrous exposition delivered by Q?  I don't want to see you reign it in Chris, I want to see you going bigger and bolder with every single film you make. Do Bond Chris. You know it would be fucking incredible.  If you don't want to do that however, could you please just do Jason Bourne? The main Jason Borune with Matt Damon not the new one or the rip-offs. I really can't be more specific about that Chris. Really can't.  Your's sincerely.  Some guy."

You haven't read Why Lift and therefore haven't the first fucking clue with which ethical/aesthetic criteria Snyder was dismissive of traditional workout conventions. You haven't read Paleo Me Plenty. You don't, for example, know another great regimen Snyder dismissed, or why. You aren't making an effort to truly digest or engage in an ongoing dialogue so much as corroding it. But perhaps you're over-rating Snyder as the greatest lifting director of all time. He's just ripped, therefore people think he lifts. Peter Jackson's bulking is just the same as Snyder's lazy 3x5 rep routine.  I could drop so much advanced fitness jargon on you, it would make your head spin, but I won't. Instead, I'll simply point out that you don't know what any of the different modes of dead lifts are, or how they seize upon muscle tissue regeneration. You've never read and don't know who people like Milo of Croton, Galen, or Frederic Delavier are- and those are just the biggies. You've read/seen next to no classic weight training, if any. Certainly not scholastically. You googled some shit about admiring physiques and copy/pasted something written in /r/fitness that you have no basis for understanding. You- yes the dumb, blind, sheltered little product of the exercise industry that you are, contribute to our world's and muscle tissue degradation. (You don't even know what that means because you don't know what good form is). You insult what you're ignorant about. And that's a really shitty thing to do. I suggest you take an honest personal inventory, and then try to make something better of yourself. Because right now, you're pretty fucking disgusting to read.

Just wanted to say, I've been a long time fan of yours ever since having my fragile brain pounded into submission by Memento. Since then, you have made my mouth drop in awe on dozens of occasions with your ability to mix spectacle and thought provoking subject matter.  You made your stamp on blockbuster filmmaking with The Dark Knight, and now every film you make seems to be a next-step toward some grander and greater experience. You've taken us into dreams and out to the furthest reaches of outer-space and beyond, so what else is there to cover? Fantasy? Horror? War?  I used to think it would be great to see you reign in your scope for your next outing: like an indie flick, but...I don't want to see that. I want to see you take your ambitions even further.  Chris, I want you to do the live-action adaptation of Akira. Everything you've done so far has shown me that you might be the only director remotely capable to handle the story and SCOPE that Akira would need to be made. One more important thing, you can swing your weight around, and we all know it which will mean the budget would be...just great. The large-scale destruction in Dark Knight Rises. The mind-bending tricks in Inception. The battle of ideas in The Dark Knight and finally the awe-inspiring visuals of space and beyond in Interstellar show just how perfect you'd be to do this.  This would also be a calculated risk for you due to the incredibly dark subject matter and the sheer scope of visual effects. Could you stick with your brand of practical effects heavy film-making or would have have to concede to a more digital approach? How would you deal with the terrifying, monstrous incarnations of Tetsuo's final form?  I don't want to see you reign it in Chris, I want to see you going bigger and bolder with every single film you make. Do Akira Chris. You know it would be fucking incredible.  If you don't want to do that however, could you please just do Metal Gear? The main Metal Gear from PS1 not the old ones or the ones in the Jungle. I really can't be more specific about that Chris. Really can't."

As part of his own quest for total world conquest, Marvel boss Feige likes to insist that superhero films aren‚Äôt so monotonously similar as some think but can incorporate other genres ‚Äî and this attempt at family ‚Äúrelatability‚Äù is part of that. It‚Äôs not about wacky suits and whizzy fights? No. ‚ÄúFor all of us at Marvel it‚Äôs always been about the characters and always making sure at the core of the film it is about being able to relate and connect to these amazing but flawed individuals,‚Äù says Feige. ‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt believe that the superhero film is a genre unto itself. We love taking sub-genres and putting them together and then adding the superhero elements into other genres of film.‚Äù We have been warned. And the amazing grosses scored by the films Feige has produced (Avengers, Thor, Iron Man, etc) mean that whatever he says is going to happen.  Scott meets Hank when he‚Äôs inveigled into burgling his mansion, expecting to find a fortune but instead discovering, in his innermost sanctum, the Ant-Man suit. For actually he‚Äôs been set up by wily old Hank, who used to save the world himself in the suit but now, needing a younger man to take his place, has selected Scott for mentoring. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late for me ‚Äî it‚Äôs your chance to earn that look in your daughter‚Äôs eye, to become the hero she thinks you are. I need you to be the Ant-Man,‚Äù he tells him, crashingly. Relate, relate."

These highly polished genre films have the genre's premise at the forefront (politics, espionage, Shakespearean tragedy, heist) and the superheroes in the background.  That's why Ant-Man only has two heists in it. That's why the espionage in The Winter Soldier is about Cap hiding a USB stick in a vending machine.  That's why the third act of these films are never about Hollywood spectacles and explosions, and never about shoving the minor superhero element in excess, but instead ends with the film pushing their specific genres further."

moviescirclejerk,3dqejb,BuckNekkid18,0,Sat Jul 18 17:08:52 2015 UTC,Because they're not based around a fictional scientific concept. Time travel and AI are science fiction. Super heroes and monsters are fantasy whether they're in space or in Middle Earth. Space and spaceships doesn't presume science fiction.
moviescirclejerk,3dqejb,sentripetal,2,Sat Jul 18 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"If they use fictional science to become superheroes then isn't that sci-fi? Like Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, etc all supposedly get their power from science."
moviescirclejerk,3dqejb,BLOODY_ANAL_VOMIT,2,Sat Jul 18 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's a chicken and the egg thing honestly. If the creator of whatever comes up with: ""Hey, what if this technology or reality happened?"" that sounds like science fiction. If instead it's: ""Hey, I got a guy with really cool super powers and/or a magical suit."" That sounds more like fantasy. The fact that they gave ""scientific"" explanations about their origins (fuggit...he got got bit by a radioactive spider) as some sort of cop-out explanation doesn't throw it into the sci-fi realm."
moviescirclejerk,3dqejb,sentripetal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"I mean at that point it's just being pedantic with the genres. I kind of hate genres in general for things like music and movies, because things don't necesarily have to 'fit' in a genre. It really just depends on how you define them. If you define fantasy as ""anything that contains something fantastic that isn't explained through science"" then you wrap up a lot of these movies.    Even Interstellar where the guy escapes a black hole is completely impossible. Does that render the entire movie fantasy because something happened that is literally impossible?  Superheroes probably fall more under science-fantasy, because they tend to back up unrealistic things with 'science.' But if we throw all the sci-fi movies with ridiculous parts into fantasy then there'll be almost nothing left, which defeats the purpose of classifying by genre."
moviescirclejerk,3dqejb,BLOODY_ANAL_VOMIT,5,Sat Jul 18 21:43:21 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure a suit that shrinks whoever is wearing it thanks to a serum is based around a fictional scientific concept...

moviescirclejerk,3dqejb,BLOODY_ANAL_VOMIT,0,Sat Jul 18 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"I get that's how they're explaining how they came to be, but it's mostly retroactive writing due to the fact that everyone now points out it doesn't make sense for all these characters to exist in the same universe. I jokingly gave a one answer reply to OP about ""midichlorions:"" a very half-ass attempt to explain something magical like the force with something scientific. Attempting to be sci-fi and being sci-fi are two different things.   And again, a place setting like space with spaceships don't count if there really isn't any scientific explanation behind why they're there in the first place. It's just as fantastic as Lord of the Rings with a different setting...not to mention the all powerful infinity stones that turns anyone touching it into essentially a god (kinda sounds like the ring of power to me). Science fiction doesn't have to be true or even possible, but it should be grounded in reality. Super powered rocks and inexplicable space travel sounds more like fantasy to me."

He spent two hours every morning smashing his palms against fortified wine glasses and smearing (real) blood over Kerry Washington's face (not in the movie, flown in on retainer). During the climax, he smashed not his hand, not even his arm, but his entire body on glass shards and kept. On. Fucking. Acting. On the final day, he bought the cast and crew antique wine glasses from the Victorian era, and we smashed our palms down on them in a show of solidarity.

It's like the fanboys are so hung up on design and those two bad X-Men movies from like 6 years ago and immediately decide from a character design that the new movie will suck, despite the previous movies being much better than average superhero movies.

It just shows how far 3D animation and computer technology has come, and how we spent all these years developing algorithms and processors to fully render Leonardo DiCaprio's huge, lardy lumps complete with a photo-realistic brownish-yellow asshole in between those luscious cheeks. 3D technology has allowed humans to realistically jiggle big fat yellow fart-knockers right in the theater with the 3D glasses. I saw this trailer in the theater and I just couldn't help but cry at the hyper-realistic butt-holes which clenched and pulsate right in your face. I've been buying revenant toys nonstop since that changing moment of my life. I am now a revenantist, with over 2000 reposted revenant pictures across each of my social media accounts and 500 revenant toys under my (literal) belt. I just can't get enough at those fat muffintops bulging out those tight overalls before ballooning out as the revenant's pants drop while they say ""Bottom!"", violently rumbling as they unleash torrents of rapid-fire fart flashes, coated so much with shit-particles it actually colors the otherwise invisible gas clouds. And my favorite is when they spread their cheeks wide open and you can see all the hairs sticking out their anus (look at their heads for an idea).

moviescirclejerk,3dmspk,ZotohZhaan,9,Fri Jul 17 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, man, that tracking shot is intense. This is movie looks intense as all hell and very gritty. And the cinematography by Lubezki? Divine, as usual. Now, I think this movie is a strong contender for multiple Oscars. Best cinematography, best direction, best supporting role for Hardy... but no Oscar for Leo, lol! Like, I like Leo as an actor. He undeniably puts everything he's got into every one of his roles. But part of me can't help but think that the movie would be better with a different lead. For example, Tom Hardy would be a good pick. He has proven that he is a big guy who can play a convincing lead role. Or Henry Cavill, THE Man of Steel. Such beautiful actors, such beautiful men. No homo of course, lol. But yeah, about Leo. Not a bad actor, just not the best. He's actually a tad overrated I think. But who knows? He could surprise us with a truly great performance and outshine Hardy, but I doubt it. It's all about that Australian charm and those beautiful, kissable lips of his. Do I need to reiterate that I'm not a gay? Lol. So, back to the movie. I think it will be praised by critics, but largely ignored by the public, until Oscar season rolls around and it becomes a smash hit on Blu-ray and VOD, like Whiplash and Birdman before it. And we all know that those two ARE severely underrated. Later this year, people will be going gaga over Tarantino and Abrams, but I promise that in 2-3 years, the motion picture people will remember most from the year 2015 will be The Reverment. People will be talking about Hardy's performance, and how fuckable he looks with long hair and dirt covering his perfect body. Not that I would be the one to talk about that stuff, haha, because I'm into women, like, big time. I wouldn't suck a cock under any circumstance, even Hardy's. Well, maybe if he wined and dined me and got me a little tipsy, I guess I COULD theoretically suck his cock. It's probably rather big, like him. But I would be thinking about the many women I've laid with while doing so, so still not homo, LOL!"

moviescirclejerk,3dn0gl,master_of_deception,15,Fri Jul 17 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"What other consequences can there be? You need to understand that grittiness is dark, and darkness requires the absence of light - also known as ""grit"". With this in mind it's important to note cinematography. If you don't have cinematography then you might as well just take all of your grit and strip the darkness out of it because that's what you're left with.   Conversely, from a film studies perspective, the grit with which you darken your darkness requires ample long take. Long Take is a cinephile term meaning ""quality"". It substantiates your darkness enough that affords for your grit to be lessened if necessary, but it's always advisable to amplify your grit with practical effects as a fail-safe.  I know that a lot of this will probably go over people's heads, and I've tried to make it as understandable as possible for the laymen because I was once one of you. But as a student of film studies I've studied film for a while now so it's difficult for me to ""dumb it down"", so to speak. If you have trouble understanding don't feel bad, all is not lost. Just keep plugging away at your film studies and one day, with enough hard work, you'll just get it. You'll know you're there when you can watch 12 Angry Men, count the men within it, and say ""This is it. There are a dozen men here. And they are noticeably agitated.""  I hope this helps."

The problem with death in a big franchise is that it has a great impact on future instalments, and this impact is not always a positive one. Take The Wrath of Khan as an example. Spock dies, and it's really sad, and the whole event becomes iconic. Fast forward to The Search for Spock, and they bring him back to life. They seem to make a significant change, but then they revert back to the previous status quo. In comparison, Star Trek Into Darkness combined these two events together, but not in a wise way. They introduced an element to the plot that could circumvent death, so in the end, all the stakes have been flattened, because we will always have Khan's Magical Blood to think about."

moviescirclejerk,3dl15t,IFuckingLoveSpoons,5,Fri Jul 17 03:15:50 2015 UTC,"To prepare for Seven Samurai, you'll need to watch the following films to understand the overarching story and its characters:  Sanshiro Sugata - The very first film in the KCU, it explores the story of the titular Sanshiro, an initially headstrong and stubborn individual in charge of his father's company, who learns true selflessness through the art of judo. It's absolutely necessary to understand the progression of future films, given Sugata is arguably the main protagonist of the series.  Drunken Angel - Doctor Sanada becomes an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to create a super soldier program via gamma radiation. On the run, he attempts to cure himself of the radiation before he is captured by the general in charge of the military initiative, but his worst fears are realized when power-hungry soldier Matsunaga undergoes a similar procedure. Not overly necessary given this is Sanada's only solo film to date, but the film serves as an introduction to his character, as he plays a more important role as the series increases in magnitude. Takashi Shimura, who portrayed Doctor Sanada in this entry in the KCU, will be replaced by Seiji Miyaguchi in Seven Samurai.  Sanshiro Sugata Part II -  The sequel to the original Sanshiro film, this story chronicles Sanshiro's attempts to prevent his fighting skills from being utilised by the government and juggling his new found success. Meanwhile, a rogue American soldier has mastered the same judo style as Sugata, and aims to pursue a vendetta against the Sugata family for past grievances, working with Sugata's business rival to undermine him. Underwhelming when compared to the first film, but it establishes the character of Sayo Murai, the ""Black Widow"".  Stray Dog - A classic riff on the fish out of water tale. The film tells the story of Murakami, the heir to the Imperial Throne of Japan, who is exiled from his homeland by his father to America. While there, he forms a relationship with Harumi Namiki, a scientist. However, Murakami must stop his adopted brother Yusa, who intends to become the new Emperor of Tokyo. Although the writing is a little weaker in this outing, the story's main characters are of pivotal importance to the story in Seven Samurai.  No Regrets for Our Youth - A period piece set in 1933, the story explores the altruistic and pacifistic character of Ryukichi Noge, a sickly man from Kyoto who is transformed into a super soldier to aid in the war effort. Ryukichi must stop the Red Eagle, Franklin D. Roosevelt's ruthless head of weaponry and the leader of an organization that intends to use an artifact called the ""Tesseract"" as an energy-source for world domination. The end of this film directly ties into the start of Seven Samurai.   I hope this serves as a proper introduction to the Kurosawa Cinematic Universe for you."

We normally did that with /r/movies but because Interstellar was small, we held more power as invaders. They asked us to stop and the mods said stop and we did for the most part.  I, personally, had an incident with an individual there. It resulted in shadow + IP banning for me. I won't go into that, but basically, I commented jokingly on something, and he proceeded to follow me around and post 'this guy is a troll' under anything I wrote, in or out of Interstellar. I returned the favour athousandfold, and he got me banned (and he also deleted all his comments, so it was me looking the fool). He got his own just desserts in due time... All of that was an isolated incident, ultimately separate from /r/Interstellar.   I think what annoyed that sub was everyone in /r/MCJ linking to the threads. Every single post there had 'this has been linked by moviescirclejerk'. Even without going there, that irritated them (which was fair enough). So we implemented the rule 'no direct links, make a text post and link in the comments'. That fixed it, more or less (by then the jerk had died anyway).

moviescirclejerk,3dklza,gandalfonacid,2,Fri Jul 17 05:10:26 2015 UTC,"I recently graduated and wrote my thesis paper on cult films. My actual paper, however, wasn't up to my personal par because I was typing it in a drugged stupor from a hospital bed in order to graduate on time, so I figured I'd try and not waste months of research and put my knowledge to good use! Let me know if you like this, because I have 8000 more things to say (ex: the history of cult, what defines ""cult status"", cult vs. cool, the new rules of cult in the internet age, why I hate Quentin Tarantino, etc.), or I could talk about specific films, too.   EDGY"
moviescirclejerk,3dklza,CollumMcJingleballs,3,Fri Jul 17 07:05:55 2015 UTC,"This guy is mistaking ""a movie with a fanbase"" with ""cult movie"". By his logic Star Wars belongs on his list. A cult movie would be something that has a massive resurgence in popularity in later on that has everything to do with the fans and nothing to do with the studios. Or a movie that is only lasting because it had a small dedicated following that's kept it in the limelight. I may be wrong but I thought those were the essential elements that made a movie have cult-status. Like The Room only growing in popularity years after it failed."
moviescirclejerk,3dklza,DawgBro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:30:08 2015 UTC,DAE think Ant-Man will make it to this list after it is released? It has all the makings of a cult sleeper hit.

moviescirclejerk,3di9f4,dwayneenyawd,27,Thu Jul 16 14:16:30 2015 UTC,This movie will be either hated by critics and loved by fans or loved by critics and hated by fans or hated by critics and hated by fans or loved by critics or loved by fans. It will most likely be a blockbuster worldwide or barely make its money back from production and marketing costs. Either way it's most likely a movie and not an interactive theater dinner. I'm no Nostradamus but I'm probably right.

moviescirclejerk,3di9f4,MajkiF,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"[Uj] The leaked trailer shows interpretation far away from comic book character. Apparently they have taken from character everything what made it famous and cool in first place and replaced it with random, not funny jokes."
moviescirclejerk,3di9f4,BuckNekkid18,2,Thu Jul 16 19:11:49 2015 UTC,Some jokes might be out of context as well. I can't remember the last time a comedy movie had a good trailer. They should've kept it serious and maybe one joke like the Green Lantern reference for the trailer. I understand why they're mixing and matching from different runs tho. This could end up as an abomination or a good movi.... err.. film.
