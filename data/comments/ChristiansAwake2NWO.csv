ChristiansAwake2NWO,3e1pcw,CleatusFTW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"Because it is part of Agenda 21 to make the drought bigger than it is. Media is making California as if we are not getting ANY rain. Laws are made based on this false presumption and water is sometimes even wasted or dumped to make a false narrative.  Here is an example: The city of Poway has recently dumped 550,000 gallons out because they conserved too much. They did not want to use the water for agriculture purposes because they were afraid that citizens would drink the water. The nearby city here of Rosemead uses separate water for their agriculture. I worked for the schools there and they use the undrinkable water to water the grass of parks and schools and libraries, etc. There is a sign they post up that says the water used for the sprinklers is reclaimed water and not to drink it. It does not come up in drinking fountains or to residential homes. Only to use for ground covering greenery.   Agenda 21 is NWO. NWO is Satan's plan to deceive people to believe they are doing good when they are actually destroying environment and standards of living. (Chemtrails, Fluoridated water, Fracking run off, electronic microwaves, etc.) They even get to the point where it is their idol calling it ""Mother Earth"". This environmental idolatry pushed by UN which is NWO and also part of the beast system.  The UN along with the Vatican is using these things to make new laws and even demonize Capitalism and bring on Socialism and Communism. It plans to bring on dictatorship and one world religion and one world government. I will post up more articles to show the correlation between them all.  That is a good question and glad you asked.

Be informed and remember they are still unbelievers who need Jesus. God's word says not to be unequally yoked so best friends and spouses should be Christians. Be friends but not best friends.   2 Corinthians 6:14   Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?   2 Corinthians 6:15   And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?   2 Corinthians 6:16   And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.   Luke 6:27   But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,   Luke 6:28   Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.   Luke 6:29   And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also.   Luke 6:30   Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.   Luke 6:31   And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.

Luke 6:33   And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same.   Luke 6:34   And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

ChristiansAwake2NWO,3d19mc,mswilso,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:19:09 2015 UTC,"Purposefully putting poison in your body, thereby KNOWINGLY inflicting self-harm, is not good, I agree. And yes, I agree totally that God has twice-owned us, and we are not our own, we are bought with a high price.   And I totally agree that we are commanded not to ""be drunk with wine"" which is idolatry. Truthfully, anytime we relinquish our self-control to control by any other substance or power (natural or supernatural), it is wrong. Being so drunk that you cannot control your actions is wrong. Allowing anything other than God to control your thoughts and actions is idolatry, plain and simple.   That much, I think you and I agree on totally. And I don't want to sound dogmatic or that I am acting as an authority over you, in any way. Jesus is your authority, as are the Scriptures.   But I want you to think about these things just a little deeper. You see, I was brought up as a strict Southern Baptist (""Lips that touch wine shall never touch mine."" and so forth). But since I started studying the Bible for myself, I have learned that not everything I was taught as a child was strictly true, even coming from a strict, fundamental background. I greatly admire those men (Cliff Palmer, Manley Beasley, Leonard Ravenhill, and others) that I learned so much from. But once I started following Jesus FOR MYSELF, and allowed the Holy Spirit to guide me, not apart from, but as an extension to these men's teachings, I started to get out into really deep water, spiritually-speaking.   My prayer is that you can stand on the Word of God AS IT IS LITERALLY, and not as someone, some earthly human wants you to believe, but as the Holy Spirit opens your spiritual eyes to spiritual reality.   But I challenge you to find a single verse in all the Bible (use the KJV, if that is what is most comfortable for you), and locate one verse where it says that ""Drinking alcohol is a sin."" It is not there. As I said previously, BEING DRUNK (i.e. drinking so much that you lose control of yourself), is totally wrong, and we agree on that. But the ingestion of alcohol is not expressly prohibited.   1) In the video presentation, he cites his opinion that ""the word for wine has lost some meaning over time, so that the Greek word for wine, also at one point included the idea of 'unfermented grape juice' "". Poppycock. The English word for WINE is a directly borrowed word from the Greek OINOS. If you go to any store in GREECE today, and ask for OINOS, they will not hand you Welch's grape juice. Anyone who thinks that OINOS means ""unfermented grape product"" is merely stretching the Scriptures to match their own theology...not allowing the Scriptures to define their theology.   2) In the story of Noah (see Gen. 9:20-27), there is not one word of condemnation for Noah getting drunk (even though we know, through progressive revelation, that God condemns it). On the contrary, the curses brought by Noah on his disobedient children and grandchildren were honored by God (""cursed be CANAAN!"" (Canaan being the son of Ham).   3) People who have a theological problem with the drinking of alcohol, also will have trouble interpreting and fitting their theology around other uses of it in the Scriptures. (See Deut. 14:26, Psalm 104:15, Matt. 11:19, Luke 7:34, 1 Timothy 5:23, others). In order to fortify their position on the sinfulness of alcohol, they must ""redefine their terms"" as would any cult, in order for the Scriptures to match their predetermined theology.   4) You stated wine/strong drink is a poison. There is recent evidence (video) that SUGAR is also a poison. Do what you will with that information.   5) Finally, as a Salvationist (full Salvation Army Soldier), I have signed a covenant between me and God to NOT drink alcohol, even though for all the reasons I have cited, that I believe that alcohol, in and of itself is not sinful. Why? Because I understand the mission of the Salvation Army is to minister to the drunks, bums, chronic alcoholics, homeless, and down-and-out members of our society. Most of those people cannot afford basic food items, much less the luxury of alcohol (even though a lot of them will waste what little money they have in favor of drink over food...)   So it would be hypocritical of me to lavish luxury on myself, while they sit in the cesspools of poverty. I would be a ""stumbling block"" (see Romans 14:13-23, 1 Cor. 8:9-13) if, in living my life in full submission to Christ, and they saw me indulging in the same life-style as they do. What makes me any different from them at that point? The driving force, my motivation, is to show them that Jesus has a better way for us to live. If I live exactly like they do...how is that lifting Jesus up? But by the same token those same people are very, very raw and real. They can spot a hypocrite a mile away. If I come to them, wearing a nice polyester suit, handing them a tract, and say, ""God loves you! Peace, be warm and well-fed!"" (James 2:16), then my well-intentioned actions will only turn them off, not lift up Jesus.   So, I hope you understand the fuller meaning that I am talking about, in so many words. What it boils down to is this: Legalism is Bondage. Jesus came to save us from the Law (not just the OT law, but ANY man-made law), and to give us freedom. ""If the Son sets you free, you will be free INDEED!"" (John 8:36). But in our freedom, we should not make  a license of our liberty. We should not ""go on sinning, so that Grace may increase"" (Romans 6:1). But neither should we invent new theologies to match what WE want the Scriptures to say.   God bless you in your search for truth. If this brings up any questions, I will be happy to answer them. I am not looking for a debate (trust me I have plenty of that these days!) but I want to be a resource for you, if anything I said was confusing in any way. May God fill you with the luxurious wine of His Holy Spirit and bring you to all truth."

Men then become subjects of the state, they look to government to grant them rights, and they look to government to solve their problems. I believe that this is the true motivation behind the gay agenda. If what they believe is normal and acceptable, then why do they feel the need to shove it down our throats? They claim homosexuality is normal because it can be observed in the animal kingdom while marriage is something that is not observed in nature.  This, as I have pointed out several other times is a result of Darwinism in our schools. By placing man in a category where he is no different than any other animal, the foundation for separating him from the divine built. No one has to force the idea of men and women being married down society’s throat because there is an obvious reason for the coupling of men and women, the creation and the raising of children.  The coupling of same sex couples has no obvious reasoning; therefore it is hard to accept as normal no matter how hard the communist left attempt to normalize it."
