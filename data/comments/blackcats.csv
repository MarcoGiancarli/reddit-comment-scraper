blackcats,3dl23x,bhudak,10,Fri Jul 17 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I never wanted a black cat until I got my first one.  I had always been a big fan of tabbies and calicos.  I got my first one when someone dumped him in a casino parking lot (a few miles from any homes) and he had actually gone inside the casino, looking for help.  The guards put him out, but he kept trying to get back in.  The casino is on a reservation without animal control, and no one wants a black cat around a casino, so I figured this wasn't going to end well for him.  Someone would probably dump him again in the desert to get him to go away.  But he was very friendly and after a little petting, he got right in my car and hopped on my lap.  He purred quietly all the way home.  Then he got out and came inside like he had always lived here.  That was over three years ago.    He turned out to be an amazing pet.  Sleeps on the pillow next to mine every night and is a heck of a good guy.   Last May, a little lost, feral black kitten showed up.  He was very afraid and about 4-5 weeks old.  I eventually got him to come around and he moved in.  This one is really special - he drapes himself over me all the time.  You'd never believe he was afraid of people at one time.  You can't give him enough attention.  Then in September, we trapped another feral black kitten at our other property.  But he got out of the trap in my car and climbed up into the dashboard!  He was in there for nearly 16 hours before he wanted out.  He took off like a shot and I didn't see him for 24 hours.  Then he showed up, crying pitifully because he was hungry.  Of course I fed him.  Then I started handing out kitty treats and he came around in just about ten days.  About another week later, he decided to move in.  Like the other, he became super friendly and frequently wants to be held and petted.  So that's how I ended up with three black cats.  They're very, very good boys.  They all like each other and hardly cause any trouble.  There's a little chasing and wrestling, but it's playful.  I also have a big gray tabby girl, who had been dumped in the alley.  I've really come around on black cats.  These three are some of the best pets I've ever had and I wouldn't hesitate to adopt another.  They're all warm, friendly and gentle.  Zero nipping or scratching.  Though a lot of black hair on everything.  I can live with that.  (For the record, the tabby is also incredibly nice.)"

blackcats,3dl23x,Tokeli,3,Fri Jul 17 08:48:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for rescuing all those little friends!
blackcats,3dl23x,AveragePurpleWizard,3,Fri Jul 17 12:43:16 2015 UTC,"Such a wonderful story!  I came to live with this black cat a bit by accident as well. I had just started grad school and was living alone for the first time. I was lonely, and I told my mom I was thinking about getting a kitten. While home for a break, a patient at the clinic she was working at brought in a small black kitten that he wanted someone to take. He had found the kitten near his home, and it had been living with him and his old tabby cat for a couple weeks. He was moving into a new retirement building, though, and could only bring one cat. With tears in his eyes, he handed me the kitten who would soon bear the name Tonks Monster the Devil Cat.   My SO constantly reminds me that Tonks is not ""my cat"", she's a cat who happens to live with us. She will curl up on your lap on the sofa or in bed, but touch her in the wrong spot and she will quickly communicate her displeasure. She's not the friendliest of cats, but she is certainly one of the most interesting cats I've ever met. She has such a unique personality.   Even though Tonks is a bit of an asshole she's caused me to totally fall in love with black cats. I wish I could go to the shelter and adopt them all!"
blackcats,3dl23x,netbich,2,Fri Jul 17 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's funny how black cats seem to gravitate to certain people/places. When I first moved into my current home there were a couple of black cat strays hanging around. I started feeding them and pretty soon I had about 7 black cats that I was feeding. I called them the ""Black Cat Mafia"" because I figured they wouldn't let any other color of cat in my yard.  The neighborhood kids must of thought I was a witch.  The Humane Society came out and did a TNR (trap neuter release) and after a few years I have no strays left.   But I do have a beautiful miniature panther named Dexter that I adopted after fostering him and his siblings.  I foster kittens a lot and always pick the black ones. They are the underdogs at the shelter, being the least likely to be adopted. I don't understand why this is.   Edit: The strays were not related."

blackcats,3c3hhl,Runnindude,3,Sat Jul 4 17:00:04 2015 UTC,She was part of a feral cat colony for about two years before the SPCA picked her up. One of the vets there was a bit overzealous when they spayed her and so her tummy is extra bald and she has one and a half ears. On all our other cats it has been a much smaller and appropriate notch.   She doesn't mind though. She loves the ear rubs. :D

blackcats,3c2z3m,ncisfan,3,Sat Jul 4 07:08:01 2015 UTC,"I've wanted a black cat for as long as I can remember but was never able to get one because when I was 6 we got three sibling cats (none of which were black) and they didn't like cats outside of their litter.   In April, Socks died, leaving his sister Tiny and only cat. In 3 weeks she lost half her weight and stopped grooming after Socks died. The vet said that since Tiny was used to being in a family of cats it was likely that she was lonely.   Around this time my Aunt's cats had kittens. A black and white male, a grey female and Arwyn, a beautiful black female. I'd been in contact with my Aunt in regards to kittens before as her cat had also had a litter in the fall. All the kittens in the first litter had died, but my Mom and I had been discussing with my Aunt to give a black kitten in the first litter a forever home.   Well, when Arwyn turned a month old and I looked like she would make it my Aunt called me and asked me if I was still interested in a black Kitten. Originally my mom said no, it was too soon after Socks passed away and she wasn't ready for another cat. Pluse, Arwyn was female and Mom thought that adopting a male cat would be better as Tiny and another female my not get along as well.   After hearing from the vet about Tiny, Mom decided to reconsider Arwyn and we eventually did decide to get her as her siblings where going to a local vet who had said that it was likely that Arwyn would not be adopted as she was black and people didn't typically adopt black kittens.   On May 15th we brought Arwyn home and, while Tiny didn't take to her immediately, now they seem like okay friends. Tiny is doing much better, she's regained her weight and then some and has recently started sharing a bowl with, grooming and helping Arwyn to learn to hunt. It's very sweet. Sometimes Tiny does get annoyed with Arwyn like when Arwyn pounces on Tiny's tale and Tiny will hiss and swipe at Arwyn but Tiny always keeps her claws in and has never hurt Arwyn. Right now the two of them are curled up and sleeping together on my bed in fact.   I'm very glad that Tiny and Arwyn learned to get along. Arwyn is the sweetest thing. She's also a psycho little thing and will often just come baraling through the house. A common fraise to be heard now is ""incoming small, black, and pouncy"" and then a few seconds later there's a small, black and pouncy on your foot or half way up your pant leg!"
blackcats,3c2z3m,sammer87,2,Sat Jul 4 07:24:20 2015 UTC,Such a sweet story! Glad that Tiny is getting better! Arwyn looks like a lot of fun too!

blackcats,3axexx,netbich,2,Wed Jun 24 07:19:37 2015 UTC,It breaks my heart to see a kitty with dirty fur. Cat's are naturally fastidious about keeping clean. Dirty fur means the cat is concentrating on survival not hygiene.
blackcats,3axexx,JulepMint,2,Wed Jun 24 14:44:37 2015 UTC,"Oh no, he's a very fastidious cleaner. He just happened to be rolling around our porch that morning lol. His coat has improved a lot since we've been feeding him, and now we're going to work on the de-worming and getting him to the vet (though he is already neutered.)"
blackcats,3axexx,netbich,2,Wed Jun 24 15:42:11 2015 UTC,"Post an updated pic...I think, no I know I love him!!  :d"
blackcats,3axexx,ValkyrX,2,Wed Jun 24 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Oh good! Now I'm happy. Thanks for taking care of him.  I had about 4 or 5 strays that hung around my house when I first moved in. Oddly enough they were all black cats so I called them the Black Cat Mafia.  After the Humane Society came and did a TNR (trap-neuter-release) it went down to 2 strays - after a couple of years. Then finally down to 1 old guy. I really wanted to make him an inside cat, but he sprayed a LOT, even though he was neutered. His fur was so matted and greasy. We tried brushing him and washing him but it didn't help for long. We finally took him in to be put down because it was obvious he was suffering."
blackcats,3ate8q,imblu2,12,Tue Jun 23 10:38:51 2015 UTC,"I have never actually heard people say that black cats are bad luck, but I work at an animal rescue and we have had people say weird things about not liking black cats. Plus we had a person who wanted to adopt a black cat right before Halloween and would not consider waiting a week after, so that was weird and we rejected them."
blackcats,3ate8q,colettecupcake,3,Tue Jun 23 17:39:55 2015 UTC,Good. They probably wanted a living decoration to discard.
blackcats,3ate8q,shoyker,4,Wed Jun 24 03:19:13 2015 UTC,"We actually thought they might want to use them in a ritual or something like that, but you could also be right."
blackcats,3ate8q,colettecupcake,3,Wed Jun 24 14:19:32 2015 UTC,Oh gosh that's even worse.
blackcats,3ate8q,shoyker,9,Wed Jun 24 14:23:19 2015 UTC,my cat's reaction to that
blackcats,3ate8q,greenchrissy,8,Tue Jun 23 18:41:54 2015 UTC,My cat's reaction to that
blackcats,3ate8q,netbich,3,Wed Jun 24 01:14:04 2015 UTC,My cat's reaction to your cat's reaction of my cat's reaction to that
blackcats,3ate8q,netbich,4,Wed Jun 24 01:56:25 2015 UTC,I love you. Just soze ya know
blackcats,3ate8q,greenchrissy,7,Wed Jun 24 02:15:25 2015 UTC,Someone telling me that my kitty cat is bad luck would not go over well.
blackcats,3ate8q,Iwantsprinkles,6,Wed Jun 24 01:24:05 2015 UTC,People are just jealous of the gorgeous sable color.
blackcats,3ate8q,Auroness,3,Tue Jun 23 16:43:45 2015 UTC,What idiots say that?
blackcats,3appey,mu3mpire,5,Mon Jun 22 14:26:35 2015 UTC,Frijoles negros?
blackcats,3appey,Joe_Hole,2,Mon Jun 22 20:46:18 2015 UTC,Is he your secatary?
blackcats,3appey,WinExploder,2,Mon Jun 22 21:07:58 2015 UTC,He's judging you for being on Reddit instead of working.
blackcats,3appey,serefemme,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:27:30 2015 UTC,Looks bossy. :P
blackcats,3appey,Aylesbury,4,Mon Jun 22 15:00:12 2015 UTC,Sometimes he is. I've woken up to him softly biting my arm when his meows didn't get me up
blackcats,3appey,Aylesbury,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:18:11 2015 UTC,How typical. Still beats living with a partner. ;)
blackcats,3ap2w9,carmarm1,3,Mon Jun 22 10:11:03 2015 UTC,She's so little! I love the roundness of her face too!

blackcats,3an4h0,YesButNoWaitYes,9,Sun Jun 21 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"Your priorities, I like them."
blackcats,3an4h0,Iwantsprinkles,5,Mon Jun 22 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"What kind of phone did you get? My cat is just a black blob when I try to take his picture, I'm lucky if I can get any detail!"
blackcats,3an4h0,murrtastic,4,Sun Jun 21 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. I had an HTC One before,  but the camera burned out horribly after a year or so. At the end is its life all the pictures were purple and blurry."
blackcats,3an5tb,cube1701,2,Sun Jun 21 21:30:41 2015 UTC,Wow. This is like I'm looking at my own little sweetie. I love Luna!
blackcats,3an5tb,nightbiscuit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:43:02 2015 UTC,Those fuzzy little black paws   <3  so adorable
blackcats,3akyri,imblu2,2,Sun Jun 21 05:38:09 2015 UTC,She is a climber/jumper!
blackcats,3akyri,msobelle,2,Sun Jun 21 07:59:18 2015 UTC,My husband's comment to this incident was: I am the night. I am a blackcat!
blackcats,3akyri,Auroness,2,Sun Jun 21 16:19:56 2015 UTC,"There is the one door handle that is horizontal. It may have taken a few attempts to reach it, but form there, fridge was easy. I've watched my cat do something similar. All it takes is room for 1 paw to get a stable point."
blackcats,3ak41h,Matrix115,2,Sat Jun 20 23:55:41 2015 UTC,Velvety paws! So cute!
blackcats,3ak41h,irish_oatmeal,2,Sun Jun 21 03:05:10 2015 UTC,Cuddle bug!

blackcats,3aet3o,Cheesydrycakestuff,5,Fri Jun 19 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"Mine likes being on my lap, too.  But it's 117° here today in Arizona!  I got sweat all over him, but he still wanted to cuddle."
