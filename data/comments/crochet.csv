Like if you got Red Heart Camo, if you wanted to make some sort of striped pattern (like you have, which is beautiful!) you would need to do X many of Y type of stitches in blocks of Z rows... something like that. Had a pattern type, too, so you could possibly stitch up a plaid pattern naturally.  Wish I had bookmarked that site...  This is cool to see in practice. Same skein, same colorway, different pattern just because you altered the pattern just a smidge."

crochet,3e3bib,draqza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"There's some story behind this that I totally missed, but basically one of my friends asked if I could crochet her a beagle, and if I could put a horn on it.   Somehow it came together, although it was just one problem after another. I hate trying to assemble balls once they're totally finished off and closed, so instead of following the pattern and making the head and body separate I just fudged together a neck to make it all as one piece. Then I discovered a) there are a couple rounds that decrease only in certain parts of the round, for the front or back, which I had to guess at, and b) based on stitch counts, it probably actually starts at the bottom instead of the top.  Whoops.  Then I stitched the muzzle sort of funny, with the end result being that I couldn't properly stuff it, so its nose is a little funky. And because I made the body upside down, the legs went on sort of awkwardly.  In fact, the only thing that was a win was that I finally managed to work rounds of 4 stitches, for the tail (and later, the horn)...normally if my magic circle starts with fewer than 6 stitches I get lost and give up.  Pattern is the beagle pattern from this list, yarns are RHSS in black, white, and coffee, with 12mm eyes.  Oh, and for the white rings around the eyes it called for a tiny hook (which I bought) and a smaller size of crochet thread than I bought, so I totally just winged that too... made a magic circle, 6sc, put the eye post through before I tightened the ring, and then slst closed."

He got really excited about the few calla lilies I had mixed in there and asked if he could hire me to make some for his girlfriend. Apparently they're her favorite flower and her birthday is coming up. I charged him $30 (was going to charge less but my fiancée convinced me my time is worth money) and he seemed happy with that.   My question: do you think other people might be interested in buying something like this? Like if I put it on etsy? Do you think $30 was a good price for 6 flowers? Total cost of materials was ~$6-8 maybe, and it took me an evening (~3 hours) to make each flower base and then another to assemble them all. But I did all that while watching tv and lazing about, so it was fun.   I've sold stuff on etsy before, but the only stuff I had luck selling were things with overt geek references (people loved my Star Trek and TARDIS headbands). The pretty stuff never seemed to sell. Maybe I just wasn't marketing it correctly.   Any thoughts or advice?"

crochet,3dzm1e,song_pond,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:29 2015 UTC,How did you do the wave? Did you start with a regular ripple and alter it somehow to get a more gradual wave instead of the more zig-zaggy effect?  It's gorgeous and I want to try!
crochet,3dzm1e,song_pond,2,Tue Jul 21 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"I was actually kind of surprised the waves were as soft as they were. I have two theories -- either I messed up, or its because the blue yarns were a slightly lighter weight than the sand, but I didn't change my hook size.  Pattern for waves after initial chain was just... Ch 2, Dc in the same stitch, Dc in the next four, 2 Dc in the next two, Dc in the next four, dc2tog twice ...repeat until 2 Dc in the last stitch.  If you do make something similar, you'll have to let me know how it works out! I'm still learning!"
crochet,3dzm1e,AnyLamename,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks! That is slightly different from the ripple afghan in the pattern book I have. They have you skip 2 stitches instead of doing dc2tog. Perhaps that's the difference. I'll try it out some day when I'm allowed to, haha (I need to make some stuff up to fill a craft table, so that is my focus until mid-September when I can look at blankets again!)"
crochet,3dzm1e,song_pond,2,Tue Jul 21 02:31:46 2015 UTC,That's my next mission too! Ahh!
crochet,3dzm1e,42spleens,2,Tue Jul 21 10:35:55 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason, this is a very fascinating topic for me. I've never done anything in ripple, despite loving the concept, because I don't like the hole at the ""point"" of each ripple, but then I see examples like this and a blanket from another recent thread that are much tidier and I get all excited. The one thing that still eludes me is a ripple that manages to have a sharp point without the hole. I really need to start learning more crochet theory (crochet math?) so I can actually figure out what's going on here instead of just hoping to find the right pattern."
crochet,3dzm1e,thrownouttosea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"My favourite thing about any craft is figuring it out for myself so I totally get you. I tend to not work from patterns because the fun for me is ""hey, I wonder if this will work!"" I'm currently working on a hexagonal bobble stitch bath mat done in the round, because of course I am. It's turning out okay but I think I have to frog my last round and put fewer increases in my corners."

crochet,3e0gj9,Kitty4Snugglez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:25:46 2015 UTC,Would love to do that but my cats would do some rearranging so they had room on the shelves lol! And let's not forget the second cat who will play with the yarn  until it covers every inch of the carpet.

crochet,3dybvu,Kittycutebegrim,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:43 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've made a few of these C2C blankets but this was my first attempt with panels. This is the video that I watched to figure out how to do it.
