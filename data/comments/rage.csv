If you're driving drunk and someone runs a red light, you get the punishment.   All the more reason not to drive drunk.  I know someone serving 10 years for DUI manslaughter.   Not sure if she was at fault or not, but she killed someone and she's been in prison for the last 5 years or so.   Why does this woman get a break?

Middlebury Vt. where she is from has a population of around 8,500. Farrisburgh where the collision actually occurred has a population around 2,800. These are very small communities where everyone knows everyone else. I would be willing to bet a large sum that the first officer on scene knew exactly who this woman was when he arrived and set into motion the preferential treatment. I wouldn't be surprised in the least to find out that the police tampered with evidence in an attempt to make it appear as though the cyclist was at fault.

If someone else caused the accident, then someone else caused the accident.  Don't let your moral code prevent you from doing what's right.   If the cyclist was your friend, and you got mad at someone else because he got himself killed doing something reckless, you would be an asshole.

rage,3e0ukz,tremens,0,Tue Jul 21 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"The problem is that in almost any other situation with a Joe Average, a citizen would be charged. Plus it would be considered an aggravating factor in sentencing of their DUI, in most states (i.e, you'd get a Level 4 or 5 DUI as opposed to a Level I or II, because there was property damage or injury ""as a result of"" the DUI - even if it wasn't really - plus you'd be charged with separate charges for the injury, deaths, and property damage.)  I agree with you - charging a DUI driver who is not at fault for the accident with additional charges is unjust. But the fact of the matter is that's how the law works in almost every other situation, but suddenly, when people happen to be police, police officers, connected politicians, or just exceptionally wealthy, they not only aren't convicted of these charges, they never even have to defend themselves from it.   Oh, and she got two hours to have her blood taken. I'm not sure about other states, but in mine, and particularly in my county, you have 30 minutes to have a witness arrive on seen, then you're offered the breathalyzer. If you refuse the breathalyzer, that's an automatic 1 year license revocation and they have a judge sitting right there in the jail 24 hours a day to rubber stamp a warrant to seize your blood. You'd get maybe 45 minutes from arrest to having your blood forcibly taken, max.  If justice isn't equal, it isn't justice at all."

Ask a cop to help with something like a locked car door, a nurse to help with a sick neighbor, a teacher to help a kid who's being beaten up.

It also states that she is a college student, so money is probably a little tight for daycare. This was an ""impromptu"" interview, so there probably was not time to set up child care, even if she could afford it. If I was going on a job interview, telling the interviewer that I'm bringing my children along would probably make them think twice about hiring me.   So we're meeting up in a public space with lots of people around and food for the kids. As long as I give them food to keep them occupied and make sure I can see them, it's a slim chance that anything catastrophic will happen. Weigh that risk against the necessity of me needing a job, and we have this situation.   It's absolutely OK that a concerned citizen would see these 2 kids sitting alone and call the police.

If you were a Christian, believing that people need to accept Jesus as their saviour or they will go to hell, you'd try to convert as many people as possible to save them."
rage,3dywsp,Kangewalter,6,Mon Jul 20 21:51:16 2015 UTC,"This article just screams total bias.   But most Christians do not agree with these practises. They probably love their faith just as much, but feel if people want to change their religion, they will find their own way to do so.   This is not true at all. Christians don't agree with missionary work? What in the world? I mean, if they were bringing actual aid as well, I don't think any Christian would be against it. Too bad...    Bible groups in the US have been raising money to take the Holy Book to the IDPs. One of these claims on its website to have provided food, blankets and Bibles to 20,000 refugees in Erbil, and asks for another $20,000 to do more. Well, at least this group also brought materials that were badly needed. Others only raise money for Bibles for people who have lost all their worldly goods.   Never mind. These people brought actual help to people who needed actual help and the author of the article is angry because they also added a book and told them they believe in Jesus. Even as a Christian, if an atheist group provided food and shelter to 20,000 people who needed it, if only to make them atheists (not that an atheist group would ever do that just to make people atheists), I would be damn happy that 20,000 people are not going hungry and cold tonight.   am reminded of ISIS, a group that wants to convert anyone who is not part of their own radical corner of Islam – because presumably it is what Allah asks of them, so they will be rewarded in paradise. The evangelicals caught Yezidis in their nets for exactly the same reason: the reward in heaven.   Apparently the author knows exactly the intentions of all of those missionaries and apparently it's just as bad as ISIS.   If Christians expect Muslims to eliminate their radical elements, should they not do the same themselves?   I am a Christian, but if there were Christian's doing stupid ass things it's rage inducing and belongs on this sub. The only thing rage inducing about this article is the incredibly irrational bias the author clearly has against Christianity/religion as a whole."

He was held in the infamous Hoa Lo Prison (aka Hanoi Hilton) for five freaking years. Many of his peers have said he was one of the few who was never psychologically broken by the guards, and that earned him especially harsh punishments. He had so many bones broken and never set properly he eventually got the nickname ""crip"" from his fellow POWs. His most famous act though, was turning down the early release.  We're not really aware of the backdoor deals that got him an early release offer, but we do know his father was an Admiral in the Navy, and may have made some back channel offers. Alternatively, it is theorized the Vietnamese were trying to prove that Americans would go out of their way to save the children of elites while leaving the common folk to suffer. At any rate, a deal was offered and John refused to leave his friends behind. He elected to stay in one of the most horrific POW camps in history (ended up staying another three years), because he thought it was unfair for him to get a special deal or to be released before people who had been captured earlier. This personally offended the prison camp warden who made things even worse for McCain. Dude, I don't agree with his politics, but that's pretty fucking heroic."

Sure, I agree that it would be wrong if the government forced pastors to marry two people that shouldn't be married according to that pastor's faith. But when the government does something unconstitutional, you go to the Supreme Court, you don't just start shooting at people.  Did gay people have the right to shoot government officials that didn't allow them to get married before the Supreme Court decision last month? They definitely believed the government was infringing upon their constitutional rights, and apparently they were correct, so then they would have been justified to defend their rights using violence, no?  I don't think so. Sure, there's a certain line you have to draw, and when you cross that line, you have to realise that you live in a tyranny and you should start using violence to fight back. If you lived in North Korea, I wouldn't blame you for using violence. But the US isn't even near that line, and they still wouldn't be if they forced you to say a few words that caused two gay people to get married. You can't just shout ""tyranny!"" and start shooting people for every small (perceived or real) infraction on your constitutional rights, or the US would be in a permanent civil war."

They would win that battle in court, since the courts already said they wouldn't force priests to do that.   The law applies to government buildings, where your religion is of no importance to anyone there except yourself. You have to obey the law and you can't refuse to serve someone just because you don't feel like it. That's discrimination and it's very clear legally that you cannot do that.  The bakers were fined that much money because, as I said above, they broke the law and discriminated against people for their sexuality. If the couple were black, and a baker said ""we refuse to serve blacks here"" it would have been the same exact result. Would I have sued them? No but it's about sending the message that gay people will no longer tolerate being treated like second class citizens.  There is no attack on relgion. The more crazy people like this speak up and say crazy shit, the more people will fight back and piss them off. Those 2 people who want to change the bible won't succeed at all. People have been doing and trying to do shit like that for decades. And it's not exactly the first time that the bible has been edited for political reasons.

At UCSC, I believe the tuition is about 30k+ per year so it's possible that 90k wouldn't be enough. And that's not even one of the top tier public schools, no disrespect to the school as it's still a very good one. Private universities in most cases costs more than 30K."
rage,3dmncy,ehhhwutsupdoc,2,Fri Jul 17 23:50:17 2015 UTC,"In-state tuition at a big 10 college that I attend is about $11,000 a year. My brand new and very nice apartment complex costs me about $6,500 a year, and that's including all the bills that come with it. Costs me about $2,000 for food each year too, as well as $500 each year for books rented at the college bookstore or bought used off amazon. $20,000 each year for  a four year degree puts me at $80,000 by the time I'll finish college.    If I got all that paid for, plus $10,000 in extra spending money, I'd have an extremely fun and worthwhile college experience with no debt.   If I instead chose to live at home with my parents while attending a college close to home, yearly in-state tuition would cost me about $5,000 a year. Another $2,000 each school year if my parents wouldn't pay for home-cooked meals, and another $500 for the books. That would make a four year degree cost about $30,000, with $60,000 extra leftover.   Receiving $90,000 to attend college would be extremely generous and would allow me to have more fun during my college experience than I could ever imagine."

I think this country has a possibility of being great, but it isn't great now.""  Matthews said, ""It was kind of weird that the crowd tried to get some sort of symbolism from it. We came up with no protest in mind, but the crowd had protest in mind when we left. If people call our talking on the stand a protest, well, some people can watch 'Alice in Wonderland' and get pornography out of it.""

Unlike in other similar FPS games, the gun skins in CS:GO are worth real world money, in this case about $26 USD each.  A user of a CSGO subreddit decided to give away a bunch of these skins out of the kindness of his heart to the tune of about $1040 and sent the skins to the mods steam account for safe keeping.  The CSGO skin community also happens to have a rather large gambling scene within it where people gamble their skins to try and get more money. The mod went to one of these sites and gambled away the majority of this guys money."
rage,3dih5m,RobotRollCall24,32,Thu Jul 16 16:22:01 2015 UTC,How are skins (which do nothing to affect weapon performance) worth so much real money? It seems ridiculous to me.

rage,3dih5m,BeaSk8r117,16,Thu Jul 16 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have that much experience with how CSGO does this, but I know some things about Dota and the answer would be..kinda but definitely no. The items that get in the game are managed by Valve and you can't make an item without it first going on through them, but you can rename them to fake rarity. For example you can't paint a gun yellow and say it's the super rare gold skin or something, but you can rename an already golden gun to add things like ""inscribed"" or ""mythical"" that would increase their value if they were real, but it's really easy to see when it's not."
rage,3dih5m,Sosetila,6,Thu Jul 16 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Generally the REALLY rare skins are duped, where there are only 1-4 legit ones but somehow there's are 10-20 in the world lol. Hard to explain, but basically someone is ""hacked"" with their rare skin given to multiple accounts back and forth so it's really gone out of the original. Original account messages support, and they can't just reverse the trade as there is a possibility someone paid legitimate money for it, so they duplicate the item stolen and give it to the original. Now that 1 item has become 2 different ones, expanding the number of them that exist."
rage,3dih5m,lFallout,8,Thu Jul 16 17:20:54 2015 UTC,I think it's something like the hat craze in team fortress 2.
rage,3dih5m,stufoor,6,Thu Jul 16 17:00:30 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what it is. It came along in CSGO in the form of skins about 2 years ago. Interestingly enough, it's gone back to TF2 in the form of weapon skins with their most recent update. It's skins all the way down."
rage,3dih5m,L4MB,6,Thu Jul 16 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"The skins are given to players in ""cases"" that you have to buy a key (~2€) to open. After a player has opened one he can use it or at any point sell it forward on the steam marketplace (or 3rd party trading sites). The price for the skins is purely supply and demand which is primarily determined by A. rarity of the skin B. the weapon the skin is for C. how cool it looks.  A nice looking design for an often used weapon like AK-47 can have a drop rate of say 1/100 so to get it from cases it'd cost on average approximately 200€. The marketplace price tends to always be a lot lower than it'd cost to get it from a case but opening cases has the aspect of ""what if I get it on the first try"" and it is kinda fun to do, like scratch-offs. To balance the valuable skins most of the drops are complete shit like uzi skins that often sell for about 3-5 cents.   The drop rates aren't public though so the prices can vary a lot depending how much the community likes certain items. People are more likely to hang onto and keep using a nice looking skin and therefore there are less in the market running the price up."

rage,3divzl,BBQsauce18,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:09:33 2015 UTC,"One example would be the JW's and Mormons who proselytize door-to-door.  They say what they have to say with respect, and they leave you alone when you ask them to.  Another example would be the soapbox guy in public.  Maybe it's for religion, maybe for politics, but he has something to actually say, and he doesn't just insult people passing by like some dime store Don Rickles.  He combines his own natural speaking voice with his power of persuasion.  There are plenty of ways to preach at people without screaming in their ears or insulting them on a personal level based on some aspect of their personal appearance.  Plenty of ways.  But these guys aren't there to actually utilize their right to free speech, they are there to abuse their power of free speech in order to engage in beard-pulling pranks cloaked in robes of false righteousness."

Do you not think though that the best way going forward is to make being any of them things a complete non issue? I know it's easier said than done for someone like me who doesn't have to put up with bigoted comments or even attacks but I think making a big deal of someone like Caitlin Jenner gives just as much of a platform for the transphobic as it does for the trans people themselves.

I only talk about trans issues at trans support groups, or online during times like this when people are posting a lot about the topic I try to inform them / share my experience.    And to be honest, I did not face any bigoted comments or attacks in real life for being trans.  Everyone in my life was indifferent or supportive, and even when I looked ""in-between"" the most I ever got from strangers was a stare.  Getting misgendered (like called ""sir"") does suck but it doesn't happen much any more, and when it did happen they were probably genuine mistakes.  So I agree with no making a big deal out of it!  On the otherhand, Caitlyn is a celebrity and apparently her story is really fascinating to some people, so I guess that's why they are talking about it.  It's an interesting point that it gives just as much platform to the transphobes as to the allies.  I guess the best use of the platform is to try and change people's minds, those who don't hate us but who genuinely have very little exposure / understanding.  Posting memes probably doesn't qualify as productive...but honestly facebook is so full of crap in general I just stay away from the whole thing :D"

rage,3dfzr3,Malos_Kain,-10,Thu Jul 16 14:20:26 2015 UTC,Yeah it is a makeup tutorial but that's irrelevant - it looks real. Everyone has had injuries like that and it may look similar to what the child has.   One time I fell off a skateboard and hurt my hand so much that I didn't use it for a week. I didn't go to the doctor and felt no need to. Not using a finger for a while doesn't scare me so much.    The big two points are 1. it may not be as bad of an injury as people are assuming and 2. they might be avoiding the doctor due to a reason like financial troubles. Combine those and you potentially get a situation where they're not necessarily such a bad parent.

You didn't think it might be a small bruise like when you stub your toe. That's exactly what might make someone avoid using a small appendage for a while. It's not necessarily a ""disabled limb in extreme danger of permanent injury"".   No, you don't go to the doctor for any and all injuries just in case.

Homeless Shopping Spree: In late 1999, shortly before Christmas, O&A held the first ""Homeless Shopping Spree"", which has since become an annual event. The bit involves a dozen of New York's homeless, who are each given several hundred dollars by the show and much more by the fans, and are taken to a posh shopping mall, most notably the Mall at Short Hills in Short Hills, New Jersey. They are allowed to buy whatever they want, including warm clothes and other items they could not normally afford, while being cheered on by the thousands of listeners who show up. In the 1999 Spree, the mall reacted by closing several of the nicer stores and eventually have the twelve homeless men removed from the mall by security. Boston mayor Thomas Menino expressed outrage at the event, declaring that the Homeless Shopping Spree degraded and humiliated the contestants, and that it was immoral to hold such an event on the same day the city was to do a census count of the homeless townspeople. The event was repeated at the same mall on December 16, 2006.[48]"

It may be dumb and unwise, but teenagers will sneak out of their houses late at night because they're fucking teenagers; most of the time it's not because the parents don't care, it's because they have no fucking idea they're doing it (and how could they know, short of setting up fucking cameras, if their kid happens to be good at sneaking out?).

The focus should be on making this cheaper, more accessible and a requirement for meat production. It also creates higher quality meat that isn't tainted with stress hormones that tighten the meat.  A vegan diet isn't unhealthy, you can get the same vitamins and nutrients from a vegan diet it's just ""harder"" to do. Meat is also tasty.

But the answer of, ""why do it?"" is the second amendment. We have a right to carry a firearm. Without justification or an excuse. Americans are really, really big on their constitution and bill of rights. These freedoms define most Americans.  The attitude of, ""doing that is suspicious even though it is legal"", is dangerous.   Because that leads to, ""there's no reason to do it if you're not up to something"".   Which will take us to, ""well he wouldn't have been arrested/shot/whatever if he didn't deserve it"".  So the justification is... it's legal, so you don't need justification. We're innocent until proven guilty, if someone's not breaking the law we shouldn't treat them like a criminal.  I love guns. I collect them and shoot for recreation. I don't hunt or carry a weapon around for self defense. So you could say I don't ""need"" a gun. But I'm a law abiding citizen with a legal, constitutionally endorsed hobby. So why should my motives be questioned?  That all being said I think open carry is a bad idea if you want to extend an olive branch to those who are uncomfortable around guns. It's their right but it's certainly not helping them sway others opinions. Making people feel unsafe is the fastest way to drive them even further away from embracing your hobby.

If he's just walking around not doing anything, and someone assaults him or shoots him because they feared for their life, that person would rightly be arrested for assault.   Just carrying a gun doesn't inspire fear in a reasonable person so that they would be justified in harming him, and almost any judge would agree. Unless he was brandishing that weapon or carrying it in an unsafe or threatening manner he wasn't breaking the law or giving reasonable suspicion that he's about to break/has recently broken the law."

You believe that your fear is a valid challenge to someone's constitutional rights.  That's just as bad as trying to get someone arrested because they hurt your feelings on twitter. Your being uncomfortable doesn't mean everyone feels that way, and it doesn't give you the right to decide who's suspicious or strange when no ones doing anything objectively suspicious or strange (I.e participating in activity layed out in the bill of rights .)  My rights end where your rights begin. They don't however end where your feelings begin.    I would never open carry in an urban environment, I think it's a bad way to convince people that guns are safe if treated with respect.

This is America, people aren't guilty until proven innocent dude...  Be scared, that's your prerogative I suppose. But calling the cops on someone who hasn't done anything illegal, only done something you disapprove of, makes you irrational.

rage,3d9bcj,Hidesuru,77,Wed Jul 15 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"When I was younger we lived on a ten acre lot. Square. I helped my dad one summer plant about 50 or so young maple trees all down the side of our yard (along the driveway) about 10-15 feet apart.   All summer long I had to water them every day. Each tree. It was a pain, but they looked damn nice and we were proud of them.   So one day some young adults let's say come up to our house and say they got their truck stuck in the adjacent lot. It happened to be an empty lot. They were mudding. Claimed they had owners permission but my dad suspected shenanigans. None the less he grabbed some tackle and helped em unstick their truck. He's a helpful guy if you don't fuck him (this becomes relevant).   As he's walking back to the house these fucking clowns come roaring accross OUR yard (they didn't want to get stuck again, after all) tearing up our property... And run straight through 2 or 3 of our trees. Fuckers.   So my dad gets so furious he just hurls the Maglite he had in his hands (one of those giant ass 4 d cell models) at the guys truck. It hits the guy in the arm so hard it broke the bone.   They called later to complain. My parents were unsympathetic. Strangely they never sued, lol (knew they were trespassing, etc). My dad never did get that Maglite back, though (I guess somehow it ended up in the truck bed, I didn't see all this happen myself).   Years later after we sold the house I went back and the next owner ripped them all out and cleared the land for fucking horses. It looked like shit. Plenty of plots in that area were already cleared, too. Oh well.   It's sort of related, and I've never told the story on reddit before so I figured why not now?"

Apparently, a woman being blase about false sexual assualt accusations is more rage worthy than an actual rapist not being punished.     For the record I strongly believe people who make false assualt, rape or child/spousal abuse claims should be punished. Regardless of gender, it is 100% not ok, it can literally ruin a life.

In the unedited version of the video, Nucatola was discussing the cost of “space issues” and shipping, notes Snopes, a website that debunks Internet rumors and hoaxes. However, the viral video makes it seem as if she is telling the actors -- who were hired by the activist group -- about the cost of fetal tissue"

She does mention that this practice maintains and improves the bottom line - which I think is the reason some people are confused (or they just believe whatever because it fits with their opinions regarding abortion). In this case,  however, improving the bottom line is achieved by reducing the overall cost of the procedure. A research lab might pay for the container and transport of specimens,  when otherwise PP would have to pay someone to dispose of the remaining biological waste.

rage,3d0t7m,Busth,20,Sun Jul 12 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"Naw, this:  Feel free to share your shitty experience over at /r/FuckBestBuy!  I bought an Asus gaming laptop in February of 2014. The employee asked if I wanted to buy the warranty, and said it covers ANYTHING except submersion in fluids. I said sure, why not. Fast forward to a few months ago. I'm at my house playing a game and I get a call from my father in law saying that my wife has been in an accident. He got a call from the police, and all that could tell him was that she was on her way to the local hospital. I grab my computer and run out the door. I realize I left my keys inside. Set my computer on my car, run back inside to get my keys, and jump in my car. I live next to the loop, so I turn on to it. A few seconds later I see something fly off the back of my car. FUCK. Pull over, grab it off the side of the road (it's destroyed of course) and get to the hospital. Luckily she only has a broken leg.  Next day I go to best buy and tell the customer service person what happened. She sends me to geek squad where they tell me it's not covered. Talk to manager, he refuses. Also refuses to put me into contact with the district manager. He says that since I have no way to prove what the employee told me about the warranty I'm shit out of luck.  Call a few stores and ask the computer employees if it would be covered. A couple say yes, get transferred to the manager, he denies they said that and that they are telling him they didn't say that. Fucking wow.  Call corporate, they tell me nobody would say it is covered. I give them the employee's ID number from the receipt, and they refuse to look it up so we can ask them what they said the warranty covers. She refuses to give me the district managers contact info. I ask to speak to her manager, and after 30 minutes on hold I hung up because I had to pick up my daughter. Tried again later and had an hour wait time both times.  I've filed a complaint with the BBB with no response.  I've also contacted stores and I tell them what happened to my laptop, but I say i didn't have the insurance on it and they tell me that would be covered 100% had I had the warranty. Then tell them I did have the warranty and they immediately say they are going to grab a manager then deny ever saying that.  I spend $1,500-$2,000 a year at best buy and never buy large purchases off Amazon because I want to be able to walk in and get my problem solved. Since that now has no benefit, fuck it. I'll just put my Amazon prime to work.  A lot of people say its a warranty and not insurance when I post this and that Best Buy doesn't claim it covers accidental damage, so here is an image from their site about the warranty:  http://i.imgur.com/KXrUXZ3.jpg  http://imgur.com/EyKsYXf  Update:a few days ago I emailed the CEO my experience and a member of the ""Best Buy Executive Resolution Team"" contacted me and told me they would not be upholding the warranty."

How can you say for sure this kid specifically would be picked on for something else if he wasn't brown? Kids will pick on kids, yes, but that doesn't mean we should write off racism in children just because bullying is a common occurrence.   In society, even in adults, there's bullying, and there's racism. They both come from different places,  psychologically and historically. In reality, complex issues such as bullying or targeted racism rarely ""all boil down"" to something black and white and simple to grasp. Are you really suggesting that the things that go on in these kids' homes don't have an effect on what they think and do? Or that they aren't affected by culture or the media, or things they see and hear every day?   Maybe these kids don't understand the gravity of their actions when they say racist things, but that doesn't exempt them from taking part in Racism as a whole. Bullying is something that kids do, sure, but when racism enters into it, it's a symptom of other things going on; it can't possibly always be arbitrary bullying for the sake of bullying. They could've noticed he's brown or he wears a turban and make fun of him for that, for example, but to call him a terrorist? They are clearly going beyond simply noticing difference and into the area of politics and current events. Brown people aren't all terrorists. They didn't just notice him being a terrorist. They noticed he was brown and then made a racist generalization. This isn't even an actual quality of the person. If somebody is fat, you notice it, you call them fat, that's bullying. If somebody is brown and you call them a terrorist, that's not just noticing the difference in skin color. You're manufacturing negative qualities. That's attacking somebody based on a quality that they do not even possess, whereas bullying is about something that is actually there to be made fun of. Racism is about ignorant, stereotypical generalizations, and bullying is about specific attributes.  This is why I think they are different issues."

Unfortunately I realized that the key to me not being like total shit during my time riding the bus was to hop on and start calling him names like everyone else.  I just graduated high school, and I can still remember the feeling of utter discontent I had when I would call him ""ball-head"" just like everyone else.  I hated the fact that I was doing it but I put myself and my selfish interests in front of his when he did the opposite for me.  I don't think I'll ever forget that.    Edit:  Just out of curiosity, why was this downvoted?  Did I break a rule or something?   I still see him around on Facebook from time to time, and I must say, his beard is very kickass."

A dairy cow was due to give birth (you know, because they have to give birth to produce milk for us) but she wasn't birthing on schedule like the farmers wanted so they pulled the calf out without anesthetic. The cow was in awful pain since it was human induced labour. Seconds later when the cow was trying to nurse her baby, the baby was taken from her and she cried out for the calf so badly it made me cry. They then proceeded to hit the mother's backside with rope to make her shut up, and the way they handled the calf was appalling as well. They dragged the calf by his ankle and he was struggling to get away.   Let's use common sense here. Animal agriculture can never be used to feed the millions whilst keeping animals safe and happy. There is not enough space. There are not enough compassionate company owners that farm the animals either. Use your brain, not your taste buds."

I didn't even know the word Jap was offensive to be honest, but hey what do I know, I'm just a white Brit, it's not for me to say what's offensive and what isn't.   Either way certainly not rage worthy especially when it seems she honestly didn't know any better."
rage,3d5m1q,DiggaryDonaldson,8,Mon Jul 13 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, she didn't know it was offensive but she seems kind of too passive aggressive over being told she was ""wrong"", it seemed kind of strangely and unnecessarily vindictive to me.  Also, I guess as a Japanese Canadian, I view the word ""jap"" to be very similar in connotation to something like ""chink"", I'm not sure if everyone is aware of the history of the term, wikipedia explains it pretty concisely, if you are interested.  To put it into context, I wouldn't go around saying let's go eat ""chink""-noodles in ""chink""-town. However, unlike the ""c"" word, the ""j"" word is probably lesser known to many, but I think any reasonable person if it was pointed out to them would have been like ""oh, I didn't know that, I'll keep that in mind"" especially someone who is your fan/reader.  I recognize this original post because I actually follow(ed) this person up to this point  and I'm glad it was put up here. What made me raise an eyebrow (or two) is that 1. she doesn't have the post where the reader corrected her up anymore (thus most people have no context as to why she is reacting in this way, and it was actually fairly non-dramatic as I recall, more of a ""hey just to let you know, can you use something other than jap because it's not a nice word to Japanese"" 2. She has a zillion followers and felt the need to zero in on one of her followers and target them (that's pretty low) unnecessarily when she probably could have used this as a learning point or, not said anything at all and let it be 3. She negatively reacted to posts who agreed that it was important to be culturally aware and then did not stop people from going completely a-wall (ex: I remember that my jaw dropped when I read a reply that read ""jap jap jap jap jap jap jap"" and she had nothing negative to say about that or those which put the corrector's character down, I believe she herself was also placing claims on the person's character at one point which I didn't think was fair) yet kept contradicting herself by saying things like it's good to learn something new everyday. And why, if she ""learned"" that new something, would she think that it makes sense to keep using the word over and over again? All of this overreacting and over dramatizing from an individual who spends many of her blog and instagram posts producing recipes or using ingredients which are inherently Japanese."

Going by the fact that she copy/pastes info about the food she supposedly cooks, and admits in the post she was ""busy"" (lazy teehee) she doesn't have much of an idea of what Japanese culture was/is like. I have uncles who lived through WWII and in no way whatsoever would I say ""Jap"" at all in front of them. They fought for the right to live in the province they lived in, before the war. They fought for the right to live in a country that doubted them. And they stayed here, amongst ridicule and efforts to make them leave.   There's a lot more western bastardization of stuff. Geisha are not prostitutes. They study long and hard to master dancing, shamisen, just general humour.   ""Jap"" was a word used by American soldiers to conquer their fear of an unknown soldier. Quick to say quick to kill.   I guess. I'm just the daughter of a Japanese person during WWII."

Which I had to do some research myself on, because he didn't have any answers when I asked him about exercises to help.    Asked a physical therapist which actually gave good info and exercises, and didn't need me to come in 3x a week to help.

Sweden believes that when you treat people like monsters, that's who you get, and are far more interested in rehabilitation than revenge. I would assume that with his community service, he will also be receiving treatment/counselling.   They might even be successful in turning him into a functional member of society. Someone who has been locked in a maximum security facility and treated like an animal is not going to magically understand how to be a person.   The other thing is that Sweden's system is working, they have very low rates of recidivism, less than half that of the USA, and they also don't consider 18yrlds to be old enough to make the kind of decisions that lead to jail, and do everything they can to keep youths out of prison.

The only, and believe me, ONLY reason you think rape is wrong is because your society and culture tells you so. There have been many cultures and societies where it's common and acceptable. I don't think I could ever accept female genital mutilation, and I would have thought that I would inherently know this was wrong, but that's not true, cultures who do it not only think it is right, but a morally good thing to do. This is probably the most anti-rape we have ever been. Good for us! But also, because we're civilized human beings, is it not possible to see that this was not of the same level of ""evil"" as if it was done by someone who had been taught since birth how totally unacceptable rape is? Don't ya think? And that maybe this makes it even more likely that it can be prevented from happening again with a little treatment/education?"

The alternative seems to be that the girl and everyone else pays taxes to keep him in a cage for as long as possible, before eventually unleashing what would then undoubtedly be a monster on society.   I suppose it's a shift in the purpose of punishment. Is it revenge, or is it to teach someone not to commit more crimes? Because the US prison system has roughly a 60% rate of recidivism, compared to roughly 30% in Sweden.   Less revenge= Less rape. Arn't we in favour of less rape??"

rage,3cta3t,Infinitezen,10,Fri Jul 10 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"It may have a ""lower"" re-offending rate, but it still has one.  I'm all for treatment and rehab for most crimes, but this person is dangerous to society, period.  Treat him, but also keep him under lock and key, house arrest at the very least.  It's one thing when a shoplifter or drug user re-offends, it's quite different when a violent rapist does it as it costs someone else their life and dignity.  That should be prevented by all costs."
rage,3cta3t,Masiajade,-3,Fri Jul 10 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, lets say that rape is the kind of crime than henceforth is worthy of a loss of all freedom forever. Except I don't actually know of a country where the punishment for rape is death/life in prison.   I think in NZ, it's somewhere around 10 years, but you'd only serve half of that, unless you'd done it many times. A quick google leads me to believe that the average served time for rape in the US is only 5 years.   So now our rapist is out of jail before this girl is even 18. And he's not better, or sorry, he's just meaner and more resentful. How has society been served? Who has won? It's just been an expensive exercise in making a problem worse.   Edit- One more thing, high sentences for rape are actually more dangerous for women, because it provides an incentive to murder your rape victims. If the penalty is nearly the same, or the same, or in some countries- higher, one good way to prevent being caught for raping someone is to stop them from being able to talk. So victims are not being served at any point in the punishment, except for the false feeling that the rapist was ""taught a lesson""."
rage,3cta3t,Lord_King_Jimmy,3,Fri Jul 10 23:02:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is going to be better, or sorry, after such a pathetic sentence for such a horrific crime.  The likelihood of this guy being a valued member of society is very low, the likelihood that he could seriously hurt someone else is high enough to take seriously.  He should be given rehabilitation, but this sentence is a slap on the wrist at best.  Think of how the victim and their family must feel hearing a sentence like that.  It pretty much spits in their face and pours salt in their already open wound.  I'm not against your system and I in fact support it for the most part, but this is just too far.  It begs for vigilante justice and undermines peoples faith in law enforcement."

Aaaaaaaalso, having looked up those people, we're not really talking about a serial killer here. In fact, we are not talking about serial killers. Interestingly, New Zealand has never had a serial killer. Ever. Sweden has only had two, both of whom were sentenced to closed psychiatric treatment- one was released only to die, the other remains there. Serial killers are a whole different kettle of fish, one that is remarkably common in the USA, and other countries with harsh penalties. So... how do harsh penalties protect society?  Three examples is not enough to justify a rate of re offending that is double that of a different system. Its anecdotal. And silly, because serial killers are broken- they can't be fixed. Perhaps if they had been treated instead of locked up the first time, a professional might have seen that they were psychopaths, and less people would be dead."

Here's what the frontal lobe does- It's pretty crucial when talking about committing crimes or not committing crimes..  ""The function of the frontal lobe involves the ability to project future consequences resulting from current actions, the choice between good and bad actions (or better and best), the override and suppression of socially unacceptable responses, and the determination of similarities and differences between things or events.""

rage,3cu00e,Angry_Nutrition,6,Fri Jul 10 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the documentary yet, because I don't know how long it is, so I don't know if I will want to take the time right now, but I may watch it later.  Either way, I am blind. I'm not sure about mental disabilities, but as far as blindness goes, the biggest problems we face from the public aren't abuse like being bullied or made fun of, it's being treated like a child. Someone wants to force you to do what they are certain is best for you, because they assume that you are disabled and therefore unable to figure this out for yourself. You'll notice that fully able-bodied people do something they shouldn't, they might be advised not to, but if they choose to do it, no one forcibly stops them. they simply suffer the natural consequences, but if a disabled person does this, someone attempts to make them act right or even just normal. What they're doing might not even be wrong, it just isn't normal, but someone will try to make them change.  This happens whether you're blind, deaf, or you have a developmental problem that might actually make it hard to understand certain things.  The next big one is a misunderstanding about abilities. Both of these are things that many people do without really thinking about it, but if they did, they would likely change their behavior. I am only blind, and it's good to keep that in mind.   I remember when I was looking for apartments. If I mentioned my blindness over the phone, I would sometimes get the question, ""Can you climb stairs?"" It's obvious I can climb stairs, my eyes are the only thing that don't work. I think what happens is that many people automaticly mentally translate the word blind to disabled. Disabled can mean anything from blindness to trouble walking and even retardation. Without thinking, people lump blind people in with people with other disabilities.  This makes it hard to find a job. If someone meets you in person, it does help, because aside from my eyes, which are always closed, I don't look or sound disabled."
rage,3cu00e,simpleman84,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:38:13 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. People become what other people think of them and blind people have a much harder time since people assume they always need help and pity.   I listened to a wonderful radiolab podcast recently that starred a blind person who was able to use ecolocation to do tons of things that sighted people could do, such as hiking and climbing trees. He lamented how helpless other blind people can feel despite their potentials. Society tends to make people think they're truly disabled and unable to be relatively ""normal"", and the people eventually believe it. It's sad really."
rage,3cu00e,simpleman84,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it is sad, but what kind of makes it worse is that the person talking really believes this person is highly disabled, and they may not know much about being blind, especially if they are born that way. They have no reason to question someone they trust, so they learn that they are disabled. I have always said that, generally speaking, not in all circumstances but many, that treating a person as disabled actually makes them more-so.  Echolocation is a grate tool, but it's important to be careful not to think it works for everything. I watched a documentary once about a kid who used it for all of his mobility, and he learned that he could help himself much more affectively by using a cane. He crossed a street with a cane, and there was a hole in the middle of the road. His echolocation didn't indicate that to him.  Some blind people feel self-conscious. They don't want to have a cane with them, because they think it makes them look more disabled.  The president of the Indiana affiliate of the National Federation of the Blind, Ron Brown, tells a story about when he was in college.  He felt that way, so he tried to use the sounds around him and echolocation to navigate. Once, he approached a hall leading to some stairs. The hall was quiet, so he didn't think anyone was there. He made his clicking noises and didn't notice any obstructions, but as he proceeded down it, he tripped over a pair of legs. He crossed the hall. Classes often came out in to thehall to read in a relaxed position, so he simply used the other side. There were people there too. He tripped over legs all the way down the hall until he reached the stairs. Finally, he was ready to go down the stairs, and a guy approaches him and says, ""It's okay man, I've been there. You must be on some good stuff. Can I have some?""  Needless to say, he was fine using his cane after that."

The only other option is to put them with their dad, which they refuse to even have lunch with, so ship them off and wait a few months and I dare say they'll only be too happy to have lunch with dad.

We are amazed by the cosplay community and even more.  We send you HUGE THANK YOU.  We receive actually lot of messages...help...support....LOVE. We try to answer fast but it is hard, a new message or comment is coming as soon as we answered one!  All of you today gave us the confirmation that we are like a family, everyone spraid love for cosplay, and bring a big support. We will never forget your lovely words, the faith you communicate us.  French friend create a crowdfunding...it is insane...We never thought something like that will be done for us... we are just "" hobbyists"" but it seems everyone in the cosplay community and even more are sad or concerned with the destruction of our costumes.  We feel all the kindness in your warm words, we feel terribly sad and happy in the same time...because all is broken and because all of you give us so much love...  A big thank you for being so kind and worried about us. We cry of happiness, you gave us faith in humanity. We can't stop...people told us "" please, continue to make us dream!""  We can't stop. We know it is hard to find motivation after seeing all of our favorite costumes destroyed but we feel stronger now again thanks to you.  We saw talented people we follow like Yaya Han, Kamui, Yuegene and SOOO many friends, cosplayers, monster hunter players share the status...  All of you root for us... it is completely crazy.  We will use your donations in order to repair some costumes.  -We will redo War's sword, all armors and boots.   We will repair the felyne Legendary anchor, redo the feather hat, put a new armor decoration on it, redo the wheel ( all the spikes are broken), the pirate's hat and props, the sewing part. We will redo the Reginleiv costumes and Odin. Gabranth cape, helmet and swords.   We will create the planned costumes for and thanks to you. A dedication and grateful work for you.  We will do our best and put our energy at maximal level. Each costume will be a part of you, so we must do the best we can, you deserved it, you gave us more than "" money"", you show us love.  We feel honored and terribly uneasy at the same time, because we are modest and to see the amount of money is...yes uneasy. It is really hard to find the words for describe how we feel, but we found faith in humanity thank to all of you.  We will answer every message so please, be patient. Best regards, Shoko and Jérôme.   TL;DR The community has given them lots of support and they are even receiving donations. They are going to remake some costumes that were destroyed.

rage,3cjka5,ChangloriousOne,39,Wed Jul 8 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"The explanation here is very shady.  People don't just go around putting holes in roofs unless told to do so by someone and if they do, you are generally instructed to move your stuff out when construction happens.  What I think happened here was that they fucked up.  I think they were told to do something and they either didn't understand it because of the language barrier or they just plain didn't do it.  Now it looks like they are trying to milk money from the community to pay for their mistake.  Prove me wrong.  Tell us why the hole was put in the roof, show us where things were being stored and explain why they still need community money."

Either way, it's fairly common for people to leave a bunch of old crap knowing that the contractors will have to haul it to the dumpster to do their work.

Negligence doesn't cause things to be removed from their covers. They didn't just not move them properly, this is clearly destruction of property.  The owners have every right to sue, and will win. They will get the cost of materials back, but unfortunately will not get compensation for all the years spent making them or the memories they lost. From the first picture, if that's everything that was destroyed, that's easily several thousand dollars, possibly $10,000+ and well beyond small claims court.  If the workers entered the property illegally, or began construction without notice, that's even more penalty. They easily will get enough back to get their next project started right away."

Actually, many of the things mentioned can be bought 2nd hand, like the microwave and computers."
rage,3cl8m2,MekkoLove,6,Thu Jul 9 10:59:59 2015 UTC,I've gotten a microwave for $5 at a thrift store. So yeah I can see how these items can be obtained. And apartments and low income housing (here they call hud  as a govt housing) all have stoves and refrigerators
rage,3cl8m2,ashnharm02,25,Thu Jul 9 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"Have these guys actually TRIED to live without these things in modern America? Do you know how much more expensive your life is if you can't refrigerate or microwave shit?  And you pretty much can't get a job these days without some sort of a phone, computer or vehicle since so many job applications are online, they sort of have to call you if you got the damn job and one of the first qualifying questions they'll ask is if you have a reliable means of transportation to and from work.   Also, did they really try to say poor people aren't poor because they were able to eat most of the time in the last year? Seriously?"
rage,3cl8m2,pillowlips,4,Wed Jul 8 22:05:55 2015 UTC,"Do you know how much more expensive your life is if you can't refrigerate or microwave shit?   I agree about refrigeration, but living without a microwave isn't that big of a deal. I've lived without one for years now, mainly because it's not built into my kitchen and we don't really have a place to put it. If we would just put it on the kitchen counter, losing that counter space would probably be a bigger annoyance than not having a microwave.  My previous apartment didn't have a regular oven and that was way more annoying. There's almost always an easy alternative to microwaving food, but there's just no alternative to baking stuff in an oven."
rage,3cl8m2,oompaloempia,2,Thu Jul 9 00:06:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I personally don't use my microwave very much anymore, but they're so cheap to buy used and they can be really handy when you need a last minute filling healthy breakfast and you throw in some instant oatmeal or whatever, you know? Or if you have a 10 minute break between jobs to grab a quick bite so you heat up some leftovers instead of buying fast food. I could more than likely live without it, but it was something cheap that makes it easier for me to make financially smarter decisions as far as my eating habits in the long run, so it kind of peeves me that they're acting like this is a big deal.   Just like, why do they feel this need to belittle the situation of the poor?"
rage,3cl8m2,pillowlips,9,Thu Jul 9 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"I have lived without refrigeration. Thankfully because I live in the north, I can keep stuff in the car or cold rooms to keep them cold (or sometimes straight up frozen solid). During the summer though, you might need to eat lots of nuts, grains, and dried fruit instead.  Not saying that refrigeration is an unnecessary luxury, they're obviously stupid. But it is possible to survive without refrigeration. It just sucks."
rage,3cl8m2,Gizortnik,6,Wed Jul 8 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"I live down in the south so I can't say what its like up north but down here I cannot imagine living without a fridge. I don't make a lot of money so I do try to eat as frugally and healthy as I can. I have lived in a place with only A/C units which I usually tried not to use because it would run the electricity bill up so freaking much. I couldn't even keep bananas or apples out on the counter because the heat would spoil them so freaking fast, especially when we had heat streaks of 90-100+ degrees outside. It also seriously impacted my quality of life. I spent so much money just trying to stay vaguely comfortable. The heat would make me incredibly lethargic and the smallest task like getting up to grab a supply across the room felt like moving through molasses. I would keep a giant pitcher of water in the fridge so I'd at least have something hydrating and cheap to cool me down.   It just makes me so angry that they're acting like  'oh poor people are just being whiny look they have all these nice things they are total liars most of them even get to eat some of the time what fakers!'   when in reality most of its probably second hand stuff they got for cheap just to try and find some small bit of relief from their situation."
rage,3cl8m2,pillowlips,2,Thu Jul 9 01:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are certain places you really can't live comfortably without A/C or refrigeration. It can be done but it's absolute garbage.  Like I said, if the temperatures not bad (like in the north sometimes, say under 80) you're fruits won't spoil too quickly, especially if kept in the shade. But mostly, you're going to want to have breads nuts, and dried fruit/veggies which will be fairly impossible to spoil by temperature alone. As for the lethargy, there isn't much you can do at that point beyond altering your sleep and movement schedule. Best bet is to just literally not do much in the hardest part of the day and do most of the work in mornings, evenings, and nights. How that works with your job though...  Rest assured, if any of those people who say ""the poor don't need refrigerators"" actually lived like that, they'd probably be trying to eat each other by the end of the week."

You get charged the lowest rate for your first 450 kWh used during the monthly billing period.  You get charged a slightly higher rate for the next 135 kWh used.  The price jumps significantly for the next 315 kWh used to incentivize people to try not to use more than 585 kWh per month.  The price is even higher for the 4th tier.  The pricing gets reset after every billing period and every billing period starts with you being charged the Tier 1 price.  Basically more power you use, the more you pay per kWh.  The image that you linked to shows that at least 1/3 of your parents energy usage in that billing period was at the Tier 4 price, meaning that they used a lot of power that month."

From Wiki:   Terrorism is commonly defined as violent acts (or the threat of violent acts) intended to create fear (terror), perpetrated for an economic,[1] religious, political, or ideological goal, and which deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Another common definition sees terrorism as political, ideological or religious violence by non-state actors. Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group.    From the FBI:  https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/terrorism/terrorism-definition  From the US Legal Code:  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331  From Merriam-Webster (for a vernacular definition)   the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion    Your description of:   They ignore the system and choose to destroy things instead of working against something they dont like.   seems more like ""violent anti-establishment"" or ""violent anarchism"", but their goals probably don't fit the normal definition of anarchism."

The problem isn't the customers that stiff the waiter, the problem is that companies refuse to pay their workers a livable wage.   When I go to restaurants I tip because I have been there done that, but at the same time I can understand if people don't feel like tipping, it shouldn't be up to them to take on payroll for the restaurant."
rage,3ch8fk,zohmg,4,Wed Jul 8 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, the restaurant is required to provide you with wages if you do not meet minimum.  However, lets say in a 2 week period you are below min by $150.  If say the next 2 weeks you make $100 over the threshold, the restaurant can re-coupe what they had to give you the last pay period and will keep that $100 as well as garnish you on the next pay period for $50.  The restaurant essentially gives the waiter a loan to make up for not paying them enough.  It's a terrible industry."

If you do not tip, they still pay that percentage.   And sorry but a server isn't ""there to serve"" they are there to make fucking money, like anyone else doing a fucking job. They get $2.13 an hour because we have a tipping dependent culture. Just because you don't like that doesn't make you less of a dick if you don't tip.  If you take offense to that, tip your server.

rage,3ch8fk,pillowlips,4,Wed Jul 8 07:01:19 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, there is a minimum wage. However, they don't base it off of what you made that specific night. They look at your collective earnings throughout the week.   For example, If I averaged out to like, $9 an hour one night but then the next night I only averaged out to $5 an hour, they would combine those two nights and say I made enough.   If it ended up averaging out that I made the 'minimum wage' in that time period, they wouldn't pay me any extra. Not to mention most servers pay checks end up being eaten away by taxes to the point where them averaging you out to minimum wage means you just put more in to your taxes.   TL;DR: if you 'don't tip because you don't support the system', your basically stealing from tips they made the other night.   If you want to protest the system, continue to tip your server/stop eating out and call your local government as well as the corporate offices of the establishments you're eating at. Your server is completely powerless to change this."

rage,3ch8fk,pillowlips,2,Wed Jul 8 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"I have:    Worked clothing retail.  Worked at a grocery store.  Worked at a Chick-fil-A Worked as a carhop at a sonic worked at a costume shop for a university worked at a Pizza hut as a CSR Worked as a server   I currently work as a bartender. I have NEVER done harder work than serving. While you may 'think' being in the kitchen is harder than serving, I ask, how often do people in the kitchen deal with the actual guest of the restaurants? Typically not at all. As a server, I have to know how all the food is cooked as well as what is in it. I have to know how all the drinks are made and whats in them. I have to know if its gluten free, dairy free, low calorie, low carb etc etc. I have to remember what drink everyone at a table had when they all want refills and I have to be able to balance 8 plates on one arm because some dude just stopped me to hand me his check.   I have to remember which table wanted extra napkins, extra ketchup etc etc. I have to pretend I'm not annoyed by the screaming child throwing fries at me or creeped out by the old man hitting on me. I have to memorize a persons order when they flag me down to place their order even though they can see that my hands are full to bursting with another tables dirty plates.  Even though I tip out bussers and runners, I still have to take all my own shit out whenever possible to try and prevent orders being wrong or that side of fries not being crispy enough because even if I did my end of the job right, if someone delivering the food or making the food messes up, it will only effect my income.   I literally had to stop serving because it was destroying my joints. I had to lift so many heavy trays and try to balance them on one arm that my shoulder developed bursitis and on occasion I can't lift my right arm up without extreme pain.   Co-workers of mine wear fit bits to work and clock in 15-20 miles a shift just doing their damn job.   I currently bartend and it astounds me how people are so much nicer to me than when I was a server. People will seriously take their anger out on the server. I have been yelled at, called names and bitched out for things I have no control over. People won't look you in the eye, won't listen when you talk to them and you have to take the blame when anything goes wrong with their order even if its not your fault. If you make a small mistake like forgetting a mustard when you're trying to take care of your 15-20 separate tables, suddenly you're satan and you are just TRYING to ruin their meal.   So I'm sorry, but while working in the kitchen is in fact a hard job, it is not something you can compare to serving.   Kitchen: hot, sweaty, repetitive fast paced work.   Serving: Dealing with people, hot, sweaty, fast paced, requires extreme mental focus.  You can't compare working in a kitchen to serving.   And I'm not saying waiters make less than minimum wage, but I am saying they do maximum work.   Unless you've actually worked as a server and had to depend on it to survive, you really cant act like you know what you're talking about."

Nothing stops a server from taking time off.  If they work one night and make 500$ they can request the next two/three/however many days off.  The only difference is the other guys know up front they will make up the time where a server has to ""make up the time"" ahead of time (think comp time but for wages).   Because that person would get paid overtime, while servers typically wont due to loopholes in the system?   Servers do get paid overtime pay.  Refer to the FLSA for details on how to properly calculate overtime pay for a server.   Because they use the complication of cash tips, credit card tips and base pay as another loophole to get around actually paying minimum wage, as it is much harder to track and make sure they're paying you correctly?    I'm not arguing that the system isn't irritating.  Hell I even have contacted my local/state government to complain about the fact that tipping is still a thing in the restaurant industry.  Cash tips are to be reported by the server.  Credit card tips are actually quite easy to calculate as there is a rather simple paper trail to follow..  It's very simple math really.    (Base Pay/hr + Tips)/Hours Worked >= Minimum Wage - If this is not true, you are due compensation under the tipping credit.   Because a server rarely if ever is doing minimum wage level of work?    This one I struggle with... what, in your mind, constitutes minimum wage work?  Fast food? Is that it? I'd very much argue that being a server is unskilled labor and should be paid as such.  Is it hard? Sure.  Is it something that should be paid $15 an hour? No way.    Because that means every second you aren't getting tipped, you're loosing the tips you worked your ass of for the night before?   In the end you still make at least minimum wage for your two week period.  Yes some nights suck.  But, in the long haul youre doing fine.  Sources: FLSA, restaurant experience."
rage,3ch8fk,pillowlips,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"That doesn't change the fact that no one who takes that job is doing it as a minimum wage job. Most servers I know do it for a living, not as a part time after school job. They are trying to feed their children, pay off college debt or in general just trying to get by while they pursue some other passion. If I worked 40 hours a week with minimum wage, I'd only pull in around $14,000. That is almost impossible to survive off of.   I've worked minimum wage jobs at several establishments. Serving was way too hard to get paid the same as I did putting a shirt on a hanger and then putting that on a rack.   And sure, its easy to say you're totally averaging out to minimum wage, but myself and a few other servers have caught them NOT paying us minimum wage due to what they claimed was 'a system error' because our pay checks are typically so low ($0-20) most of us don't even notice if they don't average us out and instead keep us on $2.13 hourly. Our company ONLY allows us to view our paystubs if we go to their website on internet explorer (which most computers don't even have anymore and mine personally won't even let me download). You can't access it on any other browser, so unless I made a trip to the library every month (using the gas I payed for, so basically burning my money to make sure I got the right money) I honestly have no way of comparing what work they claimed I did and what work I actually did. If you don't have automatic deposit set up to your bank account, they give you a paycard instead of an actual check so all you ever see is what ended up in your bank account. When it automatically deposits in to my account, it doesn't show me what was taken out for taxes or anything, so that ""simple little equation"" of yours doesn't really work that well. You didn't even factor in things like tip out, either, which means a percentage of what I made has been taken away and given to bussers, hostesses and bartenders.   I've had friends get fired for complaining about this from other establishments so I know it isn't just a single company that does this.   Also, where I work they get out of paying us overtime by having us classified as 'entertainment' workers, not food service so that argument doesn't work either. There are plenty of loopholes for servers.   I'm not saying servers should be paid $15 an hour and I never did so stop pulling things out of your ass on that.   They should, however, have a decent base pay to reflect the amount of labor they do, with tips only being a reflection of good service. Since that isn't the system we live in, however, people still need to tip accordingly and stop acting like its fine because hey servers will still make minimum wage!  And as far as 'doing fine' in the long run...I will always have a fucked up shoulder and wrist from carrying all those trays so physically, no, I won't. Financially, do you even realize how HARD it is to get by on 'minimum wage'? Especially when you can never predict how many hours you will be graced with that week or month. Several places have times of the year when they get exceptionally busy so they'll hire on several more servers, meaning hours get drastically cut. If you're already barely scraping by, how are you supposed to save up to prepare for that?   I really don't see how you benefit from trivializing serving and insulting the work done. While it could be classified as unskilled, I know plenty of people who simply couldn't handle the work being done. It is incredibly stressful and physically demanding work.   I too have restaurant experience, but I also have the life experience of having to try and live off of minimum/serving wages and it honestly pisses me off when people use 'averaging out' as an excuse to be a shitty person and not tip."
rage,3ch8fk,nedlinin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"You're right it doesn't change the fact that making minimum wage is barely (if at all) liveable in the US.  But that does not mean waiters deserve more than minimum wage.  Yes the work is hard but I'd much, much rather be a waiter than a warehouse guy working in a hot warehouse all day lifting 50+ lbs boxes all day while also getting minimum wage.   Serving was way too hard to get paid the same as I did putting a shirt on a hanger and then putting that on a rack.   While one is harder maybe they both are very much unskilled labor.  I can't think of a good analogy of the top of my head but this just isn't a valid argument.  There aren't enough of the cushier jobs to go around, simple as that.  Some people get lucky, some don't.     And sure, its easy to say you're totally averaging out to minimum wage, but myself and a few other servers have caught them NOT paying us minimum wage due to what they claimed was 'a system error' because our pay checks are typically so low ($0-20) most of us don't even notice if they don't average us out and instead keep us on $2.13 hourly. Our company ONLY allows us to view our paystubs if we go to their website on internet explorer (which most computers don't even have anymore and mine personally won't even let me download).   Two issues here.  First, it's your duty to report them.  It's not that they aren't breaking the law it's that no one has reported them so they haven't gotten caught yet.  Report them and collect what you are owed. Second, the bit about Internet Explorer?  Well, thats just a falsehood.  IE comes preinstalled on each and every Windows machine sold in the US.  Now, I'll totally believe their crappy website requires IE to view but saying you can't get to it because you can't get a machine with IE is just a blatant lie.  Source: I'm a web developer by trade.  Literally this is what I get paid for.   You didn't even factor in things like tip out, either, which means a percentage of what I made has been taken away and given to bussers, hostesses and bartenders.   This is factored in.  Its in the variable called ""Tips"".  It is literally your total amount of income which has come from tips.  If you get tipped 2 dollars and 1 dollar goes to other tipped employees, that ""Tips"" value is 1 dollar.  It is how much you,/u/pillowlips takes home from the tips received.     I've had friends get fired for complaining about this from other establishments so I know it isn't just a single company that does this.   Use proper channels to file complaints.  They are anonymous. http://www.dol.gov/wecanhelp/faq.htm   Also, where I work they get out of paying us overtime by having us classified as 'entertainment' workers, not food service so that argument doesn't work either. There are plenty of loopholes for servers.   This is not a ""loophole"" persay.  Depends on where you actually work.  But, the DOL establishes a pretty straight forward definition for restaurant and, if you fall within that definition, you are entitled to overtime pay.  Report it.  http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs2.htm   I'm not saying servers should be paid $15 an hour and I never did so stop pulling things out of your ass on that.   I was using the number as an example.  If not $15, what would you find acceptable?  10? 12? 8?     They should, however, have a decent base pay to reflect the amount of labor they do, with tips only being a reflection of good service. Since that isn't the system we live in, however, people still need to tip accordingly and stop acting like its fine because hey servers will still make minimum wage!   This is true of all labor, not just waiters.  We are in agreement there.  However, if literally everyone stopped tipping tomorrow the government safety net would kick in and guarantee you min wage.  If half the people stop, you're still guaranteed min wage.  If no one stops, you're still guaranteed min wage.  So, they aren't wrong even if you disagree with the logic.   And as far as 'doing fine' in the long run...I will always have a fucked up shoulder and wrist from carrying all those trays so physically, no, I won't. Financially, do you even realize how HARD it is to get by on 'minimum wage'?    Sorry to hear that but that, again, is not unique to food service.  Any minimum wage worker at McDonalds, a warehouse or anywhere else could have the same issues.  And in those cases, they don't have the ability to make more than min wage because most of their employers require they turn down tips.  It's a trade off.  And, yes, I do know how hard it is.  I took 10-12 hours of college courses for 6 years straight while working for min wage (well, technically 10 cents higher if I'm being completely truthful).  It's not fun.  But, again, not unique to food service industry so I'm not sure what your point is here.  Once again I am not arguing anything at all about whether the min wage is fair or not but simply that waiters are going to get min wage no matter what happens in the way of tips.   Especially when you can never predict how many hours you will be graced with that week or month. Several places have times of the year when they get exceptionally busy so they'll hire on several more servers, meaning hours get drastically cut. If you're already barely scraping by, how are you supposed to save up to prepare for that?   I suggest you try your hand at Walmart.  Or Target.  Or a movie theater.  Oh wait.. they all have this same thing happening.  Again, not unique to the food service industry.   I really don't see how you benefit from trivializing serving and insulting the work done. While it could be classified as unskilled, I know plenty of people who simply couldn't handle the work being done. It is incredibly stressful and physically demanding work.   I did and said nothing to trivialize the work.  I simply stated it was unskilled labor.  I could do it tomorrow without any real training.  Can you take one of the waiters and put them at my desk at work and have them write the web application I am working on?  Exactly.  That's the whole definition of unskilled labor.  And, lots of jobs are stressful... like.. lots of them.  I used to work on medical equipment.  What do you think is more stressful?  Knowing if you fuck up you could literally kill someone or getting yelled at because you forgot someones cheese?  From experience: Option A.   I too have restaurant experience, but I also have the life experience of having to try and live off of minimum/serving wages and it honestly pisses me off when people use 'averaging out' as an excuse to be a shitty person and not tip.   I, too, have the experience of both.  And, believe it or not, I'm a well above average tipper (20% min generally.. unless they were truly awful).  Again, whether you agree with their actions or not, their logic is sound: You will get at least minimum wage if they don't tip.  Lastly, I know very few servers that actually made minimum wage.  Most, even at lower end places like Red Robin for example, were making 10-12+ an hour over a two week time period."
rage,3ch8fk,pillowlips,0,Sun Jul 12 22:18:45 2015 UTC,"ok first off, not how tip out works.   Tip out is not subtracted from your tips, but from your total food sales. If you've 'worked as a waiter' before as you claim, you'd know this.   Second; sure hours fluctuate at Walmart and Target...but both of those jobs also pay above minimum wage.   Third: I have a Macbook. I cannot download IE. I do not have access to a windows computer with IE unless I drive to a library.   Fourth: Why exactly are you arguing about this? If you think minimum wage isn't enough, why are you arguing that its ok because servers still make minimum wage at the end of the day? I genuinely don't get your logic."
rage,3ch8fk,oompaloempia,2,Mon Jul 13 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"So, a question for you. What would you do if I asked for the bill and said ""please include the gratuity into the bill""? Would you be able to do that or not?  It seems like this would solve most of the problems with tipping. It would make it easier for the customer, and the waiter would be assured he's getting paid what he's expecting. Also, this is a way of protesting against the system of tips that doesn't make you an asshole (I think?)."
rage,3ch8fk,Asddsa76,2,Wed Jul 8 15:54:56 2015 UTC,Don't most receipts already have an extra line under total that shows what total+suggested tip is?

rage,3ch8fk,pillowlips,2,Wed Jul 8 19:24:17 2015 UTC,Actually the best way to protest would be to call the company or (if you're an American) your local governments and complain.

When I turn in my tips at the end of the night, the computer makes a giant master copy of all my credit card transactions, my manager checks them to make sure I claimed the tips people actually put down and then it is analyzed for sales/other numbers, put in a giant stack for later reference (like, if someone calls to say they got charged too much or whatever) and then it is never seen again. Automatic gratuity looks exactly like regular tips to the computer. No one beyond low level peons will see your actual receipt or know that you asked to include your gratuity. It will do genuinely nothing."

Signs of walking drunk, drooling, vomiting, seizuring, and excessive thirst and urination may be seen.  Stage 2: This occurs within 12-24 hours post-exposure, and clinical signs seen to “resolve” when in fact more severe internal injury is still occurring.  Stage 3: In cats, this stage occurs 12-24 hours after ethylene glycol exposure. In dogs, this stage occurs 36-72 hours post-ingestion. During this stage, severe acute kidney failure is occuring.

rage,3cci5k,buckyVanBuren,133,Mon Jul 6 21:16:03 2015 UTC,"Okay... Just to be a rational voice here...  http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/cheese.asp  These alarming warnings about food items booby-trapped with nails being left in dog parks  began circulating on social media sites in October 2011, usually accompanied by a photo depicting a handful of cubes of cheese that had nails run through them. The photo did come from a July 2011 news story about such an event, which reported that a dog walker in Centennial Park had discovered the nail-laced treats on the floor of a nearby kennel. However, that incident occurred in Buenos Aires, Argentina, not in the U.S.   At the time this warning began circulating, we found no evidence that cheese embedded with nails had been discovered in Chicago or Massachusetts, or in any other U.S. dog park. It is true, however, that discoveries of similar booby-trapped food items have been reported in the U.S. and elsewhere:  In October 2011, about two weeks after the photo of the nail-laden cheese began circulating online, two pieces of meat that had several framing nails ""loosely attached"" to their underside were reportedly found at the Buchanan Park dog park in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  Similarly, in January 2013 UK news sources reported the discovery of several dozen cocktail sausages spiked with nails at a popular dog-walking spot in Abergavenny, South Wales:   In January 2013, residents of Canton, Michigan, reported finding pieces of meat and fish with pins and needles inserted into them in their neighborhood; two dogs underwent surgery to remove needles they swallowed while ingesting pieces of sausage found on the ground.  In July 2003, eight dogs died and at least sixteen more fell ill after visiting Laurelhurst Park in Portland, Oregon, where they were believed to have ingested contaminated pieces of meat or sausage. (The residents of that area were then engaged in a dispute between pet owners who felt dogs should be free to roam that park and others who felt the city's leash law should be enforced there.)  As for the claim that ""antifreeze is being found in doggie water bowls,"" we also found no reports confirming that as having happened in an Augusta, Maine, dog park at the time. It is also true, however, that antifreeze-laced water and treats have reportedly been left in doggie parks before:   In 2009, cupcakes that had been injected with antifreeze were left out for the dogs who frequented Poplar Park in Port Perry (a town within commuting distance of Toronto, Canada). In 2008, 6 pooches were felled (2 fatally) by antifreeze left in buckets of water in an off-leash area of High Park in Toronto. Antifreeze is not the only poison that has been used: in 2004 in an off-leash area of Withrow Park in Toronto, 16 dogs were poisoned after ingesting chunks of hot dogs spiked with a rare pesticide.  In September 2012, Boston Police arrested a landscaper suspected of soaking pieces of hot dogs in antifreeze and leaving them spread out on grass for pets to eat (allegedly because he was disgruntled with dog owners who didn't clean up after their pets).  In January 2013, a dog owner in Tigard, Oregon, reported that his dog became ill after drinking a suspicious substance ""resembling green anti-freeze"" from a bowl hidden behind a culvert at the Ash Avenue Dog Park.  In July 2013, dog owners in San Francisco were warned to be cautious after a canine in that city became seriously ill, with the suspected cause being one of a number of poisoned meatballs found throughout the area (although it is as yet unclear whether the meatballs were part of a deliberate plot to harm pet dogs)  Pet owners in San Francisco are on high alert after one dog became seriously ill from eating what appears to be a poisoned meatball. Veterinarians are now warning owners to keep an eye out for some serious symptoms.   A 7-year-old dachshund named Oskar was rushed to the vet after eating one of the meatballs. Dr. Carrie Journey says his symptoms are consistent with strychnine poisoning.   ""This is a very rapidly absorbed toxin,"" she said. ""This is something that gets in the system within 10 to 15 minutes. So it's important that people act quickly and get to a veterinarian ASAP if they think their dog has eaten something.""   But Oskar may not be the only victim. Another dog is showing symptoms of strychnine poisoning, which includes agitation, hyper-reactivity to light and noise, and seizures.   And here's the big concern for dog owners — dozens of similar meatballs, stuffed with pellets, are being found all across the city. This includes neighborhoods like Diamond Heights, Twin Peaks, Cole Valley, and lower Haight.   Veterinarians say strychnine poisoning is not that uncommon in pets. It's often used in food to get rid of skunks, coyotes, and raccoons, and can be ingested unintentionally by other animals.

Rarely anyone wanted to join Hitler to kill the jews, they joined him in the quest to make Germany a better pace. You have to know that Germany at that time was not the nicest place to live in, Inflation everywhere, no jobs, people couldn't afford a loaf of bread for the family. It was basically the great depression sponsored by zimbabwe dollars. Hitler actually saved and united a country at that point, he WAS the knight in shining armor. When he was in power and a few other power hungry fuck up's joined him, it was lots of small changes in politics, changes that most people didn't realise can have bad consequences. If you think about it: the changes were so small even the jews didn't realise them, otherwise they would have left. Anyway at one point the commoners found themselves in a system where they had two choices: Fight and kill for a system they didn't believe in or get shot in the head and that includes the own family. Might be shocking for you, but most people decided to stay alive and support their family.  And about the video: It's fucked up, it's not normal, not in Germany not anywhere.

I do understand that people can come very close to their own breaking point by taking care of someone who doesn't appreciate it, but that might not even be the case in that video. That girl and that boy certainly don't have the mental requirements to take care of a human being in the same way you (/u/ENTP) should not be in charge of international politics."

You do know that women are 51% of the population, right?"
rage,3caov3,whatwouldbuffydo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't say that they're lying because they may have had a different experience with women than I have. That's why I used the word ""probably"" in my reply.   Like I said before, my statement about girls seeking attention isn't backed up by any studies or science. If you actually open your eyes and look though, it becomes apparent that women look for attention more than men.   How many men have kissed their male friends to get people to look?  How many men have stripped to their underwear in front of everyone at a party to get attention?  How many men are glued to their social media accounts 24/7 posting selfies, pictures of their food and new profile pics? I'm sure there are some but in my, and many others' experiences, girls and women are much more likely to do that. And I believe this desire for attention may be the root cause of false accusations in many cases. What gets you more attention and sympathy than being a female rape survivor? Of course the only women who would levy such an accusation are mentally Ill and a very, very small segment of the overall population."

Man hating feminazi!"" because they just don't want to admit they're butthurt).   I can't imagine if I posted a similar response to an article about a man actually abducting or raping a woman, such as:  ""This is actually really common, a surprising amount of teenage boys like to rape. Sometimes the police get involved, most times it's contained within a social group. The desire to rape seems to be a powerful urge in boys."" No doubt I'd be downvoted into oblivion for such a thing!

If you don't believe me, have a look at the UVA rape hoax (no punishment), Brian Banks' false imprisonment (false accuser given over $1 mil by the state), Duke Lacrosse rape case, or any of the other hundreds of examples floating around the internet.

I was NOT saying that all women feel the need to lie about crimes, just that attention seeking behavior is more common among women in my experience, and that maybe certain mentally-ill women use false accusations of rape/sexual assault in a misguided attempt to get attention and sympathy as  a victim."

Which is true. Sometimes they do get involved.   I said MOST TIMES it's contained within a social group. I didn't allude to violent crime or rape at all. I was talking about exactly what I said - its surprisingly common for teenage girls to fabricate situations so they can look like a victim, to get attention. I didn't say ""girls like to fabricate situations"", because that wouldn't be true would it?   You don't like what I said but you know it's true and you can't argue against it, so instead you subtly change elements of it to make it sound less true. That's called making a strawman.

But the guy in the youtube video here is obnoxious as fuck. His whole video is obnoxious and not even close to thought through.  It is obvious that he is out to say that Lin is guilty of the mans death. ""I'm not saying that he killed him. But he is a murderer."" and then he starts talking about ""Why would he stay on the streets?"" ""Why didn't he do this if he had the money?"" which makes it obvious that he has no clue on how the human psyche works.  Crippling alcoholism often goes hand in hand with depression and one big factor with people who are heavily depressed is the fear of change.   After a while, you get used to your situation. You get used to the depression and the anxiety and the situation feels ""like home"". Because that is your life and average day. You become afraid of changing that. As a depressed person, you often need routines. Even if those routines are collecting cans at 9am, buy a bottle of beer at 11:30 etc etc, they are still routines.  ""He could've drank himself to death for $30."" Yes. That is true. But the important word is ""could"". There are a lot of situations where you ""could"" do something. That doesn't mean that you will. In this situation, going from $0 to $100k will most likely put you in some kind of ""shock"" (studies have shown that people given a large sum of money in one go often spend them up very fast) and made him extremely unstable.   He says something about the man most likely being alive if he hadn't have met Lin (don't quote me on that, but I think he said that. Can't be arsed to look it up in the eight minute clip). Bullshit. You have no idea how people and their minds work. Maybe he just one day thought ""Fuck it."" and wanted to end it all.

I thought this video was more of a ""where the fuck is the 150k you raised for this guy"" and not seriously about the fact that Josh is a murderer.    In this situation, going from $0 to $100k will most likely put you in some kind of ""shock"" (studies have shown that people given a large sum of money in one go often spend them up very fast) and made him extremely unstable.

The plane is visible, he could have slowed down for the kid to pick it up. At the VERY least, if you see a small child next to the road, you slow down because you don't know if they're smart enough to not just run out in front of your car. Playing in the street is part of living in neighborhoods, you teach your kid to watch for cars and to get out of the way before they get near you. Last night, you could hear people yelling ""CAR!"" as any car came down the street. As soon as any of the kids heard it, they backed up to the sidewalk. Once it passed, back to the street they went. Parents and adults were all outside to supervise, but it's not abnormal for kids to play in the street in the suburbs, at least not in the midwest.   However, I think it's fake. I don't think anyone is that big of a dick, and even if they were, it doesn't look like anyone is trying to get the kid and the plane out of the street. Presumably whoever is filming is an adult, or at least an older child. SOMEONE would have been making an effort to remove it before the car came.

Good thing toys aren't pedestrians! Good thing I literally make this point twice in the post you responded to!   Cars have the right of way to drive on any road in it's intended manner without harming human life.      If your inanimate objects are in the middle of a road, a car has the right to run them over insofar as they obstruct their path.   Last I checked, toys aren't human life. Last I checked, no person is at fault for (non-government) inanimate objects which are obstructing traffic. If you drop your cellphone in the road and it gets run over, your phone is not a pedestrian. If you set up your trash cans in the middle of the road obstructing traffic, they can be run over, as they are not pedestrians. If you leave toys in the middle of a road, they will be run over, as they are not pedestrians. You can not take any of these cases to a court of law saying that there should be legal ramifications on another person for your own carelessness"

The car had the right to do what it did because a thing was in the middle of a street. You would have to be seriously dense to try to extrapolate this argument to mean that people are saying the situation would be perfectly okay if it was a person in the middle of the street.

Personally, in many regards I do think that it's noble at least on principle for people to make the decision to become vegan, but virtue of an act is kind of lost when you force it on children, especially when there's health risks involved. Maybe I'm wrong, but until then, my opinion is is shit's mad scuzzy, yo.

The risks of a plant-based diet, especially beyond infancy, are typically massively overstated. Just like anything else you gotta eat a wide variety of foods to make sure you get all the vitamins and minerals you need. Plus B12 supplements of course, because that's the main thing you get from animals that you can't get from plants.  That said, veganism is an ethical paradigm which ideally ought to be adopted freely by individuals. In my opinion, the most important thing a vegan parent can do regarding the subject is simply to teach their kids respect for living things, and educate them on how animals are treated in today's society.

It makes me feel good that ""Ohh, I am hurting no animal and allowing no animal to directly die in my name."" but really, I'm not actually doing much. Many more animals are hurt in my name indirectly then they are directly, and I can't change that through those means.  Think about it real hard for a second. First off, there are way to many animal products on the market today (The ones you don't eat I mean) for that to ever happen. You may be vegan, but I can assure you your house and most of what you own probably isn't, considering you obviously have a computer. But, for the sake of argument, let's say we figured out all out and we can all be vegans now. But wait, what does that mean for the animals? We have an absurdly large population of farm animals, what will we do with them then? Set them free? Nope, can't do that. You ask who will continue producing meat? Animals will. By fucking. Fucking a lot because even farm animals with natural enemies have such large populations now in domesticity they could overtake the environment and basically destroy the eco system, and with no predators to keep their net growth in check, that's basically the end of that shit. So, we'd have to kill the vast majority of those animals as there is no other place for them. And their bodies and lives will be wasted. And even then, being choosy with  our diets is only something feasible in privileged first-world countries. And even THEN there are a shit ton of ecological implications to such a drastic change in the demand for adequate sustenance for the population it would just end up hurting more animals, particularly wildlife.

I don't have the answers, and as much as I wish I did I'm comfortable in admitting that, which I feel a lot of animal rights activist aren't and that causes more problems.

Because meat tastes good? Because that's subjective and is truly dependent on what you're used to eating.   Now, if a doctor says that's not healthy and that they shouldn't be eating a vegan diet, then I would 100% follow their advice. The point of being vegan is that you reduce as much suffering as possible. If you're risking you're child's life then that's pretty hypocritical right? That's causing suffering.   There are vegans who don't think like that though, and that actually genuinely bothers me. Like, they'll starve a fucking child because of their beliefs, as if their beliefs justify that? Mostly they'll be ""health"" vegans (so not actually vegan, just on a plant based diet). But still, idiots are idiots whether or not they're vegan. I don't think it's a vegan thing as much as it's a people being morons and not taking into account the life that they're caring for.   Oh, and B12 is actually bacteria.

I'm not going to start policing how people should raise their children, I'm just stating the facts as I understand them (Well, ""facts,"" as I' m too lazy to cite anything I'm saying and I'm not that invested in arguing properly right now, but you get what I mean.)  That's great that you're taking a strong moral stance, but that doesn't negate that you're sacrificing a degree of health to do so and It's up for debate whether or not it's right to make that decision for a child. I mean, to be fair, there's so many unfit parents in the world it happens all the time (usually with junk food) and it's not just vegan parents, but still.

Not metal, it's corn basically corn starch. Also, exaggerated the casualties.

Flammable material is not gay. The event is not about gay pride. He posted no video related to proving that it was. Cited nothing as to gay sponsorship, just posted a picture of a a facebook group called ""NewUrbanMale.com"". He said that their logo had a sperm on it, but the picture he has shows a rainbow colored teddy bear. Now I had to actually go find these people and, hilariously, the group's logo is in fact a sperm. What is amazing is that the one thing he actually got right in the article (what the logo was) he still fucked up because he didn't even post it. From there, I went through an old vice article which says the event was organized by the same people who do The Color Run 5k of which they call ""the happiest 5k on the planet"". That being said, their run has no political themes that I can see at all.  This fucking idiot pulled a lot of shit from his own ass, made himself angry about it, tied it all together by assuming that colors that formed the rainbow are evidence of a world spanning homosexual cabal.

rage,3c0sff,GrungeLord,-1,Sat Jul 4 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"A laugh track is still obnoxious, wether it's a studio audience or not. For shows like Madtv, and SNL they fit, because it's a live audience, and they don't rely on the audience's reaction to push laughs. It also helps keep the feel that these are variety shows. Sitcoms like the Big Bang Theory, and IT Crowd push a laugh track they don't need. If anything the laugh track in those 2 shows, and most sitcoms detracts away from the quality of the show, or in Big Bang Theory's case, lack thereof."

It's a stupid accusation to make and means very little. You show me your ""science"" degrees and I'll show you mine.   What I really think is going on here is that you don't understand what is meant by ""science"" and ""anti-science"".  Science is by definition an activity, a process, and a method by we are able to empirically determine the natural order of reality.  There is no confusion here on my part between science and technology, which is necessarily the outcome of scientific discovery.  Without the scientific method, there is no technology. Technology does not exist in a magic bubble outside of science.  ""Anti-science"" advocates are people who believe it is not necessary to do any of the hard work of observing and testing reality in order to know things about it.  I can imagine you would have no trouble thinking of huge swaths of people fitting this category. Like these people who merely assert this miraculous properties of baking soda to cure cancer, and then potentially contribute to the deaths of people by encouraging them not to seek modern medical treatment.  You don't want to be associated with them, but your rhetoric echoes the same fear mongering as the cranks do. You have not merely been saying ""One day we will have more effective techniques for the treatment of cancer"", which in itself is almost certainly objectively true and uncontroversial.  But you assert that somehow these treatments have not been shown to be effective, which is almost certainly false and highly controversial. Chemo and radiation therapy are not effective in every case, but to dismiss them completely is to dismiss literally tens upon tens of thousands of people who have experienced remission due to these treatments. Why is this article/ image 'rage' inducing?  Because it insults our very reason and potentially contributes to human suffering.  Maybe the above explanation will clear up your misconceptions so you do not have to resort to the dick waving about having a degree or not.   My issue here is with the paliative technique being applied. Of course there are potential benefits to radiation and chemo, but the efficacy is controversial and the costs are potentially very high. My personal opinion is that we are due for a swift evolution in cancer combatting technique and medical ethics, and that current practices will be viewed retrospectively as barbaric and inhumane much like many historically traditional medical practices are viewed today.   You have some ridiculous method by which you define ""barbaric treatments"" or ""blemishes"" on medical history, which seems to me absolutely puerile. I believe this is where the whole issue lies between you and the people who have responded to you.  You have this vain belief that you somehow know better than all of the scientists.  As if saying ""these treatments aren't good enough for me"" somehow invalidates their use.  Study after study shows that, especially for certain cancers, the effect of treatment versus no treatment is dramatic and compelling.  Please take a look at The Cancer Treatment & Survivorship Facts for 2012-2013 provided by the American Cancer Society, as it summarizes a large amount of data and information in a way easily digestible to the lay person.  It is not as controversial as you make it seem.  Without these treatments, thousands of people would die every year.  Show me your data which makes the use of chemo and radiation therapy so massively risky.  We are also due for faster internet, nearly free energy, and a manned trip to Mars.  Just complaining that the current state of affairs is not good enough for you is not a valid argument to dismiss all of the real work done to save lives and help people enter remission in their diseases.   To share a bit of my perspective, my great grandfather was a highly respected physician and dean at my alma mater's medical school. I still retain some of his articles and records that have not been donated to museum. Some of the ""scientific"" beliefs and practices that he held, you would be shocked and angered by. But at the time they were praised. I like to think that as a skeptic and inquiring mind, I would been more progressive rather than simply faithfully branding misguided trends as ""science"".   Just a long story trying to shift the conversation.  If the techniques your grandfather used saved thousands of lives every year, then I would not be angered by them and they would not be controversial.  Only a fool would compare the efficacy of chemo and radiation therapy to bloodletting.  How do we know chemo and radiation therapy work?  Because of the huge disparity between people who receive treatment Vs. those who do not for a huge number and range of different kinds of cancers."

And at that age range we are at our most fertile. It is not unnatural even for older members of our species to want to breed with the partners that will be most likely to produce offspring.  The only reason we think it's weird is because we have suppressed those animal urges with logic and awareness. We have established a society built upon pretending we are better than the other animals on this planet so we set rules for ourselves based on things like morality to distinguish ourselves from them and condemn those who give in to their animal urges.  It's really all quite funny if you think about it. Just picture a bunch of monkeys wearing suits and beating up the ones that try and climb trees.

All I said was chances are normal rape (I say this because I don't know how many types of rape their are, and I assume when one here's rape the normally think of the common forced, struggle, type of rape), would be more traumatizing than statutory rape.  As for your argument, I never said statutory rape can't affect others, or that I don't think it is rape, or that I would be happy for other 15 year olds you have sex with 48 year olds.  And if you want something to be mad at, then I'll give you my opinion of statutory rape.  It's bad. Although I believe some teenagers are capable of making sexual related decisions, I think a heavy majority can't, so the law should apply to the majority. And if my daughter did it, and I thought she was mature enough to do it, then I'd be fine with that, but I'd still be disappointed that she didn't have the sense to not do it because of the repercussions. If I didn't think she was mature enough, I wouldn't be mad, I'd be disappointed, and then talk to her for a couple hours about what it means to responsible, but with an approach I think would be more effective.

There are a lot of grey areas and exceptions, but studies have shown that in some cases, even if minors consent at the time and think they know what they're doing, they have trouble with the decision later in life. They don't realize immediately that a 48-year-old shouldn't be sleeping with them, and they're angry once they mature further. Even if my son or daughter consented at the time, I'd be weary of the potential psychological effects down the road, when they get older and look back and realize that 15-year-olds are basically on the edge of childhood and nowhere near as mature as they thought they were when they were 15."

You can complain on the internet all you want about how you think all of society should be, but it's not going to do a damn thing whether I agree with your sentiments or not (and believe me I do - I wish people would stop worshiping this flag like it had magical properties), but society as a whole doesn't have to accept that sentiment if it doesn't want to. That's the joy of freedom of speech. It's a two-way street.   If you see society as a whole, gravitating toward an era that involves political correctness and social justice, then obviously people with your sentiments are being outnumbered by people with different political worldviews. It sucks, but it happens, and you just gotta adapt to it.   Do I believe he should have been fired? Fuck no. But should he be forced back into his job if his superiors don't want him there? Fuck no, too."

At some point he started hitting other kids with his cane. After being asked to stop multiple times he kept hitting other children.

On 16 June 2015, Baltimore resident Julie Baker initiated a GoFundMe campaign titled “Relentlessly Gay,” saying that she had been prompted to start it at the suggestion of her 17-year-old daughter when an anonymous neighbor sent her a letter regarding rainbow jar lights displayed in her yard. The note read: “Your yard is becoming Relentlessly Gay! Myself and Others in the neighborhood ask that you Tone it Down. This is a Christian area and there are Children. Keep it up and I will be forced to call the police on You! Your kind need to have Respect for GOD.”   So her response was, of course, to start a GoFundMe campaign to help her decorate her house with even more rainbows.    No, really.   So, I am starting this fundraiser so I can work to make my Home even More “relentlessly gay” If we go high enough, I will see if I can get a Rainbow Roof!  Because my invisible relentlessly gay rainbow dragon should live up there in style!  Put simply, I am a widow and the mother of four children, my youngest in high school and I WILL NOT Relent to Hatred. Instead, I will battle it with whimsy and beauty and laughter and love, wrapped around my home, yard and family!!!  Thanks for your relentlessly gay support!   However...   Critics particularly seized on the detail that the anonymous (and therefore untraceable) note and Baker’s own writings shared the same curious pattern of superfluously capitalized words.   It opened two weeks ago with a goal of $5,000.  It is now at $43,000.

As an example, consider the Ark of the Covenant. We're told that someone was immediately struck dead by simply touching the Ark to keep it from falling into the mud. But maybe the guy just had a heart attack from fear of reprisals for touching what they understood as a carrier of God Himself.

If God really didn't want people to murder gays, then maybe he should have prevented that from being in his holy book.  Also, when you said   No, hating anything is not Biblical.   You gave a bunch of reasons why the Bible is not accurate. If this is correct, then hating gays can still be Biblical while not being in accordance with God's will (because the Bible doesn't accurately reflect God's will). Murdering gays is clearly Biblical. You just disagree that the Bible is accurate."

If Christianity is truly that weak, then does it deserve to survive at all?

That's not a Biblical claim.  https://carm.org/does-god-hate-anyone   Psalm 5:5, ""The boastful shall not stand before Thine eyes; Thou dost hate all who do iniquity,""  Psalm 11:5, ""The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked, and the one who loves violence His soul hates.""  Lev. 20:23, ""Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I shall drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them.""  Prov. 6:16-19, ""There are six things which the Lord hates, yes, seven which are an abomination to Him: 17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 18 A heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, 19 A false witness who utters lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers.""  Hosea 9:15, ""All their evil is at Gilgal; indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels.""   Frankly, the Bible is so self-contradictory, it's easy for you to pull your desired meaning out of it, and yet it's easy for homophobes to pull their desired meanings out of it. Then, you can both point at the other and scream that they're misinterpreting it."
