Anarcho_Capitalism,3e2qh1,Priscilla3,8,Tue Jul 21 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"One thing social planners tend not to understand is that freedom has economic value beyond creating taxable income. Freedom to choose between many options is the only way to flourish in an uncertain world. To give an example, I may rent a car on a vacation even if I can't foresee needing one, just because having a car opens up so many opportunities. On the other hand, if there's extreme uncertainty as to whether or not I'll be able to park this car, I may choose not to rent a car. Generally, uncertainty drives people away from action, but giving people many possible options can overcome this fear of the unknown."

In your example, you used human beings losing cognitive function as an example of losing sapience. However, when you look at the human species as a whole you see that we have retained our sapience, so it can be assumed that the human beings which have presented with cognitive decline could regain it. There are a multitude of stories of people coming out of a coma, mentally ill patients receiving treatment that enables them to go through their lives semi-normally, and we recognize that cognitive decline is a part of the aging process and have created legal apparatuses, like power of attorney, so we can make decisions for others when they have been rendered unable to do so.

Other people exist; without any respect for property rights you'd just have to fight them rather than trade with them.

For example, suppose you want to start farming to provide for yourself. Tough luck, all the fertile land is already private property. Capitalism has just put tangible restrictions on your individual liberty.   Fertile land is not a prerequisite for growing your own food. Land isn't even necessary. Beyond that, what is considered a valuable resource is a matter of knowledge and perspective, and no one is just born with a right to things they haven't earned, or that some previous earner hasn't bestowed upon them. Some people are lucky enough to have productive families, but their luck doesn't come at another person's expense. Basically all wealth in a free market exists as a result of efforts that improve the lives of others. The wealthy become wealthy to everyone else's benefit.    So the system of capitalism on the one hand deprives people from their ability to provide for themselves. On the other hand it is rather good at providing things in general.   So long as property rights are based at least in part on the principles of homesteading then there should be very few cases of anyone being unjustly deprived of anything.

That doesn't necessarily mean that capitalism is evil; it just means that capitalism by itself (no matter which variant) does not automatically guarantee maximal individual liberty.

Yes, there are restrictions on your liberty, but it's in the context of everyone else's liberty, of which property is an inescapable necessity.

Abidance by principles of property, no theft, no fraud, no violence, are the only way, then, that any individual can get any degree of freedom, let alone maximal individual liberty.

This is an tricky use of rhetoric to elude detection of the truth. Yes, a person who is starving is in a position of weakness, but the force in the equation comes from their own biological needs. The person who is offering the starving person a job is strictly improving their situation.  Similarly, the person who is drowning is not being coerced by the person standing on shore with a rope, but rather the water in their lungs.  So its too simple to just say ""people get hungry, ergo slavery."" There has to be more to it.  Capitalism COULD lead to private tyranny, but that requires the people involved to allow such a thing to arise, and that the incentives would somehow encourage such an outcome.  Capitalism does not, generally, encourage the kind of centralization necessary to create a monolithic state. Without the 'legitimate' ability to use force to ensure compliance, businesses have to keep customers happy to aquire their money and support, and if they fail to do so they will fail.  So the main feature of states that allows their maintenance, the authority to use force on people unilaterally, is generally absent under the pure capitalism we're suggesting.  State capitalism, or Corporatism, is qualitatively different."

If you want to sit in your twig hut all day, then nobody will bother you. If you want to eat fast food, drive a car or play games on the internet, then you're looking for things above mere survival.  So Locke's Proviso says that everyone gets an equal chance at survival, but lets be honest, nobody wants to live such a life. Give the average person a packet of seeds and a plot of dirt and they'll be selling themselves into slavery the next day.

Noam Chomsky put it thus:   Noam Comsky is being a clever wordsmith. It sounds good, but there are some very significant logical flaws to the premise he seems to be proposing here.  Reality, that is the universe itself, dictates 'work or die', not a capitalist.  IF people don't grow food, people die. Somebody has to do it.   the question then is 'Who does it and how does it get done?"".   If you get rid of capitalism and establish a system of communism then you will have to establish a different way to motivate people to work.. which is generally compulsory. (ie: some variation of slavery)  Only the most naive communist believes in the 'literate poet farmer' were people just kinda drift around and take care of their needs without effort or coordination. Marx and all his buddies realized after a while that compulsory systems are necessary if something like communism is to work. In socialist Russia and similar 'far-left' governments they established 'work armies' built from conscription (work or prison) to try to produce food and work in the factories.  The reason for this is because people have a strong instinctual motivation to the do the least amount of work for the most amount of gain. This is the driving forces behind pretty much all societal human evolution.  This is why criminals become criminals and people design computers and machines. This is why governments are formed and why people have developed science and engineering. Laziness is a curse and a blessing.  Without this drive we would all still be cavemen banging rocks together to crush the larvae into paste and digging in the soil with our bare hands for grubs and edible roots.  What capitalism does is establish a system of distributing resources which generally results in the most efficient distribution of labor and goods to produce the most wealth with the least amount of effort.   The only real viable alternative is socialism, but even if you devote all resources to state government then it's still going to have the same exact issues as giving everything to huge corporate monopolies.  Just because somebody is in government does not mean that person's motivation is somehow magically transformed from one of self-interest to one of self-sacrifice. Quite the contrary... people join state government because they have found, in their own particular way (whether they realize it or not) that it is easier for them to profit from the confiscation of other people's goods rather then voluntary exchange in the 'private sector'. (incidentally even in the most socialist countries it's the private sector that generates nearly 100% of the wealth)  So what exactly is Noam implying here? That socialism removes the individuals self-interests, but capitalism does not?  That handing over the rights to take and use violence to a select group of 'uber men' so they can initiate changes in society is going to create a more fair situation then if you leave people to figure things out on their own?"

Anarcho_Capitalism,3e2e3r,Priscilla3,6,Tue Jul 21 13:42:00 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with the NAP?   The only thing wrong with the NAP is that people tend to use it in a way that is 'begging the question'.   Example:  Question: ""Why is Statism bad?""  Answer: ""Because it violates NAP!""  It's sort of like going:  Question: ""Why is it moral to eat beef?""  Answer: ""Because cows!""  If you are arguing with non-libertarian then invoking the NAP as a answer to their questions is putting the cart before the horse. It doesn't mean anything to them because it's very likely they have not yet accepted the basic premise of NAP.   However if you are arguing with Libertarians were everybody has already accepted a more-or-less consistent version of the NAP concept then invoking the NAP as a argument is perfectly valid.   What the term 'NAP' allows is a verbal shorthand. In other words: It's just a word that describe a concept.  The concept is: ""A basic premise about the positive value and universal correctness of the concept of human self-ownership and how that self-ownership extends out into the world in the form of private property. That this self-ownership and property rights should not be violated by anybody or any organization without voluntary acceptance on the part of the targeted individual first""  Pretty much that.   A few years ago a guy wrote a somewhat confused anti-NAP article complaining about the propensity of libertarians to invoke NAP as a justification for their morality.  Since then a multitude of psuedo-intellectuals have taken this to mean that NAP itself is invalid. Which is silly and inconsistent itself.  Since NAP and Libertarian morality are synonymous this is a silly thing to do. You can't use NAP as a logical argument for Libertarianism. It's circular reasoning.. begging the question logical fallacy.  However if you can convince people that NAP has significant merit then it's easy to point out to them that they are already Libertarians that just haven't realizing it yet.  There are lots of ways people can justify NAP. It can be a 'natural rights' thing or any other sort of moral or ethical reasoning. But once you have a group of people that consider that NAP has merit then you can dispense with a lot of the bullshit (and largely ignore their own personal reasoning how they arrived at believing in NAP) and move the discussion along because you all already agree on a basic premise that can be used to create further reasoned arguments."

The NAP is is the idea that each person has the right to make his or her own choices in life so long as they do not involve aggression, defined as the initiation of force against others.

Sharing may have a connotation of 'sharing freely' but it is not that cut and dry so as to exclude sharing via financial motivation. For instance, most sharing involves an implied social credit, or even barter, which is a form of selling just with a different currency. This is admitted when someone might say ""I owe you one"" after another shares with them.   Using money just formalizes the fact that sharing implies some form of reciprocity, free or not."

People living in communes do not share based on that kind of social credit.   Sure they do. Have you ever lived communally? I have, if briefly. There was the time I brought some specialty salami into a communal environ and saved it in the communal fridge.  Later I found some peanut butter, but unable to find the owner I helped myself. That's how communal environs go.  And when my friend and I finally got around to finding the salami for our dinner, someone else had already helped themselves to it as well. Nothing we could do. And it's not like we could get upset since it was the ground rules of the society.  Which is why in a lot of such places a moneyless market tends to develop anyway. I remember reading about one such commune which finally had to setup a trading zone, and their currency became snickers bars.   There is greater social credit involved in a commune obviously, but it is encompassing the entire community. When you sell something during a transaction that social credit is only tied to that one transaction.   In a communal environ, you might give someone something, or they may ask you for something, and there's an unspoken agreement that this person now owes you something.  That is nothing more than selling via social expectation of future reciprocity. All money does is cancel out that debt that would exist up-front, so that you can easily trade with strangers and outsiders, such as would be impossible when relying only on a system of social pressure for making things fair in a communal environ.  Just because the trade is subsumed into an invisible social expectation doesn't mean it's not actually occurring.  And btw, the people who tend to accrue above and beyond what they deserve are those most able to please others socially or climb the social pecking order, so such a system is skewed towards those types and isn't nearly as fair as a money-based system.1   That kind of transaction/use of social credit is anethma to what most would consider a commune.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3e3ct4,YesYesLibertarians,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:19 2015 UTC,"High trust would be the ability to interact with a very wide swath of people and expect similar norm enforcement, with not a selectivity to it (e.g. if a family's son commits a crime, they do not protest his punishment, just because he's their son).  Being able to get to that scale of cooperation (which robust capitalism needs) requires lowered transaction costs, which requires the high trust.  But, to get the high trust, you have to have a widespread, universalized morality, which symmetricizes information exchanges (no lying, not even by omission); if you are fine with asymmetric exchange (Rothbard and Block), then people incur transaction costs, exchange doesn't become as widespread, and demand for the State increases.  The size of a locale's state is a function of direct and indirect transaction costs: when people experience a great deal of direct costs, via lying and manipulation, they want to get rid of those direct costs via incurring indirect costs (a taxative state).  If you can lower the first, you reduce demand for the latter; thus, Rothbard and Block's 'Defending the Undefendable' Levantine ethic increases demand for the State and reduces the robustness of its capitalism.  This is why Classical Liberalism actually existed, whereas Anarcho-Capitalism can't.  You and others may enjoy these graphics."

That is some interesting food for thought and helps explain why classical liberalism worked so well and yet did not continue on into Rothbardianism.  Is there a reason to view these two categories, high trust propertarianism and low trust, as mutually exclusive regimes? It seems to me the high trust realm would outlaw the same crimes the low trust one does, while stacking on top of it social norms that further whittle away at those transaction costs. I think the anarcho-capitalist thought is that we cannot know what those ethical and moral prohibitions should be (as they'll vary somewhat from group to group) but the things we know for sure are not permissible are Fraud, Theft and Extortion.

Even if my relationship to the libertarian movement is qualified as aristocratic libertarianism, rather than general humanist libertarianism, I do want to share that observation with the truer blue libertarians, so that I might hasten a new, more interesting phase to intellectually watch and work with.  Another way of stating his case is that: if libertarians want to reduce the State and its taxation, they have to reduce abuse and privatization of the gains of the commons and socialization of losses on to the commons.  If that can't be done, demand for taxation and retribution skyrockets, and voila, you have a large state.  This is also why libertine behavior tends to follow the growth of the State, whereas thoughtful behavior and neighborliness tend to follow societies with smaller states—the super nice Anglo-American neighborhoods didn't even need a governmental welfare system, because they had an extremely pervasive ethical system for the commons.  So, you destroy the State by building the moral commons; you grow the State by destroying the moral commons.  People have no reason to seek out the costs of the State, and deal with its inevitable rent-seeking, when there aren't direct social transaction costs.   It seems to me the high trust realm would outlaw the same crimes the low trust one does   That's what Hoppe tried to do with his system, as an evolution away from Rothbard and Block's, but Curt makes it explicit as a needed requirement, not just something that can be tacked on by covenant contract.   I think the anarcho-capitalist thought is that we cannot know what those ethical and moral prohibitions should be (as they'll vary somewhat from group to group)    Yes, this is why Curt thinks the jury system was so ingenious, as it was directly tapped into the commons, so that communities could quickly figure out what is the new kind of free-riding parasitism which is hampering even more cooperative incentives.  As an example, we need to figure out a better compensatory model for artists, as the industry languishes if artists on the margin get pushed out.  People like the freedom to pirate, but it has social costs, and those social costs led to a demand for IP, which grew the State.  If we want to bypass that dynamic, we have to find the social institutions of how to not parasite off one another."

I think arguments advanced by people like David Friedman show that this stability is possible in theory,  meaning only that there's no fundamental contradiction, but that's all.

Everything else regarding the ownership of capital is just a preference. He didn't believe that the workers had a ""right"" to take property from the capitalist. He simply believed that it was generally preferable for people to be their own boss (which was probably even more true back then than it is now). You could argue that this is him being a ""socialist"" because he preferred that the workers own the means of production, but since he believed in private property I can just as easily argue that this is him wanting more capitalism, not less. He wanted more people to (privately) own more capital. It's irrelevant that he preferred the private owners of capital be the workers. What's important is that he believed in the system of privatized ownership of property, not ""collective ownership"" which is a complete nonsense phrase. Essentially he wanted there to be more capitalists. And we know that this is what free market capitalism tends toward - individual empowerment as opposed to centralized control. He also believed that those with capital have a right to charge whatever amount of interest they want.  Unlimited private property and being ok with charging interest on loans already makes him an enemy of all leftist collectivists.

And if, consistent with the turd theory you just floated above, you tried to interfere with me buying something, as it would be the case if you interfered with me having sex with my wife, under the stupid pretext that ""we didn't obtain your consent"", you will as you should be perceived as a dangerous raving lunatic and possibly shot for your audacity.  What I am trying to say here is that the sentence ""The forms of acquisition of property we support are entirely voluntary"" means that we only support people owning stuff if they have acquired said stuff with the voluntary consent of the giver (you are not the giver in your ridiculous example), or if they found the stuff unowned and homesteaded (for which your consent or refusal is vacuous).

I have spent years of my life trying to avoid intellectual dishonesty.  Due to illusory superiority it's impossible to weed it out completly. Thus, I have to rely on others.   Are you equating the following with a threat:   disturbing sexual comments about my wife in front of the children   That was the part I was referencing as evidenced here. I did not think that that involved ""threats of physical violence"" because in my mind that was presented as a separate concept later in the post. So is our issue that I did not initially clarify in my link that I was just referencing the first part?   That being so, my mistake was thinking that the controversial part of the post was the first part and I assumed people would catch that. If not initially they would see that that was what I was referencing from my comment in that thread.   So please help me understand how I am being intellectually dishonest. Or if you want to call that inattentive then fine, I will say I was inattentive.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dzmg7,zoink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"A.)    I am not equating sexual comments about a wife with a threat.  Unless a threat has been specified by the one making the threat (even implicitly) there is no threat.   B.)    After much reading and thinking it seem I was rash in my rebuke.  I regret to say that I wrote my responses when I was not in a proper mental state and I should have held my tongue. I'd assumed that you were equating the two, but I can see now that you were very obliquely calling attention to someone else who seemed to be equating the two and, by extension, implicitly criticizing this. I had mistakenly assumed that you were also making this assumption and that was a mistake on my part. For what it's worth I rescind and apologize for my misunderstanding.  I hesitate to say this, but I, myself, am oblique to the point of obscure. Perhaps a lesson to you, as well as to myself, would be to give a single indication of intent so that it's less likely that someone with a quick trigger finger (myself in this case) is less likely to make an ass of himself in public.   C.)   Yes, threats of physical violence can be met. I think it's contextual, though. I would not say there's a clear and cut systematization that you can use for what counts as a real threat absent context. Every person is different and all interactions are unique. The criteria for determining a real and authentic threat would likely change depending on the context. But I do think that one is perfectly justified in defensive violence if the threat can be verified as real and authentic."

If I define ""looking at me"" as ""aggression"", and people around you believe me, then I have free reign to assault you if you look at me, because those around you will perceive you as the aggressor and me as the defender.

State governments often find they need to fabricate a boogieman to help conform the population's perspective to one that benefits the aims of the government.  In the case of the Nazis the Jews were convenient.   Unfortunately there are quite a few people that are foolish and/or ignorant to fall into this intellectual trap of giving a shit about race.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dz19u,Kadmon_Evans,2,Mon Jul 20 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, yes. ""State governments"", though.  People will generally associate with people with similar appearance and backgrounds, but capitalism tends to erase boundaries.  As people seek out comparative advantage they will, out of necessity, voluntarily engage with different types of people. I've seen on several occasions people that are very racist or come from racist backgrounds work with other races, serve them, and sell to them because it increase their own profits. They will say 'well nrs suck, except for the guys I work with, of course. They are ok. But it's only the nrs that suck'.  Over time people learn that willingness associating with different people with different natural talents and outlooks is a massive advantage for themselves.  Plus I do think there is a natural drive built into our genetic programming out there for diversifying the gene pool.  If you disagree with me head down to some place like Brazil and check out the young women on the beaches, then try to tell me that having a mixed European, African, and Native American heritage is a bad thing."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dz19u,natermer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:15 2015 UTC,"but capitalism tends to erase boundaries.   I'm not 100% sure that that's the case. As it is now, there's a lot of anti-discrimination law. You can't discriminate even if you wanted to... so, naturally, it's going to be harder to imagine why you would want to discriminate if it's never even been an option for you. Integration was forcible and it's arguably had some pretty disastrous effects. Malcolm X was a famous black nationalist and he made what some might consider valid points. He would be regarded as a hero today if he had lived longer, but MLK outshines him for a few reasons. Forced racial integration is very much a product of government interference in the name of equality. Even now, the federal government is amassing data on racial inequality with the intention of imposing harsh new regulations on cities that don't meet certain race-related quotas... with the intention of forcing equality. Even if you want diversity, you're only ever going to get a bastardized version of it while the state is overseeing its implementation.  Voluntary exchange is good. But we'll note that affirmative action is very far from voluntary exchange; it's forced integration, at a loss-- if it weren't at a loss, it would have occurred by voluntary exchange, and affirmative action wouldn't be necessary.   If you disagree with me head down to some place like Brazil and check out the young women on the beaches, then try to tell me that having a mixed European, African, and Native American heritage is a bad thing.    Probably a bit of a natural drive, I wouldn't argue, but humans generally recognize that we shouldn't just blindly obey all of our natural drives. Civilization was very, very hard to accomplish; technology moreso, and at any given moment, we are precisely one generation away from losing everything. All that has to happen is that we fail to pass on the requisite knowledge for sustaining and growing what we've left behind.  There are some good-looking Brazilian women, I cannot lie. But what about the economy? The levels of corruption? The technology coming out of Brazil? Freedom? Poverty? Brazil is known, in addition to its exotic women, for corruption, poverty, and roaming gangs of young bastard children.

But worker-state control of the means pf production nonetheless.  Also, its most important principle is corporatism; which sees the state as a huge family or something, and basically means that individuals ought to sacrifice as many liberties as needed for the ""greater good"".

There will always be some ...unlucky... people who are willing to pay exorbitant amounts for a worthless degree in a crowded field.  But that doesn't mean they everyone would or should be funded an exorbitant amount. My college education was very cheap and paid for itself in spades. It wouldn't have cost too much extra to make it completely free. And now I'm paying shittons in taxes (out of state though, haha, sorry FL!). So I think it was a good investment on the part of the state (well almost, and certainly if I move back home).

Decreasing demand whilst increasing supply creates a surplus, in this case, a surplus of highly skilled workers. Sure they won't be unemployed with loans due, but they will be unable to pay income taxes.   So of course, the government is going to have to come up with some way of deciding who goes and who doesn't. AKA standardized testing. Something the left won't stop bitching about. So if you struggle with testing, no more GED, Community College for 2 years, work your way up bullshit. Nope, you fail the SAT, enjoy manual labor.   Now, none of this is to say that college isn't too expensive, and that their isn't something wrong with the system, but that problem is too much government assistance See, the government garuntees loans, so the lenders don't really give a shit who they loan to, and the universities don't really give a shit who they accept and what they charge. Student loans stick with you even past bankruptcy, and the government itself will act as a collection agency. Is there any wonder that lenders are willing to loan huge amounts to poor investments, when the government with all it's resources, will collect said loan for free?  None of this even addresses the fact that colleges are becoming antiquated institutions that are failing in a variety of areas, if you wanted to become say a webdeveloper, I'd say a membership at treebook would be much more worth your money than a 4 year CS degree.

They do a lot of war, but they are extremely wasteful in the process.  Redistribution also does not solve problems like this.   It has been attempted in other nations within the last century.   It can seem to work the 1st year or so (in some cases a little longer) until the side effects of doing this kick in.    If you want more money to help other people with, stop giving it to the government.   We talk about taxes... I wonder if anyone were to do a study on the overhead involved in using those taxes and see what % of those taxes are lost due to bureaucracy, waste, and climbing prices due to guaranteed paycheck.

You may be laboring under a mis-apprehension about anarcho-capitalism, at least as I think of it.  I have no illusions that anything like full-on anarcho-capitalism can exist in 2015 in the United States.   In that regard, I feel rather like a contemporary of Locke, reading 'Two Treatises of Government' and thinking, yes, that sounds a pretty good idea.  Continuing that metaphor, this sub-reddit is a gathering of like-minded fellows in a coffee house.  You, Dan, come along and remind our little crowd in the coffee house that consent of the governed is foolish when we have a God-ordained King.  And we all nod and say 'yup' and carry on.  Think of it like this: simplistically speaking, there has been a progression in the 'how we arrange society'; We've had autocratic kings who ruled, then the upper-crust of society decided things.  America came along and established reprsentative democracy as a going concern.  What's next?  The trend (simplisticlly speaking, this isn't a poly-sci lecture at UW) is to decentralize power and descision making.  I think it's possible - even desirable - to keep devolving that power from elected repsentaives to the people themselves.   When an-caps ever come up with a realistic policy that isn't pure distilled greed and tax revolting, devil-take-the-hindmost   Not the best metaphors for how an anarcho-capitalist society would function.   nobody will listen anyway   It is, again, not about the election next year, but about the future.

According to wikipedia:   Although punks are frequently categorised as having left-wing or progressive views, punk politics cover the entire political spectrum. Punk-related ideologies are mostly concerned with individual freedom and anti-establishment views.   Ancaps definitely care a lot about individual freedom over collectivism, and Antiestablishmentarianism  over agreement with mainstream leftism and progressivism, definitely the dominant current in culture today.  So if punk is indeed counter culture, it would only make sense to be against both the state, and the culture of progressivism.  Maybe in the 90's it was ""neo-liberalism"" that was the enemy.

The right to attack people over insults would be expensive because of adverse selection (like other positive rights, you'd only purchase it if you thought you'd use it), so probably would not be enforced.  My own feelings are that tit-for-tat should be the dominant strategy. Insults should beget insults, not punches. Credible threats of violence should beget violence.

There is an opportunity cost in not taking someone's real threat seriously, just as there is for taking someone's idle threat too seriously.

Wouldn't that be preferable to legalizing assault inspired by certain magic words?
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dyvsu,starrychloe,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"For a more elaborate version of my thoughts on the matter, I'd like to refer you to my post here...  For your specific question; it isn't not the case, it's just that as a non-moralist, I don't feel particularly inclined to paint it that way, although it's true. I would value the satisfaction of shutting the fellow up more than I would value the avoidance of the consequences.  But I would further argue from a legal theory point of view that a meaningful distinction can be made between free speech that provokes simply for the sake of provocation, and free speech that provokes incidentally, in the process of providing social commentary, pushing the boundaries of science, honesty, exposing political corruption, etc.,...  An instance of the former, I would argue is something like shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater. You aren't making a point by engaging in this, you're just being an ass; it isn't a ""free speech"" issue, you aren't speaking anything, really, you're just being destructive and causing problems.  For example, if someone came and said something like, ""Hey! Your wife is fat and she should lose weight!"" or ""Your kid has a square head! You might want to get that checked out!"" or something and it was rude but it's true, I would argue that that's an entirely different category of speech than just shouting profane, sexual comments about a woman's nether-regions and what one may like to do with them. So maybe it's less that I'd be committing assault to stop words I don't like, and more that I'm being a good citizen responding to extreme harassment (also a crime).  I would add that I don't think a society which uses the same protections for direct personal insult that are used for political and scientific speech is going to get very far. Men should probably be allowed to defend the honor of their women. I don't mind saying so."

Now, I'm not trying to go for guilt by association but this is what happens when one steps away from initiations and threats of initiations of violence as a guidline.  Simply using certain words is harassment, advocating for libertarian principles is harassment. Saying overtly sexual things about my significant other is not going to trigger me but it does trigger Kadmon_Evans.   In the grand scheme of oughts this doesn't matter so much in most concepts of an ancap paradigm.  It's what one's willing to pay for.  If enough people pay to not be prosecuted for beating the shit out of a ""harasser"" then that's how it will be.   From my line of thinking harassment is largely an issue of poorly defined property norms. In the most likely hypothetical case of someone making disturbing sexual comments it's in a ""public space"" e.g. a sidewalk, road, or park. That person has just as much right to be in that place and talk as you do. Hence the convolution of is it harassment or is it not? In an ancap paradigm the land owner decides and either you or they leave or then violence comes into play."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dyvsu,aletoledo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"No, ""offensive speech"" does not need to be ""violently put down"". Let me put it this way; I'm basically an amoralist first, and a consequentialist second. So I'm not going to argue moral theory about the rights and wrongs of punching someone in the face if they start making sustained, perverted sexual comments about my wife, in front of my children, for example. I'm not saying it's good, or bad, I'm just saying it's what's going to happen. I need no ex post facto moral justification for it; it's simply what I'm going to do.  Now, free speech has a huge place in society. It keeps people honest. It keeps bad government from getting worse, it keeps science growing, it provides for off-color humor, and it keeps everyone humble. Free speech is vital for the flourishing of civilization, but this is primarily for political purposes, for the sake of being able to shut down bad ideas, bad politicians, etc.,  Do you think a person should be allowed to yell ""fire!"" in a theater, or ""bomb!"" on an airplane? Think of the panic that would be caused if there were no consequences for doing such things-- but that's an evil violation of free speech, right? No; to yell ""fire"" in a theater, or ""bomb"" on an airplane accomplishes nothing. You have not made a political point; you have not furthered the interest of intellectual honesty; you have not exposed corruption in the system; you have not saved a life; you have not told the truth; you have merely said some stupid, destructive words which hold no value.  If you hold up a sign at a university and it says something like, ""I disagree with homosexuality!"" and the police assault you, that's a serious problem. But if you go to San Francisco in the very gayest neighborhood you can find and hold up a sign that says, ""Fuck all you faggots, choke on a cock and die, I hate you and I want you all to get AIDS"", and someone physically assaults you... Are you surprised? Are you really surprised? You knew beforehand that it's fairly likely that you were going to piss people off, you deliberately surrounded yourself by the people you were going to piss off, and then, when they were pissed off (as you anticipated, due to your provocation) they attacked you (as you had suspected they would). The fact that with this prior knowledge you went ahead with the course of action means you, to some extent, consented to the damages you sustain to your person. Seriously, what did you think was going to happen? That they'd just say, ""Wait wait wait, this person who has come to our neighborhood to tell us all to choke on a cock, get AIDS and die has free speech, so we really ought to just let him continue""? That's stupid. Even if you want to morally suppose that people ought to act that way, you should know well in advance that there's a certain risk inherent in doing stupid shit like that.  Political commentary, raising awareness, etc., should be protected. Being deliberately, purposelessly inflammatory just for the sake of seeing if you can get away with it, especially against, as in the example I used, the woman whose honor and safety I am to protect by what I consider to be sacred vows, in front of the children who, by the same vows, I regard myself obligated to protect from the sort of human garbage who would go out of their way to engage in such harassment, when and to the extent it is possible-- no, I'm not going to tolerate it very well.

The main reason this might work is that it doesn't require you to have a functional delivery device to be a credible threat, and their interception programs would be useless.   The series of events this would require (from secretly hiring geologists to acquiring the nuke to smuggling it into the country) are beyond impossible, and the action itself would immediately vilify you to the entire world, but it might actually get them to leave you alone. Especially if you could act independent of the free nation itself and thus give them deniability so that 'fallout' wouldn't hit them directly.  Then, once your free nation is built up and capable of defending itself, you reveal that there never was an actual nuke and it was all a REALLY, REALLY elaborate ruse. Tadahh! And that's how you pull a free country out of a hat.  I have absolutely zero intention of pursuing such a plan other than a thought exercise.

Because there's no way it'll stop at just politicians.
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dz5fv,SS_Thunderbird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"I do like to continue my belief in the better angels of our nature to rein people in, and I'm sure that the security industry would MASSIVELY increase in size if such a thing existed, so I don't know if it'd be THAT disruptive, but the concept is one that has broad implications.  The kinda fun thing is that drones work both ways. I'm expecting a LOT of regulation on civilian drone use to stack up because they do provide a cheap and easy way to try and kill important people. They've already weaponized civilian drones, its only a matter of time.  But you pair that with the fact that you can 3D print most drone parts, and 3D print guns, and it will start being really dangerous to be a public figure of controversy. I would TOTALLY expect leaders to start teleconferencing from remote bunkers rather than appearing in person.  Perhaps NOBODY will leave their house if they can telecommute to work in a VR environment, and have drones deliver all the things they need. If that happens then we could be safe from almost anything but Snow Crash.  On the other hand, if we hit a point where mind-uploading is a thing, then dying is no longer a truly paralyzing fear, which has all sorts of new implications. Lets say that they've got dozens of Obama Clones in a vat somewhere, so if the one gets killed, they download his brain and boot up a new one and his leadership continues unabated.   Or hell, maybe they just go fully cybernetic.  If you haven't you should check out David Friedman's Future Imperfect, really cool analysis of economic/social implications of technologies that are approaching."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dz5fv,Faceh,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"I would actually go even farther than that regarding drones.  I think they're going to change the face of warfare just as much as gunpowder did.  We haven't had a war between major powers in like 70 years, and the dynamics are totally different now because of how complex and expensive military equipment is. You simply can't replace your equipment nearly as fast because of the highly specialized and trained nature of both the soldiers and your industrial base.  You can't just nationalize the economy and start pumping out more F-35s or carriers or missiles like you could in WW2, because the people building them need like 2 years of training and even the supply lines for the sub components are incredibly specialized and complex.  So if we ever had a non nuclear war with Russia or China, it would be decided one way or another within a couple of weeks. And the loser would probably just launch the nukes anyway if it ever came to that.  And drones are like gods gift to insurgents.  It's a flying IED that you can leave in a barn for a year and then activate it a mile away.   Small, cheap, automated fighting platforms put the ball squarely in the asymmetric warfare court and that's where it's going to stay for a long time.     Obama clones   Not necessary, if the prez ever got killed the Reptillians would just call in Lrrzziik off his smoke break and pull another Obama mask off the shelf.  Happens all the time.  (joke)"

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dz5fv,bearCatBird,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:37 2015 UTC,"I think many people have a misunderstanding about what seasteading is and what our goals are.  We're not those crazy kids in NH chasing after meter maids for facebook likes (bless their hearts).  We're not trying to kickstarter an old cruise ship so we can have blackjack and human cloning out in the middle of the pacific.   Most importantly, we're specifically NOT attempting to challenge the nation state on it's own terms (e.g. elections or warfare).  Seasteading was conceived as a meta-level approach to obtaining better governance.  Most importantly, we have a step by step plan for getting there, as is necessary for any project of this size.  The Seasteading Institute is currently in negotiations with the government of Honduras (along with the ZEDE folks) to obtain partial autonomy for the first stage of their seastead in the Gulf of Fonseca.  As we experiment and work out the technology, economic and logistical issues we'll move further from shore as the seastead grows until it's finally in international waters, which is where the real fun starts.    But at no point do we really have to declare ourselves a sovereign nation or write a constitution or anything like that.  I really think people are overestimating the risk of invasion from the US.  The feds have a couple of triggers, namely tax evasion, harboring terrorists and exporting drugs.  Basically as long as we leave Chris Cantwell and retards like /u/Anarchy321 in New Hampshire we should be fine.    And we already have the technology we need to build these things.  Big concrete platforms for stability and comfort, solar and gas generators for power, trade for everything else. The only big piece of infrastructure nobody knows how to make is a giant breakwater for rough seas out in the deep ocean, but it'll be years before we need one of those so we have plenty of time to figure that out.  My main point here is that seasteading is a realistic and practical strategy, and there's a lot of intelligent and passionate people working on it.  Check out /r/seasteading and read the Delta-Sync Report in the sidebar, it's fascinating.  Anenome is really the guy who's brain you should pick about this though, he's our resident seasteading expert and is neck deep in this stuff."

So you are statists that aren't trying to build an anarcho-capitalist society. Many seasteading advocates need to be called out as reactionaries.    Most importantly, we're specifically NOT attempting to challenge the nation state on it's own terms (e.g. elections or warfare).   Let me guess, Anenome told you this.   Force can be used to make a region ungovernable.  Your attempt to denounce all warfare as ""the states own terms"" only reflects an ignorance of warfare. Non-State actors have prevailed in many conflicts throughout the 20th-21st century.    Most importantly, we have a step by step plan for getting there, as is necessary for any project of this size. The Seasteading Institute is currently in negotiations with the government of Honduras (along with the ZEDE folks) to obtain partial autonomy for the first stage of their seastead in the Gulf of Fonseca.

You'll hand over tax evaders, non-violent criminals, and place yourselves at the total mercy of a host nation.    Basically as long as we don't act like Chris Cantwell we should be fine.   Cantwell doesn't sell drugs, evade taxes, or harbor terrorists; this sentence has little to no place in this paragraph.   And Cantwell offers a legitimate strategy to achieve anarcho-capitalism, whereas your goal is statism.    Anenome is really the guy who's brain you should pick about this though, he's our resident seasteading expert and is neck deep in this stuff.

When people make self help videos like this and then have to add all these addendums it really makes the message pointless. Why are you even addressing people who create their own problems in this manner. It's masturbation for like minded people.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dwa5e,MonsterBlazing,4,Mon Jul 20 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, but did you read the OP link?    Opioid analgesics, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone, were involved in about 3 of every 4 pharmaceutical overdose deaths (16,651), confirming the predominant role opioid analgesics play in drug overdose deaths.    That term ""involved in"" is vague, it could mean a significant number of these deaths have opiates in their system, but it doesn't preclude that other drugs may also have been in their system, alcohol, antidepressants, etc.  This tells us nothing about deaths among those who are only using pure heroin--which at this point would be almost impossible to find an actual statistic on, unless you could find a place in the world where heroin is legal and thus pure suppliers exist.  Instead, your link actually bolsters the argument of the OP-link, that it is drug mixing giving heroin a bad rep not heroin itself:   The researchers also found that drugs often prescribed for mental health conditions were involved in a significant number of pharmaceutical overdose deaths. Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety drugs) were involved in nearly 30 percent (6,497) of these deaths; antidepressants in 18 percent (3,889), and antipsychotic drugs in 6 percent (1,351).   So there at least some 30% of deaths involved some kind of antidepressant along with heroin--not to exclude other possible drug use too, including alcohol."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dwa5e,qemist,2,Mon Jul 20 05:09:06 2015 UTC,"Yes; I read the original link you provided.

Therefore this does not bolster the OP-link; those receiving pharmaceutical grade opiates (read: not street drugs) are dying in higher and higher numbers.  In terms of supporting anarchy, this on the user who, for whatever reason, gets into opiates; but lets not try to adjust the reality at hand."

For a given quantity of putative heroin the more impurities the less heroin. If it were 100% impurities you would never get a heroin overdose from it. The impurities might kill you though. Impurities aren't a proximal cause of overdose.  The fact that almost all putative heroin is very impure does lead to overdoses though. Users anticipate impurity and up-dose accordingly. If they somehow receive high purity heroin this behavior may lead to overdose.  So I agree with the OP's point. If clean, pure heroin were available then there would be fewer unintentional overdoses and almost no deaths due to impurities. The number of people who die from prescription drugs is irrelevant."

ODs from metered, pure opioid pharmaceuticals dwarf the number of deaths from heroin. Of those that OD on heroin, impurities are responsible for some number between 0-100%.

Use more accurate numbers, and I'm sure my point will stay valid. Impure heroin is an important, but overall minor factor in ODs.  http://www.businessinsider.com/heroin-vs-opioid-overdose-statistics-2015-7   If it were 100% impurities you would never get a heroin overdose from it.

Many of the more suburban and rural counties in Maryland have had big pill mills and a lot of the high school students were doing oxycotin and pain pills. With the new regulations it is much harder to get scripts and the kids who are finding pills much harder to come by use heroine to fulfill their addiction.

You can't do this on a cruiseship of any kind, it's one monolithic vessel.   So it doesn't quite match our ideal. Whoever owns the ship will instead operate as a landlord and set the rules. That's nothing new or interesting like actual seasteading could be.  Beyond that, cruiseships have significant costs, aren't designed to remain at sea for long stretchs of time, and have major stability issues that require them to be moving in heavy surf--they're top-heavy and use fins to stay righted.  I'm interested in seasteading as a decentralized living situation, not as a centralized one.  That's why I'm working on relatively cheap floathouses, not a mega-expensive cruiseship or the like.  Another big issue is how you can earn income at sea. We need that in place somehow too.   Cruiseships themselves already are private cities at sea, there's no question that that model works, it works every single day. But that's not an ancap seastead."

Besides, even two is not enough. COLAs require most people to have granular floating home arrayed in self-chosen neighborhoods.  You could approximate it by creating blocks of apartments in the cruiseship and trade apartments when you wanted, but it wouldn't be very likely or ideal for various reasons.

The biggest issue is that those ships aren't designed to remain permanently at sea, and will generally route around storms, etc.  For the seasteading ships we intend to build, they're designed to survive the worst a storm can throw, and not to cruise at all. There are design tradeoffs if you build that way that preclude cruising.   But even then, we need experience in a relatively protected harbor first, thus the /r/ZEDE idea as a seastead incubator.

Minor (or not so minor) point: this isn't necessarily true if legal institutions are not linked to geography. The requirement to enable competition is only that one be able to (relatively easily) change between heterogenous sets of legal policies (or heterogenous legal policy providers).

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dvhox,HippeHoppe,2,Mon Jul 20 04:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what you mean? My point is that the only essential feature of polycentric law is that there are multiple, potentially overlapping sets of legal norms for different people. These norms may or may not be linked to geography - if law is decoupled from geography, then there is no reason to think that physically moving would be necessary to change legal norms. A person may simply move from institution to institution by his own assent, as we currently do with automobile insurance providers, for instance. It may be that, due to economies of scale, geography will play a role in the provision of legal services (I suspect that providing liberal, American-style law in rural Afghanistan will be too costly to justify the endeavor, and that providing Sharia in an almost entirely Christian American suburb would be equally so), but there's no reason to think that a sufficiently large society with diverse preferences won't have geographically overlapping legal institutions and that switching between them will require no real effort by consumers.  edit: I'm not disagreeing with the logic of seasteading: mobile residence does lower costs of transitioning between legal systems. It's just that this is not a fundamental logical premise of decentralized law (that legal polycentrism requires mobile residence) - this is just a fact about the practical and material circumstances of polycentric law with which we are faced today."

The thing is that some norms require a geographic separation with those who don't agree, and some norms / agreements do not.   Yes - I'm not saying that geography is unimportant for polycentric law - that some norms don't depend upon geography - the obvious example being norms regarding water usage in water-scarce areas. Only that geography (and corresponding mobility) aren't necessarily intrinsic premises of polycentric law - they are factors that are likely to influence how polycentric law operates in particular instances.  The reason why I thought this distinction was important is that a lot of people believe anarchocapitalism devolves into ""little states"" - a patchwork of ""covenant communities"" (to use the Hoppean term) which all have their own legal codes, and between which an individual can move. This may practically be the case, but it's only one way that law might play out. I think a more plausible scenario is a complex interplay of geographically dependent legal institutions (in areas where it makes sense - e.g., water scarcity) and geography-independent (or at least relatively independent) legal institutions working together - a legal insurance agency may provide certain sets of policies to certain areas, contracting with communities which are self-governing as a way of resolving disputes with other communities, or with those communities members (we could see different people with multiple sets of legal affiliations)."

We can sketch out some fairly promising opportunities however. We know one group that prefers to work on location and has a high libertarian percentage: programmers and tech workers. They're both wealthier than average, and need just an internet connection. So if you have the most minor of services: housing, internet, and food delivery, you could start a community with a group like this right off the bat. That's why the home of seasteading activity is in San Francisco where these types are concentrated and experimenting with everything they can. There's real life there in questioning everything and trying everything, it's amazing to experience and see.  My partner on the floathouse endeavor just sold his living quarters and moved onto a boat up there, for instance. Comparatively cheap too.  As for food, you don't need to grow food if you can produce something you can trade for food.  The bigger issues are housing, which I'm working on, energy, internet, and the first location. If we can nail the first one, the rest will follow.  If we bungle the first one, it could set it back for some time. So, we've got to be prepared and not half-ass it. Takes some time, but I'm confident there will be people seasteading for real within 5 years."

Fish farming is practically printing money once you get it going, plus it doubles as a food supply Growing seaweed: Might sound strange at first, but there's actually a huge market for seaweed. The trashy kind can be sold in bulk as fertiliser. Specific breeds, such as nori, dulse and carrageenan can be sold as food Mining: De beers is currently experimenting with mining diamonds off the coast of south africa. Granted though that isn't exactly a startup kind of industry Biofuel: Diesel can be created from seaweed or algae   And then there's land based stuff which could be adapted:   Novelty luxury products: There's a number of different foodstuffs which can be sold for insane prices in low quantities in certain markets. For example, there's a huge market for luxury fruit in east-asia, like those square watermelons or pears moulded into the shape of a buddha along with a bunch of other branded fruit. Alcohol is another one, you could run a distillary for next to nothing at sea given the lack of regulatory burden and taxation. Granted you'd be hit by import taxes, but that happens anyway, people still buy foreign alcohol. Tax free tech center: If you could wrangle a high speed internet connection there's a tonne of internet workers who I'm sure would be delighted to do their work in a tax-free environment. Attracting those kinds of workers would be ideal since it would bring a great deal of money into the economy and support a large service industry. Drug tourism/gambling: This one is a bit dicier, but starting up weed bars and head-shops would be easy to do.

According to this: http://traveltips.usatoday.com/sizes-carnival-cruise-ships-17588.html   It looks like a cruise ship can usually handle about 3,000 passengers.   According to this, it probably costs about $400 million USD to build a low-end new ship today:  http://www.shipcruise.org/how-much-does-a-cruise-ship-cost/  So let's say a used ship is 200 million, for the sake of argument.  That means that if you got 3,000 buyers willing to pay $66,000.00 each, perhaps a ship could be bought.   However, there are also the costs of upkeep. This site has some information on that, although it is a bit unclear: http://www.statista.com/statistics/204555/cruise-expenses-per-passenger-2011-by-type/  You would also have to off-set any production from the costs once businesses got up and running (fish farming, etc).

If you believe that healthcare differs in economics from any other industry, then what about it makes it the exception?

Seasteads have no such restrictions: Cisterns are plenty if you're in a region with enough rainfall. And even if you're not, solar stills are cheap to build, have no moving parts and are maintainence free.   as well as food, it's really hard to grow food   It's very hard to grow food on a ship where space efficiency and mass are an issue. It's quite easy on a stationary anchorage where plenty of space is available and mass isn't an issue beyond what the anchor cables will bear.   and the issue of if the island is big enough to not move, it's either not moving like the Chinese base islands in the Pacific Ocean, or it's like the Japanese airport island which is not moving.

That's not actually true. All vessels at sea are required to register with a shipping registry of a sovereign nation and fly their flag. They then come under that nation's jurisdiction. In addition, the navies of sovereign nations routinely patrol and conduct physical enforcement outside the 200m limit, simply because there's no one else to stop them."

You're just making yourself an easy internet target lol.   This place changes a lot. I'm pretty sure I subbed around 17k, back then it was mostly news discussion, then around 19k it was almost explicitly ""what-if"" or ""how does"" ancap FAQ questions (I personally thought this was when ancap was at it's most boring/repetitive) and now that we're up past 21k we're back to news, with a side of shitpost trolling and memes, which I mostly dislike but welcome the news discussion. My narrative might be wrong, but my point is I don't expect it to look the same 6 months from now. There's no reason to be like ""muh /r/ancaps"" and it's futile to have that attitude anyway.  I agree with you that during my early days that most people here were seriously on board with seasteading to the point of dogmatic worship as an inevitability. The active community here was small and frankly obsessed with it, something I thought was a result of the echo-chamber that comes with any sub.   Even considering the slightest natural disaster or engineering mishap, it's easy to see why investors would not want to take on that sort of risk... And to me that's really the end of the story. Seasteading is cool but I in no way seriously would expect investors to throw money at it for the sake of libertarian principles when there are far more lucrative and less risky investments out there, especially considering human lives.  Addressing your point about Bitcoin, we're all aware that code isn't subject to scarcity, and 80% of us here can code in one form or another, so I think it's obvious and reasonable that we parrot about it since we have a more educated opinion about it. However, I don't think a lot of us are in a fair spot to analyze huge capital investments in engineering -- and back during the earlier days, the echo-chamber around the issue was so strong (especially since ancaps/lolbertarians were the only ones even interested in discussing jt) that nobody thought they could be wrong.  Bitcoin didn't require much investment to test out... Or not nearly as much as seasteading. So I don't think that underdog feels appeal is that convincing.

Sure, it will take lots of redundancy, much more than seasteading, but the potential spacesteading has is unmatched imo.   Seasteads would compete with the mainland, and given that living attached to the earth is significantly cheaper than living out on sea, and that the only advantage spacesteads would have is lower taxes, then they could be easily driven out of the market by a small state wanting to makes tons of money (and thereby reducing their taxes).  On the other hand, there is nothing that could currently compete with a potential asteroid mining colony. The resources found on asteroids cannot be found in such great amounts here on earth, there´s trillions of dollars worth of rare earth metals that could power our technological developments.

Steel hulled ships require an enormous amount of maintainence in expensive dry docks They also cost an enormous amount to run This is more true the older they are, there's a reason they're being flogged off cheap Cruise ships are highly suitable for their intended purpose: Acting as a hotel with all food/supplies being topped up during regular stops in harbours, it would be very difficult to try and turn one into a self sufficient community far out at sea. As a ""simple cheap"" option it's actually much more complicated and expensive. Steel hulls are well adapted to their function, which is to provide an expensive, disposable hull which can be driven very quickly and cheaply through the sea. A seastead has the opposite function, it needs to be cheap and longlasting, but it doesn't need to move anywhere and fuel efficiency is a non-issue.   It's also important to recognise that there's two completely different approaches to seasteading. The high road approach is the one with all the fancy architectural renderings of floating cities and talk of building $5bn megastructures and trying to turn them into valuable real estate. This is the route taken by TSI (probably the one you were talking about looking scammy). They have in the past proposed doing exactly what you've suggested here, building a cruise ship and anchoring off the coast of california as a workplace for tech workers who can't get US Visas and to provision it from the mainland (no attempt at self sufficiency).  The low road approach is to use more DIY, cheap building materials like ferro-concrete and start off small with room to expand. Also, there's more of a focus on growing food and manufacturing supplies at sea rather than trying to find a bunch of millionaire tenants and import everything from the shore."

One theory I've heard is that in a last ditch effort Germany ""declared"" war on the US (quotes used because IIRC they didn't formally declare war, Hitler only gave a speech denouncing certain actions of the US, which was responded to by the US with a formal declaration of war), who was at war with Japan; the hope was that the Japanese would attack the USSR and take off pressure from the Eastern front."

It is the same type of odd dynamic that the Cato Institute had through its history, or Ron Paul, which you cannot specifically say they work for this or that party, but do have specific political interests. Tucker has his own affinities through his Laissez Faire Books office. There are reasons for this company not to associate itself with the LvMI and possibly not Cato either.  I am not well informed on this, only have read what some others said. You can look it up, I will try to remember where I read about it. My impression was that Tucker had some professional or personal closeness with social liberal political activists also, and I wouldn't doubt at all if those were directly connected to Democrat politicians.

Would the man be able to sue the seller for lying in the contract, or would 'reputation' make the sellers keep their promises and yadda yadda yadda.   Absolutely, but contracts of high value probably will be insured against and verified by a reputable 3rd party. After all, dealing with house sales is at the high end of what a normal person is likely to buy or sell. Unless you have the time to build up a reputation at that price point, you'll need some 3rd party to vouch for the veracity of the contract.   Suppose a more direct example. A man sells himself into slavery. Because he decides to, he feels like it and signs a contract stating that he would spend 5 years being the slave of another man. The next year, the 'slave' flees, and refuses to go back into slavery. Could the 'master' sue him and force him back into slavery?   As much as Walter Block loves to talk about this, I think I gotta disagree with him and say that it's very unlikely such a contract will be deemed 'valid' because it violates the common law of contracts. Contracts 'must' have an exit clause. That's one of our chief complaints with how the State works. If there's no exit, it's not going to be held up as valid by any arbiter, and so there's nothing the 'master' can do.   All in all: Should contractual relations be strictly enforced?   As long as they meet the criteria of common law contracts, I don't see why they wouldn't be. Remember, it's up to the arbiters themselves to pass judgments on whether contracts are valid - arbiters which are chosen by mutual agreement by the parties in a dispute! That's not like today. Likewise, enforcement of contract norms will fall to DROs, ratings agencies, or other 3rd parties.

If he wants our help, then in the future he needs to follow our rules.  Now me on the other hand, I know how to write a contract and I would never appeal to the community for help in enforcing it. So in my case, I don't wish to be regulated. The problem now is that the other lender (the one writing bad contracts with people he really shouldn't be) doesn't like being controlled by regulation, even though he really needs it. He cries that I should be subjected to the same regulations.  This all leads to me to the believe that the community should never help enforce contracts. This assistance leads to eventual regulations.   used car salesman selling a car he knows has a bad engine   This seems like a reverse example. The fault lies with the buyer. In this case the buyer needs to bear the burden or buying a cheap car and not getting it checked out.   So again, the community shouldn't help the buyer to enforce the contract, because that would lead to regulation that people don't want, though they might need it."

So is it worth it to go without student loans and credit cards if it means we get rid of the state?   Contract enforcement does not require states. I like enforceable contracts because they give me access to things I'd not otherwise have access to, such as loans. If you don't like enforceable contracts you're free not to enter into any.   Good example. So the question I think becomes, does society need to step into the arrangement and regulate the contract? After all the lender is appealing to the community for help in collecting the debt. If he wants our help, then in the future he needs to follow our rules.   Who is ""the community"", or ""society""? The lender and borrower have mutually agreed upon an agent to enforce the contract (or else it'd be non-enforceable, and more a gift than a loan). The enforcers will have certain standards they apply. If one of the parties feels they were treated unfairly, they may be able to seek protection from the enforcer's decision by appealing to other parties.  The point is that the negotiation between all the involved parties could lead to efficient interpretation and enforcement of contracts.   This seems like a reverse example. The fault lies with the buyer. In this case the buyer needs to bear the burden or buying a cheap car and not getting it checked out.   Nah, there are plenty of ways a used car salesman can patch up a car enough that it'd make it past an inspection. Inspecting internal engine components is costly and hardly ever done."

The trick here is when one side considers contracts enforceable and the other side doesn't. Even if ""enforceable"" is written across the top of a contract, that doesn't change the nature of a contract, it's just another term in it. It would be like a slavery contract, where the slave changes his mind halfway through.   Who is ""the community"", or ""society""?  The enforcers will have certain standards they apply.... appealing to other parties.   The community are the enforcers and the other parties you've mentioned. If you're writing a bunch of slave contracts that you're turning over to enforcers all the time, eventually these enforcers are going to want to write your contracts in a much clearer way. The reason being is that a contract should normally be completed without having to goto enforcement. If every contract you write is requiring enforcement, then you're doing something wrong."

So in my example, if a slave is in dire circumstances for his own survival, why can't he act to save his life and then opt-out of a bad contract once he's safe? This to me seems natural and expected behavior. People should expect this behavior when creating contracts.  If you're hanging on the edge of a cliff about to fall and I create a contract to help you as long as you give me a daily blowjob for the rest of my life, shouldn't I expect you to renege on that contract the second you're safe? A 3rd party examining that contract will sure say that I took advantage of the situation, would they not?   Usually the threat of enforcement is enough;   If violence is what is gluing a community together, then drop the idea of a contract altogether or just call it a social contract. People will obey because of enforcement and not consent. So you're describing the world we live in right now, not a future system that will create better results."

Contract enforcement - or all purely libertarian property rights for that matter - are not exclusionary in this sense. They don't keep you from doing things you'd otherwise be able to do in their absence.  e.g., apartments and leases. If the owner of an apartment building couldn't collect rent and evict tenants, he never would have built the apartment buildings in the first place. If the buildings weren't built then you couldn't live in them. If someone did build some apartments to give away, they would not be able to evict people because no agreement was signed."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dxcku,anon338,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"SpanishDuke, it is obvious that such contract of labor, or indentured service, would have a clause or several specific about the case of fleeing or skiping work, and how the ""boss"" would be allowed to deal with it.  In ancient times many people sold ""themselves"" into some sort of lifetime labor in exchange for some minimum level of food and shelter. Usually it was during famines and they knew they would die otherwise.  Still, those arrangments were not written, but regulated by social and religious conventions, which limited abuse by the masters. For example, most times the master could not punish the servant with death for petty disagreements, insults or disobedience. It was considered hubris and cursed to do so. Really different from Western colonial laws and customs about slavery."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dxcku,aletoledo,2,Mon Jul 20 10:41:45 2015 UTC,"I see contracts as more of a guideline for existing relationships. So when I enter into a restaurant, there is an implied contract that I will eat first and pay later. If I break this contract, then my reputation suffers and other restaurants might require collateral before they serve me. If the restaurant breaks this contract, then their reputation suffers and fewer people will buy less stuff up front (thats the ""scam"" after all, to get people to buy since they pay later). Both sides of the contract are taking a risk, one that they won't be tricked into buying to much and the other that they will not be paid.  What am I as a innocent bystander supposed to do to help a failed contract? If someone doesn't pay for their meal at a restaurant am I supposed to help run after the guy down the street and tackle him? Shouldn't that be the role of the restaurant owner and not me? Instead, maybe I should sit the restaurant owner down and tell me to change his business model, asking customers to pay up front instead. If he persists with his current business model of paying after the meal and he repeatedly has people running away, then it's his own fault at that point and I'm not running after people for him.  All in all, a properly thought out business relationship (i.e. contract) can solve most, if not all, problems. If the people entering into these contracts can't enforce the terms among themselves and they want my help to enforce the terms, then I should get a say in setting the contract up initially. I mean if I have to help enforce the contract, then I want to limit the hassle I experience and make sure that certain provisions are in the contract. If they don't want my input into creating a contract, then they shouldn't want my help enforcing it either."

No.  He could sue him for damages caused by him voiding the contract though.  Rothbard makes a point of this in For a New Liberty.  He uses the example of an oil worker I believe.  I reason it out the following way.  Slavery is by definition, involuntary labor. If you willingly sign a contract into 'slavery', you are negating the main concept behind the definition.  So it's not slavery so much as willingly unpaid work."

Are you saying as part of the transfer that the seller is warranting that the house is fireproof? Then the remedy if it burns down should also be stated in the contract.   Would the man be able to sue the seller for lying in the contract   Surely. He warranted it, it's there in writing.   A man sells himself into slavery.   Can't be done. You can't divorce your will from your body, thus your ""new owner"" can't actually have control of you.   However people are free to contract, so you and your ""new owner"" could pretend you're a slave, when really it's an employment contract that pays only room and board. And when you, the supposed slave finally want out, you leave, he tries to sue you, and he loses in court.   Could the 'master' sue him and force him back into slavery?   No.   Should contractual relations be strictly enforced?   You cannot divorce your will from your body, you cannot willingly be made a slave. If you make a slave contract with someone and you, the slave, break it, the remedy for the ""supposed master"" is to stop employing you thus, which is the same as ""freeing"" you. So, it's entirely a farce. He can't force you into slavery. Slavery contracts are unenforceable inherently.  However the buyer could demand back the money paid to you, say $100k, but likely that money is gone. So would be slave masters are fools."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dxcku,stupendousman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"All in all: Should contractual relations be strictly enforced?   I would say yes, but only through reputation markets.   In the indentured servitude example the man who didn't keep his contractual obligations would/could be seen as a poor business partner thus creating higher costs to himself in the future- fewer opportunities for business/jobs, romantic relationships, etc.  There will always be situations without proper or complete resolution. Systems intended to solve too many or all future disputes will always devolve into a state, imho.   Additionally, I would think in many cases a person who accepted an indentured servant contract, as owner, might lose quite a bit in reputation markets. So it may be that those types of contracts would be exceedingly rare.   My plan for society is one person plus their weapons, social/business contacts, and reputation markets will be enough to resolve the vast majority of disputes peacefully."

Thankfully, the information age and the internet is making it harder than ever to execute this strategy.   They are still trying, but it cost a lost more then simply controlling a tiny percentile of people in the mainstream media.   That is good, because their control costs are going up, at the exact same time that they are going bankrupt, and so it must divert from other people they pay off, causing great internal strife and contention."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dyr66,Faceh,0,Mon Jul 20 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Open warfare against the state is way easier than people think. The state has to have a presence for their legitimacy. Cop cars need to be recognized as such so that people know they are there. If all police were unmarked, people would generally assume they weren't there unless they got pulled over, and then there would be no way for people to know for sure they were cops anyway.  Point being, this presence issue is a major drawback in warfare, since then your enemy knows where you are. Not to mention the predictability of the state in dealing with what it considers offenses. Makes ambushes very easy."

Now it's still socialized land, but given back to the original 'owner' with somewhat favorable leases.   I don't see this ending well. The farmers are never going to have anything close to the same incentives they had to make the land productive that they had 15 years ago. At best, I'd suggest that most of them are taking this token offer to 'rent their own property from the government' as a chance to depreciate/offload the capital, milk it for everything that it's worth, and then get the hell out of Zimbabwe with what little money they can leaving the farmers a barren waste land at the end of their tenure."

Let's perform a thought experiment.  If I were to do a survey of all the crime statistics on Alexes in the world(there are men and women both who are named Alex), the statistics will reveal that most Alexes who were attacked, robbed, raped or murdered by non-Alexes(that is people whose names are NOT Alex). Does that mean there is a systematic attempt by the non-Alexes to eliminate all the people by the name Alex?  The fact is, most people don't care about the people named Alexes. Most crime is done by choosing people at random and not by a certain name. Most crime is also done by the scums of the society.  Feminists also pull the same shit as you are doing (in fact I first came up with this thought experiment when a feminist in my social circle claimed that the proof of sexual harassment of women by men is a proof of sexism and rape culture, that is a systematic harassment and suppression of women by men who are taught to rape women).

What I have not heard anyone consider yet is that if the dollar collapses, then all those short positions are meaningless. The only thing left will be long physical and all the paper positions will be null and void. All contracts denominated in dollars will be worthless.  Consider the following:   $1 billion shorting gold $1 billion long gold   after a dollar collapse it will look like this:   $1 billion shorting gold $1 billion long gold   Possession of the hard assets will be all that matters.

I would distinguish between faith in the collective and people merely acting in concert with one another. A collective believes that only actions formed together would create success.  For example, did Thomas Edison create the light bulb as an individual or do the people in the community around him get credit? As Obama would say ""he didn't build that alone"". So I see a difference in how we view these achievements. I think this is important, because a collectivist will insist that future projects must occur through the collective and be planned as such.   distinguish between a good collective and a bad collective, right   If you make such a distinction, then i would say it's the distinction of people acting as individuals in a market versus an actual collective. So I contend the things we consider good are really just individuals and not collectives.  Another example, were the wright brothers inventing the airplane as a collective or as individuals?"
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dzaob,acusticthoughts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:21 2015 UTC,"For example, did Thomas Edison create the light bulb as an individual or do the people in the community around him get credit? As Obama would say ""he didn't build that alone"".   He of course gets credit as the inventor; but also, Thomas Edisons don't just randomly appear out of the aether. They're a rare, potential outcome of a combination of factors, including genetics (intelligence, creativity, attention span, etc.,), place in history (he lived in a sweet spot where there was enough already known before him to where it was possible for one human to make the jump to the lightbulb, but no one else had done it yet), and a society where there was enough wealth and prosperity already that a person can be able to spend what under other circumstances would be an inordinate amount of time conducting research and experimentation. So, he definitely did it and he's definitely a genius, but his genius was enabled by his environment. If we had plucked Edison from his time period and thrown him back two hundred years, he probably still would've done something interesting, but it wouldn't have been a light bulb. I suspect you'll disagree with this view, but I don't think that it necessarily implies that projects must occur through the collective. Indeed, it is only because we have random, free geniuses that major leaps happen. You can incentivize them with money and protection and maybe fame to produce more or better, but geniuses tend to be the sort of intrinsically-motivated people who you just need to leave alone. The best resource for a genius is another genius; in theory, this is what universities should be for, not for attempting to spray a veneer of educability onto someone with zero intellectual curiosity. You can't lock scientists in a room and tell them they can only leave when they've figured out quantum computing, for instance. The ""collective"" is worse off under such abuse.  I think the Wright brother question would be answered in the same fashion."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dzaob,acusticthoughts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"but his genius was enabled by his environment.    Exactly, the environment, not the collective. It might be a subtle difference, but I think it's still relevant. Kinda like when Van Brun and the other nazi scientists were removed from germany and taken to the US. They weren't dependent on the german collective, but could be just as productive anywhere really. So they were smart individuals that were exploited by others.    If we had plucked Edison from his time period and thrown him back two hundred years, he probably still would've done something interesting, but it wouldn't have been a light bulb. I suspect you'll disagree with this view,    I actually agree with you, this is my point. Great individuals are great regardless of where you transplant them.   The same can't be said about collectives. Try transplanting a collective (e.g. USSR) to somewhere else and it'll fail. In fact I'd say all collectives eventually fail anyway.   The best resource for a genius is another genius; in theory, this is what universities should be for, not for attempting to spray a veneer of educability onto someone with zero intellectual curiosity.    Again I agree and I'd say we're perfectly aligned in views here. The problem with college today is that it's become polluted by collectivist views. They ignore the individual, put a cookie cutter program in place and expect it to produce the same results. The only reason it produces anything still today though is because of individuals that happen to be there. great individuals today are quiting college prior to graduation, which according to the collective is not the right formula and yet it still works."

Social capital is an incredibly important trait for a polity.  All of us benefit more from the summed positive social externalities of those around us than we contribute.  If we lost this, transaction costs would go through the roof, trust would break down, barbarism would increase, capital would erode, and we and your libertarianism would be no more. Genetic similarity governs the generation of social capital.  What this means is that, while pure meritocracy is valuable for an economy and society, we can't take it to such marginal lengths that we cause balkanization and counter-productive depletion of social capital.  Prescription?  Import high racial outliers, but not their lower performers, as we lose more in total in the macro than anyone gains in the micro.   If a libertarian can understand this, then it may make sense why there have been these strangely entrenched 'racists' here.  Many libertarians actually go on to become white nationalists.

In the same way, a macro-level phenomena, such as white flight, is no exception. In this sense, individualism is irrelevant to ""racism"", not necessarily opposed to it.  This is what I meant by race realists talking in terms of political externalities. You are merely restating the intuition of any first-year libertarian, you're just making a bigger deal out of it.

If statistics were to show that an overwhelming majority of one group, all else being equal, failed to perform as well as another group, it's reasonable to suspect any given member of the former group of performing worse than any given member of the latter group, pending further evidence. If, in the face of evidence, a person were to say that the person from the lower-average group couldn't possibly have outperformed the person from the higher-average group, simply by virtue of their membership (or even arbitrary inclusion) in such groups, that would be stupid, collectivist thinking, but that isn't what NRx-type ""race realism"" is driving at.   A lot of the point is: the apparent disparities between, say, whites and blacks, necessitate further statist control mechanisms inasmuch as we accept the premise that all humans are basically equal... because if we're trying hard to be egalitarian, but there are still differences in performance, we must not really be trying, and more severe measures are justified. But what if it's a flawed premise?  You're right; there is no gene for ""does good in school"", but there are genes which affect, say, dopamine and serotonin, which in turn modulate potential (not actuality, just potential) for the ability to defer gratification, keep attention, maintain interest, etc.,... and those things are major factors in success.  We accept that things like schizophrenia, depression, etc., can largely be a function of one's genes. If those things are debilitating, we say, ""Wow, that's awful."" But if we discover that such things are more common among folks of a certain descent, must we then say, ""Wow, that's awful... but it has nothing to do with the one common thread all these people have""?

No, I suppose you can't entirely, but you can get fairly close. Beyond a certain point, this becomes less about race and statistical analysis, and more about philosophy of science and epistemology. My point is that we have sufficiently strong enough reason to suspect that there are racial effects; your argument against that is that it's difficult or impossible to conclusively demonstrate-- which I don't think is actually a refutation, it's more of an ""even if it's there, we probably can't know"".

It's part of why capitalism is so appealing; it's built upon an essentially hopeful premise. You, too, can be rich!  What do you say about correlations between average national IQ and prosperity? High-IQ nations are virtually always prosperous, and virtually always predominantly white or Asian, ethnically. The average IQ of most African nations is pretty abysmal by western standards... and it's probably always been that way. There's a reason why no great civilizations have ever sprung up in (sub-Saharan) Africa, I think.

But that's always the way it is, right? It's so easy to break things, and so extremely difficult to optimize.   Primarily a function of early training and experience.    Studies have been conducted showing that early-childhood ability to defer gratification strongly predicts future success in life, educational achievement, etc.,... and another set of studies showed that the ability to defer gratification strongly varies by ethnicity. The logical implication from these studies is that long-term success is probably fairly strongly a function of race.  I say this, and I don't regard it as particularly fortunate. It'd be great if everyone had an infinite capacity for willing themselves into betterment, but I'm not convinced that's the case... and the alternative is the implication that the poor situation of blacks (in America, at least) has to do with institutional racism on the part of Evil Whitey, and not to do with inherent problems in their DNA (at least by the standards by which we assess success in the West; different place, different standards, different selection pressures).  I don't know a single person who would pass over a superior black person for an inferior white person with respect to any given job, simply as a matter of race.

You can just as easily go to poor white majority areas with an anti-intellectual hick culture that will produce idiots for generations as well, and where actually intelligent people will purposefully not learn things to hide their intelligence from a culture that disdains it.   Sure, but there's a difference between an average high-IQ population having subcultures that hate intelligence, and higher-IQ folk in that population having to hide their intelligence, versus an average low-IQ population having a primary culture that hates intelligence, in part because high intelligence is not a feature of that group. Alternatively: if culture and IQ interplay as strongly as you suggest, where would how would we even get high IQ from in the first place? What about twin studies where one twin goes to a family of one culture, the other stays in its native culture, and despite the differences in environment, IQ ends up approximately the same, with high reliability. Doesn't this suggest a strong genetic/racial component to intelligence, and imply the possibility of a strong genetic/racial component to other features of cognition?   Yes, but you can easily create a non-delaying child by giving them a broken and unstable home, or a culture of high time-preference generally.    I think that using an example of what amounts to child abuse to show that the environmental factors in time-preference are stronger than the genetic factors really only demonstrates that negative environmental factors in time-preference can overpower genetic factors when the environment is sufficiently negative...

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dvl0x,Erebus_Black,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"While animals are property, Rights Companies can state have animal rights as part of their plan if people in the area are against animal abuse. Perhaps the animal rights (private through rights agencies and arbitrators) could include protection when saving animals from abuse.   It's most probable that those who run the dog fights would have a rights organization protecting them. The monthly cost of enforcing basic animal rights would be very small, a price most communities' average member could afford.   And because it is economically efficient for rights organizations to have similar law, they would probably also have protection of animal rights. So they would likely lose in the arbitration courts and either have to pay a fine and likely end the dog-fighting ring. In the contract of a rights organization, one would agree to listen to an arbitrator and respect the decision. If they refused, their rights organization would have no choice but to sever the contract with the man running the dog-fighting ring.   If they lost their contract with their rights organization, they would likely end the dogfighting ring due to social pressure. This is because they would have nobody to represent their rights and since people would be aware of the dogfighting, other people would have less of a risk to seize the dogs and take them to the pound or whatever organization they wish. While this is theft, there would be nothing the man could do because he would have nobody to represent his rights.   This kind of question seems to come up a lot, let it be animal rights, nature preserves, or whatever the common value. Communities would likely represent the values of the people living there and if the people living there care about animal rights or nature preserves or whatever, that value would be the implicit law of the land (so long that the cost of enforcing that value is low enough for the rights organizations to charge their customers to enforce it. This is why anti-drug laws would be rare due to the high cost and low effectiveness of enforcement).  TL;DR: Read Part III of The Machinery of Freedom"

Dog fights and other such aesthetically non-preferable acts (not to diminish their gut-wrenching nature) would still likely occur underground because of the social stigma that goes along with it. Our feelings and attitudes about it wouldn't change, and there'd likely be a similar (compensationally-speaking) sentence in an ancap society that would deter and prevent such acts from happening."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dvl0x,McGobs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:25:37 2015 UTC,"Three points:  1) I think most ancaps do not believe in animal rights - ancaps disproportionately represent the extremes of deontology (this is not to say that hard deontologists make up the majority of ancaps, but that we are overrepresented in anarchocapitalism compared to other political movements). For a lot of us, certain things may seem distasteful (even extremely so), but this doesn't justify violating the strict principles of NAP: if rights are dependent on a certain type of anthropomorphic logic (some sort of characteristic which is unique to human beings, and this is why human beings have ethical rules for how they relate to one another), and this doesn't apply to non-human beings (that there aren't ethical rules for how we relate to animals, other than maybe how we relate to animals qua other human beings, as in appropriating animals as property to the exclusion of other peoples' use), then there's really no space for animal rights.  2) On the other hand, some of us might be weaker deontologists, intuitionists, or utilitarians who think that animals deserve some moral consideration, so we are either willing to make exceptions to general rules when it comes to animals, or we believe that the consistent application of some universal principle (e.g., the utility principle) encompasses animals as well. I could imagine an ancap who says, for instance, that certain types of uses of animals seems to him morally legitimate (that, for instance, milking or killing a cow is okay), but that certain other types (e.g., torture) are illegitimate, and thus justify an exception to a general moral rule that we should not interfere with how people use their property. This in the same way that, say, we shouldn't generally threaten people with guns, but if threatening someone with a gun is the only way to induce them to bail out a sinking ship and stop everyone from dying, it might be okay.  3) As others have mentioned, there may be ways consistent with point (1) (hard deontology) to prevent practices which we think are distasteful but aren't intrinsically unethical. For example, health insurance prices rise to take into account the costs of smoking, and this may have a deterrent effect on smoking. Abusing dogs risks a social cost (the possibility that the dog will become aggressive and harm one's neighbors) which may be calculated into legal insurance fees, or it may just be that it is viewed as so many people as unjust that legal institutions in a society include prohibitions on animal cruelty in their policies, to which their customers assent. This introduces a contractual (and therefore morally binding) obligation on adherents to a legal compact, and provides restrictions on the use of their property that would justify the use of violence to enforce."

Before person B retrieves the property person A dies. If you are able to read the comments below, I believe that property comes from self-ownership and this can only apply to the living.

Yes, people without aim is really the trivial scenario. Quite intriguing which directions you can take that. Mises talks at length of purpose and action being the attainement of ends by the use of means. So the goal, or aim is also very central to the whole of praxeology.  Mises doesn't explore the choices of aims very much because he was intentionally avoiding ethics and morality following his utilitarian approach.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dsdt9,_evokelabs_,34,Sun Jul 19 00:17:15 2015 UTC,"Well what if the boss isn't a bad businessman, but he treats his employees poorly.  Yes the people can just leave but others will take their place.   This was never really addressed directly, but I'll happily do so.  When an employee leaves his job, the boss can rarely hire someone to fill his shoes immediately.  He has to take the time to gather applicants, interview them, pick one, then train them.  This process usually takes, depending on the job, a week to a month or so.  While this is going on, there is one less employee performing the skills that there was before the employee walked out.  This means that the employer is losing money.  He also has to pay for the training.  Now, if he's a shrewd businessman, it will quickly dawn on him that it's in his best interest, if he wants to make a profit, to treat his employees better than his competitor.  He will then be able to retain the employee, and not incur the cost of re-hiring and re-training a new employee."

People seem to forget that capitalist not only benefit consumers, but they also benefit employees. And just like consumers can get screwed over, so can employees. We all know the best way to deal with companies that give us bad services, if we can't get our money back, we bitch and moan and then we find somewhere else to shop. The same is true for employers, the difference being, employers are paying you while they screw you over. And I use the term screw in a loose sense. Most employers are just trying to make their business work the best they can, employees should anticipate that their employers may put them in situations they would rather not be in. So people should always keep their options open."

I don't think there's any hope for the many people like him. They really want to take everyone businesses for themselves, and hurt/kill anyone who gets in their way.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dsdt9,chbrules,25,Sun Jul 19 03:16:23 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting try but as a former ancom I think you should consider approaching future encounters with left-anarchists with the following criteria:  Ask them to tell you which they prioritize, elimination of poverty or elimination of inequalities. Don't let them weasel out of it by saying they want both at the same time, make them stake a claim for one over the other. Their answer will tell you everything you need to know.  If they prioritize elimination of poverty then you can open up a dialogue about  how you feel ancap/crypo-anarchism/technology can achieve this goal far better than collectivization. You'll find mostly market anarchists, agorists, post-left anarchists in this category.   If they tell you elimination of inequalities is more important they are batshit insane and you should not waste your time. Most of the ancom SJWs fall into this category.  Understand that ancom is just an ideology for them to subsidize their own inefficiencies, rather than actually working on individual improvement. Elimination of poverty without elimination of economic inequalities/heirarchies would be the absolute worst thing imaginable for ancoms, because all their ideological leverage would dissolve, rendering them nothing more than the emotionally crippled SJWs they are."

I myself am not very fond of reaching out to leftists and collectivists in general. The first way to confront them is to use good knowledgeable and insightful arguments to show them you know more than they do in a frank and heartful manner. And hope the humble, curious and open-minded ones will want to learn more.  The other approach is to expose their lies, manipulative arguments and dishonesty, like you do about their class warfare commitment. This will appeal to other people listening which will be warned to be suspicious of leftists and collectivists, and eventually they will know you are right and want to learn more about liberty, peacefulness and social cooperation."

You want to appeal to people that are sincere, honest and that value thoughtful arguments, so you have to be deeply thoughtful, sincere and knowledgeable.  If you know the person is antagonistic and stuborn, then you can expose them, confront their lies like you did in this video, and expect the listeners will identify with that, and you should make that part of the point. When you make the video, add a comment, introduction or closing argument inviting open-minded people, that want to know more, to leave comments and messages, and to watch another of your videos that approaches those same themes.  When these people contact you back, you will be able to know what was the effect the argument had on them. You can improve your approach, be more communicative, use the right emotional tone or level of abstraction. You tune it for the different people that might be listening to your message.  You have awesome motivation and dedication and it inspires me also. You will keep improving and there the results will improve also.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dsdt9,Hhtura,2,Sun Jul 19 10:59:39 2015 UTC,"You are taking it all the wrong way. My recommendation was not criticism about your approach as if it had shortcomings. Your arguments are good and I know how much you dedicated and made an effort to achieve it. I already appreciate it.  I was trying to reply to your question ""If they don't work, what is there left to do?"" I know that even with our best efforts, most people don't have a positive reaction to approaching them about freedom, private property rights or individualism. But as we improve ourselves the results do improve, we fine tune our ideas and adjust it to different situations and different people. Some people are more emotional and empathic, others are more self-reliant and unconventional, and so on, you can have many different ways to talk to them.  It is not a responsibility to improve, I know you are already doing an excellent effort. It is an opportunity, because I see you are motivated in doing these exchanges and even documenting them.  Think of it as the different people that speak or write about Anarcho-capitalism and freedom to not always sympathetic audience. In a general way, some that do some amazing works similar to yours are Larken Rose, Kal Molinet, Adam Kokesh, Christopher Cantwell, and Jeff Berwick. They interact with specific people and try to reach to them with new ideas about freedom and social cooperation. Each have their general aproaches, different emotional tones and themes. My suggestion is that as you keep doing what you are doing, you will improve and get better results.  Watch some of the first Larken Rose videos, they were already very good, the guy is doing amazing work very few people could compare with. And after some years you can see his latest videos, and see differences in arguments and frame of mind. He is improving and achieving better results. Adam Kokesh also changed some things in his way to talk to people the last few years, and he even recorded approaching people in the street. Kal Molinet's is simply amazing at what he does, even if I bet less than one in ten are going to follow through and change their minds on being statists. It is not his responsibility to improve on what he does, but with so much dedication and brilliant effort, he surely will improve also.  Alright, this gave me an idea. You have excelent videos and themes, you should contact some of these guys. They would surely give you much better advice than I could.  One thing I learned recently which made a huge difference is the study of Psychologist Johnathan Haidt. He recently interviewed with Tom Woods and you should definetely listen it. The basic gist of what he says is that people have these six specific core moral principles. They don't deviate from with abstract reasoning almost never, even when the arguments they listen to are rigorous and valuable. So how do you reach through? He talks about being more empathic in arguments, instigating curiosity and a sense of wonder. I didn't explore much of what he said yet, it does sound interesting.  Haidt makes the point that some people are heavy mental systemitizers, and most people are not. I recognize I am very systematic that way, and that makes it harder to adapt the usual ideas I have to appeal to most people. I don't think it is impossible, and it should be very interesting also, it is just a deep change of focus I have to dedicate to."

From the ones I cited, he seems like the one to best give a positive frame to his arguments, in terms of people who are not good systematizers but empathizers instead. And his actual conceptual content is not that much different from none of the others. It is very curious.  Other guys that look like they are doing something in that direction are the guys in Peace Propaganda podcast. it is an entirely different approach because they cover many different topics like worldnews and pop art also."

It's those listening to the debate you are most likely to convince.

Much of this has to do with describing how ""capitalism"" (used here to mean the current state of affairs) works, operates, perpetuates itself, etc. I don't think these insights should be ignored just because the same people making these arguments usually hold particular normative attitudes.  Try this for example."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dsti6,TheMadMullah,5,Sun Jul 19 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"I think this may be outdated. The example used in the comic, filming police, is a recognized protected activity under the 1st amendment since 2012. Any police officer giving you a order (not a suggestion or request) for you to stop filming has clearly violated your first amendment rights, and is culpable for damages under 1983. There's no situation in which a police officer can legally make you stop recording. If you're allowed to be somewhere, you're allowed to film there. Any time they try to exercise that claim, they open themselves to 1983 suits, even if there's no damages.   The same with detainment without RAS, cops using excessive force during arrests/detainment, cops entering without a warrant and/or probably cause, using legal open carry as RAS for a T-Stop and probably a few others I'm forgetting. All these things can and have been used as the basis for successful (successful defined as suits raised and won or settled) against police officers.   Qualified immunity is bullshit, but slapping a 100K lawsuit on cops that you can file yourself in 10 minutes for free is a pretty big disincentive for them to act like assholes. More people should do it."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dsti6,Celtictussle,2,Sun Jul 19 07:34:45 2015 UTC,"How much of a disincentive is it, though, if when suing a cop means that their employers (taxpayers) are the ones who end up having to pay? It's not like the officer ends up getting their pay docked for the damages, or the department will have to wear the itchy, cheap uniforms for a while now because officers Jones and Smith screwed up and violated somebody's rights."

I'm not 100% sure how that part works. I thought 1983 was supposed to hold them personally accountable. Basically it breaks that veil of duty that a reasonable officer would have doing reasonable things on the job simply because they're being unreasonable.   BUT it seems there are exceptions to that and departments do sometimes pay for 1983 claims now. I don't know how to why that works the way it does. Hey...at least you get a fat payday?? Amirite? It seems like they usually settle these things out of court immediately. I'm no expert but it seems like the normative putative damage request for these things is not more than 100K, and it seems like in the above mentioned type of cases (T-Stop with no RAS, search with no warrant or probable cause, 1st on restriction of public speech/collection of information, 2nd on legal carry etc) generally just get settled quickly.

A mined asteroid should produce about $10 trillion worth of value above its harvesting cost.  As I said, the cost of mining the gold from an asteroid would actually be incidental to the cost of mining iron and nickel, which would be the primary targets of such an endeavor.  Gold would essentially be one of the leftover rare-metal constituents, a by-product requiring marginal work to refine further.  And again, sunlight in space is free.  The real problem with space mining is the upfront cost of designing and building the first spaceborne solar-concentrator furnace. Most of the materials of that first one must be lifted into space at enormous cost.  But thereafter it will produce building materials in space and subsequent structures will be far cheaper.

Yep.  Sure gold will hold some value, but it won't even be at today's level, nowhere near, potentially millions of times less than now.  We're entering a time period where no physical objects will be as rare as they were, only digital objects can hold their rarity in the future, as ironic as that seems.  First space will drastically increase the amount of material humanity controls, all kinds of material, and then it will do it again when intergalaxy travel is invented, and as robots become ubiquitous.

When you do, or perhaps if you do since you are making awfully bold pronouncements for one who is by that means displaying gross ignorance about monetary theory and use--when you do you'll find that the qualities that make gold a good money / medium-of-exchange exist in bitcoin as well, and that bitcoin has a few more qualities that gold can't touch. Things like fungibility, easy verification of quality, easy storage, non-rusting, etc., they share, but bitcoin can transfer value digitally--gold cannot. Bitcoin has guaranteed scarcity, gold does not. Bitcoin takes up no space, gold takes up a lot. Etc.   I would venture to guess that china's investment in gold will turn out a damn site better then your investment in bitcoin.    On a percent basis, I've already made far more on my bitcoin than they have on gold. Only China's rulers are an old-guard, pre-internet, and understand gold. They don't understand bitcoin.

You'll basically not accomplish this, or it will be accomplished at a vastly diminished rate compared with, say, property holdings. But if everything goes wrong, you could suddenly find the system unwilling or unable to enforce your property claims... but your gold and silver will be quite portable, and there's a decent chance that any established society will accept them as having value.  Ultimately, I figure, the best investments are in one's skills, abilities, knowledge, and networking. Those things cannot be forcibly removed from you."

You haven't researched the topic very well or very deeply then. The network effect and path dependence make this very unlikely.   MySpace had a massive headstart over Facebook. The network effect was all in its favor. We know how that turned out. Argument from network effect is insufficient to support your claim.  I'm of the opinion that bitcoin will fade away in 5-10 years, to be replaced by other cryptocurrencies. Due to the low friction of cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency transactions such a switch can happen in a matter of months. There will likely be a set of commonly used cryptocurrencies each with different properties best suited for different purposes. The more established cryptocurrencies might be accepted by the market as a good store of wealth, while others with quick confirmation times will be used for POS transactions."

The idea of money transfer without fees is super cool, but bitcoin will not hold a monopoly on it for long.  Nothing is certain in this world. That is true. I simply see less risk in gold then I do bitcoin. And that is saying something coming from me because I believe gold to be overvalued.   My perspective is this. People are really, really, really exited about bitcoin. As an investor, this actually turn me off a bit. To me irrational excitement screams bubble. While bitcoin may always have a place in transaction, this selling point alone is not enough for me to own any.  Yes, it has no fees. Yes, it is inflation proof. Yes, you can send it at the speed of light all over the world. I would rather hold wealth in a number of other investments. To this day I am unconvinced of its worth, and I have known of bitcoin from the time I could have purchased one coin for 2 pennies, if my memory serves.   Bitcoin feels like a penny stock. Something is funny about the whole ordeal. I fear my fellow ancaps may get burned hard one day soon. I hope not.

The risk that I expose myself to by holding bitcoins is that their value fluctuates wildly and is more likely to crash to zero than many other investments. On the other hand, by converting my bitcoins to other digital assets such as dollars or stocks / bonds that are actually controlled by financial institutions, I'm exposing myself to the risk that I may be denied access to my own wealth. That is, you don't really own dollars or stocks because there are gatekeepers that must approve your requests to access your wealth.  I could convert my assets into physical dollars or precious metals / other assets, but those are incredibly difficult to secure against physical theft.

Years after, nay centuries after bitcoin is nothing but a fun historical relic gold will hold value of some kind.   it's funny you mention this. gold, and other monetary tokens, were useful during humanity's history when people didn't have such quick, far-reaching communication. but even hundreds of years ago, when empires spanned across continents and oceans, people began issuing lines of credit that they wrote down on paper, because even at that point, lugging around and handing over physical tokens wasn't fast enough. my little prediction, since we're making predictions, is that future societies will look back at cryptocurrency as the logical next step in the evolution of money."

While gold has a huge history behind it, bitcoin actually solves many problems that money should solve in a manner far better than gold ever can.  I do think the two can coexist, and probably will. Gold is very useful for storing large amounts of value, but it's not that great for day to day transactions. Bitcoin is awesome at transactions and is ethereal, rather than physical, but it's difficult to store without a trusted third party in a safe manner (though hardware wallets aren't too bad and paper wallets do work)."

Dogecoin changed its protocol so that it's infinitely inflationary--as an Austrian I dislike that and thus wouldn't deal in doge.  Besides which, the whole idea behind those who pushed dogecoin was based on the theory that bitcoin's value was created purely by news-hype-stories, and they figured they could defeat bitcoin by generating more press than bitcoin had.   They learned the hard way that news is not the only reason bitcoin's price went up.  And while you can clone bitcoin, ala dogecoin, you cannot clone the developers working on bitcoin and not working on dogecoin, nor all the other devs.  Look at the recent financial hackathon, out of some 40 devs, 2-3 decided to hack on visa's network, another 3-4 on mastercard, and the rest on bitcoin.

Yeah, it would be a lot simpler as a consumer to just let the government take 80% of your money and provide almost everything you need. It would also be simpler for me to take 20k in cash and give it to a stranger and tell them to buy me a car.

Guess what happens when some gangbanger gets his tib/fib blown up? Ortho admits him and does the floor work/surgery/post-op for free.   People simply don't understand the unique difference between Medical Care and Health Care   I picked up this from a Thomas Sowell lecture over twenty years ago I think you can still find on youtube today.  He pointed out this exact fact, that we do have universal coverage in America, no one is denied service.  The people in Canada can't believe it, I then ask them about their hospital experience, usually they haven't had to go ('take 7k a year for your life and that's a second house for all those services never used' -stefan molyneux) and when they did it was minor but took them over 4 hours for a simple emergency visit- basically its a whole day ordeal.  Ask them if they had their health card and they start to see your trailing them along.  I'll tell them that as a young child I would go to the emergency room with my siblings and be left in the corner, refused to be looked at because we did not have a green card.  You try to explain to the lady our coverage but they will not act until the administration work has been processed, same with the OHIP cards.  This is not universal medical care, it is a sick warped system of subsided health care.  FCUK OFFFFFF even the paper last week had an article about how the doctors here don't even know how to diagnose modern illnesses.  Can you imagine if we just let someone from the 80s practice medicine under a dated license when the science evolved so much.  I had a doctor in Ontario's McMaster hospital tell me I had a fucking bone bend. I had to go back to Michigan on weekends just to see a specialist cause I needed therapy, in Canada it was a non-issue, just keep it in a sling and let it heal wrong!    I have gone to my family doctor several times here about my reproductive system, he seems more put off by the topic then me.  When I have legitimate worries about my digestive tract he does a look around and gives me the wait and see routine, not even remembering my earlier problems or if they would be related... so I am going to have to make a trip back to Michigan to have a doctor poke inside my asshole and make sure my balls are fine cause I can't ride a bike comfortably and the doctors here don't give a fuck if I had cancer or was dying.  --- ill be amazed if anyone read that through, I stared out so civil but broke down into one of my rants"

During the 1920s for example, Blacks belonged to an estimated 600 fraternal societies in New Orleans alone, that offered the services of a physician. (Encyclopedia of Social Welfare History in North America, P. 248).  Doctors didn't like that. They were the ones competing to be lodge doctors, competing for customers, and through regulation, have stopped that practice entirely.   In fact, you can find a good examples, such as labor unions, that were enforced through the state, because of racist attitudes. By requiring companies to hire from labor unions (who openly didn't allow non-whites), blue collar whites were able to keep blacks and immigrants from lowering the value of their labor.  There are numerous examples of orphanages, womens shelters, and homeless shelters without government subsidies. The state monopolizing welfare has actually contributed significantly to increasing poverty, the opposite of its intended effect. A fact I bring up very often when talking with ""altruistic"" statists."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dqf72,TheMadMullah,6,Sat Jul 18 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"Medicare rate sheets are never address in this conversation.   The Federal government sets prices for every covered medical procedure for Medicare. All treatments have different codes, and they represent the reimbursement for various procedures for docs covering Medicare patients.   The rates are redonkulous however. If you've ever seen a $400 bandage treatment at an ER, that's the max rate Medicare will reimburse, it's not like an accurate market representation of the costs involved in wrapping someone with a bandage. Since 50% of a doctor's business is Medicare, they just use that as their base costs. Insurance companies negotiate lower rates by bulk, but doctors don't have any incentive to create a new payment schedule for the 1% of patients not covered by either Medicare/Medicaid or insurance.   I absolutely guarantee you that every price on that list is 100% accurate to the medicare fee schedule. Simply put, it's government price controls.   SIDE NOTE: Another quirk about medicare rate sheets is that procedures or treatments not covered have more or less gone out of existence in common medical practice. After all, why should a doctor engage in a treatment which at least 50% of his patients can't pay him for? Remember when people used to get B12 shots when they were feeling sluggish during the winter? Yeah, that treatment doesn't have a code, so it doesn't happen anymore, despite being pretty effective."

Like almost all things first conceptualized, most everything comes out of the private sector and not from government. DARPA net was an improvement on something that had already been developed in the private sector and was not specifically for government. 2 universities came up with an open data transfer protocol that allowed 2 (maybe more, not sure) computers to talk with one another and share information. This was BEFORE government supposedly created a crude version of the internet in the early 80's  *Edit: Citation needed."

The internet itself was completely invented by private companies. All the first tier 1 isp, all the first network hardware, came out of private companies.

The DOD took Cerf and Kahn away from their private companies to develop military communication technology. They developed the start of the ip protocol. But it was not until they contracted out to BBN technologies (now raytheon) that they actually developed TCPIP itself.    In the 1970s, BBN created Telenet, Inc., to run the first public packet-switched network.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies   It is a military contractor, primarily for DARPA,  Some of BBN's notable developments in the field of computer networks are the implementation and operation of the ARPANET; the first person-to-person network email [18] and the use of the @ sign in an email address;[19] the first Internet protocol router (then called an Interface Message Processor);[20] the Voice Funnel, an early predecessor of voice over IP; and work on the development of TCP.   http://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/bbn/  Check out their website, they have some cool tech on there.

The capitalistic parts are nice, the socialistic ones spoil it. Get rid of the socialistic parts and its even more capitalistic. And, so we would argue, better. The capitalistic parts are good and still manage to generate great benefits in spite of the problems, and we can still point out these problems without hypocrisy.  Suffice it to say, the easy answer is: ""Yes, as we can see many good things are created under corporatism, can't you just imagine how many more good things would be created under purer Capitalism?""  We're arguing for better, and while the status quo is not ideal, it could certainly be worse. It could be full-on socialism. Which is to say the choice is not between 'corporatism is bad' and 'capitalism is good,' its more like '(pure) capitalism is better than corporatism is better than socialism,' for most values we care about.

It doesn't have to be one or the other.  For example, the tech industry has been more free than the telecom industry, so we see lots more of the ""wonderful things we enjoy"" in tech.  In telecom we get Comcast."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dpizl,Washbag,10,Sat Jul 18 05:46:41 2015 UTC,"As a free market socialist, I definitely recognize that same sliding scale. I do not, however, take seriously the ideas that certain revisions or reductions of second-order regulations meaningfully contribute to a 'freer economy'. There is no satisfying instance of a determinable, 'freer market than otherwise' - at least in first-world mixed economies. They have let the ideologies of capitalism, as we presently and historically have experienced it, infect their visions of what 'free markets' are supposed to look like. Markets are structurally distorted by state actions, not just at the tip of their operations. Existing distributions of capital and land, for example, are entirely artificial and created through violence and regulatory bureaucracies. That alone creates widespread and relatively unpredictable metastatic effects on everyday market interactions.  All the achievements they praise are usually technological, and can exist without e.g. pillaging, enslaving, and controlling the third world. (I'm not saying that an-caps directly advocate this, but they unwittingly support an ideology and a system that justifies it.) Or really without any of the kinds of economic events we see today. We don't need our economic lives determined by irrational corporate command economies just as bureaucratic and inefficient as the USSR. A distant factory sweatshop can produce $2 Nike shoes, i.e. their literal real cost, sell it own its own terms, without international intellectual property law delegating ownership of that produce to Nike so they can sell it at a mark-up. And so, and so on.  An-caps at times pay lip service to this idea. ""Capitalism is not corporatism"" and all that. They don't take it nearly far enough, though, and that is the essential point I take from this image. We do live in corporatism, as they recognize. We also live in an overriding structure of corporatism that structurally distorts markets as we have experienced them. Markets are controlled by governments not just at their surface, but at their roots. We might want to go back to our roots, to people like Thomas Hodgskin, Benjamin Tucker, Proudhon's circle circa 1848 and start championing the causes of labour against capitalism, or socialism, as we once did. After all, we find massive acts of government violence and regulatory distortion in favour of the causes of capital, against the causes of labour, everywhere and always. Maybe it happens to be that markets are also capitalistic, in a different way, by their essential nature. There's much less evidence for that, though, especially given how urgently state-capitalist governments attend to controlling markets in the interests of capitalists. Why has capital not been able to reign on its own, and why have they declared, always so urgently at events in the past, that ""capital must be protected"" - in the words of Marquis of Lansdowne? Anarcho-capitalism is so awkward and disconnected from its spiritual predecessors. I really don't get it anymore."

Existing distributions of capital and land, for example, are entirely artificial and created through violence and regulatory bureaucracies.   I don't agree with that.  We aren't living under feudalism with ownership arbitrarily parceled out to favorite lords.  If you work and make some money and build a house or start a business, you own those things.  That's not artificial, and my house isn't created through violence.   All the achievements they praise are usually technological, and can exist without e.g. pillaging, enslaving, and controlling the third world.   What modern capitalists are doing that to the third world?   I'm not saying that an-caps directly advocate this, but they unwittingly support an ideology and a system that justifies it.   Can you explain this?  How does my ideology support slavery?   We also live in an overriding structure of corporatism that structurally distorts markets as we have experienced them.    OK but I think you may be missing my point. Yes, corporatism distorts markets, but less corporatism distorts markets less.  Also, you completely are ignoring the fact that capitalists also get the shaft in our corporatist system.  For some reason you seem to have a massive preference towards laborers.  There are a shit load of people who start businesses, invest a ton of money, and are driven into the ground by regulatory compliance or unfair worker litigation.   especially given how urgently state-capitalist governments attend to controlling markets in the interests of capitalists.   I think you are incorrect here.  Unions have incredible political pull all over the world.  Sure, hedge fund managers get political help, but not your medium sized business owner.  Or even large ones.  It really depends on the specific market - telecom, healthcare, finance all get huge help.  Retail, tech, and service more broadly...not as much.  I think you have this erroneous view that it's capitalists vs. the world, but really it's just the state and whoever is more politically connected (or who helps keep the state in power, i.e. welfare recipients) vs everyone else.   Anarcho-capitalism is so awkward and disconnected from its spiritual predecessors.   I would not count those people as its spiritual predecessors.  You are just picking and choosing those that you align with.  Also your arguments are fairly vague.  I would like to respond to your points if you could be more specific or provide examples."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dpizl,WallyHilliard,5,Sat Jul 18 07:06:16 2015 UTC,"For some reason you seem to have a massive preference towards laborers.   The reason poster Nomenklatura does this is of the most importance.  The debate has been framed as ""capital"" vs. ""labor""--one factor of production vs. another factor of production. Why in the world would we construct a debate over that? It makes no sense, right?  Why not argue ""the state"" vs. ""everyone else"" as you suggest?  There is only one clear answer to this question of why we've got the whole world divided between people who are lined up in favor of one factor of production or another: Marxism is like a secularized version of Christian Millenialism that has at its core an eschatological progression where society evolves from lesser orders eventually to the highest--i.e. the Kingdom of God on Earth.  Being materialistic and deterministic, the Marxist epochs progress based on hierarchical factors of production: land, then capital, and finally labor.  So feudalism (landism), gave way to capitalism, which (when ""Jesus comes back"") will finally be followed by communism (proletarianism or laborism).  So ""capitalism"" is an eschatological epoch--not an ""ideology""; and besides, there is no such thing as ideology given that all this is determined by material forces.   So the answer to the question of why we are all fighting for factor of production A vs. factor of production B is that just about all of Marxism's opponents since the 19th century have stupidly accepted Marxism's own false dichotomy and adopted Marxism's label ""capitalist"" as though its an ideology.  Meanwhile the actual Marxists use the word ""capitalist"" when engaging their opponents as though ""capitalism"" is an ""ideology"" even though they all know that there is no such thing as ""ideology"" and snicker to each other about how easily they can duplicitously confound their opponents."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dpizl,AltLiberty,4,Sat Jul 18 05:26:29 2015 UTC,"Capitalism is generally responsible for positive outcomes while corporatism and monopolies are generally responsible for negative outcomes.   To use the US economy as an example, every single one of the top fifty Fortune corporations had been bailed out of bankruptcy at least once by the US state before 1980.  It doesn't seem possible to isolate a pure capitalism and say ""that happened, that was big, and it was completely independent of the state."" When I look around at all of the technology in a room, virtually every invention is linked with the state in some way. And almost without exception, every actual product based on that invention was produced by a corporation propped up by the state.  A few big ones, such as the technology being used to send this message, was invented and created by industry almost exclusively dependent on the state: military technology and state war/defense industry.  If I wanted to find things that were pure capitalism, as defined by anarcho-capitalists, I'd be pretty limited. Illegal products and markets might be an example. Individual technological breakthroughs, perhaps, but only up to the point that they need to be mass produced, wherein they immediately benefit from the state in the form of corporate existence, support, etc.  I see very little in the actual economy that is independent of the state. And the more significant the thing, the more state involvement. If we go back in time, things get worse: we start to see institutions such as chattel slavery with major roles in the economy."

The claim anarcho-capitalists make is that they are due to a ""free market,"" not the state, or that it happened despite the state. But this is a claim that can't be verified at all. There is no empirical basis for it. All we can do is describe what actually happened: the state has consistently subsidized and supported virtually all major industry and all major corporations.  Would the exact same historical trajectory be reproduced without the state? Maybe. But here is the thing: it's anarcho-capitalism that says yes. Where does the burden of proof rest, then? It doesn't seem to rest upon those who, in making an empirical observation of state participation in the economy, say, ""the state has had a major role in all of that."" I mean, is anyone denying state involvement and support? That's not the controversial claim or the point in dispute. The claim in dispute is that it all ""would have happened anyway"" without the state, or ""it would be done even better"" without the state."

Smaller companies also don't have the human resources, management structure, and advertising costs of the larger corporations, which keeps them more focused on the product."

As much as an-caps want to pretend that they just mean ""the free market"", or whatever, when they talk about capitalism, they always package-deal with it concepts about what free markets would look like, what they would support, and what kind of institutions would thrive in them. Funny enough, it always looks like a better, more efficiently run version of what we have now. This is despite the fact that, as you mentioned, and as an-caps sometimes officially recognize, state violence and interventionism permeates the history and structure of the present economic system.

The whole debate surrounding this deal ranges from:  A) this deal will prevent them from developing  nuclear weapons. B)this deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.  what's so frustrating about the range of the debate is that they're premised on the mistaken belief that the Iranians had the capability or even the willingness to make nukes in the first place.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dqr56,SpanishDuke,4,Sat Jul 18 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"This must be indeed one of the first mentions of the term left-libertarians:   Indeed, amidst all the talk in recent years about ""litmus tests,"" it seems to me that there is one excellent litmus test which can set up a clear dividing line between genuine conservatives and neoconservatives, and between paleolibertarians and what we can now call ""left-libertarians."" And that test is where one stands on ""Doctor"" King. And indeed, it should come as no surprise that, as we shall see, there has been an increasing coming together, almost a fusion, of neocons and left-libertarians. In fact, there is now little to distinguish them.   The latest development is that the growing Politically Corectness allegiance of left-libertarians is pushing them away from neocons. It is not necessarily causal either. Neocons and Republicans were severely weakened after Bush and again in 2012. Left-libertarians as a vanguard political support group would scatter and look for alternatives, in this case the leftist vanguard and Democratic support. That is why they are so close to new feminist groups and the other latest developments in leftist social policy.  Democrats were weakened as Obama lost popularity after his first term. They are still very well funded so they can try to attract these new leftist groups, just like they are always trying new radical communists and collective anarchists to attract young votes or practice activism in colleges."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dqr56,anon338,2,Sat Jul 18 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"This profoundly insightful description of the US federal government, and centralized democracy in general is truly worth to analyse:    the legislative arm is the one that has lost most power among the three branches of government. Congress and the state legislatures are, of all branches, the only ones quickly subject to public accounting and retaliation at the polls. These are the only people we can get rid of rapidly and peacefully. But contrast the other dangerous branches, which are conspicuously not to be subject to term limits.  There is the Imperial Executive, where only the president is limited, much to the griping of all champions of ""democracy."" The rest of the vast and swollen federal bureaucracy is not only not subject to public removal, they have been frozen into place as permanent despots by the so-called ""civil service"" or ""merit"" system, which was put across on the public by the intellectual and media elites of the late nineteenth century. And finally, there are the real monstrous tyrants of our day, the unchecked and runaway federal judiciary, which enjoy virtually absolute power over every town and village and every person's life. And at its pinnacle the Supreme Court are our unchecked despots for life. If the term limit people begin to advocate, say the abolition of the federal civil service, and two-year term limits for every federal judge, I will begin to take them seriously as part of the solution instead of being very much part of the problem.   This could easily become central themes to reach out to people about liberty and the problems in democracy.  It is also very telling that a bench of appointed judges, not elected politicians and legislators, deeply changed the government definition of marriage in the US, the fundamental social unit in civilization. Alledgedly, for most of the population, they did it for the better. But just how easily could they do it for the much, much worse? What if they made such tidal decision in a case about illegal immigration? And what about religion in schools? Or about ownership of business and residences? They could just as easily they redefined marriage, redefine religion, redefine parenthood, ownership, taxation or immigration."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dp44j,Mashimoto,6,Sat Jul 18 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"That's clean.  I'm going to sock that away for later contemplation.  Right now I'm mired in thought about how people accept information from ""authorities"" without question. I was watching Columbo earlier today and noticed that the thing that makes Columbo a good detective is that he's always looking to verify information regardless of authoritative claims. In Truth Theory this would be ""Correspondence Theory."" The idea is that a statement can only be true if it corresponds to a fact.   Some time ago James Corbett talked about how in the 1930's there was that War of The Worlds broadcast and people were so afraid and upset they packed their bags to leave the cities. The phrase James said stuck with me: ""they couldn't be bothered to reach out with their arm, turn the dial to the next station and confirm from another station that this was happening.""   The thing that catches my attention is the idea of confirming or verifying something absent an authority figure. People have a tendency to accept information without filtering it. Columbo filtered all information and only drew conclusions after filtering for himself the truth value of claims made by anyone and everyone.  I'm sure this subject has been studied and analyzed somewhere, but I'm going to ponder this on my own because I feel like it'll be fun to compare my own conclusions and ideas to studies and whatnot.  Anyway, applying your opponent's argument to them. That smacks of the 44th Law from Robert Greene's 48 Laws of Power. The 44th Law is the one about mirrors. You simply reflect what your opponent does. But I like your phrasing better. It's more coherent and understandable than the way Robert Greene said it.  I think the word ""application"" is why I like yours so much."

It's one of the reasons I'm an anarchist. Immediately after reading it I was able to understand and notice the power plays being made by celebrities and politicians. They became so transparent as to be laughable. You can't take such people seriously. And once you notice that they're implicitly threatening you with violence if you don't obey them - well, now you're seeing the sinister comedy laid bare.  I would recommend that to any young person as a good introductory on how to inoculate yourself against manipulation techniques. I'd also recommend ""On Bullshit"" by Harry Frankfurt.

The billionaire hires the best psychologists, counselors and propagandists and pays some representative group of IRS agents to submit to full psychological evaluations. He can hide his true intentions from most of the people involved, specially the IRS agents. He tells them it is academic work to improve civil service in general, which is true from a twisted point of view, he will make civil service better by making it not work at all.  Now there are two consequences which can work together. First he uses the knowledge to start a campaign to convince the workers to quit as you proposed. And he can expose the psychological evaluations to the general public, to show how rotten and dangerous the tax-collectors are with all the power they have. He could make actors to pretend they are IRS agents and make ficticious but accurate psychological profiles similar to the ones in the study. This way the campaign doesn't break the law either."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dpvkj,rottenx51,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:54:04 2015 UTC,"One of the major challenges with a novel using Anarcho-Capitalism in this way, is that it must explain why governments disbanded, how the world ended up in the position that it is now, and what all of the ramifications of those events are. If such an explanation is not at least partially revealed very early on, or at least the promise of exploring that mystery, it's hard for the world to make sense to most people. (as a note, I have not finished the text, yet, so apologies if this is answered later, but even still, I would hint at the mystery earlier).  To make a really compelling AnCap story, with real chances of meaningful impact people not familiar, it is crucial to have the thing that AnCap is not to compare it to (for instance, Atlas Shrugged features a number of characters that are antithetical to the philosophy Ayn Rand espoused).  From a purely literary perspective, the descriptions ought be more vivid, more memorable, the characters relatable. The text would also flow better if some of the sentences weren't as repetitive. The number of times the word ""said"" appears really slows down the read. When dialogue is going back and forth, stuff like that can often be implied, and at the very least, can be phrased with slightly more variety (although you don't want to sound like a thesaurus).  I would recommend writing a biography about each major character, at least a full page, but the more the better. That way, you have a very clear image in your mind of what they look like, talk like, value, their origin, their relationships, etc. I would also do the same for each major setting. Then, when you are rewriting and encounter one of those characters or scenes, you will automatically write more vivid of descriptions, as they will be more alive in your mind.  Best of luck to you on this project."

Now of course a lot of editing must be done until it becomes the novel I want it to be, and english is my second language so it is a hard work.  I agree that it it important to at least hint how mankind ended up there, but which do you think is the crucial: the sequence of historical events leading up to this anarcho-capitalist world, or the moral and psychological drivers underlying the change, Or the mixture of both? Because most of the sf parts are based on futurologist predictions from ppl like Raymond Kurzweil, and i believe there are near accurate predictions of the future, but this prediction cannot be done with such vast change in a social structure. One could argue that the clash between Islam and the west is unavoidable, because they wont stop, and the collapse of the current financial systam is also very likely, but apart from these  there are a lot of unforseeable events that could end up shaping human history. And I dont want to drift far too away from reality and possibility in the book.  Could you explain what do you mean by ""To make a really compelling AnCap story, with real chances of meaningful impact people not familiar, it is crucial to have the thing that AnCap is not to compare it""?

Even being for white culture is seen as racist in the UK.  Shocking how they used a video of a white rapist instead of one that showed a non white as the rapist. Feminism has a lot to do with it because it is inherently anti-white male and the feminists aline with the multiculturalist because of this. They turn their backs on white culture because they think it represents patriarchy. As most women in public sector are feminists in the uk and they are in the police and pretty much control the social services industry.

It is unsurprising that many tribes evolve to manifest them, and that these tribes should try to preserve such adaptive features.  Yet, when social scientists see the same things in white Christian societies, they attribute it to “hatred of the Other”, i.e. “racism”, “sexism”, and “intolerance”.

I think there is a way we can get mostly a pure meritocracy (a full one is likely impossible, as it requires too much individualism, which dissolves society), while keeping high social capital, though, and why we can is because of sufficient behavioral and performance differences between the major sociobiological groups.  What I mean is: feel free to recruit that talented programmer of heavy sub-Saharan African descent, but what you'll find is that you'll have a low out-group immigration rate if you're only recruiting high performers, which means you won't get significant balkanization and significant depletion of social capital.

Turns out that mobs of clueless people from urban environments who don't actually know anything about farming, land management, or animal husbandry (unlike the families that controlled that land and have been successful farmers for generations) when turned loose on other people's property pretty much end up destroying it.   Turns out when you implement socialist policies in a country to take one of the largest agricultural economies in the world, and certainly the biggest and Africa and turn it into a basket case. The land becomes ravaged and now gone into disuse.   If farmers try to go back to their land and develop it they are branded as criminals and have their land confiscated again.  The people start starving, and the country has become deeply mired in debt because now it must import food instead of exporting it.   2000 vs 2008:    maize -79%  wheat -90% soya beans -66% citrus -50% fresh produce -61% dairy -59%  beef -67%  coffee -92%  tea -40%  tobacco -80%   Anybody surprised by this?

Just want to clarify that we are understanding each other in terms of the context here. My position is that both those things did exist. And the settler, of course, almost always has a different definition of use from the indigenous population. We saw that in the US as well, where land was deemed unused or under-utilized when in fact there were different use systems (different economic systems) at play. That land was transferred in a variety of ways (but generally backed up by the state) to white people. I don't think I've ever heard an ancap argue for the return of that land despite the theft (backed by the state) involved. So, please clarify."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dne2y,CyberToyger,10,Sat Jul 18 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"I'm asking because literally at no point in time during my forced attendance of public school was I ever taught anything about Zimbabwe. I would like to be able to see/read as close to an unbiased recording of Zimbabwe's history as possible so I can determine whether all the invading Brits stole land from Zimbabwe natives, as in kicked them out of their houses and took control/possession of their farmlands, or if some of them merely claimed unused land outside of the pre-existing city.   I don't think I've ever heard an ancap argue for the return of that land despite the theft (backed by the state) involved.   Actually I've seen this quite a few times, it's generally involved wanting some sort of title or recording at a local registrar since anyone could just make the claim that the land happened to belong to their great great great grandfather. When proof can be furnished, the current owner yields the property back to the descendant (or if somehow the original owner is still alive), or they can try to buy/compensate the descendant to be able to keep the land, or possibly split it, and return any heirlooms or pieces of property that might exist."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dne2y,AltLiberty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:17:08 2015 UTC,"The entire colonization of the area was a policy of the British state. It isn't as if individual farmers were settling on unused land, independently, in some kind of entrepreneurial or free market venture.  If a state corporation settles land, is that homesteading - are the people it employs homesteaders?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_rule_in_Rhodesia"
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dne2y,CyberToyger,3,Sat Jul 18 06:08:11 2015 UTC,"In that situation, no, that isn't homesteading and is theft, much like portions of North America (that are now part of the US) that were taken from the Native Americans. The immediate territory violently taken/claimed by the BSAC is illegitimate. If any bit of land was truly acquired through ""treaties and concessions"", as in without any coercion or blackmail, with a bunch of deal-making and sweet-talking, then those plots of land specifically would be the only ones remotely considered legitimate.  Overall, the violently-stolen land should be returned to Native Zimbabweans and the white farmers, while only the descendants of the actual aggressors at this point, should receive some form of compensation from the British Government and/or have relocation expenses covered. If I were to sell you an item I had lifted, then the police or the owner came and pointed out his name written on the bottom of it, he would be entitled to take the item back. And as the party in the wrong, I would have to either give you your money back or give you an identical item or one of equal value.  If we can get things settled to that point, we'd be starting off with as clean of a slate as possible. THEN, in that scenario, Robert Mugabe would just be racist and a fool if he were to try and prevent or make it illegal for Native Zimbabweans to sell some land or rent it to a white person."

People get so embedded in culture that they lose their ability to think objectively. Cosmopolitanism just means he likes... wait he likes a certain type of culture, whats wrong with that? It seems no more relevant then saying he likes bow ties.   Being a Rothbardian means he has a particular argumentation style, one I think is very faulty but in calling him a libertine Rothbardian you have not actually defined him as left leaning.

He doesn't understand the actual cultural foundation that creates and sustains libertarianism   and there are people what do?   it's not cosmopolitan libertinism,    I dont believe he ever claimed that cosmopolitan libertinism results in freedom. I'm pretty sure he sees it as a result of freedom that he desires.    but high trust and social discipline.   how is anyone supposed to know what you mean here? On face value this statement is complete nonsense. trust and dicipline are the exact opposite of what I would regard as a mechanism for sustaining a free society. Trust is how you get screwed and discipline is how you keep getting screwed.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dnukp,JonnyLatte,0,Sat Jul 18 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"I see the first 2 as compliments. People get so embedded in culture that they lose their ability to think objectively.    Northern Europeans are high trust, because they're so low ethnocentric.  Not only did they evolve in a low population density environment, where the environment was much more your enemy than neighboring peoples, and were mixed with a decentralized, mobile aristocratic people that relied on honesty and honor—the Indo-Europeans—but the Church decreed at one point no breeding with anyone closer than sixth cousins, I believe it was.  This assisted in creating the absolute nuclear family, which further magnified European individualism, which, again, is predicated on high trust.  Where trust breaks down, demand for the State increases.  This high trust also creates lack of cultural self-awareness; it creates an aggressive economic velocity that can destroy itself if it's not careful, by incorporating hostile, low trust cultures.   in calling him a libertine Rothbardian you have not actually defined him as left leaning   Libertinism is leftist.   What aspects of his Rothbardian leanings make him left leaning and why is that bad?   Rothbardianism is a Levantine ethic—low trust, not high trust, like the classical liberal Anglos, who observed more than mere NAPism, like Locke's provisos.   and there are people what do?   Yes, I recommend you look at my submission history and watch the Curt Doolittle posts.   I'm pretty sure he sees it as a result of freedom that he desires.   Libertinism destroys the ethic that allows for high trust, though.  When that goes away, demand for the State increases.  The Levant and Asia are known for much larger states because they are lower trust, have more ethnic conflict, and need a larger state to force cooperation per a given area.  Northern Europeans did it via their high trust morality, which involves a morality that doesn't let the NAP be its ceiling: there is also shame against lying and lying even by omission.  When you look at Rothbardians like Walter Block, you see him justifying blackmail, something that happens in low trust cultures with larger states.   Trust is how you get screwed   By dishonest people, yes, but high trust between two open people produces high economic velocity.  When dishonesty is the norm, however, force becomes the main way you create cooperation, not morality.  But, this large state brings with it rent-seeking and economic transaction costs.  The West got around this and catapulted itself into the modern world thereby.  In closing, you seem like a calm, smart guy, and you're not triggered as much as many of the basic bitch libertarians here.  I think you should take a look at Curt Doolittle; he is the next phase of the libertarian movement.  I consider myself a Nietzschean, which makes me sort of an outsider to some of the things he's doing, but I can tell firsthand that what he's doing is groundbreaking and will overturn even what the Hoppeans have done.  Kinsella is going to keep getting pissed."

Women would suffer in their workplace marketability if more of these measures were mandated, something that is already manifesting in Europe.  Breastfeeding is good, but a lot of the currently popular measures still have signficiant costs/tradeoffs, codifying them into law will halt innovation, innovation which is needed to help drive the opportunity cost of breastfeeding even lower over time.  It's also entirely conceivable that formula could be developed to be superior breastmilk at some point, and the type of nature worship that is often bundled in with breastfeeding advocacy not only clouds the professional challenges their agitation can create for women, but in the future it may harm the adoption of these improved infant formulas and thus impair future health outcomes."

Google insufficient glandular tissue.  Also, not everyone who disagrees with you is a SJW. As I said, I've posted in this sub with some frequency, and have considered myself to be ancap for many years now.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dni00,eforemergency,3,Fri Jul 17 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"Google insufficient glandular tissue.   Here is a nice article which says:   typically this is due to early mismanagement of nursing often in the first days and weeks of the baby’s life (primary cause). insufficient glandular tissue (3-4%).   So the excuse here is it's a medical condition, when instead it women trying to abdicate their responsibility to the child. This isn't really much of a surprise though, since the modern world is about money, career and self-fulfillment rather than focusing on the child. 96% have the capacity to breatfeed, yet the numbers aren't close to that.  Another interesting point from the article:   We saw some mothers again, years later, with a subsequent baby. Surprisingly, we did find that these mothers produced more milk with additional babies than with their first born.   So if women went to have more than one child, they wouldn't have this excuse.   Maybe the reason you are being down voted is because you believe such completely nonsensical things about the female body, and not from a brigade.   Seems odd that my higher up comments aren't being downvoted, which leads me to believe that a brigade is linking directly to my this particular comment. After all the prior comment was just as sexist.  regardless, I think the reality of the world around us is enough to see that children are screwed up and the blame lies squarely on the parents. There is a lot more medical science showing the benefit of breatfeeding and the harm of feeding soy formula to infants."

IGT is a condition in which there is insufficient breast tissue. See this study here. As in from birth, not because the woman went and worked outside of the home.  Or, possibly, could develop due to PCOS, or environmental contaminants, or for many other reasons. See here. Somehow missing from that list, though, is ""acting like a man"". Working at a job does not cause a woman to not produce breast tissue  There are a variety of reasons why a woman could have trouble breastfeeding. You are simply ignoring basic biology to defend your view that a woman's place is in the home. And that is why you are being down voted, because most reasonable people do not hold that belief."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dni00,eforemergency,2,Fri Jul 17 20:45:13 2015 UTC,"IGT is a condition in which there is insufficient breast tissue.   Breast tissue has the potential to grow. Thats why the article I linked to pointed out that by the second child most women with IGT no longer have problems.  Even the link you gave backed up the link I gave. this is from your link:   Most problems are related to insufficient knowledge, inappropriate routines, and lack of confidence and are easily managed or prevented by prenatal education,    In other words, women have lost the tribal knowledge of how to be mothers. This is knowledge that used to be almost universal, but is no longer prioritized, instead favoring getting women into the workplace.   PCOS, or environmental contaminants,   Hey I can agree with this, but the solution isn't to dive head-first into a more modern lifestyle, but instead to revert back to a more natural environment.   There are a variety of reasons why a woman could have trouble breastfeeding.   which again are mostly tied to a lack of tribal knowledge getting passed down. Children are taken out of the home and taught how to use birth control in school, but not taught how to breatfeed properly. So the list you linked to had a lot of things that pointed to changes in our modern lifestyle, some knowledge and some environmental. Nothing for the vast majority of women is really stopping them, they just choose career over family. The world is upside down in this regard, where the woman works, war is peace, debt is wealth and law is freedom.   because most reasonable people do not hold that belief.   and look at what a wonderful world these people have created.

Now if you want to understand why a mothers milk might be lessened, it's a function of use. If a mother is actively lactating, then she can do so for years.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dni00,of_ice_and_rock,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"Good point. Over time certain traits would be selected for. Longer necks, bigger breasts or poor eyesight.  Still though, breatmilk production is not really limited by genetics, but more cultural and environmental. A mothers body will deplete itself of nutrients to deliver them to the milk, at the expense of the mother.  So there are so many other factors involved with affecting milk production that genetics should be the last thing to consider."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dni00,aletoledo,4,Fri Jul 17 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"My issue isn't that the majority of women can breast feed.  My issue is that you have presented an absolute that all mothers can breast feed.  This might not even be due to a genetic defect that prevents the mother from producing sufficient amounts of milk which is very rare, but does happen.  The mother might have HIV or another disease that she could pass on to her child by breast feeding. She might have died.    The practice of wet nursing has been around for thousands of years."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dni00,lizard450,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"you have presented an absolute   Yes, you're right I have used an absolute. I find it stimulates discussion more than a wishy-washy couching of language.  The idea that formula is used for the purposes of the rare woman that has physical limitations belies the fact that the majority of women not breastfeeding simply don't do it for selfish reasons. It's an excuse pathway that they take when they encounter the slightest difficulty or hardship. This is the point of the discussion that I'm making, not the 1% with physical ailments.   The mother might have HIV or another disease that she could pass on to her child by breast feeding. She might have died.   Sure, to which I would say that her lifestyle probably lead her to that point. You could then say that she got HIV from a blood transfusion and not drug use, but the majority of people getting HIV are doing so from a lifestyle perspective, so my point remains.  Not breastfeeding, HIV and women choosing a career over family are all symptons of a society that is being -re-engineered to something unnatural.   The practice of wet nursing has been around for thousands of years   This is a good point. The first example I think of when this comes up are the ruling elite. The monarchs wife gets a poor person to be her wet nurse, while she goes about enjoying her life. This is why I say it's a lifestyle choice, selfish and a symptom of statism. In other words, wet nurses are almost exclusively from a lower social class than the child they're feeding."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dni00,aletoledo,5,Fri Jul 17 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"Now on to my second contention.  You've softly suggested that not breast feeding your child is child abuse.  Now I believe we have the right and responsibility to act in defense of others.  Now this presumes the victim hasn't freely expressed their desire to be saved for whatever reason.  An infant being in a state where they cannot articulate such a desire it's correct to use force in defense of the child in accordance to typical natural desires.  My issue simply put is your suggestion that not breast feeding your child is abuse sets a dangerous precedent similar to drugs should be prohibited.  Under NAP the decision to use force should be put under significant consideration.  More often than not the use of force results in unintended consequences.  To present a circumstance that occurs where a woman can find herself pregnant with HIV yet has not done anything to warrant such a stigma that you've declared warranted would be rape.  If a woman is raped by a man with HIV.    That being said in this discussion the woman's actions that do not pertain to direct interactions with a child are not relevant to whether or not abuse is taking place and therefore carry no weight in the consideration of the decision to use force to defend the child.  Only the woman's interaction with the child is relevant in determining abuse and therefore the decision to use force.  If she initiates harmful force against the child then action in defense of the child is morally just.  Now given your lack of conviction on your position being that you don't feel confident enough to confront people in person.  To me suggests you're leaning this way yet aren't fully convinced yourself.  From my perspective which provides very little value in the attempt to understand yours.  When I have a strongly held belief in something I have no problems confronting people directly, even if I do so with respect as I find attacking people is counterproductive.   Finally while the profession of being a wet nurse may have only been developed during the greeks.  The profession is not relevant to this discussion.  What is relevant is the concept of woman breast feeding other women's children.  Which I assure you existed long before the greeks as polygamy has been practiced long long before the greeks came along."

Children are suffering from a lack of a parent at home and men are suffering by having a higher competition in the labor pool.

Children are suffering from a lack of a parent at home   Are you saying there is only one true way to raise children, that there could be no other model that is worth finding via exploration? A highly intelligent woman should spend a huge amount of her time raising her children, rather than focusing on giving them the benefit of her intelligence over a smaller period over which they are able to benefit from it, while letting someone else equally qualified take over for her in tasks that her special skills don't particularly benefit the children, while at the same time using her intelligence and her skills to benefit her and her children's standard of living, and society at large?

Usually you will see the sales rank increase (getting closer to #1) as the price drops. This one seems to go both ways which may just indicate a product with low volume.   Keep in mind that sales rank is relative to products in the same category. So even with no sales, the rank could change as other products sell more or less.   Edit: I think this is a better example. It's over a longer period of time with many price points recorded. You can see when Amazon quit selling it, 3rd party prices spiked. As the price spiked, you can see sales slow, and thus the sales rank decrease (larger number).  Then when 3rd party sellers found they couldn't move the product, they started to drop prices, and it became a rush to the bottom. That increased sales and the rank went back up."

In their desire to establish stability and control over rates and competition, the railroads often resorted to voluntary, cooperative efforts.  When these efforts failed, as they inevitably did, the railroad men turned to political solutions to [stabilize] their increasingly chaotic industry. They advocated measures designed to bring under control those railroads within their own ranks that refused to conform to voluntary compacts... [F]rom the beginning of the 20th century until at least the initiation of World War I, the railroad industry resorted primarily to political alternatives and gave up the abortive efforts to put its own house in order by relying on voluntary cooperation... Insofar as the railroad men did think about the larger theoretical implications of centralized federal regulation, they rejected the entire notion of laissez-faire [and] most railroad leaders increasingly relied on a Hamiltonian conception of the national government.

They-the advocates of alternative, non-family-centered lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism-will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order.   ...or Mises:   Mises's cultural traditionalism also led him to oppose egalitarianism as regards the traits distinctive to particular racial and ethnic groups. He believed that all human beings are inherently unequal, and that these inequalities can be generalized according to the social patterns that develop in terms of race and ethnicity. He viewed scholarship that seeks to study such racial and ethnic differences, within the proper scientific context, as legitimate. However, he condemned state-imposed distinctions among various groups and wanted all of them, regardless of what might be their intellectual and social capacities, incorporated into the division of labor.   There's a reason that a lot of people like /u/ice_and_rock, or other neoreactionaries such as Moldbug, affiliate with anarcho-capitalism, Hoppe and Austrian economics."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3domb8,DerMef,4,Sat Jul 18 07:10:11 2015 UTC,"What about people like Hoppe   Your quote starts too late and is misleading. Here is the full quote:  In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, not even to unlimited speech on one's own tenant-property. One may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They – the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centered lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism – will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3domb8,AltLiberty,0,Sat Jul 18 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"How is that misleading?  Hoppe's model of anarcho-capitalist society is covenant communities structured via insurance companies.

Thus the necessity of physically driving away (as he says, to the ""polar regions"") people with values and belief systems that are not compatible with the values that anarcho-capitalist society needs to exist."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3domb8,DerMef,3,Mon Jul 20 06:38:35 2015 UTC,"It's misleading because the part you quoted doesn't mention covenant communities.

That's Hoppe's entire model. These covenant communities are not isolated areas within an anarcho-capitalist society, they are anarcho-capitalist society. The polycentric system is made up of multiple such communities, with undesirables cast out of society (not just forced to leave the community) all together.  Hoppe isn't in favor of ""concentration camps"" that remove certain people. He explains, instead, that insurance companies would incentivize subscribers to remove unwanted individuals from their communities. It isn't just that people would not be accepted into already-existing communities, but that individuals who ""raise risk,"" as he puts it, would have legal protection withdrawn from them, and those who remained under the banner of insurance protection would be able to expel them without consequence.

Ancaps, virtually alone, have the concepts and the desire to build that sort of order.  It's a concept that requires a certain amount of societal wealth to even have the time to think about and conceive, which is why Africa is not where it has been developed, but in the West.  And that wealth has been developed because of a cultural trait of investment and property rights, which perhaps are required of a people that live in a northerly climate where surviving through a winter requires forethought, planning, and low time-preference lifestyles.

Under a free market system (not the bullshit crony capitalism that we have now), anyone with some capital, large or small, can put that capital to work through a little bit of self-directed creativity. Buy something and sell it to a different market, buy something and use it to add value to something else, find collaborators with unique skills to make a good or service more affordable to people in the marketplace... the possibilities are endless.

A lot of middle class people in the US could work for 15 years and retire to a poor but safe country if they choose to live simply. The problem is most people lack the discipline to do so...   Why might a middle class American prefer to stay in the United States rather than move to a poor country? Gee, let's think about that for a little bit.  It's not that people lack the discipline to do so. It's that they don't want to because it's such a bad idea."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dlhup,emnot3,13,Fri Jul 17 10:10:44 2015 UTC,"It's that they don't want to because it's such a bad idea.   Your lack of travel abroad and reliance on local corporate media to stay informed about the state of the US is showing. There are many countries poorer than the US which are safer (especially in Asia) and perfectly fine for human habitation. Anyone can learn a second language and find their own version of paradise outside of the US, if they have a plan and discipline. The only thing stopping the majority of people is their own inertia.  This highlights another fundamental difference between an anarcho-capitalist and a communist. To an anarcho-capitalist most people are autonomous human beings who can be responsible for themselves while to the communist most men are passive and helpless. The ""helplessness"" of the proverbial passive prole that communists dwell on is a crippling illusion that prevents people from reaching their full potential. It is condescending in the extreme."

The purpose in explaining the coercion of capitalism wasn't to conclude that there's ""something wrong"" with working for capitalists. It is simply to disprove the idea that Marxists complain nature is coercive; in reality, it is capitalism itself that is coercive.  What's wrong with actually working for capitalists is a different discussion entirely.   What's wrong with employing yourself?   Self-employment isn't a complete removal of oneself from capitalism. In fact, self-employment means that you are still involved in capitalism, and it is still a means to commodity purchase and ultimately survival.  Again, my intent here is to illustrate how people can't opt out of capitalism, not to show why certain aspects of capitalism are ""bad."" In demonstrating that capitalism actually coerces people into participating in it, I prove that capitalism is fundamentally involuntary."

In modern market capitalism, these goods are only distributed via the market. People need money with which to purchase these goods. If people do not own capital so they can have others make money for them via a contract of employment - i.e. most people - they must seek employment to a capitalist to get money."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dlhup,chewingofthecud,12,Fri Jul 17 07:47:32 2015 UTC,"Ehm, all right. I'll respond to one of their questions.   Now my refutation: Who operates the court? Clearly you'd need a higher authority, ie the state, to enforce this ruling. The market is not a court, and would not be able to take appeals, not to mention the cost of paying for a group of judges who would need to exist like law-firms and would be beholden to their profits, causing them to side with the moneyed group for their own self-interests which would contradict any ethical guidelines, but not the morality of an ancap system.   Private courts have been successfully implemented in the Icelandic Commonwealth and Medieval Ireland, working perfectly for 400 years the former, and more than a thousand the latter.  You would have private companies offering their court services. Since there would be no victimless crimes, disputes would always be between two or more individuals.  Suppose John has stolen Carl's 500 dollars. If both courts declare him guilty, that's fine, he pays the cost of the trial and repays John, perhaps double the quantity.  If Carl's court however, declares him innocent, both courts would go to a third party, whose judgement both John and Carl have beforehand agreed to, via contract."

I'd like to add to that again. I'll likely repeat some of what I've already said in a prior post here. Private courts are not so uncommon as Marxists are led to believe. We generally refer to them as Private Arbitration Courts. If they took the time to research such concepts as DRO's (Disputes Resolution Organisations) and say things like David Friedman's The Machinery of Freedom [The illustrated version], and Stephan Molyneux's work on explaining DRO's The Stateless Society: An Examination of Alternatives (not the exact article I was looking for but close enough) they would get a very accurate idea as to how easily this would work in a An-Cap society.  Each person would have a DRO. If you can't afford one I am certain there would be DRO's that would provide their services pro-bono. When there are no taxes philanthropy will likely be even more common than today and DRO's would be very affordable even to the poor. We have to remember that prior to the U.S. government, for instance, getting involved in healthcare in the 1930's and onwards, 90% of Blacks had comprehensive very affordable healthcare services. Read that last sentence again. I recall the stat for whites of the time was only around 45% who had private healthcare. This was achieved through Mutual Aid societies, which is likely a role/service that DRO's would provide as well.  When there is a dispute the DRO's would meet each representing their clients and they would see, through arbitration, if they can come up with a solution. If they cannot come to an agreement they will agree to take this before another mutually agreed upon DRO (or DRO's if they feel an appeal process may be necessary), or if they cannot agree upon a DRO to mediate, then one will be chosen via whatever market process DRO's have mutually agreed upon to abide by. It's been a while since I've looked into this but you Marxists should get the general drift of things.  Being that they are operating in the free market DRO's would have every possible interest in performing their duties properly. Unlike with government where their vested interest generally lies in courts advantaging government, because it is government from whom they get their sole source of income ie their salaries and you can't tell me that doesn't create a built in bias towards one party, even if that party is not involved in the dispute? Government.  Being beholden to profits is what helps ensure their impartiality. If a DRO earns itself a poor Reputation for making unfavourable decisions for its customers, other customers and existing customers will seek the services of other DRO's because they will establish over time just who the best DRO's are. It's how the market works. Customers know best how to spend their own money.  For example. You've just discovered that your local green grocer constantly short-changes his customers and so you decide to shop elsewhere. He loses your custom, word gets around and others stop shopping there too. He makes less money and likely enough to mean he can't carry on operating and so goes out of business, or changes his ways so that he can entice customers back to working for him.  DRO's would survive or fail based upon their results and therefore their established Reputations.  Now the ""moneyed group"" would likely also find that where there is a dispute they may well have their favourite DRO but so would those that find themselves in dispute with them. Having money doesn't always guarantee favourable results.  Private arbitration courts have been around for centuries and worked very effectively in resolving disputes. Many countries are making more use of these private arbitration services now-a-days and especially in the area of...wait for it...Employee/Employer disputes. You would think that Marxists would be scrambling to make this a part of their ideology. But they won't because there is money/capitalism involved."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dlhup,bobroberts7441,3,Fri Jul 17 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"The whole private court/arbitration thing is one of the instances in which a purely voluntary society seems to break down.   Suppose John has stolen Carl's 500 dollars. If both courts declare him guilty, that's fine, he pays the cost of the trial and repays John, perhaps double the quantity.  If Carl's court however, declares him innocent, both courts would go to a third party, whose judgement both John and Carl have beforehand agreed to, via contract.   The fact of John and Carl being engaged in a dispute suggests that they're engaged in something extra-contractual; perhaps they had a contract which each party interprets differently, perhaps one party now chooses to ignore the contract, perhaps there is no contract at all.  In any case, the contract is either irrelevant or itself in dispute.  Even supposing that the two could agree on an arbitrator, I don't see why the losing party would be obliged to recognize the judgement of the arbitrator as binding in absence of something like coercive force.  If both parties are going to bind themselves contractually to the judgement of the arbitrator, this would cause both parties to favour an arbitrator who they knew would favour themselves, which means there will be a disagreement on who the arbitrator should be.

Imagine there being a huge platform to record how reputable individuals are in upholding their contractual agreements, like the Ebay rating system; now imagine the guy who rejects the ruling of the third party arbiter and what his reputation is going to look like after this.

If both parties are going to bind themselves contractually to the judgement of the arbitrator, this would cause both parties to favour an arbitrator who they knew would favour themselves, which means there will be a disagreement on who the arbitrator should be.    I've gone some way towards responding to this here.  The parties to the dispute would likely already have selected their own personal DRO. The DRO's themselves would agree upon whom would arbitrate between themselves, if they can't easily come to an agreement. The DRO's would mutually agree upon another DRO or more if they want to appeal, to make a binding decision.   And even supposing that an arbitration agreement is reached and a contract is signed, it's not binding in absence of dispositive force; that contract could itself be called into dispute.  The buck has to stop somewhere.   The DRO's, of the clients, themselves would have to enforce the decisions agreed upon in the dispute resolution. If they don't ensure the decision is followed through then they will earn a poor reputation for not following through with the agreed upon decision. Failing that, the DRO's will have  previously agreed, probably before the the dispute, upon a third party who would step in and perform the necessary actions to ensure remedy is actioned and fully complied with. The case will no doubt have criteria, and that would be based mostly upon prior established case (think common law) as to which actions can be taken that would satisfy settlement of the dispute.  I invite you to look up DRO's and information on how disputes would be settled in an An-Cap and even libertarian society. There are links in the above link that may be a good place to start.  [Edit] Please bear in mind that these ideas and concepts, that although they have been very thoroughly discussed by many scholarly people, over many years, that you are likely to have never taken the time to consider, and although are in place in our societies in some ways such as employment arbitration courts, we don't really know what an An-Cap society may come up with in order to resolve disputes? It's like the free market. We've never truly had the free market because governments keep getting in the way. We may well discover over time, much ore effective ways of doing things that we've never thought of. That's the whole part of the creative, innovative process that Socialism lacks, has provably lacked and with never be able to achieve, because of the way Socialism uses force, violence and coercion, and stifles incentive."

It's not really clear in what sense you consider these courts to be 'private' or 'working perfectly'. Considering the Icelandic Commonwealth collapsed due to disputes between warring individuals who'd amassed too much power, it seems almost like an argument against your case.   In any case, I can find no historical evidence supporting that claim. (granted, that is not evidence of absence, the history of Ireland and Iceland are simply not my specialty) The only source I can find who argues anything like this is an article by David Friedman who's not an academic historian and is a political ideologue who a dog in this particular fight.   As for Ireland, I'm going to trust /u/depanneur on the subject.   To go any further with this discussion I'm going to need you to cite your sources.   But, again, assuming all of this is true it's rather irrelevant in my opinion. That a preindustrial society was capable of organizing itself into something resembling contemporary post-industrial capitalism isn't particularly helpful in arguing that our current mode of production can capably handle judicial disputes. In the same way that 'Primitive Communism' isn't particularly useful as evidence for the efficacy of a post-capitalist Communism of the future. And again, I say all that in the assumption that what you say is 100% accurate. I don't actually believe that at all. You're simply leveraging a point on the assumption that the people you talk to don't know the fine-details of Medieval Irish and Icelandic societies. It's a good bet, strategically, but one that runs aground the moment you encounter someone who does.   You would have private companies offering their court services. Since there would be no victimless crimes, disputes would always be between two or more individuals.   I'm not sure what you mean by saying 'there would be no victimless crimes'. What grounds that assumption?   Further, this whole scenario would, by your own logic, mean that courts could take on cases against individuals merely for driving cars. The standard ICE engine emits pollutants known to cause asthma, among other breathing disorders, and contribute to the destruction of property via acid rain. People are objectively harmed by breathing in pollutants.   The assumption here though is itself kind of ridiculous. Because you're replacing law with contract and hoping courts just adjust to a common law standard around that when that's simply an assumption on your part.   And again, this is leaving out the discussions of bribery or any number of examples of real life problems that affect existing courts. You're simply arguing that legalizing such things eliminates them as problems. Yet your own historical examples are, themselves, evidence that this doesn't last once people become aware of them."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dlhup,Maikowski2,8,Fri Jul 17 08:49:29 2015 UTC,"As for Ireland, I'm going to trust /u/depanneur on the subject.    Except nobody claimed it was a libertarian paradise, or even that it was particularly individualist. It's cited as an example of polycentric law, nothing more, and it was no more or less free than other societies of the time period (with the exception of stateless hunter-gatherers.)   Further, this whole scenario would, by your own logic, mean that courts could take on cases against individuals merely for driving cars. The standard ICE engine emits pollutants known to cause asthma, among other breathing disorders, and contribute to the destruction of property via acid rain. People are objectively harmed by breathing in pollutants.    This is actually something that's been widely debated, and one thing that always comes up is that common-law property rights have historically been the defense against pollution. In that PDF I linked, someone mentions the book The Transformation of American Law, which discusses (among other things) the shift from treating pollution as a question of common law to a question of public policy. I'd be surprised if you're not familiar with that book, actually - one of its central arguments is that during the expansion of capitalism, judges aligned themselves with the rich and worked to solidify the power of the capitalist class.  Also, speaking as someone who has studied common law, a tort against an individual driving a car would probably not be successful unless that person had deliberately removed the muffler or catalytic converter from their car. On the other hand, a tort against an auto manufacturer whose cars fail to utilize the latest technology to prevent emissions would be likely to succeed and potentially have a chilling effect on other auto manufacturers that want to cut corners. I consider this a feature, not a bug.    The assumption here though is itself kind of ridiculous. Because you're replacing law with contract and hoping courts just adjust to a common law standard around that when that's simply an assumption on your part.    Friedman actually talks about the fact that polycentric law isn't guaranteed to produce libertarian outcomes on its own. He does, however, conclude that the economic incentives for it to do so are very strong.   And again, this is leaving out the discussions of bribery or any number of examples of real life problems that affect existing courts. You're simply arguing that legalizing such things eliminates them as problems.    ""Your system doesn't eliminate all problems of the previous system"" is not a legitimate criticism. If anyone here claims that polycentric law will eliminate bribery, they're simply wrong. It doesn't follow that their entire position is undermined by that one mistake.   Yet your own historical examples are, themselves, evidence that this doesn't last once people become aware of them.    The argument you use when people say ""every Marxist country has turned totalitarian, how can you still be a Marxist"" is the same one that applies here."

Once people experience a better life,  it's only a matter of time before they take it for granted and assume that all these things can remain while also turning to government to solve those problems perceived to have no market solutions.    It's all based on the fact that people do not seem to realize that many of the things that governments provide are luxuries that were made possible by the economic growth that a lack of government intervention enabled. The source of government largess has been the prosperity created by past generations.. the foundation upon which society was built upon. Government can extract from this for some time, but the returns begin to diminish and then countries are left in crisis mode.   A good example is Greece. Prior to joining the Eurozone, Greece had issues with debt, inflation (they controlled their own currency) and a lack of economic development in large part because of their debt and currency debasement.   But the Greek people overwhelmingly supported joining the Eurozone, something around 2/3rds of the population. And in order to join, Greece had to agree to get inflation and debt under control. You didn't see people rioting on the streets when they were forced into austerity back then. That's because they were able to join a strong currency union and once they had their foot in the door they began to spend and live beyond their means, as they always had, accept at this time, they did so at the expense of the other Eurozone countries instead of at their own expense.   What you are seeing in Greece is precisely what will happen in the United States once our creditors and trading partners began to demand concessions in order to support us. I don't think the world will end, I don't think society will be wiped out. People will just be forced to live a lower standard of living and the productive people that remain in society will have to work that much harder to support the less productive people. That means large segments of the population will lash out against the government and the productive people. But they need to eat, so somebody will end up putting them to work.

Furthermore, a total collapse is a horrible thing in almost every way imaginable; even the current totalitarian state is preferable. The best thing we can do is build family, community, ideology, religion, identity, and capital in parallel so if the system collapses, we are able to fall back on an alternative and defend ourselves.

We have steel laws, steel policies, steel people and culture, and steel money.  Steel is strong--it is so very Western to rely on strength above all, isn't it--but it inevitably rusts, even in its most rust-proof form it is still vulnerable, requires constant maintenance and care, requires replacement.  Our laws rust because their meanings are corrupted over time, connotations grow on words that they'd never held before, meaning corrodes and takes on new forms, thus weakened they are easily twisted into new forms they were never meant to hold. The 14th amendment being perhaps our greatest example.  Our money rusts, in the form of inflation, its value slowly and surely hollowed out with a dull and slow pain like a cavity devouring a tooth until one day the tooth snaps from the root and collapses in on itself.   Our culture is rusting, as the effects of government policy create a high time-preference culture, one that refuses to invest, refuses to develop itself, refuses to commit to anything that could create long-term profit, things like family or children. We've tossed aside chastity, modesty, purity, virtue, temperance, and a dozen other values that once marked the former low time-preference culture of yesteryear. When once the poor aped the upper classes in manner and dress, today the upper classes ape the poor, in behavior and attitude and habit.  When those who maintain the steel give up, the structure will collapse systemically, perhaps on all fronts at once or in quick succession.  But always there is a remnant that maintains the right ways, that survives, that carries on, that contains the seed of the future. Naturally we hope to catalyze that seed, to even begin building before the collapse so as to be ready for it, to make transition far less painful thereby. But even if we fail, the world does not collapse all at once, order is maintained somewhere, generally."

It is not an initiation of force to use force against aggressors.    Not just those directly supported by state welfare, but government job-holders, aerospace contractors and the like.   It is not aggression to prevent them from being paid with money gained through taxation, as taxation itself is aggression. They are not entitled to the money gained through the initiation of force; no force is initiated against them by interfering with tax collection.    Revolutionary change would be jarring and destructive of lives and infrastructure   Yes, and that isn't aggression, as unfortunate as it may be. No more than you are agressing against the public by killing a rapist, when some members of the public like being raped by him.    Evolutionary change would preserve current capital and would allow people to adapt to anarchist life without mass disorder or loss of life.   ""Evolutionary Change"" isn't going to happen. This discussion goes back all the way to the early writings of Walter Block and Murray Rothbard. It doesn't matter if people believe in anarchism, that doesn't actually challenge the problem of power and force on behalf of the state. It's not enough to educate people; it's not enough to simply say ""I withdraw my consent"", because the state uses force to compel people to do things against their will.   And let's be realistic: at the rate we are going, you're not going to convince the American masses within this century. Your evolutionary strategy thus condemns tens of thousands of ancaps to decades of death, taxation, arrest, and suffering. All for the sake of your hope that statists will embrace anarcho-capitalism in the future.  In other words, when you say there won't be ""loss of life"", this ignores that we are still living under statism, and that the state continues to use violence against us without provocation.   Pragmatically, a revolution will more readily draw from those who are and have been underprivileged with regards to economic opportunity and education.    No, Anarcho-capitalist revolution and/or violence will draw on militant anarcho-capitalists.   These people will not understand economics and will gravitate toward ""free stuff"" not opportunity and hard work.    I highly doubt that militant anarcho-capitalists will be so ignorant.    This makes founding ""Ancapistan"" orders of magnitude more difficult.   It only takes a very small number of ancaps to make a region or community ungovernable, through the use of force against statist personnel and facilities."

Most American secessionists advocate conservatism and Christian fundamentalism.    Texas is creating gold and silver currency to compete with the Fed.    Thats nice, but nation states have used gold-backed banks for centuries.

Crypto-currencies, P2P and other technologies are making it much more difficult for the state to maintain its strangle-hold    Not much, as of yet.   Most people who use crypto-currencies aren't avoiding taxes, and you can't easily avoid things like property taxes.  The state is not having much trouble enforcing the law and collecting taxes.   There is promise in projects like Open Bazaar, but there are limits to what crypto-anarchism can accomplish, and severe limits on how quickly these things can be accomplished.    and Americans are being forced into awareness of their political situation by the Obama administration's gaffes.

Its possible to coordinate around this, for sure, but he's not set it up to allow for such. Tragedy of the Commons works best when you demonstrate that even if people are able to coordinate they will still act against group interests. But then again, if you let them coordinate they might actually figure out a way to mutually benefit, which defeats your apparent intended lesson...  He'd do better to simply provide a pool of extra points that, if depleted, will never be replenished so the students have to work out an optimal distribution or else lose out on the ability to acquire them.  That would lead to some unfair classroom outcomes (if one person makes the decision to grab all the points, they might get boosted really far ahead) so I can see why he wouldn't do it, but he's substituted a very different scenario with somewhat different application.  What's he's got here is a single iteration where the points are either gotten by everyone or they are not. No one group will excel while leaving the rest of the group (and the future) with nothing.

Look at the most recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as the numerous cases of US intervention abroad seeking to preserve the current petrodollar system. If the US was not so unbelievably wealthy with the benefit of issuing the world's reserve currency, it would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. In fact, it is very likely that these incredible wastes of capital have played a fundamental role in accelerating the decline of the US Empire, though that judgement will ultimately have to be left to history.  Because aggression is so expensive, it does not happen as readily as you would think and in a power vacuum sovereign entities much prefer a peaceful solution over a violent one. Look at the history of medieval Europe and you will find that the most successful feudal rulers (sovereign entities) were those who established ties with their neighbors and resolved their disputes peacefully while maintaining a decent measure of defensive military power. If you have ever played any of the Civ Games on hard mode, this same principle holds true - aggression is risky and expensive and almost always puts you at a technological or economic disadvantage to your peaceful opponents.  Taking the above argument and extending it to the issue of private police forces, it would seem self-evident that the police forces that are most successful in the market place would be those which focus on defending their customers' property rather aggressing against other police forces. Aggressors will, effectively, go bankrupt as their costs of doing business would be high and they would priced out of the market.   As far as the question of drug lords / the mafia is concerned, don't forget that these entities currently exist under the existing framework of the state which does not allow these entities the freedom to openly engage in contractual agreements or third party arbitration with other entities. It is not unreasonable to think that in the absence of a state private police forces would have far more freedom to negotiate with one another. It is also worth noting that while under a state monopoly there is little direct recourse for the individual against thuggery due to a dysfunctional legal system (ex. people are often afraid to defend themselves with sufficient force because the state often punishes people who stand up for themselves), in ancapistan the individual would be empowered to take charge of their own self defense, making the cost of aggression much higher than in our current statist regime.  Hope the above makes some sense and answers your question. I'll leave the property rights stuff to another poster since I've gotta get some work done. =P"

One (weaker in this argument because we don't have the alternate history) is that aggressive behavior still resulted in a less profitable outcome than cooperation. The second is that you aren't accounting for failures, you're using the cherry-picked example of ""success"". To use Nassim Taleb's illustration, offer six people a revolver and have them play Russian Roulette with a $50k prize. The guys who win seem pretty smart, IF you ignore the dead guy - that doesn't make it a smart decision. In reality though, odds are worse than the example, as you'd have most aggressors be relative losers based on frequency in addition to magnitude of outcomes.

Of course it is a high risk and high reward game but the five people who survived the Russian roulette would have never gotten anything if they hadn't played. Game theory alone dictates that if you have two groups and one is being cooperative and one is being aggressive, the aggressive one will win out. One of the oldest stories of man kind, Gilgamesch, already tells the tell of a group of peaceful farmer who got mugged by Gilgamesch for his profit. In the early days of Christianity the Arianer who preached a very peaceful version of Christianity got absolutely whipped out by the more aggressive groups. As a whole cooperation might be more fruitful than aggression (altough I don't see this as self evident as you are), but for single individuals and groups aggression can be extremely profitable and thus will always serve as an incentive.

I am not even sure why we are discussing this when we can have a look at the entirety of human history where we can observe humans acting violently for personal gains. Every single empire in the human history was build upon violence and every one lasted for centuries and through many lifetimes of dictators.

I think you are too distracted by flashy outlier cases (and all they demonstrate is that people can behave violently and loot; they do not demonstrate that a pattern of violence is a more sustainable form of social interaction). You would understand the point better if you considered the innumerable mundane interactions of everyday life - even under oppressive regimes. No one is claiming that aggressive behavior doesn't occur. No is claiming that some aggressors don't benefit from their actions.

They had two widely disliked, destabilized regimes that produced a huge pool of recruits combined with a wealth of US military equipment.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dlsup,VassiliMikailovich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"That ISIS existed before the Syrian conflict doesn't change the fact that they only really became powerful because of it. The Bolsheviks existed in a form well before the Russian Revolution, but they weren't particularly powerful until external factors helped them out (first the Russo-Japanese war, then WW1).   You're also really ignoring context and motivation. Historically, very few conquerors did so for the purpose of ""profit"". Colonialism is an arguable exception, but that was an unusual case in which the victims were relatively isolated peoples with inferior technology and no acquired immunity to disease, a situation that is completely irrelevant to the modern age barring the sudden arrival of aliens.   On that note, most of the examples of conquest actually being profitable are predicted either on the state having a large population to draft/tax for its own benefit, or on technology being limited to the point that being able to rule or rob a larger group of people is predicated more on training than equipment.  The feudal system ""worked"" because a highly trained Knight would beat a peasant in combat nearly every time unless very heavily outnumbered, and the ""cost of entry"" for a bandit to fulfill the role of a knight was a relatively cheap sword, a horse, and some training (and as the bandit transitioned from an outlaw to a landowner, his descendants could spend more and more time training to be better fighters and more money on higher quality equipment).   Now compare to the modern world, where even relative backwaters have access to cheap firearms. You could argue that the ""cost of entry"" is still cheap since it isn't hard to get a gun, but the skill factor is largely gone. A regular person that practices with his rifle is fully capable of defeating someone with much better training or physique. So in reality, to have a good chance at conquest at all, you'd need substantially better equipment, and military grade hardware doesn't come cheap. Thus, you really don't see many cases of random bandits becoming rulers these days like you did in the past, since the costs of conquest require either a tax base or foreign assistance (be it intentional or unintentional)."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3djs7i,LookingForMySelf,29,Thu Jul 16 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"Forget whether its about slavery or not.   The north failed to find a peaceful way to negotiate the conflict, and the result was the bloodiest war in American history (in terms of lives lost). The cost was mind-boggling.   If the north really cared about ending slavery, they should have pursued some more peaceable means to achieve it like every other nation on earth just about, managed. The ONLY reason a war would be necessary was if they wanted to force them to rejoin the Union.  The war was the single worst way to solve the stated problem. Good outcome ultimately, terrible means to achieve it.  I mean, for comparison, lets say that its a hostage situation, with the slaves being the hostages. Someone could run the numbers to compare the amount of hostage-takers (slaveowners) and bystanders (non-slaveowners who were against slaveowning) and hostages (slaves) to approximate the population of the south, to the amount of hostage rescuers (northern soldiers) and bystanders (civilian northerners). Then figure out just how many hostage-takers, hostages, rescuers, and bystanders died in the process of rescuing the hostages, compared to how many hostages were rescued.  I'd imagine it would look something like an inept Spetznatz operation, with ridiculously high casualties on both sides compared to the outcome achieved. There's a reason negotiation is usually a preferred tactic.  Some quick math (numbers from here): ~3,000,000 slaves in the south (call that 30 people) and approximately 600,000 deaths (note this is not casualites) in the war (6 people) so basically a force of 26 people (2.6 mil. total in the union army) was sent in against a force of 12 people (1.2 mil estimated in confederate army) and each side lost about 3, with another 6 wounded across both sides (more on the union side but lets dismiss that for now). So 36 people in the fight over 30 people, 12 (~1.2 million) of the combatants end up wounded or dead, or ~1/3 total casualty rate for the operation, or 1/4 for the rescuers and 2/5 for the hostage-takers.  Rescue operation successful, but such losses would be considered unacceptable for any organization except for XCom."

Add in the fact that the north probably would have banned the trade of slave-made goods or something like that and it is incredibly likely that slavery would become very uneconomical very fast.

I wouldn't say ""the Civil War was a slave war,"" but I would say that the Confederate states seceded primarily due to the imminent threat of the institution of slavery, particularly the threat of the federal government banning the spread of slavery into new western territories.  People go back and forth at each other about this, and usually both sides of the debate are going overboard. As far as I can tell, things went like this. Slavery was in general getting unpopular in the northern states. The southern states saw the writing on the wall. It was pretty clear (especially after Lincoln won convincingly due to those sweet northern electoral votes) that the federal government intended to at the bare minimum halt the spread of slavery into new western states. Slavery was important to the economy of the south, at least according to the rich people who carried political weight in the south (some things never change). This is definitely by far the most significant reason the southern states seceded. That's definitely not revisionist history, unless some major 1984-style rewriting has happened.  Does that mean that the Union's opposition to secession was also primarily about slavery? Well, it depends what you mean. I tend to think that Lincoln would have responded largely the same way even if the southern states had seceded for some completely different reason, but I'm not an expert, and I don't know if anyone really knows."

Of course he would have. Lincoln literally cared nothing about slavery. He wrote in personal letters that he didn't care about the slaves at all and if he could end the war by freeing slaves or not freeing slaves, he would do it, because the only thing he cared about was preservation of the Union.   Read upon the Corwin Amdendment. It was a bill explicitly supporting slavery in the Southern states. Lincoln supported it as did most of Congress, but war broke out before all the states could ratify it.   Slavery was only important to the Civil War in so far as it was part of the Southern tax base.

He even ALLOWED Union allied slave states to keep their slaves until after the end of the civil war.   I think his record is pretty clear.

As what you stated was essentially truth to us growing up, I always wondered why Northerners could ever believe that it was actually about slavery--I thought it was obviously historical revisionism.  Well, it turns out that the idea that the Civil War wasn't about slavery is utter bullshit. ""Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union"" is the full name of the document which declared South Carolina's secession. You can read it and the equivalent of the other Confederate States here: http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html  It is pretty hard to refute what was written about the justification of secession when it comes directly from the seceding party, and the document makes it clear that slavery was the central issue.   Note: I don't believe slavery to be the reason that the average Southerner chose to fight for the Confederacy; that's a different discussion. Also, it's important to recognize that secession is different from war. The North was the aggressor in that it declared war to enforce its territorial integrity and later issued the meaningless and hypocritical Emancipation Proclamation."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3djs7i,avrg_dick,10,Fri Jul 17 00:26:27 2015 UTC,"No. Slavery was the concrete focal point for what amounted to a Southern feeling of a Northern attack on their way of life. It certainly was a rallying point for the South, but poor southerners (especially men) were not particularly fond of slavery, since slavery drove the price of labor down and kept them artificially poor.  The war itself was, in Lincoln's own words, not about slavery. It was about 'preserving the Union' which translates in plain English to ""maintaining political authority"". The North did not want an independent South and had to goad the South into firing the first shots so it didn't seem like the aggressor (it did so by delivering supplies against Southern wishes to Fort Sumter).  Naturally, at that point, the North had no business in destroying the South or burning half of it to the ground. Even in a defensive war, there is no justification for the actions taken by the North. The fact was, the actions only make sense in the context of the North wanting to completely obliterate any Confederate political power so that they could reclaim political authority.  It's a war of conquest, period."

This act angered many northern whites, mainly Irish immigrants who had accepted U.S. citizenship, not realising that citizenship also made immigrants liable for the draft. Fuel was added to the fire of their anger when black men, mostly freed slaves, were excluded from this same draft. The Irish feared that newly freed slaves from the South would migrate to the North and create further competition in the labor market.  More than 150,000 Irishmen, most of whom were recent immigrants and many of whom were not yet U.S. citizens, joined the Union Army during the Civil War. Some joined out of loyalty to their new home. Others hoped that such a conspicuous display of patriotism might put a stop to anti-Irish discrimination.

Slaves were a central issue to them, in so far as it was the base of their revenue.  But keep in mind...the South didn't start the war. The south ceded. The North started the war. These are two distinct points to keep in mind. In the absence of the North's actions, there would have been no civil war in the US history books.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3djs7i,Kabloski,2,Fri Jul 17 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"We keep running in circles here. Are you not seeing the distinction between the secession and the war? When the South seceded, they didn't take up arms and invade the North. They wanted a divorce, not conquest. It's true they fired on Fort Sumpter first, but that was in South Carolina, and it appeared that war was inevitable. But had the North amicably allowed the South to leave by closing down their military presence in their country, the war wouldn't have happened. I know you think that's just speculation, but it shows us that secession is not a direct antecedent to war. It is possible to have a peaceful secession, just as it is possible to have an amicable divorce in marriage. That Lincoln refused to allow the South to leave, and by the way said absolutely nothing about slavery until a much later date, is what brought the war about.   This is what is so frustrating about these conversations. People seem to refuse to understand the distinction. If I'm lucky I don't get called a racist for in any way defending the idea of secession. But people always insist on conflating the motivations for secession with the motivations for war. The two are really very different things. I hate that slavery has ever existed, and slave owners deserve all the scorn in the world. Bad slaveowners! Bad!  But unnecessary war-wagers might just be worse. And if it's true that the civil war might have been a mere power grab. might. Then maybe we should think about that. Because over 800,000 people died in that war. And civil liberties were trampled everywhere. And awful precedents were set. And if it's true that slavery could have been ended peacefully, maybe we should consider that when judging the praiseworthiness of that war. And if the South, with its awful practices of slavery, could have been simply allowed to leave in order to prevent untold suffering and destruction, maybe we should think about that.

Instead, they went after the civilian populace (See also the March to Sea, burning Atlanta, and the start of ""Total War"").  And then there was Reconstruction.  They wanted to free the slaves at the end, but they consistently wanted to punish the South throughout.  As for Lincoln quotes, there's also that line early on about how he'd preserve or abolish slavery in an instant if it could quickly rejoin the Union.

If the North just wanted to free the slaves, they could've either tried diplomacy   Seems unlikely that it would've worked, and thus it makes sense it wasn't proposed. The South wanted to secede to maintain their self-determination, slavery being one of the most important issues at stake (if not the most important).

Anarcho_Capitalism,3djs7i,intangir_v,7,Thu Jul 16 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"The Civil War really didn't have anyone with the ""moral high ground"" though.  The Northern states were basically fighting to force the Southern states to stay in the Union, with slavery being incidental to this.  However, the Southern states (or rather, the Confederate central government) were mostly fighting because they recognized that the institution of slavery would die a slow death with Lincoln and the anti-slavery Northerners preventing its spread westward (Yeah, he was willing to compromise in the short term for reasons I'll get in to, but in the long run there was no way the South would be capable of preventing a collapse of their economy and they knew it). It's also worth mentioning that while the ""initial"" states that seceded officially did so because of slavery, the ""later"" states (mostly the upper South eg. Virginia) seceded because of constitutional opposition to being forced to send troops to fight the other Southern states, so you could make somewhat of an argument that about half of the states did fight for ""States rights"".  The Confederate Government, meanwhile, was quite centralized and was arguably even worse than the government of Lincoln in terms of interventionism, between immediately instituting a draft, issuing worthless paper currency, and opposing the rights of the governments constituting the Confederacy. If Lincoln didn't invade at all or was defeated, such a government probably would have had its own civil war anyway.  I always get a chuckle out of the deluded idea that Lincoln was somehow a progressive or liberal, though, like he'd be supporting Obama if he was alive today, and that the modern Republican party actually betrays his ideals. Lincoln's policies were pretty much all for the benefit of northern industrial interests, especially the midwestern railroad companies that bankrolled his early elections. Slavery was of no benefit to railroads, so Lincoln opposed it. If anyone thinks he was some kind of racial egalitarian, just check out what happened to Indians under his watch (who, unlike slaves in the South, were actually an obstacle to the interests he represented).  If Lincoln was running today, he'd resemble Mitt Romney in that he'd be a corporate executive, he'd have protectionist policies, and he wouldn't give two shits about the poor (who in his time were Irish immigrants that were even cheaper than slaves and absolutely detested Lincoln). He'd do a lot of pandering to get elected, and he'd dress up every subsidy for his allies, both direct and indirect, as some kind of grand policy that existed for the benefit of whatever group happened to be widely sympathized with."

It flies in the face of the experience of virtually every other country on earth that abolished slavery.  If anything slavery slowed the economic growth of the south because it hindered long term technological agrarian capital accumulation.  The south wanted out of the US immediately because its trade activity with Europe was being hampered by tariffs that were the primary source of revenue for the US government (someone farther up said 80%, but it was more like 95%).  In their minds the upside of the union, assistance with returned slaves, wasn't being enforced, so the downside, excessive share of the tax burden, was no longer worth it.

He was a strong supporter of the movement to deport all free slaves back to Africa, as he was certain that Whites and Blacks were incapable of living together peacefully.

Really, Lincoln was an excellent foretaste of what was to come in the next century, with military dictators running total states and causing death and destruction in order to consolidate power. His total disregard for the rule of law and of constitutional barriers to his own power is illustrated by his suspension of habeas corpus, during which time he imprisoned anyone who got in his way, including senators, judges, assembly members, and journalists. He shut down hundreds of opposition newspapers, and even had one member of Congress deported.   It's no surprise that progressives love Lincoln, because progressives love a strongman.

The only reason war was necessary in the first place was because the asshats in Federal government thought it would be awesome to make it a Federal crime to help hide runaway slaves.  In ever other continent were massive black chattel slavery was underway they resolved the problem mostly peacefully. Slaves ran away to neighboring countries.  Turns out that when you free somebody and then pay them to work.. that is one hell of a motivator and the 'freer' countries benefited economically from the influx of cheap labor.

They could of played the European powers correctly and got all the support they needed to push the invading Northern armies out, but the people running the South government were worse then the people running the North and they ended up blockading themselves in the hope that it would cause a economic crisis in Europe.

(hint: If you want support from your loyal customers, don't close the fucking store in a attempt to force them to support you.)  The worst thing about the war was that the Northern military learned how important it was to destroy the economic base of a region to eliminate the ability for them to support guerrilla fighters.  It worked out so well for them that they repeated the 'march to the sea' style scorched earth campaign against the Indians, then the Germans and tried a version of it against the Vietnamese (which failed) and then are still trying to make it work in Iraq and Afghanistan (which are also massive failures)  Yes the war was about slavery, but not in the way people tend to suppose.  If the civil war was just about slavery then the second Iraq war was due to the massive cache of weapons of mass destruction the Iraqis were maintaining. Or 9/11.

You're stuck on a rock far away from any support except by sea, which will probably be shot to shit before it ever leaves the salt. There was nowhere to go, and surrender was inevitable. Completely inevitable. There are three explanations as to his behavior that I can think of.   Patriotic zealot defending his country to the last. I doubt this one. South Carolina was not yet seen as a major threat to the union, at least not compared to the entire confederacy. It was just a little rebellion. Besides, he was fighting his own countrymen, not some foreigners. He wasn't a crusader defending Jerusalem from the infidels. He was just a man who got caught in some civil unrest. He was an idiot and thought he could survive in Fort Sumter. Now this one, I don't buy either. He knows that the south can stop any and all aid from reaching him unless they're totally wiped out. He's right next to their capital, for fuck's sake. Not only that, he knows how many cannon are sitting right across the water from him, in the fort he just left. The number is 56. Any number of which can (and later will) be trained on his position in Sumter. No man is elevated to his position of command with that level of stupidity unless he's got an important daddy. And this guy does not. He had less than a hundred men to operate an entire fort, for Christ's sake. He was told what to do. This one we know to be true, at least to some extent. This message came from the war department, courtesy of Wikipedia, believe it or not.   ... you are to hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and if attacked you are to defend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt to take possession of any one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance.

There was one country, and the half that wished to keep slaves attempted secession.  Quotes from declarations of causes (confederate declarations of independence, in case you didn't know.):  South Carolina:   ...We assert that fourteen of the States have deliberately refused, for years past, to fulfill their constitutional obligations, and we refer to their own Statutes for the proof.  The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: ""No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.""...  ...For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia...  ...The right of property in slaves was recognized by giving to free persons distinct political rights, by giving them the right to represent, and burthening them with direct taxes for three-fifths of their slaves; by authorizing the importation of slaves for twenty years; and by stipulating for the rendition of fugitives from labor...  ...We affirm that these ends for which this Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection...  ...A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that ""Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,"" and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction...   Texas:    ...[Texas] was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery--the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits--a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time...   ...The States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa, by solemn legislative enactments, have deliberately, directly or indirectly violated the 3rd clause of the 2nd section of the 4th article of the federal constitution, and laws passed in pursuance thereof...   ...the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon the unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of the equality of all men, irrespective of race or color--a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of the Divine Law...  ...They have for years past encouraged and sustained lawless organizations to steal our slaves and prevent their recapture...  ...We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable...  ...That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding States...   Georgia:   ...For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery...  ...The people of Georgia, after an equally full and fair and deliberate hearing of the case, have declared with equal firmness that they shall not rule over them. A brief history of the rise, progress, and policy of anti-slavery and the political organization into whose hands the administration of the Federal Government has been committed will fully justify the pronounced verdict of the people of Georgia...  ...The question of slavery was the great difficulty in the way of the formation of the Constitution. While the subordination and the political and social inequality of the African race was fully conceded by all, it was plainly apparent that slavery would soon disappear from what are now the non-slave-holding States of the original thirteen...  ...Northern anti-slavery men of all parties asserted the right to exclude slavery from the territory by Congressional legislation and demanded the prompt and efficient exercise of this power to that end. This insulting and unconstitutional demand was met with great moderation and firmness by the South...  ...After a bitter and protracted struggle the North was defeated in her special object, but her policy and position led to the adoption of a section in the law for the admission of Missouri, prohibiting slavery in all that portion of the territory acquired from France lying North of 36 [degrees] 30 [minutes] north latitude and outside of Missouri. The venerable Madison at the time of its adoption declared it unconstitutional. Mr. Jefferson condemned the restriction and foresaw its consequences and predicted that it would result in the dissolution of the Union. His prediction is now history...  ...The prohibition of slavery in the Territories, hostility to it everywhere, the equality of the black and white races, disregard of all constitutional guarantees it its favor, were boldly proclaimed by its leaders and applauded by its followers.   With these principles on their banners and these utterances on their lips the majority of the people of the North demand that we shall receive them as our rulers.  The prohibition of slavery in the Territories is the cardinal principle of this organization...   Mississippi:   ...Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world...  ...It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion...  ...It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union, and has utterly broken the compact which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain.  It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst...  ...We must either submit to degradation, and to the loss of property worth four billions of money, or we must secede from the Union framed by our fathers, to secure this as well as every other species of property...   And that's just those I could fit in one comment.  tl;dr Southern states seceded because they wanted slaves, and were anti- states rights.  Stop trying to defend the indefensible, ya racist fuck."

What many people in this sub are trying to defend, though, is the idea of secession, which the US was built upon. We celebrate it every year (under the name ""Independence""), yet that the southern states tried to do the same is considered a moral outrage. Like the ideal way to arrange a country is for everyone to be ruled from a single power center in Washington DC, and anybody who tries to undermine that arrangement, or to start a competing government, shall be invaded by the army.   All the quotes you listed prove is that the South wanted to secede largely because of slavery. That's true, and that's bad. They're bad. But that doesn't answer why the North wanted to invade. Was that also because slavery? If so, why didn't they go around invading other countries to end slavery there too?"

But the whole premise of the Constitution (as well as the articles of confederation) speaks to what I'm trying to say. Representatives from 13 independent ""states,"" or really ""societies,"" met together in order to agree terms that would bind them all together in some way. But it had to be a unanimous agreement. The burden of proof was on the proponents of the Constitution to show why the states should join, rather than on the states to show why they shouldn't."

It was a cynical, murderous ploy to preserve the institution of slavery, which the  US and the UK were actively discouraging and dismantling. The only reason why the US hadn't done what the UK did much earlier, i.e. to completely outlaw the practice, is simply because slavery was a deeply entrenched economic and cultural tradition in the South. The South worshiped slavery: even the people who didn't own slaves, aspired to be slave owners one day. They were hoping to impose it on the north and everywhere the US would expand, but when Lincoln was elected, the South exploded in a massive hissy-fit and threw the table over.  Slavery is the reason why the South went to war. Period. There simply nothing else to it. The Union was ""slave owning"" in the sense that they had legacy practices, which were promptly dismantled once the war was over.

If your logic can cover every set of circumstances, then it's sound logic.  The problem really lies with people that can't openly discuss the issues to the extreme. When a republican bashes homosexuality, then is discovered on the floor of a public toilet giving a blowjob, those are the people you should have been worried about in the first place. Simply not discussing things and covering up the problem is not helping things.

My personal belief is children should be cherished by their parents and I would never personally get an abortion. However for the purpose of this discussion, I'm challenging you to think of a -6month and +6month child to be nothing different than a clump of cells. If you want to challenge me on this, then you're likely going to say ""magic happens at birth"", which is a baseless and illogical position to hold.

This allows one to justify almost any behavior as long as it can be construed as bringing about the glorious revoution which will make everything great. To use a rough comparison: its like how the promise of 72 virgins in heaven can inspire terrorists to do horrible things, although terrorists are an order of magnitude worse than what most leftists get up to. If the reward is guaranteed and the action is 'justifiable' in pursuit of the reward, then you can go to huge, horrifying lengths to achieve it and still feel you're doing the right thing.  If you are convinced that your actions can and will help bring about the wonderful utopia, then the actual consequences of your action need not matter, nor the principles underlying it. Its all just one step on the road to paradise, be that in heaven or on earth.  Lying, stealing, cheating, even murdering is all permitted because you're fighting the power and it all goes to bring about the desired result. NO cost is too great, from this perspective.

A liberal ultimately believes in the market, though they may wish to have a social one and, at the end of the day, believes in the state and balancing security and liberty.  Basically, liberalism, in the philosophical sense, is the coordinates in which all American politics takes place, including libs, progressives, libertarians and so on.  The only exception are radicals and reactionaries, the former including communists, socialists, anarchists and the latter, fascists and so on.  Liberalism in the political sense, in America, is the progressive form of philosophical liberalism.  It wishes to expand the market and the state to other previously disenfranchised peoples.  Hence its obsession with identity, victimhood and trauma.  A liberal seeks putative equality for those previously excluded.  A radical seeks liberation. A reactionary seeks further exclusion.    Both an-caps and socialists have identified themselves in the liberal philosophical tradition before, the best examples, respectively being Mises and Chomsky.  Though this is by no means necessary.   The political liberal is someone, ironically, who we, both commies and ancaps, love to hate because their lack of conviction and slipshod conciliationism and pleas for decency in a wholly indecent world are very fucking annoying.  So, please, continue to accuse us left wingers of being dishonest, cowardly statists, but do NOT lump us in with Bill Maher or liberals generally."

One, ancap is extremely fringe, so you're going to have fewer of all types of people involved. Leftism, on the other hand, is basically the dominant ideology in all its various forms. So you have more dishonest people there, but that is to be expected. I'm sure there are many sincere and intellectually honest leftists.  Second, leftism appeals more to young people, and young people are immature, so you're going to see immature argument tactics more often.  Third, ancapism is pretty strongly steeped in logic and rationality, so ancaps are going to be more aware of logical fallacies, and will be less likely to use them. The cognitive dissonance would be too painful for many of us. Leftism, on the other hand, is less interested in consistency and more in what they see as fair outcomes. So they're going to be pretty unconcerned with dirty tactics if they think it will help them win an argument. Hell, many of them are postmodernists, meaning they deny there is a single logic or Truth out there to begin with. So why would they care about arguing from first principles.  Finally, this is Reddit. A semi anonymous forum where some of the worst aspects of humanity are free to expose themselves without shame. So you're going to get some shitty behavior."

I think this is because we actually are individuals and have arrived at our positions through evidence rather than group-think. When someone gets trapped into a corner, they can start to question the validity of years 9if not decades) of their past life. To admit you were wrong makes you feel like a fool and young people have no experience getting past that blow to the ego. Instead they resort to name calling and violence, while retreating back to their group.  Words hurt people and I've heard of people committing suicide because of negative ostracizing comments across the internet. So in essence, when we start to make themselves question their beliefs, they're starting to see themselves as bad people and worthy of ostracism themselves. Suicide is like the ultimate self-ostracism.  IMO this is why soldier kill themselves as well. Despite people calling it PTSD, I think it's guilt and a shattering of the cognitive dissonance."

I can barely wrap my head around it. But I find it interesting that Austrian Economists don't seem very keen on refuting or even challenging this theory. They instead side with the neoclassical economists that believe in the money multiplier  whereas banks are held to reserve requirements which lead to an increase in the money supply.

I can understand this sentiment, but I would be surprised if a statist would believe in such a system. They seem to view things as a top down hierarchy and giving banks free reign to do whatever they want seems to give them the power of a oligarch.   I mean we do have a bank oligarchy in the world we live in, so reserve ratios really are meaningless, but I don't see him drawing that conclusion. Your link said it best here:   Ulti­mately, Cen­tral Banks aban­doned mon­e­tary tar­get­ting, and moved on to the mod­ern approach of tar­get­ting the overnight inter­est rate as a way to con­trol infla­tion.[6] Sev­eral Cen­tral Banks—including Australia’s RBA—completely aban­doned the set­ting of reserve require­ments. Others—such as America’s Fed­eral Reserve—maintained them, but had such loop­holes in them that they became basi­cally irrel­e­vant.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,HamsterPants522,20,Thu Jul 16 17:38:46 2015 UTC,"im curious about how you guys would explain anarcho-capitalism to me   You'll get different answers depending on who you talk to. Advocacy for Anarcho-Capitalism can come from multiple directions, ranging from moral reasons to economic reasons.   Anarcho-capitalism is, fundamentally, just an advocacy for respecting private property norms above all else. It is literally just a position favoring negative rights (namely, the right to self-ownership and the right to own property) and nothing else. Since governments have free reign to violate private property norms, then that is a reason to oppose them.  The justifications for the importance of respecting private property norms are both moral and economical.   how do you plan to bring about anarcho-capitalism if a very large portion of the world are committed statists , in Europe a large portion supports social-democracy and regulations and in south america and Asia Marxist guerrillas and political parties are still very strong, how would you convince them to follow your ideology?   There is no central plan for anarcho-capitalism. Every one of us has our own ideas, it's just a matter of who succeeds in acting on it. That being said, almost nobody is thinking that it's a good or productive idea to try to convert people to this worldview. The currently most popular idea for establishing anarcho-capitalism is to build a floating city on the ocean comprised of anarcho-capitalists, and then if the economy in that city flourishes, this can serve as hard irrefutable evidence that state governments are not needed, and are in fact bad for society."

My personal view on ""anarchism/capitalism"" is different from a few years ago. I used to see Ancap as a goal, but now I just see it as a way of describing the most efficient way that the world ALREADY OPERATES. I would say the vast majority of human interaction is anarchistic and capitalistic already, and it has been this way for thousands of years. Sure, there have been tribes/kings/empires that CLAIM to control the nature of events, but my understanding of how technology and trade have advanced throughout the years leads me to believe that mutually-beneficial trade is the backbone of all civilizations that advance past cavemen.   A good example of this is police officers. While on the Job, their official role is often to hamper and stifle market transactions, and to be an ""archon,"" thus nullifying anarchistic interactions. In practice, however, these very police officers spend the large majority of their time peacefully trading with grocery stores, gas stations, doughnut shops. They go to their kid's little league games. They bake cookies for their older neighbor. Only when they exercise their power are they creating a non-anarchistic environment.   tl;dr: I think anarchistic, capitalistic interactions are vital to the growth of society, and because people are utility maximizers, they will adopt behaviors that are anarchistic. Even if they claim to love Bernie Sanders/Jeb Bush, they will spend most of their days trading peacefully and furthering the beautiful harmony of the market out of self interest."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,clear831,20,Thu Jul 16 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"isn't anarcho capitalism basically what we say in the 1800's where the capitalist class had basically no restrictions or regulations and was free to exploit people at factories as much as the wanted?   No, and there are a couple of reasons why.  First, is that governments were heavily involved in either regulating or subsidizing the industries involved.  Railroads are a great example of this.  Those companies got so powerful because they were helped by the government.  Second, the working and living conditions were pretty terrible everywhere, and since the people still chose to work in the factories, it was obviously better than their alternatives.  Third, the government is the sole arbitrator of disputes.  There are no third parties that I can go to if I disagree with their rulings.  So the government tells companies they can do X, Y, and Z.  The companies then go do X, Y, and Z.  Clearly this is caused by government action, not lack of government oversight.  Now I can't really contest X, Y, and Z being done to me in any meaningful way.  This brings me to my last point.  An ancap society wouldn't be completely unrestricted or unregulated.  It would be regulated by the market, and by the people that operate in it.  That would allow the rules to respond to what people wanted.  If, for example, a factory was built in your town and belched smoke all day, you and your fellow citizens could take that company to court.  Based on a system of property rights, you would win, since they are damaging your property.  Trying the same thing in the current system and the one which was roughly present in the 1800's, gets you smacked with the idea of the 'public good'."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,Shamalow,5,Thu Jul 16 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember that capitalism is such an incredibly recent event in mankind's time-line. Capitalism rose mostly out of the poor, through the tradespeople, the smiths, and is not really from the rich. At the cusp of the industrial age the lower classes (talking Britain here because that's where it all really began) found that with a little imagination they could make incredible things that not only enriched their lives, but the lives of those around them, by being able to find ways to produce goods for the masses. Yes, the rich got their first dibs as they usually always do, but the producers still had the means of production and now the savings with which to continue to produce ever larger quantities of those goods at ever lower prices.  The Robber Barons of America weren't hated by the people, although they were propagandised later on into being hated by the masses, with that negative viewpoint being schooled through the education system subsequently. At the time, it was their competitors who hated them and who just couldn't compete fairly against them. So, those Competitors lobbied & petitioned the U.S. Federal Government to have their more competitive enemy stopped. Thus the Anti-Trust legislation, which by the time it came about wasn't necessary. Just like ever of occasion where government has introduced Anti-trust laws, the perceived monopoly had already been countered by natural market forces. ie Other competitors.  Tom Woods has some great articles and talks about the Robber Barons. Here is one:  In praise of the Robber Barons  And Mises.org is a fantastic resource for things like this:  The Truth about the Robber Barons  ""The Age of Robber Barons"" by Robert LeFevre."

""Invitations"" in this context are those who move to an ancap enclave in order to find opportunity, ie: jobs and the ability to start a company without barriers to entry. And also those who want to purchase property. You work-in, or buy-in. Elsewise, you're invited to the property of a property-owner on an individual basis. There are no immigration laws thereby, just property owners. This doesn't become a problem because there are also no public roads, so even road owners must allow you on/in.   In short it's self regulating by virtue of leaving decisions to property owners generally. No one's going to own everything, but each person will own something and make decisions over it themselves."

Still, it's healthy to have one's ideas and preconceptions challenged, so here it goes...  The first mistake that I think you're making is to think that AC is something that needs to be advocated for.  Like, people getting together for the cause of AC in order to change the political status quo.    Nothing could be further from the truth: AC is precisely about depoliticising subjects that are, today, considered very political.    For example, if you think about healthcare or education, a politicised point of view might be to say ""X amount of wealth must be taken from citizens A, B and C to pay for citizens D, E and F to go to school"".    AC, on the other hand, considers the provision of these services to be very similar to other services, responding to similar market incentives as any other.  Since many products and services today are improved substantially when capital is used to augment the productivity of labour, the case is made by ACs that better results will be made in an environment that is as free from government interference as, say, the internet.  So, since healthcare and education are vastly improved by technological evolution (i.e. new tech allows us to perform operations today at a fraction of the price they were just a couple of decades ago), the argument could be made that an organisation like Apple or Google (or a completely new start-up that will become tomorrow's Apple or Google) would do a better job at providing these services than those old, dusty, bureaucratic organisations.  So, in that sense, no case needs to be made by AC partisans: AC is already happening, technology is already enabling the freeing of the individual.  There are so many things that individuals used not to be able to do, like live in one country and work in another, simple things like Skyping their clients on the other side of the planet, or difficult ones like investing their savings into projects on the other side of the planet.    Companies like Uber, Airbnb, Google, Reddit, Wikipedia, Skype, etc. are already performing functions that, not so long ago, needed heavy government intervention in order to exist.  The AC claim is that those services are the first to be taken over by companies that perform it much better than the existing service provider (i.e. the state monopoly).    AC's next claim is that the services typically supplied by the ""night watchman"" state – police, defense and courts of law – can also be supplied better by the private sector than by the state monopoly.  It's just a matter of time.  Despite the fact that states are themselves also tightening their grip on power, as we have seen these last few years with many liberty-reducing activities by governments, overall there still is great cause for optimism.  So, from the AC point of view (I'm generalising here, but you get the idea) the best way you can ""mobilise"" people to create a better world is to start your own start-up in a sector previously dominated by state participants.  It's a very long subject, obviously, but feel free to throw your ideas at anything I've written, I'll be delighted to respond."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,Not_Pictured,2,Fri Jul 17 05:39:08 2015 UTC,"It's just a matter of time.    It is. An what separates AC's from the rest is that AC's understand that this can be achieved through peaceful means, and not revolution, or violence, force and coercion."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,tableman,5,Fri Jul 17 07:45:33 2015 UTC,"Your post is sufficiently broad that no one will be able to provide a complete answer, in part because you believe the widely-held, but wildly incorrect, story of the late nineteenth century American economy. It is difficult to answer an interlocutor's question when one believes the question to be based on a false premise, as the premise distracts from the heart of the question and inspires greater confusion and disagreement.  Instead, I'd encourage you to read some of the resources in the side bar and ask questions as they arise in your reading.   As a quick summary of anarcho-capitalist beliefs, I'll offer the following:   Anarcho-capitalism rejects the state in its entirety. Anarcho-capitalism accepts property rights, though there are competing theories for the discovery of best claims. Many anarcho-capitalists support the Non-aggression Principle (NAP) and some use it as the fundament of anarcho-capitalist philosophy, law, or morality. There are competing ideas for spreading anarcho-capitalism. In recent years agorist strategies have become more promising. There is a good argument that states can be relegated to obsolescence and decay through entrepreneurship and appropriate technology."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,tableman,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"My idea of Anarcho-capitalism is the lack of belief in a state, a state defined as an artificial monopoly legitimized mostly through ideology rather than market forces. What you'd get without this ideological adherence to statism is what I'd refer to as Anarcho-Capitalism.  If you have a decent understanding of economics and are a minarchist, you should read this recent post of mine.  I often draw a parallel between Anarcho Capitalism and implicit Atheism, they both lack a belief in something, the former lacking belief in state as defined earlier, and the latter lacking belief in God and its variants.  So if you want to be convinced about Anarcho-Capitalism, it's essentially about being unconvinced about the state. So if you have concerns about that, shoot away. But know that you will require an explanation of how you think a state can solve a problem and why you think only the state can solve the problem."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,Fridge-Largemeat,2,Thu Jul 16 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"What anarcho-capitalism is   It is the logical conclusion to some well-known facts about human behavior, some of which are called the laws of economics. First: that humans act. Second: that in acting we express preferences over inaction or actions not taken, no matter how slight those preferences may be. Third: that your preferences occur within your mind and are not necessarily knowable by third parties until you act.  These truths have implications that lead to an anarcho-capitalist way of thought when taken to their logical conclusion. They draw a limit around what you can coerce groups of humans into doing before catastrophic unintended consequences appear. They explain why trade works and why it is superior to coercion over the long term. These truths also help explain and understand why people make the decisions that they do, and why government policies have the results that they do.   isn't anarcho capitalism basically what we say in the 1800's where the capitalist class had basically no restrictions or regulations and was free to exploit people at factories as much as the wanted?   Yes and no. Post-Civil-War America grew immensely rich due to the conquest of the West and a rather free economy, but you should check your assumptions regarding words like ""exploit."" Trades are by definition mutually beneficial, even trades of labor for money.   how do you plan to bring about anarcho-capitalism if a very large portion of the world are committed statists   People have many plans to change the world, most of which will fail. The ones who I think have the best odds are the ones aimed not at making converts or taking political control but by inventing new technologies and institutions that improve people's lives. They will do this by leveraging the anarcho-capitalist's superior understanding of how technology, people and institutions affect one another in order to create tools that make people more free by subverting immoral or unnecessary restrictions enforced by the state. Examples include Silk Road, the Peacekeeper app, the Seasteading Institute, bitcoin, Defense Distributed, or even books like Jeffrey Tucker's Bourbon for Breakfast.   how would you convince them to follow your ideology   I don't think I would. Although if anyone asked why I have chosen this ideology, it is because it allows me to understand and anticipate what will happen in the world without resorting to magical thinking.  Inventing escape routes from the state has a way of attracting followers even if they don't understand the ideas you used to create the escape route. Jesus Christ said ""Do not give dogs what is sacred, and do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to shreds."" Most people, and social-democrat/marxists especially, don't want to hear that the world would be a better place if they would just stop trying to control everyone around them.  edit: some omitted words"

By example, mostly. There are many places where capitalism is rampant and the state is minimal, and they flourish (think Singapore, Switzerland, etc).

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,ChopperIndacar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:17:33 2015 UTC,how would you convince them to follow your ideology?   This is how I plan on it
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,phoenix--insurgent,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"It is Anarchy + Capitalism. So there is anarchy which means no ruler and there is also capitalism which means private property norms, contract laws etc. Anarcho-Capitalism theory explains how private property norms, contract laws obligation and enforcement etc. are possible without a monopoly Government.  So it is clear that there will be laws and rules and enforcement, but creation of such laws and doing the enforcement should happen in a competitive market. That laws (legislation), security (police) and justice (courts) is a produced good in the market and there are multiple producers with overlapping jurisdictions.  Will on person potentially exploit another person in the market? Yep, absolutely can happen. Will it be worse than the current status quo? Not likely. The early industrial era practices could be demonized now with our modern understanding of human rights, but for that time and age it was a better deal to people than* toiling physically for subsistence farming. It is also debatable how much monarchy and aristocratic traditions played into the capital relationship between people at those times.  The above idea of competing security providers (Rights enforcement agencies or REA) and courts (Dispute Resolution Organizations or DRO) and contract laws (aka insurance laws and any other contracts) together is called Polycentric-law system. Polycentric law has existed right from primitive tribes to pre-renaissance cultured societies and even upto today. The inter-nation relationships are made possible by contracts between Governments without no bigger monopoly authority to guarantee that. Polycentric law before urbanization was possible due to availability of trust network based on clan and family trees. But even in history, urban areas are what that gave to powerful States. To bring polycentrism to urban areas, lot of technologies should be developed to ensure trust and legitimacy in a decentralized fashion. Many of those technologies and adoption of those technologies fall under the counter economics strategy called Agorism.  The side-bar has links that explain the above ideas in much more detail."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj096,ChopperIndacar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"how would you convince them to follow your ideology?   Just to make a tangential point, political phenomena resulting from ideology doesn't result, by and large, from ""convincing"" people to follow that ideology. Anyone who thinks so doesn't understand how culture, material conditions, technology, and power centers control ideology - all of which are mostly outside of the context of persons existing in completely rational spaces. Most people today follow their ideology not for rational reasons.  If anarcho-capitalism ever exists anywhere it will be because all of these contributions to ideology add up to it. The average person in an anarcho-capitalist society won't be a Rothbard scolar, probably won't know much about economics or history, and won't understand the detailed critique of statism by anarcho-capitalists.  The same is true today about the nation state. Most people aren't scholars on Rawls or Locke or Hobbes or Rousseau or whatever political theorist you think shapes the modern state. They watch Fox news or MSNBC and masturbate."

Why on earth would two people exchange like that? Yet another example of how ancappery is based on a false premise. Also, that's barter. No money involved. Not a market. Ha ha ha! This is too easy. You're literally trying to prove me right, aren't you?  Here's what you're doing. Let me try to explain it a different way. I already pointed out in a comment how ancaps value consistency above all else. That means above facts. Of course, the ideal is to be both logically consistent and have evidence. Ancaps stop before the evidence part.  So, consider the humble murder mystery novel. I'm sure we can both agree that it must be logically consistent to succeed as a genre book. However, when we finish reading the book, we don't really think an actual murder took place, do we? Well, no one else does, but apparently ancaps do. That's what you're doing."

Sure, it's barter. That doesn't make it any less of an exchange.   Money is just a medium; a store of wealth. The example works fine if either party trades their commodity for another commodity, which both parties agree holds value, and then trade that value-storing commodity for something else. For example, if I want your fish, but you don't have any use or desire for my apple, I can go exchange my apple for an ass-plug and then trade you that ass-plug for your fish, and all parties are happy."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dhrbt,TheMadMullah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:44:51 2015 UTC,Technically the value of everything is based solely on the labor required to make it. The cost of the paper needed to make a book all stems from the labor required to grow and chop down a tree then to process it into paper.  In the end it all comes back to supply and demand. It's all limited by supply and supply is mostly limited in many areas because labor isn't unlimited/free.

If you pay men to dig a canal with spoons in a developed economy, that's clearly a huge waste of time and money and labor, so the question is, where did you acquire a surplus of those things to throw away on such a project to begin with? I'll say again that the goal is to examine the economy altogether, not just the single transaction of ""I subjectively valued spoons more than shovels,"" which doesn't really tell us anything important.

The resources required to produce something don't intrinsically have a value/cost, they only do because human labor was required to produce them at one point in time. If labor wasn't required for the resource, then the supply has the potential to become very high, and essentially unlimited for the purposes it's used for."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dhrbt,Hhtura,4,Thu Jul 16 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"I posted a comment the other day about worker co-ops being far from fair to the worker:   There was a Reddit TIL that said if Apple were a co-op, each employee would earn some $400,000 or something like that. Although I'm not sure of the figure, I'm sure you get the idea, people who make $50,000ish would be making way more while people making millions would be making way less.   So now, say you have a vacancy, if filled, would have marginal utility to the company of about $120,000. However, if you have to make a hire, the new hiree should receive ~$400,000, which means $280,000 of someone else's product should be reappropriated to the new hire.  How in this case is the work of existing workers ""even more their own"", considering they have to share it with the new hire? Now you can replace ""new hire"" with any worker whose marginal utility is less than his supposed share in a worker co-operative and the result would be the same. So I'm not sure what you've read that suggests co-ops ""make your work even more yours"", as that would somehow defy economics."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dhrbt,Hhtura,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"I thought you wanted a feels answer. The way people feel about things isn't an invalid foundation for their preferences of those things, after all. That is, even if we assume that an economy of self-managed workplaces is less ""efficient"" than otherwise, it could still be the more preferable option if we think of the feeling of control and autonomy and freedom (or whatever) as a service that people are willing to ""purchase"" in the form of sacrificing potential gains, meaning it would be the outcome the market produced if the price mechanism were capable of calculating those particular decisions. To look at those people's situation and say ""they've lost money, or they've produced less output (or something), therefore they've made themselves worse off,"" is simply to demonstrate the limitations of that system, sort of like how if I go to an art show and say ""look at all these idiots buying basic supplies in a particular arrangement, what a waste of money,"" all I'm doing is showing the limitations of a perspective that assigns no ""value"" to the pleasure of experiencing artistic works – from a different perspective, wherein value is assigned differently, those people's actions are perfectly rational, even if ""the market"" has an easier time understanding the high price assigned to art (a simple commodity) than the high price many people assign to a different form of economic system leads to a freer or more satisfying lifestyle (a complex series of services with no clear provider or explicit exchange of money).  I don't think any of that's necessary, though, because I don't know of any reason for why letting people own their workplaces would lead to a less efficient economy in terms of real productivity either. I'm not necessarily demanding a change in their internal or intra-organizational structure; there could still be a division of labor between workers and administrators, and in fact there almost certainly would be in the earlier phases where people are still getting used to the change; equal ownership of a factory or its capital goods doesn't mean an equal role in physically using or manipulating those goods or in deciding what the factory produces and when and why and whom it does business with and so on, only an equal say in deciding which people within the organization have the authority to make those decisions on behalf of everybody else and an equal entitlement to the output of their and those people's various contributions. Moreover, I think the average worker would be more productive in an economic system where ownership of productive capital is less centralized because there would be a more direct link between each worker's input and their share of the resulting output; that is, in today's system any gain realized by an increase in any one worker's productive input partly trickles upward toward the people who profit from that worker's labor (the owner capitalists) and is partly distributed across the entire rest of the economy in the form of a generally stronger economy. If each worker has a direct stake in their own workplace the product of their labor is more concentrated than otherwise and they therefore have a more clear and more direct reason to care about their role in production than whether they are or aren't going to get fired or be given a promotion.   What do you mean by favorable distribution of a society's resources[?]   The distribution of wealth that results in more for the average person tends to be the distribution that's better for society overall because the ratio of wealth to general quality of life and capacity for productivity tends to have diminishing returns. So a dollar improves the life of a poor man more so than a rich one because it's a higher proportion of the wealth he already had than of the wealth the rich man already had. I think that even if socialism was only exactly as productive as capitalism, shifting entitlements could result in a significantly better life for the vast majority of people.   how does it handle things like differing rates of productivity and worker attrition?   This would vary depending on the social dynamic of that particular workplace; if we assume they're all selfish robots then worker compensation could be determined directly by individual productivity, such that each person only owns and can therefore profit only from that which they were responsible for creating, meaning the worker who hammers in the most nails or whatever is still going to be the person who goes home with the most bread... or whatever."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dhrbt,hot_rats_,3,Thu Jul 16 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"I thought you wanted a feels answer. The way people feel about things isn't an invalid foundation for their preferences of those things, after all.   That is indeed true if we're only talking about personal preferences. But here we're discussing why everyone else should have similar preferences, so feels doesn't cut it. I can't and won't do something simply because you personally prefer it, I must prefer it as well if I were to do it.  I agree with the rest of your paragraph. It would be inappropriate for me to say a voluntary co-op is silly because value is subjective, and whoever works with the co-op apparently values it. But it would be similarly silly to say anything that's not a co-op is an oppressive institution. If people prefer working there, they will work there.  Why worker co-ops (which I believe is what you mean by equal ownership) would lead to less efficient outcome, is because of several reasons.   If worker co-ops evenly split the whole product, it disincentivizes workers with a higher than average MPL from working for the co-op. This holds true even if you incorporate feels. If a worker potentially earns (money + feels) less than the opportunity cost, he will not work for the co-op. If the co-op pays far less than the MPL, its competitor will have enough leverage to pay something closer to the MPL, hence leading to inefficiency for the co-op. It ignores the utility a person you call capitalist puts into acquiring or investing in capital. Not permitting such ""capitalism"" disincentivizes investment. This is actually an extension of the previous point.   Essentially both workers and ""owners"" contribute their product to a company. They will do so only if the utility received in return has more value. To owners, they contribute capital and receive capital + feels. To workers, they contribute time and receive capital + feels.   If you think workers should receive compensation in line with their contribution, that is what happens already in a capitalist society. In fact, they receive more than they contribute. If not, they wouldn't be contributing what they do if it's more valuable than what they receive.    Moreover, I think the average worker would be more productive in an economic system where ownership of productive capital is less centralized because there would be a more direct link between each worker's input and their share of the resulting output;   This already happens. Workers are paid salaries and bonuses according to their MPL.   that is, in today's system any gain realized by an increase in any one worker's productive input partly trickles upward toward the people who profit from that worker's labor (the owner capitalists) and is partly distributed across the entire rest of the economy in the form of a generally stronger economy.   This stems from the labor theory of value and marxist definitions of surplus value and is bad economics. The gain realized by the worker's productive input would not have been possible without the capitalist's contribution to begin with. If a capitalist is not going to gain, he will not make an investment. The gain effectively happened not only because of the worker's input, but also because of the capitalist's input. If the worker could manage to make this improvement by himself without the capitalist's input, he is free to do so and doesn't have to share the marginal utility with the capitalist.   If each worker has a direct stake in their own workplace the product of their labor is more concentrated than otherwise and they therefore have a more clear and more direct reason to care about their role in production than whether they are or aren't going to get fired or be given a promotion.   They already have a stake via bonuses and stock options. But if you mean this can only happen in co-ops, the required investment to conduct business will likely be unavailable.   So a dollar improves the life of a poor man more so than a rich one because it's a higher proportion of the wealth he already had than of the wealth the rich man already had. I think that even if socialism was only exactly as productive as capitalism, shifting entitlements could result in a significantly better life for the vast majority of people.    That's true if you assume socialism is anywhere nearly as productive as capitalism. But since you base a society on disincentives, I don't see how this assumption can be valid. A dollar amount does indeed mean more to a poor man than a rich man. This is obviously factored into salary negotiations. Even if not, I do support redistribution, but I don't think a centralized monopoly is capable of managing such redistribution, whose optimality varies locally. Anyone who has a stake in the economy will have an interest in keeping it healthy."

This stems from the labor theory of value and marxist definitions of surplus value and is bad economics.   I didn't say profits trickle upwards thinking it'd be a point of disagreement. The dollar gains generated by a business are the property of that business's owner, not its employees.

It's possible for a worker to buy stocks in the company they work for, but it's still a distorted relationship because that stock would be representing all the locations the business owns rather than just their workplace, and because many of the stocks that make up that business would still be owned by non-workers. If you prefer to, you can think of socialism as all workplaces being publicly traded, but all the stocks of each workplace being bought by that workplace's workers.   A dollar amount does indeed mean more to a poor man than a rich man. This is obviously factored into salary negotiations.   I'm not sure their salary negotiations are relevant.

Back then there was much more of a willingness to tolerate a divergence of opinions within the anarchist-left, at least to the extent that there existed a bare minimum of respect for free speech, even for the opposition. But of course the internet presence of ancom had not been well cultivated then. The resulting collectivization of ancoms on the internet over the last 8-10 years has predictably awakened the metaphorical beast from within that always rears its ugly head when the ""herd"" congregates.   It's a bit tragicomedic how they continue to put on airs that they are the liberators and not the inevitable oppressors.  Make no mistake about it, every one of them knows at some level that what they are advocating would lead them down the path of eventually becoming some form of the violent aggressor and damaging the lives of innocent people. The problem is the few of them that still maintain a modicum of integrity to be able to stop would be unable to act upon it as the collective would overwhelm them.  Thankfully, I don't see them ever doing anything in North America or most of Nothern Europe, but they could cause a great deal of damage in the Mediterranean region as it is a breeding ground for that kind of collectivized lynch mob mentality."

The fundamental question of any political theory is ""under what circumstances is the use of force justified?"" AnCapism answers that with a set of property norms and goes not one step further. Any further questions have to be answered by additional philosophies.  I see this as a good thing. It means that Christians, nihilists, UPB-ers, Objectivists, etc. can all ally politically in spite of their differences, as long as they can agree on the AnCap property norms. If you try to expand the scope beyond them, you're just cutting out allies, and lord knows we need all the friends we can get."

That is the fundamental question of libertarians, not the fundamental question of other political ideologues.  The actual fundamental question of politics is what are the highest values and how do we honor them?  Leftists often answer as whatever raises and unites community, elevating the poor however much is needed.  Aristocrats often answer as whatever elevates beauty, the aristos often embodying it.  So, when you tell me, ""Whatever uses the least amount of force,"" you're answering the same general question, just your values are maximum commercial leeway—whatever maximizes material growth.  As I have said and as Curt has said, these three groups ultimately need each other, as specializations of different areas of what keeps civilization together, but I think it's apparent Beauty rules over Material and the Poor, which is why that has historically been the hierarchy.   If you try to expand the scope beyond them, you're just cutting out allies, and lord knows we need all the friends we can get.

So, when you tell me, ""Whatever uses the least amount of force,"" you're answering the same general question, just your values are maximum commercial leeway—whatever maximizes material growth.     The ancap basis for individual rights goes beyond commercial considerations. Relationships that are entirely outside of commerce are still protected by ancap property norms. The idea is the leave as much freedom as possible for individuals to pursue whatever values they may hold, material or spiritual.  It may seem like ancapism is overly concerned with commerce, but that's because most of its intellectuals come from economics backgrounds."

If you can't prove that basic democracy is justified, then the ends don't justify the means.   Democracy is collectivism.  Collectivism ignores the plight of the individual. Anything that ignores my plight is not favorable to me.   Someone would have to be lucky to have the collectives wishes align up with their own wishes. So I think it's safe to assume that in a democracy that nobody is 100% happy. Why should I want to be in a system that is less than 100% to my satisfaction?  This is why I think people have been deceived. they think that the collective will make them happier than they would be on their own. I can understand this to be true for some people (e.g. handicapped), but not for everyone. We would all be better off if we were individuals without any ties or treaties with anyone else. This is why the founding fathers thought they shouldn't enter into treaties as well."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dizar,aletoledo,2,Thu Jul 16 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"Are there any examples of how more freedom would yield more utility, particularly to achieve more happiness? It seems like the common response I get is that libertarians or anarcho capitalists put too much faith in the free market and individuals to self govern. Like Monsanto, for example. Assuming all the negative allegations of Monsanto are true; how would a free market prevent such corruption without government interference?  It seems like those who are socialist aren't very great at nuanced thought; so they dismiss libertarianism very quickly. I find it difficult to give them examples.    It's easy to argue for libertarianism on an ethical basis, but hard to explain it in terms of utility."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dizar,Priscilla3,5,Thu Jul 16 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"utility, particularly to achieve more happiness   This is a messed up argument.  For example, I could sneak up behind Bill Gates, shoot him in the head, and steal all of his money.  That would make me very happy, and would not make him unhappy at all.  He's dead, and he didn't experience much in the way of displeasure of dying.  I'm not very knowledgeable about Monsanto, but I'll try my best.    The first is obvious.  Don't buy their products.  In a system without the insane levels of entry barrier, they would have multiple competitors.  Second is lawsuits.  If you can show they are hurting you or your property, you can take them to court, and you will almost certainly win.  No public good, no subsidies, no weaseling out with some obscure government regulation loophole.  Now do that times 1000x and you very quickly have a number piling up that even Monsanto can't pay, and they go bankrupt.  So basically, they do good business, or they go out of business."

Simply assuming governments can, especially without there being a higher cost elsewhere, is simply assuming the problem away.  Like how Bryan Caplan puts it about public goods, by saying governments are required to manage public goods, the government itself then becomes a public good. How do you manage that? Isn't the statist solution merely a case of kicking the can down the road, if not worse?"
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dizar,aletoledo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"how more freedom would yield more utility   I try to avoid this argument, because it's subjective. If I say that I'm willing to give up the chance for gay marriage in exchange for more happiness elsewhere, I don't think thats fair to conclude the same for everyone. So instead of looking at the collective as a whole, I think it's better to look at a theoretical individual.   Someone, somewhere is going to be upset by almost every edict of the collective. So from a moralistic standpoint is the collective allowed to make an individual unhappy? No, never. The classic argument here is whether it's OK to lightly scratch someone on the skin if it means it will save 100 peoples lives. The answer to this question determines if you're a collectivist or an individualist. If you say that no matter how trivial the offense, the individuals rights are absolute, then the ends can never justify the means.  All in all, I think my perspective on your argument is that it's a moral question and not a utilitarian one.   too much faith in the free market    I don't think it even has to be about the free market. Individuals can gather together voluntarily and engage in a centrally planned economy (i.e. non-free market). the question is whether the individuals or the collective has a say in the participation of the individuals. A democracy (i.e. state collective) assumes that participation is not optional.   but hard to explain it in terms of utility.   I agree, which is why I avoid the question. I think all utilitarian arguments are ultimately collectivism and all moralistic arguments are ultimately individualist."

Government does not run business well be it services or good creation or mining activities. They are inefficient, ill organised, lack motivation, lack the right incentives, they don't treat customers like customers, they don't offer value for money. The only thing they do have is lots of other people money and it is very easy spending other people money and this is why it leads to so many incentive problems. A private rubbish collection business can go bankrupt if it does not offer value for money and keep up with the collections. If a government runs rubbish collection then it makes no difference how good of a job they do or how often they collect. The tax payer is not seen as a customer, instead the tax payer is seen as a liability. They see tax payers that use government services as a cost, instead of a potential income. Because there is no profit motive they would be better off budget wise if they had less customers and less work. While the private sector is the opposite.

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dgnyp,Citizen_Bongo,5,Thu Jul 16 11:38:21 2015 UTC,"A gunshot and the resulting recoil happen much faster than a propeller could ever impart acceleration.  The only way that would ever be completely smooth would be an equal and opposite reaction;  something effectively akin to a second pistol firing in the opposite direction.  The buffering system in a stock AR 15 makes it recoil less than a 22 lr, which in turn recoils less than the 9mm (I'm guessing) they have on there.  Also with a longer barrel recoil tends to pull straight back, instead of back and up on an arc like a pistol tends to want to do, meaning the propellers that keep that thing in the air won't have to work as hard after every shot to reposition.  Also /u/qemist could be right, they could be using wadcutter rounds or some such giving the illusion that it's handling a lot more recoil than it is."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dgnyp,CaputGeratLupinum,3,Thu Jul 16 12:23:08 2015 UTC,"A gunshot and the resulting recoil happen much faster than a propeller could ever impart acceleration.   This is very sound reasoning but unless that video is very slowed down, which it doesn't look to be the case given the camera's movement. The craft doesn't appear accerlarate at an unrealistic speed to impart via propeller, /u/qemist could very well be right given that...  Perhaps if the propellers had forwards facing counterparts to counter balance them that powerd off?  Adding to what you said I think placing your long barrel level with, or as the central frame its self would distribut the weight where one ideally wants it. If the prop's were adjusted to be providing force ideally with respect to that. Vibrations could naturally make this ineffective even if these assumptions are correct."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dgnyp,Citizen_Bongo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"It does a lot better when it has forward momentum when the shots are fired as the forces cancel each other out a bit, but gets knocked back at least a foot even then, and at least two feet when firing from a standstill.  That's not something you'd necessarily want to bank on if you need accuracy, as it's much more difficult to be accurate while in motion.  You're right in that the speed at which it gets knocked back isn't faster than a propeller could handle, but speed isn't the problem, acceleration is.  Not just feet per second, but feet per second per second.  There's an initial jolt which tapers off as the propellers regain control.  I'd want mine to be able to remain dead still and fire off 700+ rounds per minute all day long."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dgnyp,Citizen_Bongo,2,Thu Jul 16 13:29:57 2015 UTC,What about a recoil balancing system such as the AEK-971 uses?
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dgnyp,Priscilla3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, I mentioned the AR chiefly because I've put more rounds through one more than any other semi automatic battle rifle worth mentioning, and I know it kicks less bone-stock than a Kalashnikov (might even just be a function of the power difference between .223 and 5.45x39mm).  The AK is a better and more robust design though, and I'm sure its derivatives are wonderful.  An AR/M4 will be a hell of a lot lighter though.  The reason the US military keeps to the design when so many obviously better rifles and cartridge designs exist is purely because of the amount of ammo a soldier can carry.  More lead sent downrange always increases the odds you'll hit something you want dead."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dgnyp,CaputGeratLupinum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, the free recoil from the the 5.45x39 in the AK-74 is a bit over half as much as the 5.56 when fired from the M16.  And the M16 is heavier than the AK74 (M4 isn't), so that should negate some of the felt recoil as well.  These are unloaded statistics.  Without going and looking it up, I'm pretty sure a loaded AK47 or AKM is a good bit heavier.  Either way, that wasn't my point.  Let me elaborate a bit.  The AEK uses a counterweight system.  When the gas pushes back the piston, a counterweight is pushed forward to counteract the recoil.  I'm just pondering if this would still work when fired by a flying drone.  It would probably take a counter adjustment against the forward momentum, but should be a smaller adjustment than a full one from the backward momentum."

When the gas pushes back the piston, a counterweight is pushed forward to counteract the recoil. I'm just pondering if this would still work when fired by a flying drone.   I see what you're saying.  With this type of system, the counterweight being massive enough to counteract the recoil might give it a sort of pendulum effect on a lightweight hovering quadcopter.  Someone should start a youtube channel and test this stuff out.  Could call it ""Will It Drone?""  I know I'd subscribe."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dgnyp,CaputGeratLupinum,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:34 2015 UTC,Recoil force is momentum transfer.     22lr is a 36 grain bullet at 1600 fps.  223 rem is 55 grain at 3200fps.  9mm is 115 grains at 1200 fps.  Only thing the gas system can do is impart momentum in the direction of the bullet.  This is not very efficent.  Muzzle breaks do this very efficiently.   Also the direction the recoil force imparts on the quad rotor is going to have more to do with what angle the bore axis intersects the center of gravity and how far offset it is.  It has nothing to do with pistol vs rifle.

Workplace safety regulations allow me more freedom and bargaining power but they are a restriction to my boss.     I'm not saying we need more regulations and higher taxes... I'm merely pointing out how they are indeed different. One person's freedom is another person's tyranny."
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dir31,wrothbard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:56 2015 UTC,"No.   Yes.   A lot of regulations result in more personal freedom for most people (working class). Taxes allow more people to have more freedoms thanks to public education and healthcare that they would otherwise be left as peasantry with absolutely zero bargaining power in the market.   This doesn't make economic freedom a non-personal freedom. You increase some personal freedoms by impeding on other personal freedoms in this case.   The economic ""freedoms"" you speak of are only freedom for private property owners (capitalists).    No they aren't. I don't have to own any capital in order to be taxed.    Taxes do not concern me, they are a huge concern for my boss.   They are a huge concern for me as well, and I'm not a boss. That my personal freedom doesn't matter to you doesn't mean it's not a personal freedom.   I'm not saying we need more regulations and higher taxes... I'm merely pointing out how they are indeed different.   You haven't pointed out that they are different. You've just shown that you have a preconception for which personal freedoms you care about (your personal freedoms) and which you don't (my personal freedoms)."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dir31,dt084,0,Thu Jul 16 20:15:43 2015 UTC,False dichotomy. You can't have social freedom without economic freedom and vice versa.
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj5xc,bearjewpacabra,7,Thu Jul 16 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"Well, they are wrong about one thing. Silver is wealth insofar as it has utility, but its monetary value derives from how it is a representation of wealth.  All money is a representation of wealth, by definition."

Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj5xc,Cialis_In_Wonderland,2,Thu Jul 16 18:36:07 2015 UTC,What about it? It is a representation of wealth.
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj5xc,anon338,3,Thu Jul 16 18:39:21 2015 UTC,I was agreeing with you.
Anarcho_Capitalism,3dj5xc,Anen-o-me,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Current silver market value is almost entirely based on its industrial applications. In this case, it is an industrial good that stores quite some value in it, not as a representation or as a widely accepted indirect means of trade. It is wealth as much as oil or coal is wealth, but its thousands of times more practical to store and trade."

Like oil, coal or steel, but it is practical to store in your home.  This is from 2011:   GFMS noted that cell phones used 13 million ounces of silver last year, while computers consumed 22 million ounces. Thick film PV consumed a whopping 47 million silver ounces in 2010, followed by automobiles which used 36 million ounces of silver   http://investmentwatchblog.com/the-silver-institute-says-silvers-industrial-uses-are-the-largest-component-of-silver-fabrication-demand-continue-to-rise-sharply-by-2015/"
