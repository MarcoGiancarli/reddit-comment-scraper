DogShowerThoughts,3drj4d,mynewaccount5,8,Sun Jul 19 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"No no. You guys are getting confused.   Hot dogs are just called that because that is what the humans cook to give us as treats when it is hot out,  which sometimes they make in the outside kitchen by the huge but fun B-A-T-H.  They call them that because we are hot and dogs and they make us happy.  I'm pretty sure they are made out of squirrels and mailmen."

DogShowerThoughts,3ds0rh,grasshopper_jo,5,Sat Jul 18 22:12:47 2015 UTC,You have to dig under the wall. Then run away and look for a flashy lights car and bark at it. It'll take you home.
DogShowerThoughts,3ds0rh,MHG73,2,Sun Jul 19 03:54:35 2015 UTC,my person gets really upset when I leave the yard without him. So I just stay in the yard like a good dog. He takes me out a bunch (though not as much as I want) so it is okay.
DogShowerThoughts,3ds0rh,hjiaicmk,3,Sun Jul 19 12:49:04 2015 UTC,"You are correct, it is a test. As u/MHG73 suggested, digging is always an option. How tall is the wall? How hard have you tried to jump it? Is there anything you could stand on that would help you get over? Is it solid all the way around? Try pushing every part to see if one part is weaker than the others.  What master is doing, is training you to solve problems, so you can not just be a good dog, but the best dog."

DogShowerThoughts,3cmj4j,jes0308,42,Thu Jul 9 01:48:59 2015 UTC,I sniffed a black and white kitty once. Ended up in a bathtub full of tomato juice.
DogShowerThoughts,3cmj4j,poetetc1,6,Thu Jul 9 05:35:30 2015 UTC,I love tomato juice. You were lucky.

DogShowerThoughts,3cmj4j,CHClClCl,31,Thu Jul 9 06:10:59 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I love smelly stuff.

DogShowerThoughts,3crv1t,DarthFarious,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:37:59 2015 UTC,How do your balls work? ie what is their purpose?
DogShowerThoughts,3cnkwq,butwhatsmyname,5,Thu Jul 9 08:13:19 2015 UTC,I believe the humans exchange metal and paper for the chicken from a building that has a larger light-cupboard and then take the chicken home and put it in their own light-cupboard. I am not sure where the place with the large light-cupboard gets the chicken from though; I can only assume that it's from a place with an even larger light-cupboard.
DogShowerThoughts,3cnkwq,ThereIsBearCum,4,Thu Jul 9 09:07:36 2015 UTC,This sounds like it warrants further investigation.  I still can't work out why the chicken needs the light on though. Perhaps it is scary inside the cold cupboard? Perhaps being in a cupboard is frightening for chickens?
DogShowerThoughts,3cnkwq,theartofrolling,2,Thu Jul 9 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"They must be very cold, the chickens in our light cupboard don't even have any feathers."
DogShowerThoughts,3cnkwq,KumoDreams,2,Thu Jul 9 13:56:44 2015 UTC,The cold cupboard with the light in has bacon in it...bacon will report back later
