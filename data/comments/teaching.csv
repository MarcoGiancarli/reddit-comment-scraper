teaching,3e2m46,madaughe,6,Tue Jul 21 14:03:05 2015 UTC,It's really hard to even consider most of these since getting approval for (or paying out of pocket) for as much as $50/month means these would have to have some pretty amazingly compelling features over Google Slides or PowerPoint that most all of us already have.  I would have found the article more useful if it focused on few options but gave more complete and compelling cases for why we should invest the time looking into them further.
teaching,3e2m46,Thaaron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for free alternatives, I would seriously urge you to try out Prezi.  It has made lesson planning so much easier for me. It's super intuitive to use--it's kind of like building a presentation in a huge space where you can post any images or videos or text and zoom in on them when you need to.  You can search for images to use within Prezi and to put in a video you just have to copy and paste a YouTube link--it's awesome.  Here's an example of one; just press the arrow at the bottom to go through the presentation.  I haven't used PowerPoint once since I found out about Prezi."
teaching,3e2m46,ThisAppleThisApple,4,Tue Jul 21 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"Umm.. i just think that everyone has to learn how to use powerpoint. It does an amazing job at what it sets out to do. But roughly nobody uses it for what it is designed for.  It is for visual aids. It is NOT for the notes that kids should write down. Prezzi is cool and everything, but your job is to teach kids, not look awesome."
teaching,3e2m46,fizdup,2,Wed Jul 22 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but most of the option listed are free.  The feature sets are similar although some do provide some unique options.  The goal of the article wasn't to push teachers toward any one app.  Its a list of what's out there, what device can use it, and how much it would cost if you really like one of them.  I personally pay for a subscription to one of the tools listed because the feature set is worth it vs the free options.  Just my two cents."
teaching,3e436a,CEOPatra,7,Tue Jul 21 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely is education. Just because they are not learning academics does not mean they aren't being educated in other areas.  In the lower grades (until about 4th) there is kots of 1:1 teaching done to see how closley they will get to their typical peer level. Especially with prek/k with ASD, sometimes something just clicks by 1st grade and they are able to go into the inclusion setting with a modified curriculum and learn content. Sometimes they can't.  In the upper grades it switches to a life skills type setting. You teach them to sort, basic daily living skills, money sense, bus schedules and other vocational skills like recycling, sweeping, mopping...  These all help them to possibly survive on their own in the real world (live in a shared apartment with others like them and a helper a few times a week). It also may be enough to get them a basic job at a cash register or as a shopping cart guy at the grocery store or something along those lines. You have helped get them to be active members of society.  And then there is the whole social skills aspect. Teach them the basics of manners, how to be in a room with others, appropriate voice levels, conversations, even getting them to learn how to use ipads/devices to communicate to the rest of the world.  So yes! We ARE educating these students with what they need to function in society even though maybe they dont learn how to graph algorithims or what congress does.  The more we teach them, the less reliant on others they will be when they age out."
teaching,3e436a,massholeteacher86,2,Tue Jul 21 23:37:17 2015 UTC,"I see! Well argued. I suppose education should then be redefined as ""betterment in any sense."" Thanks for your thoughts."

Some are making wonderful progress towards grade/age appropriate academics and social skills while some are already focusing on functional skills. In addition, the specialized techniques used to manage the academic, social and behavioral needs of these students really require a lot of knowledge and experience on the part of the teacher and their team of specialists."
teaching,3e436a,1_comment_Johnny,5,Wed Jul 22 13:44:07 2015 UTC,"Whoo! This is a hot button issue for sure (I think?). My wife and I were just discussing this the other night. The main crux of the argument was how disproportionate the money is spent on students with special needs (such as a full day 1-on-1 aide, plus LRE modifications, transportation needs, lawsuits, etc.), versus the spending on typical students who make up the vast majority of the school district.   From a business approach, it doesn't really make sense. No, it is not education, and it is draining the resources of the district.   From a personal approach, the benefit to the families of these students is often nothing short of a miracle. To be able to count on a safe, encouraging environment for a child while the parents get some bit of normalcy in their life is amazing. Most of the parents of Severely Handicapped students are good people who pay into the system like everyone else and deserve to get the best education their child is capable of.  I come from the personal side; It is a greater good to all those involved for SH students to get an education. It isn't business, it's personal. Though I do wish there were a way of curbing abuse of litigation for some cases. It seems like our district spends an awful lot of money paying for seemingly bogus lawsuits."

He caught pneumonia and was in the hospital for 4 months. It cost the State 2.5 million. He died 2 months later of an unrelated issue.   I sat in on an IEP with a kid in a similar position. He probably wouldn't have made it to 22.   He had a case manager, therapist, occupational therapist, nurse, speech pathologist (even thought he could never speak).   I think a lot of this has to do with a very low amount of hard science (neurology), the 7th amendment, and deep pockets.   Parents want answers. Parents want to see their kids flourish and they REALLY have to depend on others for help.   With principles like 'least restrictive environment' there is a lot of wiggle room for students to get over served.   I'm not saying we should throw them in a closet. But we should really work hard on figuring out what we want for these students and all students."

But as you note, ""the best"" costs far, far more than what the average child receives--not to mention that there's no such thing as average, or that gifted children often receive the short end of the stick when it comes to funding, even though their exceptionalities place them as far away from our mythical average as SH kids.   I'm really not so sure that we can talk about the greater good, though... shifting all that funding towards gifted children, for instance, may give our society great thinkers creating society-changing innovations for all. It's great that we're taking care of all students in our charge, but when I'm paying extra to enrich my kids' education because the current school model doesn't give a damn about gifted kids..."
teaching,3e436a,andriellae,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:12:59 2015 UTC,"My wife teaches teaches self contained special education and has taugh very disable student, and I can assure you that it is education.  It's not the same education (it's special) many other students are getting, but it is education none the less. My wife has helped teach kids how to walk, interact with people in public places, AND how to read, write, and do math.    Yu have to look at schools like hospitals.  Not every patient gets the same level of treatment.  People in the ICU will have much more prompt care than those who get their tonsils removed.  People requiring open heart surgery cost more than stitches.  In the cas of students, some students NEED more support.  It costs more, but it is the goal of the DOE to help students learn and prepare them for the world.  Disabled students at all levels requires more preparation.    I know many will argue that the cost is too disproportionate, but look at the whole spending and what we get for that.  Yes, each individual special education student gets more money for their  education, but their are far fewer of them than average students.  Also, there should be a continuum of services, so that class that you worked in represents a very small percentage.    Also, if we were to make funding more ""equitable"" those students would actually impact regular education students more.  Special education students not receiving additional support from outside specialists, would need much more support fromthe classroom teachers."

If the DBS says ""assault of a constable"" on it you're going to have to explain it very carefully, putting the spin on it that you were young and regret it deeply, that sort of thing is not characteristic and you wouldn't dream of it happening again.  You will have to declare this all the way through your career, which is not a problem.  The best thing to do is declare it early in any application, usually in a sealed envelope enclosed with the application addressed directly to the head.

The experienced teacher will probably grill you and you'll think the kids think you're a mug. Maybe even have a sleepless night in apprehension for the next lesson. This will pass and next lesson will be fine, the kids will have forgotten about it and don't care.

I also work with students who have a very wide range of test scores. It really depends on what you are assessing. If you are looking for comprehension, mixed ability is the way to go so the more advanced students can help the lower students with reading. If you are assessing for fluency, I would recommend ability grouping. If you go this route it is important to have appropriate booms for each group. The mixed ability groups allow for all students to study the same material. In my opinion a successful ELA class should be a mix of fluency and comprehension. The type of groups you create should be aligned with the academic goals of your class."

Hopefully the website provides you with some material, ranging from texts, to links, to unit plans designed by his students!  With 6th grade, I'd say just do your best to focus on keeping kids engaged with and loving reading! You're likely to discover that a lot of middle schoolers actually like to read. With 6th grade, it's all about keeping those kids on board, and showing them how to become better readers.

The papers themselves are fascinating, and I'm glad that economists are taking the task of evaluating teacher performance seriously.  I think the biggest weakness with this kind of analysis is that the only output variable they measure is standardized test scores. In fact, I don't have any critique of the analysis; despite the complaints about their methodology, I find their rebuttals convincing and the fact that their results have been replicated in other studies across the country seem to indicate that they've done their work well. However, their work is measuring the value teachers add... to standardized test scores. If those scores don't correlate to the things we really care about (happiness, career success, creating an internationally competitive work-force) then the analysis in the paper doesn't matter.  Standardized tests are seriously flawed right now -- the content, the implementation, the administration, you name it. It feels to me like these economists are largely wasting their time trying to figure out which teachers are the best at teaching the standardized tests -- when the first step should be to figure out what should be on a test."

A 3.6 is great. I have teacher friends with jobs who graduated under 3.0 overall (although they did need 3.0 or higher in their major).  As for certification, there are many routes. I wouldn't recommend TFA. Can you go back to your university and add the education concentration? It would require about 30 credits, or one year.

It will pay better than journalism (of course, McDonald's might check that box), but more importantly, it will help you test the waters. Teaching is not an objectively good or bad career. It's subjective; it largely depends on how well you fit with the students and how well they fit you. Being an aide or a sub will quickly show you if you should jump in with both feet or if you should save your time and money and pursue other things. Some graduate schools will also consider that time countable experience for Master's applications."

teaching,3dwqjf,eleventeenth_beatle,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"oh, I do.  One of the most important things is not to worry about what they think about you.  If you worry about what they think of you then you are not a good teacher.  You are the teacher, not their friend.  I have in the past bought items of stationary for students who seem incapable to buy them themselves, but that is a very rare occurrence.  I do not stock things for students.  It is their responsibility and their responsibility alone to come prepared.  It is not my job to ensure they have a pen. If a student comes to a test without a pen or a calculator then they must sit that test without a pen or a calculator.  Lending them one only teaches lack of responsibility and bad habits.  Further more buying resources that the school should offer sets an awful precedent.  I will not buy pads of paper with my own money, or plasters for in case my students injure themselves.  I will insist, nay,  demand that they are provided by the school.  If I worked in an office I would not be expected to bring my own computer monitor and keyboard.  Ok, I have got a little of thread, but a lot of other people are posting things that they buy that are required to do their jobs.  If you need it to fulfil your job description your employer should supply it. If they don't then you should NOT pay for it with your won money, you should just say that you cannot fulfil your job without it. If the school says I cannot use its money to buy hair ties then I will tell them that it is literally illegal for me to continue teaching my course as health and safety laws dictate that long hair must be tied back near open flames. If they require me to do long outdoor duties during sunny months then they should supply sun cream.  They have a duty of care towards you. If they will not supply the staff with sun cream then you should not do out door duties.  To the point in hand, if you like carrying a toothbrush and toothpaste everywhere you go then fine, be my guest. I bet you don't take it out to dinner parties though and sneak off to brush your teeth after each course.  Think of the poor person sitting next to you!

To address one of your objections: if a fellow guest at a dinner party doesn't like your breath, he or she can simply break off the conversation and go somewhere else. Kids in school don't have the option of doing that, and we are often in the position of talking to kids face-to-face, sometimes quite close. A reasonable person would want to reduce the unpleasantness of any interaction with a captive audience.  I sincerely hope that you're working in a school where your approach brings results."

teaching,3dk2yi,Reginoldmcbryer,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:32 2015 UTC,"I just graduated college as a chem major (we don't have an undergrad education program), but I TA'd last fall and am TAing this summer. In my department, it is very rare for an undergrad to TA -  generally none do unless they are very desperate. Anyways...  TAing was the best experience I had in undergrad.    how would I teach kids who are essentially my peers in school without treating them as so?   It's pretty easy actually. I had students who were the same age as me or older. Most were a year or two younger. If you don't tell them you're an undergrad, they probably won't know (at least that's how it was for me since all the other TAs are grad students). Plus they automatically see you as a person of authority since you're the teacher. It's cool though because they'll also probably be more relaxed around you/see you as more approachable than some other teachers they've had since you are younger.   what outliers (grading maybe?) could really make the semester difficult for me as a student?    Depends on how much you have to grade. When I TA'd, I taught two discussions per week (same stuff in each one) and a lab with prelab discussion. The thing that took the longest was planning my prelab discussions, by far. I was essentially teaching them everything they needed to know from scratch, which was super cool but also time consuming, since I also had to make sure I was really on top of what was going to happen in lab. Grading wasn't too bad. Conveniently, my class's lab reports were always due on Fridays, so I just spent an hour or so each Friday afternoon grading them. Weeks that had quizzes had another hour or two of grading. Exams for lecture were graded as a group. All in all, everything put together was really time consuming, but I think that's because I'd never TA'd before and I wanted to be really good at it. It was all I cared about that semester, and I LOVED it.  I have no idea how this would go with student teaching stuff, though or how big of a commitment your TA position would be. Mine was expected to be 20 hours per week, which is quite different from TA positions at other schools - for example, my brother is a comp sci TA and just helps grade/spends time in the study room where kids can go for help with programs/homework, but he doesn't actually teach a class.  As for the email, emphasize any teaching experience you have. When I asked for a TA position, I mentioned I had been tutoring ochem for two years and had helped grade exams for lecturers. Be excited, and I imagine you'd get the job."

Your experience shows me that it could definitely be worth pursuing given the possible rewards that could come along with such a job.  Perhaps the University is desperate which could explain why they are reaching out, which gives me confidence that I may get the position yet also causes me to pose the question ""do they have their shit together?""   Either way I think I am going to give it a shot and see how it goes... I hope it is as rewarding as you make it sound.  Thank you again for taking the time to respond to my post!"

teaching,3dk2yi,thecraziestgirl,2,Sat Jul 18 14:37:14 2015 UTC,edit There are 4 positions open and 7 email recipients. How do I present myself competitively and confidently in applying for this position?
teaching,3dkf6t,bgorelick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"I moved to California from Illinois a few years ago and was wondering the same thing as you. Search on edjoin.org , many jobs are posted there.  I suggest doing a lot of research on districts and schools so You are more aware of what you are signing up for."
teaching,3dkf6t,Rosapod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:33:04 2015 UTC,Thank you! Did jobs you applied for expect you to fly out for interviews?
teaching,3dkf6t,Rosapod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:54:52 2015 UTC,"I actually decided to not seriously look for a job until I was in California.   I don't think a school would expect you to fly out, but may also not do phone Interviews. My friend (looking in a different field than education) has also been looking for jobs out here. She said that most places that have called her back will not do phone interviews.  It depends where you are looking. Where I am (Bay Area) there is no shortage of people looking for work who already live here... So many places are not incentivized to take a risk on someone they can't meet face to face.   I'm not trying to discourage you, all the luck in the world! Keep trying and something will fall into your lap. :)"
teaching,3dkf6t,iluv_apples,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"I moved from Missouri to Massachusetts. I timed all of my interviews for the same week during spring break. I was able to swing a job offer before I left. I will say it also depends on what you are looking for. Public schools are going to be different from Charter. I know the Charters in our area are willing to do video interviews and several of our new hires were not able to make it to the school due to their location. I don't know that Public is that accommodating. Charter's tend to start a large hiring push starting around January. We have most of our hires complete prior to the summer. Public schools tend to wait to post until later, usually the end of the school year into the summer. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
teaching,3dkf6t,iluv_apples,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:16:18 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! That is really helpful! How is teaching in Massachusetts? I have been looking into applying there as well.
teaching,3dkf6t,emberella,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:23 2015 UTC,I love it. I went to college here so I knew what it was like. I'm a special educator and have been in the game for 11 years. Let me know if you need any support! I am really familiar with the Charter world in Boston so if you are interested let me know. My school is always looking for young talent in January so hit me up if you are looking around then.
teaching,3dkf6t,kaymar789,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:05:45 2015 UTC,What part of CA?  We're hiring in Silicon Valley - very low SOE district - and we hire out of state often.  I'm sure you could request a skype type interview (I have someone joining my team from Florida this year!)  I agree w/ other comments - check out edjoin.
teaching,3dkf6t,msprings,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:29:47 2015 UTC,"I just did this for a job this fall.  I moved from Chicago to San Francisco.  I would check the website of the district for the area of CA you're going to move. For San Francisco Unified School District it would be sfusd.com. District sites will have a list of current job openings.  Also, Craig's List worked for me.  In the Bay Area it had many openings for both public and private schools.  I had multiple interviews via phone/skype and had to send lesson plans to lots of places.  Some schools I knew it wouldn't be a good fit, I didn't have enough experience, or it wasn't a culture fit so I didn't need to fly out for those jobs that I wasn't really considering.  I did have to fly out for 3 interviews, but I was able to just make a long weekend out of it.    I do think you will need to fly out at least once because it is policy of many districts to have an in person interview/demo lesson. It really wouldn't be a good idea to take a job at a school you haven't seen anyway, that is pretty risky."
teaching,3dkf6t,Howls_Castle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:09:37 2015 UTC,"I made the move from NY ( Hunter College MS woooooooo) to TX.  The only schools I could get to call me back with an out of state address on my resume were charters.  At the time, I didn't want to work for a big charter network, so I just sucked it up and moved to Austin.  I picked up a semester-long long term sub job and then got hired at a district the next year.  If you can swing it, you might want to just move."
