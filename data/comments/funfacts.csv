I went into a gas station opposite my lodgings for the night to get one (Laramie, Wyoming).

Since it is infinite, then it contains every thinkable line of numbers you can think of."
funfacts,1tbyfi,Voelsemand,1 point,Sat Dec 21 14:00:06 2013 UTC,"Clarification, this is not true, or, at least, we don't know if it's true yet.  It is not because it's infinite that it holds this property.  We can construct an infinite decimal that doesn't, like 0.333333....  Also, it's not necessarily because it's irrational, either (meaning it doesn't repeat; it can't be represented as a fraction).  We can also construct something like 0.111100111010111011010101000110010100111...... that never repeats, and is thus not rational.  Not even the transcendental property does this (meaning the number can't be expressed with just roots and powers).  It's possible to construct a transcendental number without using the digit ""9"" in it's decimal expansion, so if I was born in September, I'd be shit out of luck if I were looking for my birthday.  What we're looking for is for Pi to be ""Base 8 normal,"" and I am not really sure what that means exactly.  All I know is that it's not known if it's true or not."
