So as not to shitpost, they basically said what johnfbw said, a lot of what look like bricked-up windows were never intended to be windows, but were, for example, to keep the building symmetrical or for other aesthetic reasons. As an example, the Irish parliament building has what looks like a bricked up window, but the building was built by a very wealthy Lord who would've had no problem paying any window tax."

Five other nations — Australia, Canada, Norway, Netherlands and Denmark — also offered to resettle 10,000 each.  New Zealand offered to settle 600 refugees over a period of five years starting in 2008. By January 2009, more than 8,000 Bhutanese refugees were resettled in various countries.  As of November 2010, more than 40,000 Bhutanese refugees were resettled in various countries.  Canada offered to accept 6,500 Bhutatanese refugees by the end of 2014. According to Raj Khadka,  who is completing his PhD dissertation on the labour market of Bhutanese refugees in Canada, resettlement has provided the opportunity of starting a new life but the challenges that they are facing in the labour market is a big hurdle in establishing themselves in the new countries that are quite different from their own.

We helped a bunch of 'em get established not too far from the church, over in Doraville, Georgia.  It was tough for the younger generation (the people my age and younger -- I'm 25 now) at first, since they'd grown up in a UN camp, and so most of the parts of society you take for granted (employment, buying groceries) were new to them. Even the older generation that remembered life before exile still had a difficult time readjusting, not only to the typical big cultural differences, but back into a non-UN-dependent life.

Obscureknowledge,37wr9z,Lufernaal,3,Sun May 31 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"Germain's contribution would have been forever wrongly attributed to the mysterious Monsieur Le Blanc were it not for the Emperor Napoleon. In 1806, Napoleon was invading Prussia and the French army was storming through one German city after another. Germain feared that the fate that befell Archimedes might also take the life of her other great hero Gauss, so she sent a message to her friend, General Joseph-Marie Pernety, asking that he guarantee Gauss's safety. The general was not a scientist, but even he was aware of the world's greatest mathematician, and, as requested, he took special care of Gauss, explaining to him that he owed his life to Mademoiselle Germain. Gauss was grateful but surprised, for he had never heard of Sophie Germain. The game was up. In Germain's next letter to Gauss she reluctantly revealed her true identity. Far from being angry at the deception, Gauss wrote back to her with delight: ""But how to describe to you my admiration and astonishment at seeing my esteemed correspondent Monsieur Le Blanc metamorphose himself into this illustrious personage who gives such a brilliant example of what I would find it difficult to believe. A taste for the abstract sciences in general and above all the mysteries of numbers is excessively rare: one is not astonished at it: the enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it. But when a person of the sex which, according to our customs and prejudices, must encounter infinitely more difficulties than men to familiarize herself with these thorny researches, succeeds nevertheless in surmounting these obstacles and penetrating the most obscure parts of them, then without doubt she must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents and superior genius."""
