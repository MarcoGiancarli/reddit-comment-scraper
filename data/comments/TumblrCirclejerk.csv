Or be unabashedly racist under the guise of ""preventing microaggressions"".  Sure, it's a stupid ohsoedgy movement but not anywhere near deserving of being compared to obssesive SJW psychotics. Goths are harmless.  The essential difference really is that goths tend to be the quiet types susceptible to being bullied while SJWs are more an overgrown evolution of the sort of jealous bully cunt that would pick on people minding their own business for not following a clique they approved of."

TumblrCirclejerk,3beahl,LonelyScout,13,Sun Jun 28 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"tech companies are practically BEGGING to get women in that can actually code properly.  The fact of the matter is that not a lot of women go into the industry so hiring more of them is very challenging.  Men aren't keeping women out of tech, women are keeping themselves out of it.  We have a few female engineers (couple devs and a couple QAs) and they are all quite competent and have no problem working with the men and vice versa.  Tech is more of an accidental boys-club than a boys-club by design.  We would love to hire more women but it just isn't possible based on the replies to job openings we get.  My company even is involved in female specific coding groups in the area to try and get more women into it and to find women already in the industry that are good that might want to work for us. The irony is that with a lot of companies now, a woman could probably negotiate a higher salary than a man with the same qualifications because there are lots of men applying and the companies want to get more women in so if there is one interviewing that is qualified the company is going to jump all over that."
TumblrCirclejerk,3beahl,sleaze_bag_alert,5,Sun Jun 28 23:25:46 2015 UTC,"The irony is that with a lot of companies now, a woman could probably negotiate a higher salary than a man with the same qualifications    Probably?  Certainly.  A woman I knew casually negotiated a salary that was a good 50% higher than mine, doing the same work I was doing (that is, programming), and she was as old as I was and had more-or-less the same experience I had.  We were literally equal in every way other than the fact she was a woman and I'm not.  To be fair, she was a significantly-more-aggressive negotiator than I was, which probably had more to do with the higher wage she earned than anything else.  Oh, and that was 15 years ago, long before everyone started fretting about how few women there were doing programming work, because apparently they'd forgotten that women have been doing absolutely fine work as programmers since the very start of computer science.  Unrelated, my team at work was hiring new members a year or two ago.  After going through a bunch of candidates, I asked my manager why on earth he hadn't invited any women in for any interviews.  The explanation he offered was pretty straightforward: no women at all had even applied for the position in the first place."

That ""transracial"" lady was white, and could never be black because she was born and raised into privilege. Being a minority is appropriation   So according to the SJW Law, if you are a black woman who wishes to be a white man, the privilege rule does not apply because of your born experience into oppression.

It's a struggle. It's a everyday struggle with my family. I know they love me but they just don't understand.   lol  And here's the gem:    ermagawd, I tried being anorexic once for the whole day and it was really hard, you have to have so much willpower. It is serious mental illness and it is a disease that shouldn't be taken lightly. Do not be anorexic just because you skip a meal or two.   What the hell does she even think anorexia is?   Often the people with eating disorders are perfectionists   all my what  The whole time she's implying she has an eating disorder. From the last thing I quoted onwards I'm struggling to understand her. She's interjecting random stuff like ""Thanks for the pressure"" ""The pressure from society"". Finally after being even more incoherent she said ""but thanks for that, yeah, thanks, it's real nice of you"", which I still don't understand what she's referring to.   Her video is titled ""what not to say to someone with eating disorder"" and there's about 30 seconds that is actually about the what not to say, the rest of the video being her complaining about things that I don't understand. She's fucking repulsive, especially certain faces she makes, basically being the epitome of what everyone's imagination of a tumblr feminist looks like.

TumblrCirclejerk,37n38h,JoeBoco7,6,Fri May 29 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"The Things They Carried:       The Things They Carried is a collection of short stories by Tim O'Brien, about a platoon of American soldiers in the Vietnam War. His third book about the war, it is based upon his experiences as a soldier in the 23rd Infantry Division, 3rd Platoon. O’Brien prefers to refrain from political debate and discourse regarding the Vietnam War, but has become jaded in regards to the ignorance he perceives from the denizens of his home town towards the world. It is in part this ignorance that drove O’Brien to author The Things They Carried.  It was initially published by Houghton Mifflin in 1990.  Many of the characters are semi-autobiographical, sharing similarities with characters from his memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home. The book works heavily with metafiction, employing a writing tactic called verisimilitude. The use of real names and inclusion of himself as the protagonist within the book creates a style that meshes and blurs the fiction and non-fiction.

TumblrCirclejerk,36oy5w,blobacus,1 point,Thu May 21 20:07:01 2015 UTC,Some girl started carrying her mattress around everywhere in protest of the school after their investigation showed she wasn't raped (or something).    Evidence was released (text messages) later that the explicitly planned on having sex.  She essentially then went on a smear campaign against the guy and school with this protest.  For some reason even after it was shown she lied and has been slandering someone for months no-one really called her out or anything and she's still a feminist idol even while being a false-rape accuser.

TumblrCirclejerk,36fzu3,helensis_,6,Tue May 19 05:41:06 2015 UTC,"I think the thing about demisexuality is that it's more of a degree of sexuality, rather than an orientation.   So like, asexual -> demisexual -> hyper sexual  But within these categories, you can be attracted to different genders, which makes your orientation.  So you could be demisexual, but only attracted to people of the same gender, or attracted only to people of the opposite gender etc.  But as an actual sexual orientation? What a load of codswallop."
TumblrCirclejerk,36fzu3,uptotwentycharacters,1 point,Tue May 19 09:16:43 2015 UTC,"Demisexual isn't really about the extent of sexuality/attraction though, more the circumstances under which one experiences attraction, and I think hypersexuality is more about libido.  So I would make a line with asexuals (sexually attracted to literally nothing) at one end and omnisexuals (sexually attracted to literally everything) at the other with the average sexual person in the middle, and demisexual in its own category off to the side."

But the real things to complain about in that movie, was how far away from the comics Joss Whedon went in the story. Which is especially disappointing, considering how good his run of xmen was.   Ant Man created Ultron, not Iron Man. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are Magneto's children, and mutants, not the result of some experiment. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were originally part of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and later abandoned the mutant conflict to join The Avengers. Vision was created entirely by Ultron, in order to destroy the Avengers. A mission he later abandoned by his own will. The Visions creation had nothing to do with an Infinity Gem."

TumblrCirclejerk,34jqky,Parker_I,2,Sat May 2 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"No it's not bad. I live in a small city in germany where 60% have an islamic background. We don't get thaught to hate them, we learn to hate them by ourself. Since germany entered the EU we don't have any real country borders anymore which means that every human trash can enter the country and receive welfare. We don't hate them because they are foreigners, we also don't hate them because of their skin color or religious believes, we hate then because they don't work, insult germans whenever they can, are a general burden to the taxpayer and brag about how their country is so much better than germany because everything and everyone here sucks. There are plenty of turks that live in germany for over 10 years that don't speak a single word of german and don't bother to learn it in the slightest. When we forbid burkas in public places  we got called racists and nazis (hello? you have to adjust to our culture not we to yours) when in return I'd probably get thrown into prison in every other islamic country for doing the same thing.  All of this is just a big ""fuck you"" directed to the people who where willing to accept them when they could not go anywhere else  Don't get me wrong, coming from a city with such a huge percentage of foreigners I have plenty of islamic/turkish friends, and have met plenty of islamic/turkish people who are hardworking and in general great people, but sadly the stereotypes mentioned above just apply to too many people so you'll learn to be cautious of them sooner or later.

TumblrCirclejerk,34jqky,prtstrk,1 point,Mon May 4 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"You didn't cite any facts you just said a bunch of racist things. Like I don't like a lot of the shit on tumblr because it calls people racist when they actually aren't being racist. You are being racist. Let me run through your post:  ""they don't work"" is racist stereotype: akin to ""lazy mexicans"" here in the US, or ""I don't hate jews because of their religion, but because they control the media,"" or ""Black people aren't bad because of their skin color, it's because of their attitude"".   You are saying all of this shit not because ""it's true"" but because you are being racist. You are connecting the dots between race and another thing, therefore connecting a group of people (or a race) with a stereotype. That is racist.  ""every human trash"" -- lol really? Tip for the future: when you are trying to explain how you aren't racist, do not refer to a group of people as human trash. That is a surefire way to get called racist.  ""they won't learn our language/culture"" why should they have to? Just because they live inside certain borders and are citizens of your country? It's racist to assume that all people in one area have to speak or act the same, regardless of their cultural upbringing. At the very least its elitist and nationalist to a fault.   ""When we forbid burkas in public places we got called racists"" That's probably because you are racist. They aren't forcing you to ""adapt to their culture"" when they wear a burka. It's literally clothing. Why should we ban clothing. This is not only racism it's idiocy. They shouldn't have to adapt to your culture. You aren't being forced to adapt to theirs when they wear different clothing. This is racism. I don't know why this is so hard.  ""I'd probably get thrown into prision in every other islamic country"" first of all, not all countries where islam is practiced are the same. Secondly the vast majority of Islamic people are not islamist. There's a difference between the religion, the culture and the government system. Yes Islamism the political system is often really awful towards women and also pretty racist itself. This does not mean the Islamic people in your country want that. In reality, many of them have likely fled those Islamist countries for a reason quite similar to the corrupt governments. Finally, just because awful governments are awful does not give you the license to be awful as well.  ""don't get me wrong"" etc. is an excuse akin to ""I have a black friend"" and that's not a justification for racism. You still refer to large groups of people in a group negatively. That's racism. Even if you say ""but like here's a few that aren't bad"" does not mean you are not being racist. People shouldn't have to earn your respect more because they are a different race.  I'm not on tumblr whining about being an oppressed ""black queer trans-otherkin"" or whatever. That would be stupid. However, actual racism still exists. Your post was actually racist. I don't expect you to suddenly change or ""see the light"" or anything. I just wanted you to know why I think (and not in a tumblr over-protective way) your post was racist."
TumblrCirclejerk,34jqky,Parker_I,0,Mon May 4 22:16:49 2015 UTC,"Tip for the future: when you are trying to explain how you aren't racist, do not refer to a group of people as human trash. That is a surefire way to get called racist.  That's probably because you are racist. They aren't forcing you to ""adapt to their culture"" when they wear a burka. It's literally clothing. Why should we ban clothing.    Because in germany and most other EU countries there is a law against disguise in public places. This law exists for good reasons, and exists for everyone. If I move to any islamic country chances are that my wife has to cover herself and can't run around showing as much skin as she can here in germany. Are you calling them racist aswell? No because they are not, because if I want to live in their country I have to adapt to their rules and laws, and can't expect them to change them because of my culture or believes.    why should they have to? Just because they live inside certain borders and are citizens of your country? It's racist to assume that all people in one area have to speak or act the same, regardless of their cultural upbringing. At the very least its elitist and nationalist to a fault.   We are not talking about countries like the US where 99% of the population consists of people who originate from a lot of different languages and therefore has multiple languages spoken in different areas. Yes almost all of the US is english dominated, but you can find a job and live your everyday live without speaking a single word of english in certain areas. In germany on the other hand we only have a single language. Refusing to learn the language of the country you are living in also means refusing to integrate yourself into society, and failing to integrate yourself into society also means never beeing able to find a job here.   This is not only racism it's idiocy. They shouldn't have to adapt to your culture   Yes they should. Have you ever been to the arab emirates or any other islamic/arabic country? Well I have, and let me tell you something. If I would get caught drinking alcohol on the streets and say ""I shouldn't have to adapt to your culture"" to the police officer I would spend the next 4 months in prison. In every country in this world you are expected or forced by law to adapt to their culture, but in countries dominated or ruled by whites it's suddenly racist? Your hypocrisy is real and you can't deny that.     ""don't get me wrong"" etc. is an excuse akin to ""I have a black friend"" and that's not a justification for racism. You still refer to large groups of people in a group negatively. That's racism. Even if you say ""but like here's a few that aren't bad"" does not mean you are not being racist. People shouldn't have to earn your respect more because they are a different race.   My negative views of certain groups are based on the experience I made in my own life. Are you seriously telling me that's wrong? Following your logic every female rape victim that has become cautious or scared of men should be called out for sexism. You know where I heard this twisted insane logic before? Tumblr. Let me clear that up for you, neither I nor the female rape victim are racist/sexist, getting cautious or more suspect of groups you've had negative experiences with in the past is a human reaction and not a choice just like it's not a choice to like or dislike a certain genre of music or a specific type of food.   ""every human trash"" -- lol really? Tip for the future: when you are trying to explain how you aren't racist, do not refer to a group of people as human trash. That is a surefire way to get called racist.   I don't think I'll ever mentioned a specific group of people didn't I? I never said that every foreigner is human trash, I also never denied that germans can't be human trash. There is plenty of human trash on both sides. The point is that we let more of them in without asking twice,   Your post was actually racist. I don't expect you to suddenly change or ""see the light"" or anything. I just wanted you to know why I think (and not in a tumblr over-protective way) your post was racist.   If that's your way of defining racism, should I sue every black person for racism because they blame white poeple for it? Because they are connecting ""the dots between race and another thing"", following your logic that's racist. Stereotypes don't come from nothing, there is a little bit of truth behind every single one of them. ""Blacks are all criminals"" - because blacks make up for 50% of crimes while only beeing 10% of the total population, ""French people drink wine all day every day"" - because they drink a fuckton of wine, ""bavarians only eat bratwurst and sauerkraut"" - because we love to eat bratwurst and sauerkraut"", ""germans are all nazis"" - because we fucking were a country full of nazis not 70 years ago, ""americans are all fat"" - because they majority of americans are hams. I give every single person a chance, but it's not racist to keep those stereotypes in mind until you know someone, because as I said earlier - most of them apply to a large portion of a certain group. I think you are throwing around the word ""racist"" far to easily, because it's not racist. It's only human and the right thing to do."

As long as my personal opinions don't affect someone who is actually willing to work and integrate himself into society I don't think that's racist. It's only natural to look down on people who refuse to work and are in general just a huge burden on society, and honestly it's the right thing to do. If I go by your.or the textbook definition of racism absolutely everybody and everything on this world is racist to a certain extend"
TumblrCirclejerk,34jqky,prtstrk,1 point,Tue May 5 15:51:08 2015 UTC,soooo your definition of racism is workplace discrimination?
TumblrCirclejerk,34jqky,Parker_I,1 point,Tue May 5 21:34:02 2015 UTC,It was an example of giving someone an advantage or disadvantage based on the skin color without taking the actual qualification in mind.    As long as my personal opinions don't affect someone who is actually willing to work and integrate himself into society I don't think that's racist.

TumblrCirclejerk,34dwod,keiyakins,1 point,Sat May 2 13:28:12 2015 UTC,I think she's trying to say that it should carry as much weight as other degrees.  She probably finds that her degree doesn't get her as far with employers as another degree would.  It may be that she's looking in the wrong job market or she's finding that positions needing a gender studies degree a fewer than expected.  It could always be that she got a degree in something she's passionate in only to find it's not as useful as expected.  Or if she's talking about the social weight it carries.  As a STEM guy myself I generally don't hold them as high for two reasons;   I find that stat and philosophical classes are more enjoyable than difficult. I will always be a jealous bitch of how much of a social life they generally had in college.

Psychologist John Money oversaw the case and reported the reassignment as successful and as evidence that gender identity is primarily learned. Academic sexologist Milton Diamond later reported that Reimer failed to identify as female since the age of 9 to 11,  and transitioned to living as a male at age 15. Well-known in medical circles for years anonymously as the ""John/Joan"" case, Reimer later went public with his story to help discourage similar medical practices. He later committed suicide after suffering years of severe depression, financial instability, and a troubled marriage.      Interesting: David J.

Victim complexes left and right, absolutely zero sense of community/school spirit, the organization supporting Emma called ""No Red Tape"" projecting the words ""RAPE HAPPENS HERE"" on our flagship library while prospective students file out of it. The administration letting shit like this go on is absurd. Her little song and dance should have been stopped long ago.  Not that the administration is much better, they do a very poor job of concealing their undying contempt for the entire student body. The war on fun is very literal here, being in the city you may have heard about the debacle that was the planning of our spring concert.  The student population and administration aside - it's what you make of it. I stayed relatively uninvolved with radical activist groups and skirted the edges of the administration, so I think my experience was overall positive.

TumblrCirclejerk,33o5oe,LazyFigure,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"eh, it kinda depends. if im communicating with people ive either never interacted with before, or have, but not enough to get a feel for how they communicate, yeah, itd be an in general thing.  In the case im communicating with someone ive been interacting with for a good while, itd be a bit more than an occasional stray mayday, but when ive gotten familiar enough with someone's communication style i do tend to make less mistakes.  the issue goes both ways for me though, i have about as much trouble making heads or tails of what any given person says or does as they do with what i'm saying or doing. The only exceptions seems to be something ive discussed with a significant amount of others enough times to hammer what worked best to get said message across deep enough into my memory for it to stay there. I try and apply what I learn from those situations to others, but, thanks to my lack of inherent understanding of social constructs and how my memory is, i can just as easily screw up with it as i can improve my communicative ability."

TumblrCirclejerk,33l5tn,ImYourWenis,-13,Thu Apr 23 22:57:15 2015 UTC,"Young guys will commonly try to gas light, beg, plead, guilt trip and beg their way into your pants.  When you have been socialized from birth to be the ""nice girl"" and please everyone, saying no can get very difficult when the guy refuses to hear that no and keeps pushing.  Its not ""rape"", because the woman eventually consents.  But from the female perspective that ""consent"" feels like it was given under coercion and after the act you feel exploited/violated.  I think that's where these girls confound rape with the scenario of regret.     There's also the scenario where a guy will make all these promises and pleas of affection/intention, only to completely negate them after the deed - which is deceptive and some males would consider this ""rape"" if the shit were reversed on them in a relatable scenario because the conditions under which consent was given were completely false.    Take for example how males react to trans women who they fucked around with only to find out later that ""woman"" had a dick.  It leaves the guy most certainly feeling exploited, coerced, duped and ""raped"" of sorts because he never consented to that shit as a fully informed participant.  Men can feel SO violated by such an act they can and have killed trans people for it.  In that way, women can feel ""raped"" by some scenarios.    I think women talking about this issue should be more careful to explain so they don't look like they are equating some ""oh i fucked him good and then we broke up so NOW I regret it"" with a totally exploitative scenario."

""Blasphemy"", like ""sin"", is a relationship with a supernatural being and as none of those exist the term is invalid. ""Blasphemy"" is a term without a real referent, it is a nonce word, a pointer to things that can never exist. One can not insult a being that is not real. In truth, ""offensive"", being real, is worse than imaginary terms like ""blasphemy"". Though it is often inappropriately applied. It is also often used, as is ""blasphemy"", for political advantage by cynical sludge who feel no offence.     Now, ""offensive blasphemy"" is a strange idea ..."
