Or something more broad, along the lines of 'how do i value a company i want to buy three shares in'?  For the mechanics of modelling, something like Benninga or Rosenbaum will get you going.  Beyond that, a lot is going to depend on what you want to do and what you want to use to do it.  If you want more of a 'background', just borrow some CFA coursenotes.

finance,3e0u7x,Eddy_Duh_Brah,17,Tue Jul 21 10:18:15 2015 UTC,"Commodities are priced in US dollars. When the dollar is strengthened, the nominal value of gold goes down because the 'intrinsic' value of gold has not changed. i.e if gold was $1200 an oz. and then the dollar got stronger, gold could now be worth $1150 an oz. simply because that $1150 is ""worth more"" thanks to a stronger dollar Many people hedge against inflation and other things by buying gold. When the dollar is weak, they become scared and put their money in gold instead. A higher demand for gold leads to a higher price for gold, and this mostly happens when the dollar is weak.  The opposite is true - when the dollar is strong, some people move out of their gold investments. I should note that most smart investors (or people who know what they're doing) don't really use gold to hedge against inflation, but I could be wrong."

Using the above formula:  C= 6%  r = 6.4%  n = 20  M = $10 million  Price = $9,552,293.219  So now to calculate Theoretical forward clean price:  FP = ?  SP = $9,552,293.219  RP = 5%  N = 5*365  C = 6%  FP  =  SP  +  ( RP%  -  C / SP x 100 ) x N / 365  FP  =  $9,552,293.219  +  ( 5%  -  6 /$9,552,293.219 x 100 ) x 1825 / 365  FP = $9,552,318.219"

And, SPX options close at 3:15 PM, when the cash index is no longer being updated; futures trade until 3:15 too.   The futures pricing data should be easier to find.

Isn't one of the basic ""rules"" of corp finance that if  companies are unable to find projects that return the required rate of return they should start returning cash back to investors (through dividends and repurchases) so that the investors themselves can decide where to invest their money."

finance,3dltyy,WizardOfNomaha,12,Fri Jul 17 18:52:46 2015 UTC,"My point was that you could live a very comfortable lifestyle without working at all once you have $2.5 mil.   Your definition of ""very comfortable"" is not objective.  You have an opinion what it is... Other people have theirs.   is probably just a trapping that you really don't need.   You're trying to argue a subjective and opinionated point.  You define needs as something different than others.  Go jump in /r/economics or /r/worldnews if you want to play the bleeding ""rich are too rich"" heart.   Don't see the point.   Because you're small minded.  Not meant as an insult either but that statement just makes it clear what your thought process is.  If you're ambition is to leave a non-trivial impact on the world, money is just a tool to accomplish those goals.  $2.5mm is a very small tool.  Money has different meaning between people with ambition who use it to accomplish their goals and those who just want to retire/sit around/have it so you can consume your goods and services.

And to scale your impact to a truly global and generationally defining level you're going to need some form of capital to sustain it.   If you're using wealth as a proxy for ""accomplishment"" you're missing the mark IMO.   If you think anything I said was saying ""wealth = accomplishment"" you clearly can't wrap your head around the concepts we're discussing.  Wealth is a tool.  Bill Gates is a very public example.  He didn't start and develop Microsoft because he had the goal of being worth $70 billion one day.  Money was a byproduct.  Likewise, he would have never been able to commit to the projects of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (making unbelievable progress in combatting malaria in 3rd world countries) or have anywhere near the impact the foundation has had without the wealth he amassed at Microsoft."

You were presenting two opposing options for how a person can view/use money, and implying that those were really the only options and that those who do not seek mass amounts of wealth lead a ""very sad existence"". So many forms of accomplishment and ambition, in fact I'd argue most meaningful forms of accomplishment, don't require massive amounts of capital, at least not personal capital.   Right. And to scale your impact to a truly global and generationally defining level you're going to need some form of capital to sustain it.   Yes, that's why we have capital markets, fundraising, etc, etc. Claiming that any single person needs a mass personal fortune to affect change is stupid. It does make it easier, sure. But there are probably more direct ways to affect such change than pouring your life's work into building a personal fortune.   Wealth is a tool.   I'm not denying that. You're arguing against a point I was never making in the first place. If this was an article about something Blankfein was doing with his money, then fine. It's not. It's just about how much wealth he has. Who gives a shit? A billion dollars is a meaningless sum until you actually do something with it. Bill Gates is a good example.

Amazon's is really just a freebie add on to Prime so it doesn't really count and people will use it along with another service if they have prime anyway.  Apple/Google are realistically the only ones with a shot but Netflix already has a huge lead on the field. If NFLX would have grabbed Seinfeld/The Simpsons it probably would be over. Apple will get the fanboys to convert, but why would normal people who are content with Netflix leave, its not like they have their own original content or anything of value exclusive.  The only real difficult hurdle NFLX has is to become even bigger in content creation. Those programs are way higher margin for them, and they are not at the whims of the content providers. If the content providers leave Netflix, it is toast.  I would also argue that I think Netflix has some solid pricing power, they could raise prices a bit and I think it would still be a much better value than cable and the competition.

If you are clearing on behalf of a client, you may offer an incentive to clear at a given clearing house, or always charge stand-alone initial margin which introduces an element of risk which you need to manage yourself."
finance,3dei69,sionnach,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:55:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply.  If I understand that the difference in the way the margins will be calculated needs to be taken into account in the way the instrument is priced, the article states that this difference in calculation methodology does not explain the completely the observed difference in prices.  Do you think that the standard practice is to have a discount curve per counterparty/clearing house? Or that people will tend to calculate a subsequent adjustment such as xVA (CVA, FVA, etc)?"

Your feelings do not factor into their applications process. You were not accepted because you do not have the required mathematical background. Graduate level mathematics is no joke and a bachelor of business studies wont cut it. You will fail out by the midterms of first semester.  If you are truly dedicated to getting this degree, your only option is to take all the prerequisite undergraduate math courses as an undeclared student, there might be a list of recommended courses for applicants. It should take you 3 years to get through all the courses. Perhaps shorter if you get good grades and can sneak your way into courses without the relevant prereqs.   Reapply after you have completed the courses. Who knows, they might accept you with partial completion of the courses if you get straight A's in all of them.  TLDR: Get an undergraduate degree in math."

finance,3de0zz,dupeofadupe,2,Thu Jul 16 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"i just remembered this.. once i get some free time id love to take a look  What im thinking is to just set up a loop and have it calculate all of the outputs and spit out the top 20 portfolios based on certain criteria. The problem as i mentioned in my previous post is that there would be so many loops required since you have so many to choose from (and you dont necessarily have to use the same weights for all making this crazy). A way to cut down on the first issue of too many possibilities is to tell the macro how to pick stocks. For example ignore stocks with certain returns/vol ratios or to diversify industries somehow. To get around the second issue of there being too many possible weights (infinite really), you can run a regression on every possible portfolio to get the portfolio of the best weights by stock and then test the portfolios against each other. This may however require more than excel (SAS, SPSS, etc) but its a super fun project for those with the time/resources.  Sorry if what i said doesnt make sense. Also im simplifying things a bit, im sure theres better methods and id love to hear them."

I imagine Texas wants a gold reserve in case the USD hits hyperinflation, for which Texas does not control. Then Texas would issue it's own currency backed by gold assets. I would imagine people would be allowed to withdraw gold by exchanging the new currency if they chose to do so.   In one case the banks ran out of assets.

finance,3db9ie,vmsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, voting is important. What a lot of people don't understand is that voting at every level is important, right down to City Council and Sheriff.   Governors and Presidents rarely pop into the political sphere fully-formed and ready for office. They rise from somewhere. That somewhere is ""the bench.""  The bench begins with the lower offices. Those who make good at their entry level jobs often shoot for the next level up. And if they do well there, they go up again. At each point the real losers tend to get weeded out, and the better ones tend to advance. The operative phrase here is ""tend to,"" because God knows that some losers make it to the big leagues from time to time. But in general if we fill the lowest levels of the bench with good people, then good people will rise to the higher levels.  Also, it is often the elected officials at the lower levels who make the rules or appointments that affect higher-level outcomes. Look how state legislatures redistrict to affect Congressional outcomes.  Voting at ever opportunity, and at every level, is absolutely critical. (This is actually the topic of my Toastmaster speech later on this month.)

You can add in purchasing in small blocks every few minutes and forcing purchases to be a percentage of total volume or even artificially raising the price if you buy large blocks in your simulation.  Backtesting with full indexes, including the ones that have gone to zero, tracking the ticker changes properly...I just can't seem to find it.

finance,3d8kvz,sentdex,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:14 2015 UTC,"Which you can do on Quantopian, and we do cover how to set up in the series. You can forward test with paper trading. From here, the only downside is possibly latency, though the highest granularity with Quantopian is 1 minute trading anyway, so less likely an issue, and slippage. Quantopian incorporates slippage automatically in the testing, however."
finance,3d8kvz,Dumb_Nuts,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:34 2015 UTC,"It depends on how realistic you build your strategy. The main determinant there is actually YOU, the programmer. Too many people fall prey to overfitting, and that is the downfall.   If you actually try to sign up to the quantopian fund, part of what they grade you on is how similar your strategy performs forward, in a paper trading setting vs your back test.   ...which brings up the next point, you don't just have back testing with Quantopian, you can also forward paper trade.   Quantopian's back tester has things like slippage and execution time built into it, in order to make it as realistic as possible."

finance,3d8kvz,sentdex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:29:46 2015 UTC,Would a noobie in python be able to follow this series? Or should I start with some intro to python from codeacademy?
finance,3d8kvz,dimino,6,Tue Jul 14 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, but you can try. I almost never recommend people start with a basics series, but I do offer a basics series here (I am the person who made the OP series, and I made the series on this website): http://pythonprogramming.net/dashboard/  I find people have far better success by diving into topics that interest them specifically, rather than trying to learn the mundane basics.   My ""intro to python"" was the NLTK module book for natural language processing in Python. A horrible topic for most to start with, and a topic most would probably have told me to stay away from... but it was perfect for me because I was very interested and passionate about the subject."
finance,3d8kvz,sentdex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in learning Python for Finance, how do you recommend I learn more?  I know syntax and defining functions, so the complete basics. Where should I go from here, would you say following along your series OP posted? Also python 2.7 or 3+?"
finance,3d8kvz,IAmBroom,2,Tue Jul 14 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Quantopian uses Python 2.7... so you have no choice if you go with them. Otherwise, I would say Python 3+.   That said, I use Python 3 syntax when working with 2.7 anyways. The only major differences are with various modules (urllib for example), and handling bytes vs strings.  Another example is range vs xrange. In python 3 range is a generator, in py 2 it's not, but xrange is... and so on. It's good to know both versions, but ideally just go with 3 as much as possible, and 3 syntax is fine with py 2.   If you know syntax and the basics, try the series that is posted. You also will have to consume Pandas, and OOP without seeing it explicitly. I try to be explicit about Quantopian's slightly...implicit / hidden use of both OOP and the Pandas module... but I think this is really detrimental to many users. Some of what Quantopian does appears to be magical or something... because they create and modify dataframes without mention of the word pandas, and also utilize OOP without even naming a class. They also do some SQL alchemy... without calling it.   I love the service, and think it's awesome, but I can only imagine what it must be like for someone who doesn't recognize Pandas code by syntax alone, or SQL Alchemy.... and they think it's some sort of Quantopian only code... yet it has absolutely zero documentation on their site regarding how to use it to manipulate data. I've seen a lot of people totally lost when it comes to how to use the Pandas aspect of the data, I don't think many people even realize it is Pandas.  Regardless, I say try the series. Ask any and all questions on the associated video and I will do my best to help. If for whatever reason I am not replying, shoot me an email.

If you're a hundred times that size, you don't care about the integer problems and you probably don't care that much about the smallish liquidity difference either  If you're a hundred times that size (now we're at $10B), you care a lot about it being a little bit more liquid as a result of the first group being willing to include it in their universe, so you're willing to hold and trade it more, which more liquidity still."

This guy became famous for his ""GS Elevator"" account which supposedly relayed what was being said in Goldman's NY offices.  He never worked at GS and was actually living in Hong Kong.  So I think it's pretty safe to say his stories are about as accurate as ""Wolf of Wall Street""  Bankers are much more buttoned down than traders, btw."
finance,3d9jw3,roboboom,2,Tue Jul 14 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"He seems to be exaggerating for the sake of drama, similar to how he felt the need to name his twitter feed GS elevator despite never being employed at GS. I was not in finance at the time so I can't give my personal experience but from what I hear it generally wasn't that bad. However it was a little worse around that time than now and Asia was 'crazier' than US/EU.  For a more sobering view take a look at the small article by Matt Levine (who actually worked at GS) on the book: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-07/john-lefevre-s-wall-street-memoir-full-of-hookers-cocaine-and-other-cliches   ...  In his book and on Twitter, LeFevre paints this experience as representative of a broader culture. He’s not the racist misogynist; he’s just writing down what he heard. “These are a few of my stories,” he says at the end of his book. “All bankers have stories just like them.” I don’t! Good Lord.  But the ones who do are the loudest, and they replicate themselves. LeFevre feeds the public’s hunger for proof that Wall Street is full of degenerate sociopaths, while also glamorizing that degeneracy. Those inclined to hate bankers will have their suspicions confirmed. Those inclined to whoring and cocaine will see a career opportunity. The rest of us—including many bankers—might worry that the worst bits of Wall Street’s culture are being passed down to the next generation. Teenage boys at Choate will want to be investment bankers after reading Straight to Hell. Which is probably the point."

There certainly is a lot of socializing, lots of escort fucking and lots of parties, but these are for the new/younger traders. For the most part, things become much calmer as time passes. Most traders/bankers get together after work, have drinks, eat dinner and just chat about shit, get to know your colleagues and what not. Other's are much more reserved and have their own social groups or separate life.   So, there are most certainly the coked up types that get huge rushes and rent Lamborghini's for a night, but they are not the majority in any sense of the word.

Duration is the blue straight line, which approximates the change in price given a change in yield. Now start at the point where the curved line (the bonds price) and the blue line (the duration) meet. Follow that straight line to the left and right, simulating large changes in yield. Notice how the curved line diverges from the straight line? That's due to the bonds convexity. The price-yield relationship is not linear, it's convex. So a bonds convexity reflects just how 'flexed' or curved the price-yield curve is."

However, in most cases, companies will choose to raise money to fund an acquisition or a merger, whether it's through an issue of new shares or debt.  Even if there is no financing, the bank's advice can be quite valuable.  A company who is looking for an acquisition target or a merger can usually widen their search through the bank's network.  The bank's M&A team will propose to the company potential targets that are in line with the company's long-term corporate strategies.  Essentially, instead of having to do the work in-house, the task of finding a target and executing on the deal is left to the investment bank.

It seems that doubling market size in that short of a period would be pretty unsustainable and that this is a correction for overly optimistic valuation  Because the ""burst"" value didn't exist 6 months ago, I'm having a hard time figuring out what the really significant part of this story is supposed to be? is it the concern that it continues to fall out or are business investment decisions made on that short of a cycle that having electronic value for that short a period would augment investment patterns?"

Often dividend funds are touted as being better protected against market downturns and it is claimed that they can be used to replace bonds in a portfolio.   Of course, also consider your tax situation. If this is for a non taxable or tax deferred account this doesn't matter, but in a taxable brokerage account you will pay capital gains taxes on distributions which hurts total returns for the dividend heavy fund more than the broad market fund."

When working in a tax privileged account like an IRA why can't a high dividend yield ETF be viewed as a sort of ""high risk bond"" for a young investor, particularly in today's market where bonds are just so unappealing. VYM yields >3% and presents some capital gains upside. Vanguard bond funds often yield less and won't necessarily appreciate like VYM would if this bull market continues. I recognize the greater downside risk for VYM but why is this a bad idea for a portfolio with high risk tolerance?"
finance,3d0mkw,JFlaviusT,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:56:18 2015 UTC,Because one doesn't hold bonds for any of the reasons you just cited.  Bonds are held because they both net a positive long term expected return and they are generally not positively correlated with equities.  This lowers total risk and creates a more efficient portfolio.  A high dividend index is still equity exposure and doesn't lower risk much at all.   A fine example being 2008 where all equities lost between 30-45%(depending on market sector/style) but the Barclay aggregate was up around 5.5%.  Treasuries behaved even better.

Gold is pretty much gold - it doesn't matter where it is mined. But diamonds from different parts of the world,  different mines within the same region,  and even different pipes or levels of a pipe can be very different depending on the idiosyncrasies of their formation (ie other minerals in the diamonds, cooling speed,  pressure,  etc. ).  Combine that with the fact that diamonds are in some respect difficult to mine due to their formation in generally vertical narrow volcanic pipes (meaning that mining quickly becomes quite deep).

Also remember that without the existence of goods and services that could be exchanged for money, money would have no value. Money is a way to store value. But there's a catch - the money supply can be increased. If it increases faster than the supply of goods, you get inflation.  Think about it another way. What if the money supply was fixed? What happens when new goods are created? If you can buy a can of soda for $1, what should the price be when the supply of soda doubles, but the amount of money in circulation hasn't changed? You might be able to get soda for 50 cents. The value of your money just increased! That is how money is really created - by the creation of valuable goods."

Commercial bank lending also creates money under the form of demand deposits. When banks had sizable reserve requirements (freezing an important percentage of their deposits in mandatory reserves at the central bank) it was said that the process multiplied this base money through fractional reserve banking.

finance,3cv3aw,friend1949,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:19:22 2015 UTC,"The stock price is related to both the present value and potential future value of the company. For simplicity, lets say that the company would never cut another tree, so the company's value is derived completely from their assets after selling the tree ($20). Say you owned 50% of the stock. The company was initially worth $10. You would likely be able to sell your 50% for around $5 if you wanted to. Now the company buys a tree with their $10 and sells it for $20. They now have $20, but you still own a 50% share, which is now worth $10! Stock is basically a form of claim to the company's assets, so in this very simplified example, they now owe you $10. You could now sell the company's obligation to you for around $10 instead of claiming it, if you so wished."
finance,3cv3aw,friend1949,5,Sat Jul 11 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"Ok I get it now. You give the company money in exchange for a part of the company. If that company makes more money, the theoretical value of your share increases. The actual value doesn't increase until someone buys the share from you.  The part that had me confused is that you don't actually make any money until someone else pays for it. The extra money is being added by the person paying for the share. I also thought that cash flowed between the company and the shareholders but they are actually separate (ignoring dividends).  Thanks for the help!"
finance,3cv3aw,armybender,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:20:17 2015 UTC,"Keep it simple. Establish a brokerage account. There are a number of stock brokers. Put money into the account. Instruct your broker to by a number of shares of a company. As long as your account is large enough to pay for the shares at the market price this will happen. A trade will execute. They will use the cash in your account to pay someone else fore the shares. Now you own the shares. You no longer own your money.  I just bought shares in HSY. That is Hershey. Now that I own shares in Hershey I will be paid dividends. That will be credited to my account. If Hershey keeps selling sweet chocolate to the world they will continue to make money, pay me dividends and keep the chocolate factory running. More people means more chocolate buyers means more sales. As sales increase earnings increase. Increased sales means the board will increase my dividends and my stock will be worth more money to others. The stock price will increase."

So sometimes companies disappear. There is a list somewhere of companies which have paid dividends for over a hundred years, always.   I bought stock once during a market downturn. I read a column about companies which had more cash in the bank than the stock was worth. How could I lose buying stock in a company with more cash than the value of the stock?  Well really you can. But I do not think I did.  Ford once had a return on investment equal to the price of the stock if you counted a few years. They had bet everything on making good Fords and did not take a government bailout. It paid off but it was a risk. I did not buy Ford stock.  If the company is increasing sales year over year then earnings will increase year over year. Therefore the stock price will increase except for the vagaries of the market price."

That's why we measure things in terms of P/E multiples... P/E multiples move up / down, so ""value"" is created by perception and is manifested as a result of rising prices.     Example... I buy some stock at $10 - it goes up to $15 so I sell.  I have made money, but you bought it from me at $15... now it goes up to $20, so you sell - you made money.  If the company is earning $1 per share and the price goes from $10 to $20, it's P/E multiple doubles... we all make money... that is until we don't and prices fall, but then there is the case for making money shorting too.     Again, don't confuse ""MONEY"" with ""PRICE"" - they are NOT the same.

The reason markets go up is because money supply expands over time (inflation, etc.) and so do expectations (P/E multiples).  Every now and then people decide to re-price risk and multiples shrink and you end up back at the nominal rate of money growth.  This is the reason prices can't go up faster than the long-term earnings growth rate over very long time-frames."

I suppose I'd fill that with a few Stats/Probability, a few Financial Maths, a few Stochastic and maybe an Actuarial stats class or something...does that sound normal?

James Simons is a pure mathematician, and by way of interview gives the insight that most of what rentech does is statistics and applied math.  Take from that what you want."
finance,3cq30f,Pseudo_Prodigal_Son,3,Sat Jul 11 18:30:20 2015 UTC,Everything in the industry is applied.  That's the nature of it.  However the distinction between pure and applied at the undergrad level is negligible.  This isn't like choosing a PhD.  Your role as an analyst won't be coming in and redeveloping the DMA desk's code.  It will be coming in and working under other STEM phd's who are running the desk and are seeking someone who has the core capacity to learn.  Pure math at the undergrad gives you a stronger foundation if you do decide to go back and pursue a doctorate (even if the doctorate is in applied).  Pure is the basis for which applied is built off of.  A class like analysis is crucial underlying knowledge for truly understanding say... stochastic processes.  It's very easy to pick up an applied topic when you already understand the pure logic it's built off of.

And I'd suggest finding a professor who you like and doing some undergrad research in math or some sort of data intensive field if you can...it will show you can examine a problem rigorously and follow through on a project.  I've met some of the Applied Math profs at UC Merced...it is a brand new school and a new department but some really talented people and i'd consider it as a backup.  Honestelly I don't think learning excel beyond a very basic level is needed and mac vs windows isn't a big deal...I haven't had a windows computer in years.

Focus on understanding the ideas (math is great for this) and you'll be able to implement analysis in different environments.  FWIW I have a math degree and got recruited by a bay area fund after doing work in machine learning and biology, we pretty much only hire people with math, statistics or ml background and rarely use excel and all have macs.

You need 3 skills: a strong background in statistics, computer science and finance/risk to be good at this role.

Read a book or two on Excel based financial modeling and do the practical exercises.  Most of my work deals with oil and gas investment, which involves a lot of reservoir analysis, regulatory risk, and background environment risk.  Where I find most young candidates lacking is their lack of understanding of business process, petroleum geology (you'll need this to understand any sort of petroleum field analysis), and regulations.  If you're a private equity firm, you want to know how to maximize your return whether oil is $140 a barrel and the company is swimming in cash, or $40 a barrel when bankruptcy is imminent without continued borrowing lifelines.  Structure a bond to equity conversion number so you can profit handsomely if things go gangbusters, with some extremely favorable exit triggers should things go south.  How do you structure bond to equity dilution?  How do you protect your own interests from dilution and other investors?  What kind of restrictive covenants do you enforce on borrowers?  What kind of EBITDA to interest coverage ratios do you want to enforce?  Looking through SEC filings and things like 8-Ks, and understanding the deeper meaning behind each and every line of them is a must.  Most private equity risk mitigation involves soaking retail shareholders for everything they're worth in a slow lobster boil while giving management enough financial flexibility to do great things.  One must understand that large writedowns make future quarterly earnings statements suspect.  Don't treat capital investment as completely separate from expenses just because the IRS classifies it as such.  Depletion, Depreciation, and Amortization also have very real consequences to return on investment, as do taxes and a hostile regulatory environment.  If you're dealing with say, the Nigerian government, you need to include some sort of ""corruption overhead"" into your models.  My young guys develop a skillset with differential equations, linear algebra, and Monte Carlo simulations as well, but it's probably not all that widely applicable.  Ben Graham is a good start, but is completely ignorant of the realities of how modern entities value investment and mitigate risk.  In any given industry, there are probably a dozen different models of fair sophistication commonly used for valuation, which will frequently arrive at very different numbers.  Know what these are (Google scholar is a help here, because you can see the number of citations).   If you have the time, read the papers from whence these originated, so you can trace the history of valuation methods, and why people found them effective.  What sort of regression analysis was used to determine its efficacy, and are these really applicable to your own real world models?

Thank you for all the recommendations, I take from this that the more technical knowledge I can gain, the better. Excel being basically expected and everything else a plus?"
finance,3cq30f,jpastore,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"Good on you for having an IRA/brokerage account. Start tracking your returns, if you don't already. The joy of a mock is that you can usually be more nimble, not worrying about brokers fees, and of course have a much higher beta with fewer consequences.   As to location, no idea. In cities large enough there's always something. But I would encourage you to be flexible with regards to location; it gives you more options. I'm probably a bit extreme in regard to relocating: I had internships in Houston, Sun Valley Idaho, and Memphis, and jobs in Phoenix, Charlotte, and in a week NYC. But staying in one place is boring anyway.   And something like that. I'd say the adage you posted about it being easier to teach finance to a math major is very true. No matter what you end up doing, it's likely that your classes won't directly apply to it. Which is OK. But yeah if I had enjoyed it at all and thought I could do it a math major with say a comp sci minor is pretty damn hard to beat."
finance,3cq30f,yeezymyweezy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:11:44 2015 UTC,"Quantitative risk positions love math majors. Also you may want to consider looking into the actuary track, especially since you're doing applied math. Actuaries make really good money provided you can stand taking and passing the various exams and extra projects and assignments required to make the big bucks. But you only need to pass 2-3 exams before someone will hire you as an actuary."

I have a friend who was on the actuary track and ended up with a quant risk job, so he ditched the actuary route. I don't know much more than that. Your school's career center is the best place to ask. Career fairs are a great place to go talk to people, even if they aren't hiring your class or age or whatever, talk to people. Get info. Follow up with an email. Most people I know in the industry love helping out college students, especially alumni of your school."

finance,3cnb5u,xsvfan,2,Thu Jul 9 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"I assume that students know nothing about VBA or programming in general at the start of the course, and each topic is designed to focus on a core programming topic that you would find in any language (e.g., variables, sub procedures, function procedures, decision structures, loops, arrays). We also get into VBA specific topics like UserForms -- although concepts from the UserForm module are useful in other languages as well."

The videos were well paced, and doing the bare minimum for the class (homework was optional) was only about 2 hours of work. You get what you put in, obviously, but for previously VBA-illiterate user, it was very easy to follow and build upon the steps without being overwhelmed! FWIW, I took it concurrently with 2 MBA courses and planning a wedding, so it's easy enough to jump into with a busy schedule!"

Many Dark Pools (and other ATSs) have fewer regulations to abide by and so some of the less complex only have to worry about saying, effectively, ""This guy wants to sell, and this guy wants to buy...boom! Trade!""  That said, the US Equity Exchanges are vastly more complex. There is a tremendous amount of regulation that needs to be enforced. Things like RegSHO, Limit Up/Limit Down, and RegNMS (603 is a fun one), just to name a few. Clients' orders have to be treated equally (fair and equal access), meaning there is a lot of technical overhead to guarantee in the event of a failure you aren't unnecessarily disadvantaging a subset of your user base.   Then, on top of this, you throw in all of the business logic (""This order type can trade, but only when the moon is at its Zenith and two goats have been sacrificed""), and the fact that none of these policies or business idea were planned at system design (for most of the markets; I suppose this doesn't count for anyone who had the chance to build a brand new system, though I can't think of anyone who has)  and you have yourself a nice steaming pile of process interdependencies, weird race conditions, and the potential for chaos and confusion when shit hits the fan."

I'm not 100% familiar with NYSE's internals, so I can't speak to what would be the most effective and safe release schedule.  I mean, even assuming it was a software failure, this could have been a minor upgrade to a subcomponent in preparation for a larger change coming in the next few months, or that the software for larger components was set to happen Friday for trading on Monday.   Without NYSE being more transparent it's really impossible to say. Hell, this could easy be the result of a hardware failure too depending on what the system design is."
finance,3ck8ud,TheHolyLampshade,3,Wed Jul 8 17:14:58 2015 UTC,"The problem with patching after close is you then don't know of any problems until the start of trading again.  Patching midweek means the problems, if any, arise quickly, and you can roll back or repatch quickly."
finance,3ck8ud,FG_SF,3,Wed Jul 8 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. It depends heavily on how the trading system is designed, but generally you can either patch portions of the system to determine the impact or do a sweeping waterfall style update and test on the weekend.  In either event, any patching happens after the close and issues would present in the next day's trading session (this is specific to US Equities which doesn't trade overnight)."
finance,3ck8ud,TheHolyLampshade,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:00:06 2015 UTC,Patching mid-week can make more sense. You see the issue immediately vs sunday night startup with low volume and running with it for a couple of hours before someone realises (assuming it's a subtle issue and/or load related).

finance,3ck8ud,BiasedGenesis,2,Wed Jul 8 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"[Rant]  Alright, time for some education:  You just typed your message using a computer, built with various parts all around the world, connected through copper wires, to other computers, through an ISP. Literally every single FRACTION of a keystroke of yours was brought to you by someone else.  The clothes you wear, the car you drive, the coffee you drink, ALL of it was brought to you by a myriad of other people.  But none of it would have happened unless there was a reason for them to do it. This reason is profit. Profit is not a bad thing. It incentivizes people to do things that benefit other people. Everything you own was for profit. Even public things, like roads, were built with profit and benefit in mind.  But how did they get their start? From use of financial markets. Whether it was a friend giving a loan, or an investment bank underwriting a state's bonds. Without financial markets, we'd literally still be in the stone age. Technology would move at a snail's pace, as brilliant people would need to raise their own money before being able to launch a product, service, or idea.  Can you imagine Steve Jobs needing to work for 20+ years before being able to offer us the first Macintosh? Can you picture a world where governments need to wait for taxes to come in (or raise taxes, which I'm sure you have no problem doing, because surely GOVERNMENTS cannot be corrupted or greedy...) to build bridges or roads or parks? We'd still be throwing our sewage out the window for fuck's sake.  Without financial markets, no one is incentivized to save, no one can enable breakthroughs in technology or thinking, and we all just sit around, farming all day, and being generally worse off for it.  You look at banks and finance as a small child looks at an oven. You are petrified of the very thing that gives you food, merely because it's big, it's powerful, and you don't know how it works. And after a tiny amount of study, all of which filled with hyperbole, and focusing on the defects of that oven, you determine the whole thing to be ""evil,"" that anyone that uses ovens is ""corrupt and greedy."" When you see news articles showing moments when the oven is broken, you blame everything except the person who put the settings on too high, or left the door ajar, or put the wrong food in. No, that person, your Mother.gov, surely does no wrong! She knows best!  No human institution is perfect, not finance, not government, not schooling, not business, nothing. But to pick out a sub-set of a sub-set of the population, call ALL of them greedy and corrupt, call for them to be legislated to oblivion... who does that benefit? Who does that help?   More often than not, an open hand will effect more change than a closed fist.  [/Rant]"
finance,3ck8ud,LupusSuperius,0,Wed Jul 8 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"TIL: Markets enable people to buy shit.  You just made a whole lot of assumptions. I never said that we need to legislate them. Actually the less legislation the better. Right now with the assistance of BigMother.gov We, as a people across the world not just the U.S., are being systematically pushed into financial servitude. And to call anything above traditional goods and services (I.E. stocks, derivatives, bonds, ect.)  a market is a joke. The ""market"" is being manipulated heavily and we are the perfect people for it because we are filled with apathy. Everything is driven by profit like you suggested. A fact not lost on the banks. Since everything is built with profit in mind, it stands to reason that the people with the most money have the most buying power.  Institutions, laws, and just about everything are built to grasp the biggest chunk they can, which is perfectly logical. That big chunk belongs to that ""sub-set of a sub-set"" that you talked about; meaning that the banks carry the majority of the ""incentive"" giving them the means to shape supply and demand. And the stone age had a market too, unless you don't count markets that are pinned to real values instead of the un-backed floating currency dream that only works because everyone still buys into it. Unicorn farts could replace the dollar if everyone agrees on it. And sadly that would be a more stable economy than the dollar, because you can't mass print unicorn farts. Look at the interest rate over our economic history vs now. Ask yourself, why did Obama ""freeze the debt clock?"" (Which is a lot like saying you have money, but you can't pay your bills and so you decide to burn all the credit card statements that you get and never look at them.) In the version of ""market"" that your talking about, value is neither created nor destroyed. The hours work to make a basket has value, the wood to make that basket has a value, and the transportation to get it to it's selling point has value. In our ""market"" value is created from nothing all of the time via quantitative easing. What does this influx of untethered value do to the value of the components brought to market ex: an hours work?  Edited: Clarity"

With the glut of rigs, it makes no sense to continue building them and add to the oversupply but simply purchase other companies with a modern fleet and contracts and assume their work.  Personally, I see Transocean ""RIG"" making the first buy during this downturn.   They have a large line of untapped credit. The Macondo Settlement is closed and they were fined no where near what they expected.  Due to Macondo they didn't build rigs without contracts so their glut is with their existing fleet. They've retired half of their fleet, from 120 rigs down to 65 in the fleet at the moment, and still not finished. This has brought their average age up to 10-15 yrs of rig age.   Now here's where the big points come into play. 5. Transocean has been built on Mergers and buyouts. Ex: Aker, Global Santa Fe, R&B Falcon, Sedco, Forex.....   The new CEO is from NOV ""NOV $44.16"" which is a company built on aggressive takeovers and mergers of other companies.   Right now, I don't see any big mergers between the giants, but more so a slaughterhouse amongst all the smaller players who own 3-5 newer rigs and don't have the capitol to maintain them.  Maersk ""MAERSKB"" is another rumored favorite for doing takeovers. Ocean Rig ""ORIG $4.71"" on the other hand seems prime to be bought out.  Only time will tell."

It can be an all cash offer in which case shareholders of the existing company just get cash usually at some premium to share price.  Or the acquiring company can just give the shareholders of the company being bought out shares in the acquiring company at some set conversion rate and cash for any fractional shares.  In general it's probably better to own the company getting bought if they're solid and the expectation of a merger isn't already baked into the price.  Generally the company being acquired will see it's share price shoot up to whatever the offer rate is and the company acquiring might take a small hit in share price when the news is announced.  Longer term it really depends on your risk tolerance and your outlook on the acquiring company.  Ideally you'll want to invest in whichever company has better fundamentals though.  Regarding PACD being acquired.  It's been speculated about for a while given the relatively good age of their fleet, amount of backlog and relatively low market cap.  There's a good number of potential buyers out there, but generally the larger established drillers come to mind.  Companies like RIG and DO are likely going to be retiring and writing down a lot of rigs over the next year.  As such an acquisition makes sense simply to preserve market share.  Companies like NE and ESV might be interested simply to expand their market share.  RIG and ESV have the cash on their balance sheets to execute the transaction pretty easily, but DO and NE would likely have to do some debt issuance or draw down revolvers if they have any.  NE also has a credit rating below investment grade which would make things challenging, but it's important to note that they're also the only company currently paying large dividends still.  Cutting that could probably boost them back up.  I think the biggest risk for PACD itself might actually be not getting acquired.  They're strong through 2015 and into some of 2016 but have a pretty steep roll off after that and it's all specifically in drillships which have taken substantial day rate hits compared to shallower water rigs like jackups.  They also have a new rig coming online in Q1 2016 (might be able to delay delivery).  Consensus is for the offshore drilling market to turn around sometime in H2 2016 at this point and PACD is going to lose a lot of it's revenue.  They aren't alone in this fact but the bigger players have generally been a bit more successful about renegotiating at least some of their contracts so far.  Overall though the company seems to be well capitalized until that point and it might be worth holding it given the number of potential buyers."

The whole reason Glass-Steagall was put in place was because people believed that commercial banks with investment banking operations were more likely to sell shitty investments to unsuspecting investors because they had a retail platform through their commercial banks. This was of course right after the great crash of 1929.  Then, in the '90s, a few studies came out showing that in fact, the failure rate of securities underwritten by institutions that had commercial and investment banking businesses was actually lower than securities underwritten by pure investment banks. Lawmakers realized that Glass-Steagall was created for the wrong reasons and promptly got rid of it.  Glass-Steagall was never about separating risky banking from 'non-risky' banking (no such thing, really) and it makes me boil with rage when some ignorant cook from Massachusetts represents it as such."

Mortgages! Mooooooooooooooooortgages! The boring, take-deposits-and-make-real-estate-loans banks in Spain and Ireland and Cyprus and Bedford Falls and 1989 managed to blow themselves up just fine without any help from investment banking.  But you knew all that, gah. This bill is not really about depositor safety in any sort of empirical way. It’s a more ancient and anthropological theory of the dangers posed by banking: there are pure activities and impure activities, and the danger comes from mingling the pure and the impure. You build two buckets and you keep them apart, not because one bucket is riskier than the other but because things just belong in their own buckets"

Greece is about the size of Louisiana for context, and does not have an enormous impact on the Eurozone. There are three concerns that the European nations are looking at here:  1) Greece as a member of the Euro helps to pull DOWN the value of the Euro. This is good for industrial/exporting countries like Germany, because their goods are cheaper for other countries to buy than they would be without Greece in the Euro (long term).  2) Domestic firms with large Greek debt holdings. For example, Allianz (a German company) is the largest single holder of Greek debt (I think a little over a billion Euros).  3) Euro countries are concerned that if Greece exits and is able to turn things around and even thrive in a relatively short space of time, it might lead to other countries following suit the next time they get into financial trouble.  The biggest consequences though are without question for Greece. One of the biggest advantages to a devalued currency is making your goods cheap for other countries to import, but Greece is not an export-based economy, so the benefit is limited for them."

In a contango market, commodity futures prices increase with longer maturities, usually due to the cost of insuring/storing stuff.  So if the price of the commodity stays the same, the futures should stay the same too, its just that the longer dated futures trade for higher prices. Any term structure can be referred to as contango/backwardated, not just commodities.   Backwardation usually occurs under two scenarios:    A sudden supply shock A large producer is worried that prices will drop so they sell longer dated futures below the current commodity price just to reduce their risk"

finance,3cgu77,throw-it-out,2,Tue Jul 7 21:57:55 2015 UTC,I believe the generally accepted usage in finance is trading on information before it released to clients and/or made public. It's kind of a stretch to use the term here.

finance,3cgu77,throw-it-out,5,Tue Jul 7 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"No, I see why you're saying it. It's not clear to me why the author feels the need to relate this to something that is materially different. It seems like fear-mongering, to me.  In the traditional example, I work at a brokerage and know we're about to release a Buy recommendation on a stock previously given a Hold rec. I go and buy a bunch of it before the report is released, and thus I have front-run retail who then piles into it and drives up the price.  So, the trading aspect in the article is the same, which is what the author means when she says ""resembles"" but that is rather meaningless.  The part that makes front-running a bad thingtm, and gives it such a bad name, is that it is done with MNPI or similar."
finance,3cgu77,JeffKSkilling,2,Tue Jul 7 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"Not that you're wrong but I think front running is basically any time you buy stuff before a client. I believe you are supposed to give the client beneficial treatment  Like if I already wanted to buy some Apple stock, and you called me up wanting to buy it.

finance,3cgu77,throw-it-out,2,Tue Jul 7 22:35:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, yours is probably the more prototypical example. As I said to another poster, I think I was intending to say something along the lines of ""you have mnpi about orders you can safely anticipate, or have the ability to jump in front of"", as there are cases where front-running is applicable where parties are other than broker/client."
finance,3cgu77,aalabrash,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:09:31 2015 UTC,"That makes sense - you have a fiscal duty to your client.  ""Front running"", in my google searches, does seem specific to privileged client info and therefore, I'm guessing, is a form of insider trading.  This sounds more like market timing.  Although it's specifically being done when you know about a very specific big trade coming up.  Slightly off topic, but I had a similar idea when I read about hedge fund ""friends"" who told each other that they were about to make material (5%+) purchases of public companies - which allowed the ""friends"" to purchase in advance of the related disclosures and therefore profit without violating any rules - since the ""friends"" never specifically colluded to make those purchases.  In this case, it seems that these ""friends"" could make quite a profit taking turns each buying up material amounts of companies and telling their ""friends"" about it beforehand.  Since nothing is privileged info, it seems to skirt insider trading/front running rules."
finance,3cgu77,throw-it-out,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:14 2015 UTC,I think of front running as buying for your own book in front of a large client order.

finance,3cgu77,m0jj3n,2,Wed Jul 8 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"No, that's smart trading.   Front running is when a broker trades on orders he is executing on behalf of clients. It's a violation of a duty to a client.  Traders generally don't owe any duties to index funds."

A lot of firms were crazy overvalued, and every observer was expecting a 'correction'. The problem is that China has way too much margin trading so many retail investors got margin called, leading to more selloff and lower prices.  The Chinese stock market just didn't make sense fundamentally (the same stock would trade much higher in shanghai than in hongkong due to retail investors having access)  Pausing the markets is supposed to act as a circut breaker.

This crash comes right on the heel of a humongous market rally that is not supported by any change in the fundamentals of the Chinese economy. The reason the market crashed is because at market peak, the P/E ratios for many firms are in the hundreds and even thousands, which means that these firms have to grow at >100% YoY to justify these numbers. With the Chinese economic growth continue to slide (Chinese govt report 7% growth, non-govt sources reporting 4.3% - 4.7% growth), and companies continuing to report poorer and poorer financials, the valuation for many of the companies could not be justified, and still cannot be justified now.

Wouldn't you expect to see the Chinese bond yields to move up in basis points after an incident like this?

Unfortunately, China is a retail driven market (upwards of 80% of trading is retail); few know much about investment fundamentals. Stocks are treated like legalized gambling. People trade based on government press releases, tips from friends, and gut feeling, not P/Es and PtoBs.   As a result, people aren't looking to preserve capital. People are just waiting for the government to move the market higher. And they might actually be right! We'll have to see what today's price action looks like, but yesterday's was very strong."

This is the whole underlying basis of it. The reason the market rallied in the beginning was a combination of China's sliding economic growth and massive slow down of China's real estate market. Most Chinese in the past used to make money off real estate and property: the act of basically trading real estate even got coined ""炒樓"" (cao lou, directly translated into ""cooking property""). My parents had friends in China who were buying up property by the handful and selling them off and buying others for profit.  As soon as the housing market began slowing, in combination with the opening of the HK-Shanghai exchange link that also freed up more foreign money, people began looking to the stock market for money instead (there was something else the central government also did to encourage the buying of stocks before the rally started because it knew its economy was slowing, but I can't seem to find exactly what they did  anymore). However, most of the people who began investing money did so based on speculation, who lacked knowledge on what they were actually doing, and did so on margin, which led to a huge speculation bubble (""look!

But the Chinese domestic market itself has been hugely unstable: companies with P/E ratios + valuations that were scarcely believable, more and more people entering the market with very little knowledge but trading on margin (a consequence of China's housing market slowing down which used to be a go-to for Chinese investors to make money), etc. all are larger causes to China's stock tank in the past few weeks than just Greece."

While 1/3 of the bail out money went to pay off foreign debt, 2/3 financed the GReek current account deficit and the capital flight that has been going on for months. You also have to realize that the banks were paid of at a time when the European financial system was very vulnerable, there was a real fear that things might collapse. Thats why there was no haircut included in the first bailout.   And no, Greece isnt collapsing under interest payments. Italy and Portugal are paying more, while having a much shorter duration.

On the other hand I think they must be idiots, because something like 80% of Greeks want to stay with the euro - and a large percentage of them just voted to exit.     One theory I saw on twitter was that the ND party (which would normally vote 'Yes') was rebelling against their leader Samaras, because they want him out. If that's true they really picked the worst time to do it, and dropped themselves out of the EU by accident.  Of course it's also possible that they just bought the lie that this referendum wasn't on a Grexit.  Either choice makes them a bit daft in my opinion though.

Sure germany might only have one vote and that the eu voted against germany,  but that does not mean germany has less sway than other member countries.   If germany can persuade other countries than any other country can,  then that means germany has more sway. The fact that the majority voted against germany does not in and of itself mean germany has less sway than other countries. If germany can influence 4 countries while other countries can only influence 2, then it is still very possible for the majority to vote in opposite of germany even though germany can single handedly influence more members than any other member can. They are not mutually exclusive.  You are missing my point completely.  Being influential does not mean you have to have everything go your way. Compared to every individual member in the EU,  germany has the most sway. Does that mean germany will win every decision? No"

In other words, Greece has simply become a vector transferring money from international bank to international bank (while accruing more debt in the process), kinda like getting caught in an endless cycle of payday loans.   Absolutely false. About one third of the bail-out Money has been spent to pay back foreign creditors (who also took an hair-cut on greek government bonds). Meanwhile Greece is still spending 114% of ist national income on consumption. It's just not sustainable. It's sad to hear that so many people actually believe what the populists say, while most bail out money has definitely NOT gone to German Banks (which arent even very exposed to Greek debt). What Greece really needs is to boost growth, but that doesnt happen by stimulus. Greece has the systemic problem of having a wildly dysfunctional state. This needs to be reformed because it's simply not sustainable.    Contrary to assertions, the Greek population has also benefited from the rescue credit. Calculated from the onset of the crisis, in net terms one-third of the public credit has contributed to financing the Greek current account deficit, one-third to paying off private foreign debt, and one-third to capital flight by Greek people. Furthermore, the country has profited greatly from the lowering of interest rates on its foreign debt, an advantage that translated into around 50 billion euros between 2008 and 2014. In 2014, overall Greek private and public consumption amounted to almost 114% of net national income. Greek banks have received some 80 billion euros in ELA credit from the Greek central bank in the past few months. ELA credit, which can be blocked only by a two-thirds majority in the ECB Council, exceeds by far the recoverable assets of the Greek central bank in case commercial banks go bankrupt and the collateral pledged by the banks loses its value. Thanks to ELA, the private capital fleeing to other countries has been replenished with public credit from the international community. This credit has strengthened Greece’s negotiating position with the international community by increasing the other euro countries’ potential losses in the case of Grexit. This could explain why the Greek government has played for time in the current negotiations.   Please read this: http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/publications/docbase/details.html?docId=19161354"

True, a lot of the money has been spent on interest and maturing debt, but most of that debt lies within Greece, so you definitely have a transfer of capital into Greece.  Interest rates. Greece was unable to borrow in the capital markets, meanwhile it is paying some of the lowest interest rates in the EU, has the longest maturity in the world and pays less for interest as % of gdp than countries like Italy or Portugal.    When the first bail-out package was approved German banks had an exposure of 33bn. € (source is the Bank for International Settlements) in Greek debt (public & private - some of it already written off). This is around 1.5% of German GDP, if you assume that all of the public and private debt was worthless. It really is not that much. Some of your articles also fail to mention that there was a 53% haircut for private creditors, so it's not like they didnt feel any pain.    I really urge you to read the entire piece.

finance,3c7w82,ChicagoSchooler,5,Sun Jul 5 23:56:11 2015 UTC,How do you go about it? I'm actually interested.
finance,3c7w82,DepressedHypeman,-1,Sun Jul 5 21:43:55 2015 UTC,"For the US, it's very simple.  The normal state of affairs is 12 VIX.  When there's a recession, it starts to spike hard and fast.  When the recession finally turns, it spirals hard and fast.  In between, the VIX will frequently pop up to 15 or so for reasons usually not easily explained.  You have to really be in tune with the news and/or economics to find the cause, but those little bumps can just be ignored and profited by normal hedging.  It's events like possibly this, the Argentinian default (which was somewhat masked by the tech recession), the awesome SE Asia & Russia debacle, etc that can push the VIX up to half-strength recession level panics.  I strip the expansions with 3 month options on cheap individual stocks that are bubbling, and go all in on the most expensive stocks in the bubble-busting industry with six month long puts for the recessions, but the general strategy below can be applied to individual stockpicking and especially indexes.  I don't recommend a single position in equities or equivalents without a hedge.  We're in a tech boom right now, so I recommend that the beginner or casual investor long QQQ if recession can be predicted, SPX if not, and hedge by buying 1:1 weekly 1% OTM puts at around 12 VIX & below and sell 1:1 weekly ATM calls at around 14 VIX & up, refinancing with every 1% move away from the entry/refinance point.  Volatility is most of the price of options so long as the dumbass Fed isn't hyperinflating, so buying puts on a low VIX and selling calls on a high VIX is a kind of a value investor play on the VIX that gets an easy return.  The complexity increases from here, but this will give above market return."

It's so much the inflation measure that it's what the incompetent Fed uses.  Do you know why they don't prefer the CPI?  I know you don't, but I like hearing you say ""no"" in your head.  They prefer it because they are at least smart enough to know that a Fisher Index is superior to a Laspeyres Index.  Shot your mouth off thinking that the PCE was some crackpot whatever that would show higher inflation?  It actually shows lower.  Bet you didn't think that was going to happen.  It all depends on what your opinion of a hyperinflation is.  If you knew anything about options, you'd know that premiums are at rock bottom lows because of low inflation.  When the Fed raises interest rates, options become extremely expensive.  Overnight rates of an inverted yield curve during a moderate inflation is more or less the same a normal curve during a hyperinflation."

finance,3c7w82,blackamex,6,Mon Jul 6 16:55:50 2015 UTC,"It really depends. I know a lot of times companies who will basically pay their employees the same base wherever they are, plus a ""cost of living"" adjustment based on where they are. In all likelihood you'll still make the equivalent of 100,000 euros when spent within Greece, but the economic situation will dictate that anything involving Greek labor or Greek goods will likely be cheaper than it currently is in Euro terms. Of course, your Drachmas are going to depreciate quickly and inflation of 5%+ will probably be the norm for a while so you're going to want to spend the cash or swap it back into Euros pretty much immediately after earning it, as I have a tough time believing that real deposit rates (the interest rate you earn on deposits - the rate of inflation) will be positive at any point in the near future.  There are also other instances where big multinational companies who have single-digit numbers regional office employees (eg. a relationship manager for clients in the balkans, who just happens to be based in Athens, but theoretically could live anywhere in the area and still do his or her job) who might just be paid in dollars or euros (or in dollar/euro terms, and then changed at the market exchange rate) regardless of what the local currency is where he or she lives."

If the government spends and taxes in Drachma then the Drachma will be demanded by everyone that pays taxes and supplied to those who do business with the government. The devaluation of the Drachma won't cause hyperinflation.  The problem with austerity measures is the drop in aggregate demand which can easily be propped up by deficit spending.

If you give everybody a million dollars, many people will want to go out and buy ferraris. But the problem is, there is only a certain amount of ferraris in the world and they cannot produce more ferraris than their output. So that $1,000,000 will not be enough to buy a Ferrari anymore as they will push the price of each ferrari up.  If the money is being printed fast enough, people wont accept it as payment anymore because it will lose so much value. Would you accept $50 right now if you knew that it would be worth only $40 dollars tomorrow? If you are smart, you wouldnt and would rather accept precious metals or minerals as payment.

This meant hyper-inflation is possible, and hurting those who actually works in Greece and receive compensation in Drachma.

The ramification of using Drachma, including Greece's exit from Eurozone, would be devastating for Greece. What happens when the export loses its competitiveness due to tariffs? What happens when the Greece's export is significantly smaller than Greece's imports?   Austerity measures may be painful, but at least there's still capital flow. Without foreign capital injection, Greece's capital flow will come to a standstill. Ironically, Tspiras ran on the platform that austerity measures hurt the retirees and their benefits, but discount the fact that having a devalued currency would deal equal, if not more damage to those on fixed income."

Cessation of due payments (also euphemistically termed receivables) may either be accompanied by formal declaration (repudiation) of a government not to pay or only partially pay its debts or be unannounced. A credit rating agency will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural defaults, failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments. Countries have at times escaped the real burden of some of their debt through inflation. This is not ""default"" in the usual sense because the debt is honored, albeit with currency of lesser real value. Sometimes governments devalue their currency. This can be done by printing more money to apply toward their own debts, or by ending or altering the convertibility of their currencies into precious metals or foreign currency at fixed rates. Harder to quantify than an interest or capital default, this often is defined as an extraneous or procedural default (breach) of terms of the contracts or other instruments.

If Greece leaves the Euro for the Drachma, would these large outstanding Euro-denominated obligations have an additional weakening impact on the new currency's value.  I mean, Greece's creditors sure aren't going to want repayment in Drachma -- does that unwillingness to accept Drachma at any reasonable rate drive the value through the floor?  Add to that Greece's reputation for financial mismanagement (deserved or not), is the Drachma going to have any value at all outside of Greece?  Obviously, I don't know too much about these issues."

The devalued currency will, over time, make Greece's exports (such as they are) more attractive and make Greece an attractive destination for foreigner's to vacation.    If the devaluation is too drastic, they run the risk of creating run away or hyper-inflation.  See what happened most recently in Zimbabwe.  For a good read, check out ""When Money Dies"" it details  a few of the hyper-inflationary events in the world's recent past.  As far as the bondholders?  They will suffer losses.

finance,3caqgd,ellusiveidea,3,Thu Jul 9 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"Just about every brokerage firm is required to publish statistics on where they route order flow.   Here's an example - it happens to be Etrade but your broker, whoever they are, is required to publish something similar - search your broker's website for a ""606 report"" or ""quarterly routing report""  Warning PDF  https://content.etrade.com/etrade/powerpage/pdf/OrderRouting11AC6.pdf  The report is broken out by securities listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, NYSE MKT/National Market System, and Options.  Notice for NYSE listed securities that NYSE is not listed.  EDGX is the only exchange listed.  The others like G1, Citigroup, Citadel and KCG are all what's known as ""consolidators"".  They go around and pay other brokerage firms that have retail customer order flow for the privilege of seeing that order flow and deciding where/how to execute it.  If your order is marketable against the NBBO, those firms may decide to internalize your order and simply trade against it, while offering some ""de minimus"" price improvement over the NBBO or matching the NBBO.  That trade never makes its way to an exchange but the trade gets reported using a Trade Reporting Facility or TRF.  The biggest one is the FINRA TRF.    For non-marketable orders, (ie: you want to buy stock at $2.00 and the National Best Offfer is $5.00) your order will likely get routed to the venue that pays the highest ""posting"" credit.  In this case that's where EDGX comes into play.  They pay brokers to ""post"" orders or rest orders on their order book.  For brokers who come to EDGX to ""take"" liquidity (ie: hit a bid or lift an offer) they charge a ""take"" fee.  So long story short - it is likely a rare occasion that your order would ever find its way to the NYSE.    The SEC wanted to create competition for the exchanges and did that through Regulation ATS and the Regulation NMS.  It has brought down trading costs while at the same time increasing market complexity and fragmenting liquidity (in my opinion)."

In popular media, ""haircut"" has been used to denote a financial loss on an investment, as in ""to take a haircut"" (to accept or receive less than is owed.) Especially following the financial crisis of 2008, the term was popular in political debates surrounding the propriety of various government actions in response to the crisis.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haircut_(finance)  Let's say Greece has a 100M debt.  If Greece defaults, they likely won't pay back the full amount of their debts.  The holder of the 100M debt may only get 90M back or a 10% ""haircut"".  Also it's customary to give a free haircut when accepting a debt haircut (not really)."

Krugman is 100% wrong as he usually is in the critiques section.  The monetary issuer does control the overall money supply since it is the marginal producer.  It's besides the point since price stability is proportional to the rate of production.  Barry Eichengreen makes a good point acknowledged by Friedman, but that also is largely irrelevant since the Fed eventually ignored that law to bring the US out of GD as it has many others throughout its history.   Tobin's critiques on technique are valid but not relevant considering what should be well-known now that continual price stability is optimal.  To answer your question specifically, GD was caused by a massive decline in the quantity of money which caused a massive decline in the general price level which decimated the financial structure which hobbled production.  Once the Fed restored relative price stability, things rapidly went back to normal.  It was very stop start before they finally caught on to what they were doing."

The implication is that monetary policy should control the money supply. Economic historians see it as one of the most influential economics books of the century.

Essentially, Friedman advocated setting the nominal interest rate at zero. According to the logic of the Friedman rule, the opportunity cost of holding money faced by private agents should equal the social cost of creating additional fiat money. It is assumed that the marginal cost of creating additional money is zero (or approximated by zero). Therefore, nominal rates of interest should be zero. In practice, this means that the central bank should seek a rate of deflation equal to the real interest rate on government bonds and other safe assets, to make the nominal interest rate zero.

This is a bit like how technically the Queen can dissolve Parliament by so called 'personal perogative'. In practice any such an attempt would cause massive upheaval and probably spell the end of the British Monarchy as we know it.  Same goes for the PRC overruling the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, something that has yet to happen. Should it occur the PRC is very unlikely to waste it on a corporate matter but rather tackle agendas such as censoring free speech, currently protected under the Basic Law.

So he was 37 years old in 1987 when he bought the pass and the average life expectancy of an American male is 76 years. So he'd be using the pass for about 40 years. The rate at which he travels will decline as he gets older.   For the discount rate, I thought of adding a liquidity risk premium and a default risk premium to the risk free rate. American would have a pretty high default risk premium since AMR (parent company of American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 in 2011 and went through a reorganization. Plus, AAL has a Debt/Equity of 6.4 v/s an industry average of 1.7 and has been given a credit rating of BB- by S&P. What do you think of this approach? Any ideas you have as to how I can quantify this information into a discount rate?  Also, you mentioned discounting the costs of the flights he takes. By that, do you mean the cost of the tickets or the cost price to American Airlines for operating those flights? Cause the article mentions ""$21 million: Cost of flights to American Airlines.""
