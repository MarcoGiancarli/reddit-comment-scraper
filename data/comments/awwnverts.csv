The feeling that I have right now, though, is a basic expression of the human impression to find something ""appealing"" (in the term most frequently used sense; as in, the sense of something aesthetically awesome).  That's only a way that most people feel, quite frankly, I have a certain feeling of awesomeness when I see small arthropoda.  Really, as a very slightly more sober person, I understand what I just said.  The reason why it's adorable is because of that awesome-ass neck.  Holy shit look at that motherfucker.

awwnverts,3dzxpu,CHClClCl,33,Tue Jul 21 02:00:54 2015 UTC,Yup! The mother and father actually offer all of that during the development of young woodlice!  They do so by living in burrows that contain up to 100 woodlice! Both the parents of the woodlice gather up food for their kids and can recognize each one of them by detecting their chemical badge. After growing up; they can even return home if they need shelter or food. Woodlice are known to have only one partner for their entire lives and take care of their big families whenever necessary.  My source was The Encyclopedia of Land Invertebrate Behaviour from 1993. You can find even more info there with Google Books.

One, there's the instinct towards revulsion, I'm ashamed to admit, that seems to come naturally (or at least culturally) in reaction to certain creatures, like insects, snakes, predators, etc. But then there's this other urge, that while it takes a little focus, a little conscious encouraging, comes almost as easily, and yields a much nicer feeling--and that is that this is as beautiful and warming as any other mother/child scene. If ours are, then theirs are."

awwnverts,3dzxpu,fluffyxsama,10,Tue Jul 21 05:39:22 2015 UTC,"""The creature was there, a curiously shaped creature no doubt, but all the loathing had vanished clean out of his mind, so that neither then nor at any other time could he remember it, nor ever understand again why one should quarrel with an animal for having more legs or eyes than oneself. All that he had felt from childhood about insects and reptiles died that moment: died utterly, as hideous music dies when you switch off the wireless. Apparently it had all, even from the beginning, been a dark enchantment of the enemy's. Once, as he had sat writing near an open window in Cambridge, he had looked up and shuddered to see, as he supposed, a many coloured beetle of unusually hideous shape crawling across his paper. A second glance showed him that it was a dead leaf, moved by the breeze; and instantly the very curves and re-entrants which had made its ugliness turned into its beauties. At this moment he had almost the same sensation. He saw at once that the creature intended him no harm-had indeed no intentions at all.""   C.S. Lewis, Perelandra"

This parasite enters fish through the gills, and then attaches itself to the fish's tongue. The female attaches to the tongue and the male attaches on the gill arches beneath and behind the female. Females are 8–29 millimetres (0.3–1.1 in) long and 4–14 mm (0.16–0.55 in) in maximum width. Males are approximately 7.5–15 mm (0.3–0.6 in) long and 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) wide.  The parasite severs the blood vessels in the fish's tongue and so the tongue falls off, and then attaches itself to the stub of what was once its tongue and becomes the fish's new tongue.

awwnverts,3cfo46,pseud0nym,8,Tue Jul 7 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"Heh, neat.  so you keep a tank with things that'll get eaten?  like... how does that work?"
awwnverts,3cfo46,Silverlight42,14,Tue Jul 7 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"It works because he stays in the sump.  They are awesome detritivorous and will eat up any bits of uneaten food or whatever that comes its way. The sump is a separate compartment so he can't really get out.  Hermit crabs and snails however are amazing little climbers and will sometime get in there and get eaten as well. In my 120 I have some 300+ hermits and 200+ snails, so it is bound to happen occasionally. Beautiful creature too. This bright green with yellow nodules. When it eats the entire bottom of the body kind of opens up and inside it is like a Japanese porn producer's fantasy. Tentacles everywhere!"
awwnverts,3cfo46,pseud0nym,3,Tue Jul 7 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Haha if there is a subjective experience of being a brittle star, I'm pretty sure the brittle star would be more terrified of me picking it up than anything else."
awwnverts,3cfo46,pseud0nym,6,Tue Jul 7 21:12:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know. They are almost entirely inedible and not much will even try for them.  The arms, what is most likely to get eaten, are made up of as much as 2/3rds stoney ossicles.  So eating one would be like eating jello that was mostly made up of sand. That being said, things do nibble on them occasionally, but they regrow arms so fast that it doesn't really bother them.    The TL:DR is they don't have much of an escape response other than in Ophiopteris papillosa which will sort of curl up into a tulip shape if a predator happens to drop it (which causes it to fall faster). Their evolutionary defense against predation is almost entirely being inedible."
awwnverts,3cfo46,l_andie,4,Tue Jul 7 21:27:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I found them (there were actually about 20! This is just the only one who had a heart on it) on a kelp holdfast that had washed ashore and the tide was going back down, so they were definitely about to get pretty unlucky. If anything can make a brittle star afraid... (we pulled the holdfast apart and brought anything alive as deep into the water as we could get them. Don't know if they made it, but they definitely had a better chance in the water!)"

Here's an excerpt:   There is a billion-bug byway in the sky above your head, and you may not even know it! Some insects have been found as high as 19,000 feet! That's higher than some private planes are allowed to fly, due to a need for pressurization! Why do insects fly this high? The same reason you and I do: transportation! It's possible that they even join the mile high club, just like humans, while airborne, but it's probably a bit more difficult. Even spiders may throw out a piece of web to catch the breeze. Dispersion in the wind is a common tactic for many organisms to travel huge distances, which is how many pests for agriculture are spread! Tiny little bugs can travel much farther on a steady windstream than they could on foot."

Its long proboscis and its hovering behaviour, accompanied by an audible humming noise, make it look remarkably like a hummingbird while feeding on flowers. It should not be confused with the moths called hummingbird moths in North America, genus Hemaris, members of the same family and with similar appearance and behavior.  The resemblance to hummingbirds is an example of convergent evolution. It flies during the day, especially in bright sunshine, but also at dusk,  dawn, and even in the rain, which is unusual for even diurnal hawkmoths.  Its visual abilities have been much studied, and it has been shown to have a relatively good ability to learn colours.

They are typically black with a pattern of spots and striped on their abdomen and legs. Often these spots are orange-tinted in juveniles, turning white as the spider matures.

Common names include American giant millipede,  worm millipede, and iron worm.  It inhabits the eastern seaboard of North America west to Georgetown, Texas, north of the Ottine swamps.  It has a nearly cylindrical gray body, reaching a length of 4 inches (100 mm).  When threatened, they sometimes curl up or release a noxious liquid that contains large amounts of benzoquinones which can cause dermatological burns. This fluid may irritate eyes or skin. Many other millipedes secrete hydrogen cyanide, and while there have also been claims that N. americanus releases hydrogen cyanide, this is not true. They do however, excrete a substance that causes a temporary, non-harmful discoloration of the skin.

If an animal is raised in a very cold, high-pressure environment, obviously it would not fare well if moved to a relatively warmer/low pressure environment.

Explanation of why it's relevant below, but be warned, moderate spoilers (probably the most common knowledge thing from the comic though).  There's some aliens in Homestuck who's life cycle is pretty heavily similar to insects- they grow up as grubs, namely. The main distinguishing factor about them as adults (that is, distinguishing them from humans) is that they have horns, that have often been compared to candy corn (they have the same gradient of yellow/orange to red/orange).  Also the grubs themselves look almost identical, though the Homestuck ones have little claw hands that are freakin' adorable.  Pic of the grubs (and an adult under the grub-pile) because I should've just added that earlier.  END SPOILERS  It's a good read, though a bit on the long side. Obviously that's not what anyone's here for, but hey, you asked. If you do decide to give it a shot (that goes for anyone reading this) hit me up with any questions you have along the way, it's safer than trying to look up an explanation due to how easy it is to get spoiled on the pretty substantial twists.

awwnverts,39ntb1,arydactl,10,Sat Jun 13 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"17 is a prime number so it's highly unlikely that this cycle would matchup with cyclical predators.   Wut  edit: to clarify, I am aware of the cicada's life cycle. It's just that this explanation seems strange to me. I much prefer wikipedia's explanation:    These long life cycles perhaps developed as a response to predators, such as the cicada killer wasp and praying mantis.[21][22][23] A predator with a shorter life cycle of at least two years could not reliably prey upon the cicadas.   I'm not sure that the prime-number aspect would be hugely influential. If a predator has a 5-year population cycle, then 1/5th of cicada generations will be effected by the predator's population boom, regardless of whether the cicadas take 1 year or 17 years to emerge. However, if the cicadas are entirely vacant for 17 years, predators will have a hard time specializing in preying on it--most generations of predators won't even encounter a cicada in their lifetime."
awwnverts,39ntb1,ViolentWrath,10,Sat Jun 13 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, it's a real thing. Basically, cicadas are safer while underground, but they HAVE to go out and mate eventually. Going out in increments of prime numbers keeps them safe from predators that have population bursts in a smaller number of years. I am not very good at explaining this, so here is the article info:   Now, imagine an animal that emerges every twelve years, like a cicada. According to the paleontologist Stephen J. Gould, in his essay “Of Bamboo, Cicadas, and the Economy of Adam Smith,” these kind of boom-and-bust population cycles can be devastating to creatures with a long development phase. Since most predators have a two-to-ten-year population cycle, the twelve-year cicadas would be a feast for any predator with a two-, three-, four-, or six-year cycle. By this reasoning, any cicada with a development span that is easily divisible by the smaller numbers of a predator’s population cycle is vulnerable.  Prime numbers, however, can only be divided by themselves and one; they cannot be evenly divided into smaller integers. Cicadas that emerge at prime-numbered year intervals, like the seventeen-year Brood II set to swarm the East Coast, would find themselves relatively immune to predator population cycles, since it is mathematically unlikely for a short-cycled predator to exist on the same cycle. In Gould’s example, a cicada that emerges every seventeen years and has a predator with a five-year life cycle will only face a peak predator population once every eighty-five (5 x 17) years, giving it an enormous advantage over less well-adapted cicadas."
awwnverts,39ntb1,lets_trade_pikmin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:58:54 2015 UTC,The same way that cicadas have dormant periods other animals do as well. Let's say a type of bird has a population rise every 3 years. If the Cicada comes up every 18 years or w/e it will coincide with that bird and thus it will be harder for the cicadas to survive. So the cicadas that waited 17 years to come up ended up having a higher chance to reproduce because no numbers go into 17 so they never matched up with predators on similar cycles.
awwnverts,39ntb1,Day_Bow_Bow,2,Sat Jun 13 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"Depending on the species, most cicadas live for 2-5 years. I believe there is only one species genus of 17-year cicada."
awwnverts,39ntb1,Jaberkaty,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:12:36 2015 UTC,Negative.  There are multiple 17 and 13-year cicada species.  Here's a brood chart with more information.

They are nocturnal and elusive by nature.  Don’t let the looks fool you, they are strict carnivores and sometimes will work together to bring down larger prey.

Shot from the point of view of a presumed assassin, it features 007 walking, turning, and then shooting directly at camera, causing blood to run down the screen. The visuals are accompanied by the James Bond Theme, written by Monty Norman.  Originally designed by Maurice Binder, the sequence has featured in every James Bond film produced by Eon Productions and, although retaining the same basic elements, it has evolved noticeably throughout the series.  It is one of the most immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has featured heavily in marketing material for the films and their spin-offs.  British media historian James Chapman suggests that the sequence is a significant part of the James Bond mythos because it ""foregrounds the motif of looking, which is central to the spy genre.""

Whereas your statement isn't true of all moths, OP's moth is a saturniid and they indeed cannot eat because they lack fully-formed mouth parts. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antheraea_polyphemus#Lifecycle"
awwnverts,38nrqp,OfMiceAndMenus,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:56:02 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Lifecycle of article  Antheraea polyphemus:       The lifecycle of the moth is much like that of any other Saturniidae species. It lays flat, light-brown eggs on the leaves of a number of host plants, including:   Betula, (birch) Salix, (willow) Quercus, (oak) Acer, (maple) Carya, (hickory) Fagus, (beech) Gleditsia triacanthos, (honey locust) Juglans, (walnut) Pyrus, (pear and quince) Prunus, (plum, peach, apricot, cherry, etc.) Sassafras Citrus, (orange, grapefruits, lemons, limes, etc.) Ulmus americana, (American elm)   When the eggs hatch, small yellow caterpillars emerge. As the caterpillars age, they molt five times (the fifth being into a pupa). Each instar is slightly different, but on their fifth and final instar, they become a bright green color with silver spots on their sides. They feed heavily on their host plant and can grow up to 3–4 in long. They then spin cocoons of brown silk, usually wrapped in leaves of the host plant.  Two broods generally hatch each year throughout the United States, one in early spring and one in late summer. The moths eclose and then must pump their wings with fluid (hemolymph) to extend them. The females emit pheromones, which the male can detect through his large, plumose antennae. Males can fly for miles to reach a female. After the moths mate, the female spends the majority of the remainder of her life laying eggs, while the male may mate several more times. Adults of this family of moths have vestigial mouths, meaning their mouth parts have been reduced. Because of this, they do not eat and only live as adults for less than one week. In captivity, this moth is much more difficult to breed than other American saturnids such as the cecropia, promethean, or luna. Kept in a cage, the male and female tend to ignore each other, unless a food plant (particularly oak leaves) is present.

Prominent ear-like fins protrude from the mantle just above their lateral eyes. They have a U or V shaped shell in their mantle which gives them a bell shaped appearance. Some species are short, squat and yellow, while others resemble a jellyfish with one big brown walking shoe. Some have suckers, in addition to spines, on all 8 webbed arms while others look like a regular octopus with the addition of blue or other colored ""ears"". These octopuses are commonly nicknamed ""Dumbo octopuses"" or ""Dumbo octopods"" in reference to how the ear-like fins protruding from the top of their head-like bodies resemble the ears of Walt Disney's flying elephant Dumbo. There are at least 13 to 14 species recognized in the genus.  each having a different aspect from all the others. These features could be larger ears or different colours. As these animals live at the bottom of the sea they have a very small food supply. Prey include crustaceans, bivalves, worms and copepods.  The average life span of various Grimpoteuthis species is 3 to 5 years.

awwnverts,36y8lk,imfm,7,Sat May 23 06:58:36 2015 UTC,"Don't just wash it; disinfect it. Use bleach, and rinse well, then let it dry completely. Bleach is toxic, but it's a good disinfectant, and if it's rinsed well and allowed to dry, no chlorine will be left hanging around.  Hummingbird feeders must be kept clean; just about as clean as you'd drink from yourself. Sugar water is a wonderful medium for the growth of a fungus that can infect the birds. The infection causes the tongue to swell, and since the birds cannot feed--and hummingbirds must eat roughly every half hour that they're not in torpor (""asleep"")--they literally die of starvation. It's better to have no feeder at all than to have one that's not kept clean and disinfected regularly. Feeders should be washed and refilled never less than once a week, and more frequently in hot weather, especially hot and humid (fungus loves humidity)."

The disease caused by the mites is called varroosis.  Varroa destructor can only reproduce in a honey bee colony. It attaches to the body of the bee and weakens the bee by sucking hemolymph. In this process, RNA viruses such as the deformed wing virus (DWV) spread to bees. A significant mite infestation will lead to the death of a honey bee colony, usually in the late autumn through early spring. The Varroa mite is the parasite with the most pronounced economic impact on the beekeeping industry. It may be a contributing factor to colony collapse disorder, as research shows it is the main factor for collapsed colonies in Ontario, Canada  and Hawaii, USA.

A buddy of mine had each eaten an eighth of an ounce of shrooms before walking in the door.  It was a great time, and I highly recommend it to everyone.    And then a really weird thing happened...we walked up to this large cuttlefish tank.  There were 20 or so of them, and as soon as I looked in to it, they all immediately swam over to me.  I walked from one end of the tank to the other, and they followed.  I went back and forth a few times, giggling like a little school girl.    Other people around us started to notice this...and the extra attention started making me feel uncomfortable, so we moved on.

Dynastes tityus is a species of rhinoceros beetle.  Adults of both sexes are 20–27 millimeters (0.8–1.1 in) wide, and males are 40–60 millimeters (1.6–2.4 in) long,[1] including a long horn (the pronotal horn) which projects forwards from the thorax of the male; a second horn (the clypeal horn) projects upwards from the head.[2] Dynastes tityus is therefore ""among the longest and heaviest beetles in the United States"".[3] The horns are used in battles between rival males competing for a mate;[4] the size of the horn reflects the availability of food when the beetle was growing.

awwnverts,33s6hg,Boreoeutheria,2,Wed Apr 29 16:35:02 2015 UTC,That . . . is . . . weird.  It looks like it has a regular eye instead of an insect-type compound eye.
awwnverts,33s6hg,patentologist,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:02:44 2015 UTC,"It's a trick of light caused by the structure of their compound eyes. A lot of insect eyes do this; the dark spot will seem to move as your perspective changes. Look at photos of preying mantis eyes and you'll see the same effect. It's weird because it looks like they are always looking right at you, which they sort of are because they're always looking in every direction at the same time.  To understand how this works, imagine if you made a big ball out of toilet paper rolls that were all facing out from the center. The ones that are angled directly at you will appear darker because you're looking down into them, while the ones of the outside won't because you're seeing them edge-on. The same sort of thing happens with this sort of compound eye; you're looking down into the structure of the compound eye in the spot that is facing towards you, so a dark spot appears there."

awwnverts,33s0im,Shitty_Bollocks,3,Tue Apr 28 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is a bit of an old picture...about a year old. Haha. However I somewhat unknowingly did just that! When I noticed that he was still in the same place after a few hours, I put him in an open box in the sun with some plants and sticks. Every now and then I'd spray water with some sugar every couple hours. A day or two later I had him out of the box on a stick and he just flew off! I was so impressed. But I didn't know about the honey or even the sweets, I will keep that in mind in case I ever stumble upon another lil guy. :) Haha, I can see that happening. Bees are my favorite little creatures so I definitely sympathize with you on that one!"
