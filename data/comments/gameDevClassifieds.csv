Anything you can do with that software you can also do it in any other modeling software, like maya, 3DMax or others.  As long as you export in .obj or .fbx you're going to be able to switch from one to the other effortlessly.  Just curious."

OBJ is far too limited.  But its also most likely that /u/scanevaro only owns blender, and wants to be able to view the scenes and models himself."

And that means if they just release a product without your consent you'll have some legal recourse. Maybe they're in India or something and you can't figure out what to do - but you can contact Steam and let them know that the program contains stolen IP. You can contact their host and serve them with a DMCA for using your music/art assets on their website without your consent. There's all kinds of things you can do.  The most important thing you could do as a creator is to have a chat with a lawyer. It's going to cost you a couple hundred bucks to talk to one for an hour, but they'll be able to help you better understand your options. Don't wait until it's too late to know where you stand legally as a creator OP. Trust me."
gameDevClassifieds,3dt7pv,terpin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:37:23 2015 UTC,"+1 on talking to a lawyer. If this is something you do professionally and regularly (creating IP), then consider something like legalzoom. I pay ~$170/year and I get unlimited consultations, which is great when you have lots of simple questions about your IP, contracts, etc.  If you do end up in a contract with someone in a different country, be sure to include an international arbitration clause."
gameDevClassifieds,3dt7pv,shibbypwn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:41:50 2015 UTC,"$170/year is less than a full hour of any decent lawyer's fee. You're getting what you pay for. Legalzoom gives terrible feedback for this sort of thing, they put out poor quality pre-made product (I've found serious deficiencies in a number of their IP-related documents), and any ""legal advice"" you'd be getting is cursory at best, with little to no understanding of the games industry. Frankly, if any real lawyer gave you unlimited consultations for less than $200, and claimed to make money off of it, they should be slapped with malpractice."
gameDevClassifieds,3dt7pv,SWATJester,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"You hire an attorney to handle it for you. There are several contracts that work collectively to protect you in this regard, such as IP assignments, work for hire agreements, trade secret agreements, NDA/confidentiality agreements, etc. How these integrate together into one cohesive protection scheme is something only a lawyer can assist you with. This goes double when you are dealing with non-publishers, especially when the relationship is over the internet or international in nature. Plus, you want an attorney familiar with game development practices, so you don't get bad advice that fails to reflect the realities of how independent development works in this industry. I'd be happy to discuss further via email or PM."
gameDevClassifieds,3dt7pv,SWATJester,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the medium (game, film, website, etc.), if I'm working with others on something that will be sold, distributed, sold, or anything other than sit on a shelf, I always create a contract and have everyone sign it. There are a ton of free online contract websites. I can personally speak for http://www.docracy.com as it's what I always use (it was the first one I found and I haven't had a need to find another).  Make sure you put every detail into the contract, especially information about ownership of work, profit sharing, etc. Once the contract is ready, I suggest approaching everyone on your team in a manner that makes it sound like you're doing this to protect everyone. For example, you might say, ""I think everyone here trusts each other, but for the sake of avoiding any gray areas later on, I think we should all sign a contract so that we're all on the same page and everyone is covered.""  Let everyone read over the contract first and let them know you're open to suggestions or changes to it. You want to make sure everyone agrees to the terms in the contract, obviously. Then have everyone sign it."

Mumble (always has people from Dev team in it) Used to use Trello for Task assignment now we use Jira (We may move back to Trello for the graphics guys as they find it more user friendly) Schedule meetings at regular intervals so people can plan their schedule Source control like GIT. Dropbox for files not inside the GIT repo (Binary files etc) We used to use Google Docs for any kind of document sharing and shared document editing. Now we moved on to Confluence because it ties into our Task Scheduling software and our GIT Repository. Gyazo for quick sharing of screenshots from our desktop. We are very recently moving over to Artstation to preview 3D models. Character Preview     On a side note to helping find people nearby you if that is your first preference.

gameDevClassifieds,3dr6nm,wizbam,3,Sat Jul 18 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"I don't see anyone here addressing what will turn out to be the real issue. Tools are well and good. They are necessary, but not sufficient for a running team. The problem you'll face is people showing up, starting, and then either not delivering, or just disappearing entirely. That's a problem that software won't solve.   This is a hard problem, but some things to consider when finding team mates who are reliable:   Have they shipped anything at all before? This indicates that they actually want to do projects like this as opposed to liking the idea of doing projects like this. What is their employment situation? If they are in a stable place life is less likely to get in the way. University students may be a good bet--you know they have a few years to kill, and the fluctuations will come around exams roughly twice a year. Or maybe they have a cushy job they aren't planning to leave any time soon. What you want to stay away from is people in unstable situations,  like currently unemployed but looking for work. Those people have time now, but what happens after they find a job? Who knows? Are they agreeable? Basically, are they nice people who are having fun building something cool, or are they stress cases who are rough at the edges. Drama rips apart many teams.   Good luck!"
gameDevClassifieds,3dr6nm,PeteMichaud,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"As a person who was formerly unemployed before, and had to rely on freelance, I disagree with staying away from unemployed people. It really depends on the person, and their personality, and we can't know for sure if people are dependable until we start working with them. Dependable people will make time if they are  motivated by working on promising good projects, and money. Sometimes stuff happens in life with people that they have to drop the projects whether they are employed or not. So dismissing unemployed people, which happens to many people in this industry is an unfair assessment of their reliability."
gameDevClassifieds,3dr6nm,HypoBear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"It seems like you think I was saying that unemployed people are people you should definitely avoid. I didn't say that--I said that instability like unemployment is a factor to consider that correlates with long term unreliability for free/revshare products. That is a true fact, even if you are personally an outlier.   So I guess the specific claim I'm making is that unstable living situations like unemployment (or just finishing school) are correlated with unreliable participation in side projects on timescales of about 6+ months."

Well we're a small team working on an action-puzzler called Heroes Never Lose: Professor Puzzler's Perplexing Ploy and though our game is really coming along and is not far from release, we could use a bit of help with UI.

gameDevClassifieds,3doj3i,odorias,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome! :D   Hell it's an action-puzzler similar to Puzzle Fighter / Puzzle Kombat / Dr. Mario etc... but with Super Heroes! Players try to break blocks on their grids to make that many blocks fall on the opponent's grid to fill it and make them lose. While doing that they charge up their super bars and can trigger unique special powers!  For example, Brainfreeze can freeze the blocks on the other side so that they lock to the grids (they don't fall) kind of like in Dr. Mario. Firestarter burns them so that they lose their color, making them harder to break. Pronto speeds them up. Professor Puzzler scrambles them. Gun Nut drops nuts.... you get the idea :)  Right now we're getting very close to being feature complete, but there are still a few more characters and stages that we want to add to the game. Also, I've made some placeholder UI / menu elements that I'd very much like to replace with something that actually looks good ;)  I can keep talking, is there anything more specific you'd like to know?"

I know that what I do is worth money, and I already do music production for money.  In the end it's a tad disrespectful to ask someone to not do some free work here and there.

gameDevClassifieds,3disjx,jarantfos,0,Thu Jul 16 16:51:52 2015 UTC,Never said RPG. But during those 41 minutes i thought up a really good idea that wouldnt work as a top down
gameDevClassifieds,3disjx,SunburyStudios,6,Thu Jul 16 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say this but before you talk about bringing anyone else into this project,  get a working engine with programmer art,  get a playable state and prove to someone else that the often insane time it takes to produce such work will be with their trouble. Even if it is just for fun.   I decent RPG or even side scroller can take Months of hard work."
gameDevClassifieds,3disjx,spifftune,2,Thu Jul 16 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah...art can be added after the game is programmed. If you really want to give artists incentive to draw for you, you should get your game working just with some programmer art so that whoever wants to spend a lot of their time drawing for you can actually see that you have a working game before they begin."
gameDevClassifieds,3disjx,BurritoEclair,2,Thu Jul 16 19:50:26 2015 UTC,Or pay them. That's always a good motivator. I wouldn't mind getting paid for a project that fails instead of volunteering for a project that will fail.  And why do people think adding our name in the credits is an alternative to paying us instead of a mandatory thing?
gameDevClassifieds,3dk0zb,gidyRas,5,Thu Jul 16 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible deal, you basically offer nothing. Why would anyone on a sub for game developers want a gamesalad license? Even noobs will have picked up better software from the recent humble bundle, or better yet are actually programming. And to top it off you had to use the 'programmer wanted' flair. Oh how it hurts me so."

gameDevClassifieds,3dfrem,gdevalt,2,Thu Jul 16 01:02:20 2015 UTC,"It depends on the length of the tracks, instrumentation, and the scope of the project.

Here's one of my more polished games: http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/dungeon-run.jsp Notes: You need to register to play too far in it, and I did pretty much everything except the menus and the virtual goods.  I've done a 3d tekken style game with P2P networking.  The interesting thing with P2P is that it has tricks to half the latency which is big in fighting games, and you can update others less often, leading to potentially 5000 players in a single action zone.   Maybe I should go and learn 3d modeling and finish that game myself, hmmm. I don't know, the door is open wide on pretty much any game being possible."

Unless there aren't that many and your client has a history of winning similar contests I suspect the chance of winning is much less than 18%."

gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Exodus111,-3,Sun Jul 12 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"I'll be organizing the collaboration and providing a plethora of concepts I've already developed that need to be applied and compiled, including the stat and buff/debuff system I've developed, all of the skills and creatures to be used, writing the plot (which considering it's an rpg, plot is critical), characters, mapping the world, writing the mythos, character dialogue, etc. I'd say that's a pretty critical role."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Exodus111,14,Sun Jul 12 18:43:13 2015 UTC,"You're the Idea guy.  99% of making a game is Programming and Art assets, if you can't do either of those you are not really a big part of the team, and you certainly don't get to own it."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Pixcel_Studios,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"Whilst this is usually the post I'd make, a game like this is usually something that a lot of work needs to go into on the design and writing side, as opposed to the other posts we tend to get on here. I think doing what they're doing could be considered a relevant position."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Exodus111,2,Sun Jul 12 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"Well yes, the Design process in something like this is essential, for someone that understands game design. Which really requires at the very least an understanding of the underlying codebase.     Consider the skill tree point system. Those things have a tendency to devolve into catastrophic messes of Game logic. Every node in the system needs its own collection of functions/methods and the complexity tends to grow exponentially once the nodes can be used in conjunction with one another.  A Good Designer can create a system out of the chaos, but it requires making some decision about Code Architecture from the get go.  As an example, most games are written in C++, but in RPGs these kind of systems often require the use of higher level Scripting languages. As it allows much faster iterations of each node on the skill tree. Bethesda uses Papyrus, Blizzard uses Lua, Python is also popular.  So there you are already making a C++ API for a higher level scripting language, as an example.  But if you don't know what that means, you are not the right person for the job. I'm sorry but that is just a fact.  And when the OP gives the, all too common, ""Logistical Manager"" reply when I ask him what his job is, I have reason to fear that he mgiht have severly overestimated himself and underestimated the task at hand."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Janusse,2,Sun Jul 12 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"written on the internet, must be true"
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,MapleDung,0,Mon Jul 13 22:19:46 2015 UTC,This depends on the game. If it's heavily text-based I can see a writer being a legit position.
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Exodus111,5,Sun Jul 12 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"Someone has to write the actual game logic, and then write a tool for the writer to inject the script seamlessly into his game.

gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,MapleDung,0,Sun Jul 12 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"But design and writing are also huge parts of a good game.

gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Exodus111,3,Tue Jul 14 01:02:01 2015 UTC,Oh he can do whatever he wants with his idea. Ideas are worthless.
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,NineFourtyFIve,0,Tue Jul 14 01:10:50 2015 UTC,"What the hell is your problem? So the only thing that matters in a game is programing and artwork to you??? You need to visualize the concept  and the idea of the game before you can do any programming or art design, so to say that ideas are worthless is a very negative and also a very dispassionate thing to say. YES anyone can come up with ideas, most people are un original, BUT if you have a really unique vision for what you want in a game and the entire reason why the game should be made is because of this idea, how can you see something like that is worthless?"
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,Exodus111,3,Tue Jul 14 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"YES anyone can come up with ideas, most people are un original   I totally disagree, I think absolutely most people have awesome amazing game ideas in their head. Someone that does a lot of gaming probably has 4 or 5.  That doesn't matter, what matters is the ability to put those ideas into practice, and get a result that matches the intial idea at least somewhat.  That requires understanding the tools you are working with intimately and know how the process works.  An ""Idea Guy"" has no place on an Indy team, and no programmer or artist would work for free (rev share is free work), for someone ELSE idea.  Why? Because they have their own ideas they would much rather be working on.  In a team with one Programmer, and one Artist and one ""Producer"" helping out, that can also write the dialogue and help with the game design. They should either work on the idea together, OR make the game the programmer and Artist wants to make. Since they will be doing 80% of the work."

gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,HerpthouaDerp,3,Sun Jul 12 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"I think that you are perhaps putting the cart before the horse here. You don't need an animator or artist right now, and you certainly don't need a musician.  What you do need is a quick and dirty prototype. Get some cash together and get a programmer to put something together for you in UNITY using premade assets. See if the idea actually works and if its a feasible idea before trying to get other involved.  From there start to create a vertical slice. A 'dungeon' that has ALL of the aspects of your game. Conversation, trading, combat, party combat, leveling up, character creation, doors, magic, traps, monsters. Again - I would pay a programmer for this. Once you have your vertical slice done and you are happy with it it will give you a good idea on how much time the rest of the game will take. From here you can start to find people to dedicate their time to the idea - and IF you get to this point I promise you the people WILL come.   Doing this will solve multiple issues that you haven't thought of. It will show you how to effectively communicate your idea to a programmer, how to put together a basic design document, and it will give you something to show to other people to get them interested in the project.  While you are getting your prototype done, hire an artist to create several mockup screens for you. Design (on paper) what the interface should look like - and have an idea about what the game will eventually become. These 2 or 3 pieces of key art will help you in finding artists who can immediately gauge the style - and again it will test your ability to communicate with artists.   If you want to be the writer - you also need to show that you can write. Writing for games is NOT an easy thing to do - and writing RPG's is extremely time consuming. I recommend that you find some existing design document and see how they are put together. The VAN BUREN ones are floating around the net and are exceptional.   RPG are one of the HARDEST genres to create. Even seasoned developers with battle hardened teams find them incredibly difficult. Go in slowly. Do your homework. Do the foundation work yourself, and THEN start to look at building something with a team."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,HerpthouaDerp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:47 2015 UTC,What makes this unique?
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,HerpthouaDerp,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"Mainly the manner in which the skill system is applied, which, sadly, due to being the cornerstone of the game, I'm not anywhere near dumb enough to say it here. You'll either have to be part of the development team or wait until its reveal trailer for that."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,HerpthouaDerp,3,Sun Jul 12 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"So it's so easy to implement, any Joe off a sub could do it if it occurred to them?  If the only thing keeping people from doing it as well or better is that they haven't thought of it yet, then I can't say I'd confidently invest my time, especially given nothing about it so far sounds particularly new to start with, meaning it's likely someone else already had this idea. So far it just sounds like a job system with multiple jobs at once."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,filmmusicguy1985,0,Sun Jul 12 20:35:13 2015 UTC,"Far from just that. It's the nature of how the skills function that changes it. Normally, when someone thinks of a skill in an rpg, they think a single attack or buff or debuff being triggered, while that's far from the case with my system."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,filmmusicguy1985,3,Sun Jul 12 20:40:44 2015 UTC,So the individual skills have multiple functions and effects? I'm still not seeing anything revolutionary here.
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,filmmusicguy1985,0,Sun Jul 12 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"There's much more to it, but I really don't know how I can go into further detail without leaking critical information."
gameDevClassifieds,3d0yvh,ccsdg,3,Sun Jul 12 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless it breaks a law of physics or something, it isn't that critical. Even genuinely revolutionary ideas get shopped around to a dozen or so teams. Ideas are a dime a dozen, even the really good ones. Most people won't spare it a second glance.  Of course, if they ripped it off, you'd have recorded proof of having originated it. But it never comes to that."

gameDevClassifieds,3cocr3,kyzfrintin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:51:55 2015 UTC,"Nice music work.  However, without any experience in sound design it is a bit misleading to claim to be an audio designer.  Also, experience is a much better investment in your career than traditional schooling.  At the end of the day it's not about what you have learned, but rather what you can do.  I would recommend to focus on music and not try and tag sound design unless that is an expressed focus you are trying to acquire."
gameDevClassifieds,3cocr3,solarunion,0,Thu Jul 9 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"without any experience in sound design   I suppose I should have mentioned that I did sound design as well as composition for the animation and video games (I mistakenly thought it was implied, what with my title). I'll amend it. It's not a side hobby, I really do focus on sound design as well as music, as is expressed in the course I'm currently pursuing.   experience is a much better investment in your career than traditional schooling.   While that is true, experience depends on experience. As in, trying to find work (and develop experience) depends on you already having had work.    it's not about what you have learned, but rather what you can do.   To me, that's exactly the same thing. Learning enables doing. As I learn, I practise, and as I practise, I practice."
gameDevClassifieds,3cocr3,solarunion,-2,Thu Jul 9 15:56:29 2015 UTC,Just want to say that my bachelors degree in audio production was only valuable in the form of the information learned and not the actual acquiring or possessing of said degree.  I think actually getting out there and working on projects is a more valuable way of spending your time (and money) than going to school.  Thought I would just pass on that bit of learned wisdom...

gameDevClassifieds,3cev74,Dakruon,4,Tue Jul 7 10:55:16 2015 UTC,"It would be helpful to know roughly how much a 3D asset might cost. I can't determine that based on your hourly rate because I don't know how long it takes you to make something. Like, how much might it cost for a sci-fi style gun like on your portfolio, or a big sci-fi building with several floors the player could run around in?"
gameDevClassifieds,3cev74,CaptPic4rd,2,Tue Jul 7 21:46:31 2015 UTC,"Hello Captain,  The way we work out the prices is based on the asset complexity. We tell our potential employer how much time it would take to do what he asks and what that would mean in price. If the employer can't afford that, we try to come up with a flat rate that is more tailored around his needs.  Unfortunately it is very hard to make a fixed price without knowing what the asset looks like. Sci-fi guns are very different from one another and for example a first-person shooter would require a different kind of work than a third-person. Price is very situational, but it's always agreed on BEFORE the job starts and any ""extra"" hour or fixes required are free."
gameDevClassifieds,3cev74,hit_bot,2,Tue Jul 7 22:19:55 2015 UTC,"It would help if you posted approximate costs next to some models.  I don't know if you'd want to do it in your portfolio necessarily, but something like that would help us figure out ballpark figures."

If you don't want to post costs (I could see where you wouldn't want to do that), you could at least post the number of hours that went into the model.  That way, given whatever rate you quote, we could find out the estimated cost."
gameDevClassifieds,3cev74,defrazr1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is actually a very good alternative. A pricetag can be much more scary than the actual amount of work that justifies it, so it might be the better solution.   We'll decide as soon as we have our site up. Thank you!"

gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,higherpower420,17,Mon Jul 6 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"I price out 2D artwork and animation for mobile titles mostly. I can tell you that for a fairly simplistic game with limited art needs you should still expect to pay out at the very least $3,000 USD for a freelancer. You might be able to lower some of those costs by handling things like UI, Logo, and promotional artwork on your own but it doesn't sound like you have the skills necessary to do that without it looking like amateur work.  Revenue share is pretty much balked at by most professional freelancers in game development. It's pretty simple to explain why. The only people offering it are the people that don't have the money to pay you otherwise, which is (whether you like it or not) an indicator of commitment, experience, and professionalism. Conversely, the only clients you would want to take rev-share from seldom offer it because they have the capital and the expertise to bet on the fact that it's cheaper for them to pay you up front in the long run.  Finally, and you're not gonna like this either, but everything about your post tells me you're an ""idea guy"". You don't have any skills relevant to actual games development. Producing and writing don't get a game made and are, honestly, the lowest concerns for a small time indie-developer. Music and SFX are a little more valuable but also easier to purchase from e-stores than art or code. Which means the only way you can get people to work with you is through payment, not teamwork.  So it's good that you are asking and trying to do some research, just keep in mind that rev-share won't attract people with experience and up-front pay won't be cheap."
gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,pixel_illustrator,7,Mon Jul 6 20:02:03 2015 UTC,"Your entire post sounds skeptical.  I'm also an 'idea guy'.. and when I need something done, I figure out how much $ it'll cost, and then go raise that $.  $200? Fine. 3k? Fine. 10k? Fine.  Just because somebody doesn't have gaming chops (art, programming, etc) doesn't mean they don't have the business chops to raise capital when it's needed."
gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,KnightDuty,3,Mon Jul 6 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Your entire post sounds skeptical.   Probably because every gamedev related board from here to 4chan's AGDG is rife with ""idea guys"" that never see anything come to fruition. We get used to the never-ending parade.   Just because somebody doesn't have gaming chops (art, programming, etc) doesn't mean they don't have the business chops to raise capital when it's needed.   I mean, sure, that's great if you can, but if you can't then you have nothing to contribute. That's the deciding factor. That is the only thing an idea guy can potentially bring to the table."

Some people produce digital products (like myself), some people are authors, some run retail shops. But in my experience all industries transfer to one-another at some level.  You're unlikely to find people there that are interested in investing at these places. But if you're genuine about learning they'll be happy to help.  How far along in your game are you?"

gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,actionJxn,3,Thu Jul 16 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how indie your proj is. But technically, producer/director is just about the lowest position there is. If you're just the idea guy, think again. You'd better pay your team very generously.   Developers might do share-rev, if they like your proj and believe in it. Professional artists most likely won't (especially 3d artists), because artists' tools cost a lot of money.   If you want to get funding (via publishers or kickstarter), focus on developers and artists. You need something that looks good and looks fun."
gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,PyrZern,3,Mon Jul 6 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"because artists' tools cost a lot of money   That's not a valid reason, especially since most of the choices are just personal preferences/industry standards.

gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,Inukai,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:43:26 2015 UTC,"considering less than 20% of indie games turn a profit it is fair to assume that you will probably be working for free, and never see a penny.

gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,actionJxn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"tools like maya and zbrush (the main tools of a 3d artist) are pretty expensive and there is no real alternative. Blender is not an acceptable substitution for professional 3d work, it is far too slow to work with and makes the rest of the pipeline a pain in the ass because of the file formats it supports and the fact that most artists don't have the time to learn its extremely obtuse UI (so replacing an artist or adding more becomes a serious headache).  Programming tools are the exact opposite, I've written code in every major language and never spent a cent on a code editor. A good and bad thing about programmers is they always think they can make a better piece of software than the one they are using, so as a result you have a ton of open source, free, code editors that are amazing."

gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,Inukai,3,Thu Jul 16 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the responses. Again im willing to pay. But first u want to get an idea so i know how to approach funding. I have to include in the business plan how much it can be for just staff then include the costs of resources, etc.   And being an idea guy is irrelevant. Especially since I am working on upfront funding. I can hire people willing to work with my ideas. Just have to find the right people.  Rev share was brought up because im sure those who work on the game, would want revenues shared. But i already plan on hiring a small team for the beginning stages of development"
gameDevClassifieds,3cbup8,Dewgongz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"Here are some questions you should be asking yourself:   What do you bring to the team? What do you do that the people you assemble (programmers, artists, etc.) couldn't do without you? Are you a leader? Why should anyone follow you? Where is your funding coming from? Is it a grant from a school/organization? Is it investors expecting a return on their investment? In any case they're probably going to be asking a lot of the same questions I asked above.   I don't mean to sound harsh but these are the kind of questions you're going to be up against and you should really take a hard look, because if you can't answer them then your journey is going to be a short one."

Aiming for a clean geometric art style or high detail artwork meant to be the focus of the game? Lots of different things could impact how much your game costs, or even change the breakdown of costs for programming vs art etc.  I can program and draw a nicely polished short one scene click-and-find kind of game in a few hours, but have spent weeks on games that really aren't anywhere near sharing."
