RioGrandeValley,3aw98k,UrbanSkullKid,8,Wed Jun 24 00:30:22 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Made a throwaway just because I'm posting to the local sub and all that. Are you looking for a Cardigan or Pembroke? Why does this breed of dog appeal to you? They're hardy little guys bred to work thousand pound cattle, not laze around and do nothing. Very high energy, stubborn little assholes. If you're searching for a good breeder make sure they do the relevant health testing. Make sure it's not a breeding of pet quality dogs, otherwise you're very much supporting irresponsible breeding of these animals. There are also tons of Corgis in rescues. Search Petfinder (not puppyfind) and you'll find some Corgi mixes in the valley. A good starting point is the Pembroke or Cardigan Club directory pages. If you're saying ""I don't want a fancy show dog"", then you'll be glad to know you won't have to get one. Not every puppy in a litter is for show, and instead those puppies just have generations of (PROVEN) great health, temperament, and predictability, not to mention a lifetime support from the breeder. Unfortunately, the valley's pretty low on the responsible breeder scale. Going the extra mile and doing research before you bring in a 15 year commitment is worth it. Best of luck.  Forgot to add: sometimes local shelters end up with them, since people go out to buy cute ""wigglebutt"" dogs off craigslist and then become frustrated when the dog grows up and shows destructive tendencies from lack of training or/and exercise such as nipping and, again, general stubborn asshole behavior. If you go in you can often ask to be put on a call list in case the breed of dog you're looking for finds its way there. On occasion you'll even have puppies from irresponsible breeders who will just dump them there after they can't get their 400 bucks a pop.   edit again!: To add more to what /u/youthquake08 has said- please stay away from backyard breeders (""oh my girl was so cute I just had to get a puppy out of her!"" ""X is the smartest dog I ever had!"" ) and of course the disgusting puppy mill operations you'll find. Corgis are already a breed who has suffered from popularity- explosions in incidents with bad tempers, bad backs- and this is why you must be diligent to either fully identify and support a responsible breeder (out for the health of dogs and not a profit) OR rescue.   I've found this blog, Own Responsibly written by a corgi owner and linked a page on how to identify a reputable, responsible breeder in a sea of bad breeding practices. Please give it a look.   If you feel like maybe you'd be open to other dogs, a look at a shelter has several adults with already stable temperaments. If you for some or any reason need a specific breed, you need to know the responsibility that comes with it. This is to not support the bad breeders who wreck breeds for profit or 'fun' (""my Dolly would be such a good mom!! I just know she wants some puppies!!"") or in any way contributing to animals in shelters."
RioGrandeValley,3aw98k,rgvdogperson,-2,Wed Jun 24 02:06:03 2015 UTC,"I highly discourage you from getting a pup from a breeder. Giving money to someone who may be running a puppy mill is heinous, especially when there are so many new friends waiting for you at the shelter. Search for personality, not pedigree.   That being said, you could join a corgi rescue group and be on the lookout for a baby that needs you. I'm part of Austin's pug rescue because I love their little mashed faces so much but wouldn't ever buy a dog who was bred.   Good luck!!!"
RioGrandeValley,3aw98k,youthquake08,3,Wed Jun 24 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"Hi there, totally not looking to argue but pedigree isn't for showing off, it's for security. If you have 12 generations of breeding dogs who didn't develop bone cancer, for example, then it's very unlikely you'll be given a puppy with a tendency to develop that cancer. Reputable breeders take so much time to do these sorts of screenings, and it's up to the buyer to stay the fuck away from mills or pulga-dogs or ""omg my neighbor breeds chiweeniedoodleugs because they're just too cute!"" who are ruining dogs for everyone. That said, I do think OP would be a good candidate for a rescue and I hope they pursue that route."
RioGrandeValley,3aw98k,rgvdogperson,0,Wed Jun 24 15:05:36 2015 UTC,"That's interesting! I didn't know that about health. However, I think I'm still on team ""Save the accidental puppies instead of creating a market for new ones when there are so many being euthanized every day.""  Thanks for the knowledge yo."
RioGrandeValley,3aw98k,youthquake08,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"No problem! I've  helped rescues and shelters throughout my life too. r/dogs actually has an explanation of the economics on how buying from ethical breeders doesn't cheat a shelter dog out of an owner (full disclosure: I own a well-bred purebred from a breeder and a total mutt from the humane society) mostly because the small group looking to screen and buy from show or trial breeders and the folk looking to always adopt just never really seem to overlap and ethical breeders never contribute to the problem. The real enemies here are the backyard breeders and mills- and unfortunately there's such a lack of education that people looking for purebreds (without doing their research) buy from them and support the overabundance of unhealthy or unwanted dogs. They get a ""cute"" puppy and then dump the husky at the shelter because omg nobody told them they run away all the time!! And they're so stubborn!! And loud!! It's sad the lack of thought that goes into bringing in a dog into your life when it has a great payoff when done right. Research, research, research. These are living things we're talking about, not a purse to shop for at a bargain. :/"

The Enumclaw horse sex case was a 2005 incident in which Kenneth Pinyan  (June 22, 1960 – July 2, 2005), an American Boeing engineer residing in Gig Harbor, Washington,  died from injuries received during anal sex with a stallion at a farm in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington, near the city of Enumclaw.  During a July 2005 sex act, videotaped by a friend, Pinyan suffered a perforated colon from receptive anal intercourse from a stallion and later died of his injuries. The story was reported in The Seattle Times and was one of that paper's most read stories of 2005.  It was informally referred to as the ""Enumclaw horse sex case"".  Video footage of Pinyan and a horse was later disseminated through the Internet.   Pinyan's death rapidly prompted the passing of a bill in Washington prohibiting both sex with animals and the videotaping of the same. Under current Washington law, bestiality is now a Class C felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

We were all giddy with excitement, couldn't believe what we were actually seeing. My dad runs and gets the camcorder and starts filming this thing. He then decides that we need to get closer to this alien ship so we all jump in the car and start driving north. This was North Edinburg so things were pretty rural at the time. We're driving north on 281 and start to see more and more details on this UFO until finally we can see symbols that our minds could recognize. We were making out letters it seemed.

There were allegedly two distinct events involved in the incident: a triangular formation of lights seen to pass over the state, and a series of stationary lights seen in the Phoenix area.

Everyone should carry around a white person w/them, so much utility."

RioGrandeValley,34y6h5,levibr11,2,Tue May 5 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"These domes have been in the works for a long time. I believe that after Katrina, FEMA wanted to get shelters built in areas that were prone to hurricanes so that they could avoid a repeat of the Superdome.   Primarily, these are dual use facilities, meaning they will be used by schools and cities as recreation facilities when they are not being used as shelters. Pretty smart use of money if you ask me.  As for the dome in Edinburg, it was built after all, but Edinburg worked with FEMA to ammend the original plan to build a bigger facility. Edinburg footed the bill for the expansion and it is now the new Parks and Rec Center/Vipers practice facility.  There isn't a connection between Jade Helm 15 and these FEMA shelters. If you know anything about how government works and actually taken part in any government activity, you will know that inter-agency cooperation doesn't exist and that no one is interested in working together."

RioGrandeValley,33wek5,ju5tjj,7,Sun Apr 26 07:13:59 2015 UTC,"I'll try  Pros: The bond will bring the schools up to date in terms of repairs and maintenance. The bond will provide for expansion to fit the needs of the school district in the future.  Cons: Its a lot of money, and even though bonds only last for a term (not sure exactly how long this one is), the length of term is long enough that another bond will have to be past to continue the maintenance, repairs and increase in capacity that the bond becomes close to a permanent tax increase.  A few thoughts, the folks in McAllen ISD have had several failed bonds over the years, this has cause the large bill in repairs and maintenance to accrue, this bond fixes that. The bonds failed from what i understand because folks did not trust the school board in the past.   The expansion is more costly than the repair, the repair is pretty well scoped out, you go to the reports on the bond and you can find line items for everything they are proposing, and an estimate about the cost to repair. Those estimates look accurate to me, as a layman they look a little high, but over the years i have learned I low ball estimates like this, so they are probably close to correct.  The expansion is what I think causes people eyeballs to pop, approx 80 mill for McHigh, and 80 mill for Memorial. and several more million for other expansion projects. This really looks like a lot when you lean sherryland built a new high school for 30 to 40 million a year or so ago. But sherryland, by their own admission, did it on the cheap the skimped on alot of the facilities in the high school. At the same time, since these are expansions, the estimates come across as SWAGS, just large line items, like ""New Science Classrooms"", etc. without alot of details. Don't get me wrong, I believe the folks putting together the bond did research and got professional opinions or consultants to help them with these SWAGS.  If there were two bonds, one for repairs one for expansion, I think the repairs would pass without much problem, but it would be about Somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of the current bond package.  I dont have a dog in the hunt, i no longer live in the RGV, but i have family that does. I am sure someone who gets impacted directly might have other points one way or another, but I think I have hit the high notes."

RioGrandeValley,33wek5,candeljak,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"It's asking for .13 more per $100 of property value, which doesn't seem like a lot but does raise property taxes in one of the the poorest places in the country to the highest allowed by the state.  This cost will likely be absorbed by the wealthy parts of town and businesses, who have proven they have the resources to fight it and will keep complaining (like old, rich folks do) about how the kids are dumb and irresponsible due to lack of an education.  The lack of specifics on some of the budget doesn't help people's suspicions in regards to corruption and wasteful spending, but most of those critics will not be satisfied no matter how much info you'd put out there.   The Board, iirc, kind of shat the bed by doing whatever they did to get that lawsuit filed against them and it's enough rope for the opponents of the bond to rile up their base. On the other hand, I'm not sure how big a push the schools, teachers, and parents have been making but it's probably not enough to encourage an indifferent voting population. The STC Bond only passed because of support from Starr county. Mcallen ISD is probably a bigger, farther reaching entity but they don't have those extra few hundred votes.  We need a better educated population so that conspiracy theories don't waste time in the courts. But whatevs.  (Edits to add relevant links and whatnot.

RioGrandeValley,33sk9e,bigbend01,3,Sun Apr 26 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"You could rent kayaks and go out on the ocean. (open ocean... dolphins around you... bait balls with SWARMS of fish... sea turtles... riding waves... it's quite an experience). If you're not that great on the water you could just ride near the shoreline at Laguna Atascosa or something.   You could also hire someone to take you surf fishing for shark. It's a lot of waiting around for a while, but catching a shark is pretty fun.  Kayaking the Rio Grande is also another option. Not many people do it for obvious reasons but it would definitely be a thrill. There are actually boat ramps up and down the river... or maybe just start at the mouth and go upstream?  You could rent road bikes and get out on some of the back roads. I prefer the eastern part of the valley... and back again to Laguna Atascosa, you could do the bayside loop... seeing an animal is always a pretty big rush for me... so many people in the valley have been there all their lives and never really seen the wildlife the area has to offer. (On that note... there are a ton of state, federal, and private lands worth checking out... just go and walk around them, explore.)  You could get a guide to take you fishing for Alligator Gar... the fish are prehistoric looking and GIANT (we're talking like 5 feet)...   You could go hunting... you can hunt pigs year round...

It works pretty well for him considering he watches lots of Youtube and plays WoW.

I don't recall if we paid an initial set up fee, though I'm sure we did.  It had to have been pretty reasonable since we try to adhere to a budget.  That being said, the fee was also probably worth it considering our only other option would have been satellite internet through Dish which is costly and has a very small data limit."

The business has only been open for like six months or something?  I went to go visit them yesterday.  They have a limited selection but they do have some Cascade yarn.  They also have a sitting area where people hang out and knit/crochet.  The owner told me that they have meet ups on Tuesday mornings and Thursday evenings.  Maybe I'll hook up with them.  If you wanted I'm off on the weekends sometimes, we could meet and show off our works in progress if you want.    I also found the Barnes and Nobel meet up on Facebook.  They're listed under Border Stitchers.  They have over 100 members on Facebook and from their pictures online it looks like they take over most of the Starbucks cafe at B&N.    Also, Lamb's Loom is participating in World Wide Knit in Public day on June 13th.  I know I definitely want to knit with them.  You should pay them a visit if you haven't gone.  They're super nice.  I just wish they had a wider selection.  They're still figuring stuff out as they go though, so they said they're very open to any suggestions on inventory and would order any colors I want.  I hope they get a ball winder and swift soon because winding yarn from a hank by hand is a pain in the ass."

It is a beginner friendly club that meets at the University of Texas-Pan American. Best of all it is free and open to the public. I lead the classes there alongside a few other great BJJ guys. I'm a purple belt and have been involved in BJJ for about 8 years now. Every Saturday we have ""open mat"" where we invite guys and girls that train BJJ from all over the Valley to join us for friendly sparring. We had over 30 people join us this past Saturday from white belt to black belt. Our beginners are progressing really quickly. We took a small team to a tournament this past weekend and 2 out of 3 of out competitors medaled. One of them took second place with only two months of training. Mondays through Thursdays we teach beginner lessons. Our group has grown tremendously in the past 2 years. I have 30 people signed up to be a part of our UTRGV student competition team in the Fall. Again, I stress, you don't need to be a student to come. Most of the people that join us are not students. They are here because it is the best bang for buck options ($0) for training BJJ in the RGV. We have a lot of skilled blue belts that come everyday. Lots of guys with many years of experience on top of the many beginners we have. Hope to see you, or anyone else reading this, around at the club.  https://www.facebook.com/UTPABJJCLUB"

Sure this isn't NY or a huge city, but it isn't a shitty, tiny, super outdated place either. I've posted this before for restaurants to visit.   House wine in McAllen is one of the best places to eat IMO. Texas lime shrimp are a must try (fresh from Brownsville bay). Can also vouch for the duck, and lamb chops personally.   The centennial club speakeasy in the downtown McAllen district is incredible. Very intimate environment, and awesome customer service. If you're willing to dish out some coin, this place is worth it.   The blue onion (multiple locations) is one of my favorites. Po boys, pizzas, and calzones. Very tasty dips as starters with their house made flatbread. Oh, and they have like 21 beers on tap. Best beer selection other than Roosevelt's around here.   Moonbeans or jitterz if you want local good coffee."

It's pretty cheap though so you could make upgrades... are you fishing alone or with company?     The laguna can be really shallow depending on where you go. However the intracoastal runs through it of course, so that can be up to 12 feet deep according to Wikipedia.     I'd suggest buying one of those fishing maps from Academy. It lists kayak spots which should be a good start on figuring out where you'd want to launch the inflatable from. I'd suggest staying close to shore until you get the hang of it."

RioGrandeValley,2y7t0d,DeadAbyss,5,Sat Mar 7 05:36:58 2015 UTC,"The chances of Google Fiber coming to this area are very slim. In order to even get started, an application has to be made to Google, and there has to be support from the local municipality as well as a petition from the citizens that says ""if it were here, I would subscribe."" None of that has happened. We tried to circulate a petition, and it got no where. You can learn more about GFiber here: https://fiber.google.com/newcities/  That being said, with no pressure from the outside there is no catalyst for TWC to upgrade the service; furthermore our market doesn't have the amount of subscribers necessary to justify the euqipment upgrade cost to provide higher level of service. Hidalgo county has the lowest amount of broadband subscribers in the United States, so I wouldn't expect providers to jump at the opportunity to invest more for the 30% of the population that use it.   That's why it's up to us to make it happen in our cities, schools, and the area as a whole. Look into the Free Wi-Fi in Rio Grande City, the  initiatives in SPI, PI, and Laguna Vista. There are pilot projects going on in many small communities that not many people know about .. from La Feria, Mercedes, San Juan, etc. Your City leaders know this is important, but if you let them know how badly you want it, it might help them move the projects along :)  NOTE: I'm building some of these projects out, so obvsly I'm a fan boy.

RioGrandeValley,2y7t0d,energetik,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:58:30 2015 UTC,AFAIK Time Warner is already increasing their bandwidth to above 100mb on their cheapest plan in some places like Austin or Houston. That's why the modems they give out (or recommend) now are all DOCSIS 3.0 certified.  I would expect TWC to implement that before Google Fiber coming to this area.
RioGrandeValley,2y7t0d,sweetbutstupid,2,Sat Mar 7 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"Hopefully someday they'll upgrade the service here, but don't expect GFiber anytime soon :("

Two other ISP's have rolled out 1 gigabyte service in San Antonio.  ATT will also be bringing their Gigapower internet service to San Antonio.

RioGrandeValley,2y6ozu,tejanodelsur,2,Sat Mar 7 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"Milanos in weslaco has good Italian food.  House wine in McAllen is one of the best places to eat IMO. Texas lime shrimp are a must try (fresh from Brownsville bay). Can also vouch for the duck, and lamb chops personally.   The centennial club speakeasy in the downtown McAllen district is incredible. Very intimate environment, and awesome customer service. If you're willing to dish out some coin, this place is worth it.   The blue onion (multiple locations) is one of my favorites. Po boys, pizzas, and calzones. Very tasty dips as starters with their house made flatbread. Oh, and they have like 21 beers on tap. Best beer selection other than Roosevelt's around here.   Those are just a very few. If you have a kind of food in mind you are looking for, ask away. I might know what restaurant caters to what you're looking for."

You can get a combo plate for takeout or the buffet for dine-in. There was a nice selection of rolls and all kinds of chinese dishes, rice, and soup.  I guess they don't have a website but here's their facebook."
RioGrandeValley,2xsven,forjakessake,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"Can only recommend in the McAllen area. Kumori (multiple locations) has always been our go-to for sushi. Kohnami (on Nolana near Bicentennial) is a decent place but much more affordable. Kurai isn't that bad for an all-you-can-eat buffet. My newest discovery is Lucky Sushi on Trenton, just in front of the Cinemark Bistro theater. A little cheaper than Kumori but fresher, they offer a create-your-own roll or you can choose from a variety of rolls. I've only been twice as they only recently opened, but it may replace Kumori as our usual sushi place."
