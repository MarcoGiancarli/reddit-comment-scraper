Powerful? I don't know how to put it. I spent a some time tuning the colors and remaking the homescreen to look a specific way on the Turbo, so it doesn't look exactly like I wanted to on all screens.

I didn't want to post v2 & v3 which is an add-on, since they were 12 widgets based off the google + users thoughts and primary made for them off of their settings.  Though this is just to show how design language can be improved and optimized over a course of time when you work on something you actually like doing. I don't post on reddit for the ups, if I did I would post all my shitty transitions screens and one - off widgets.

androidthemes,3dwwl9,kumquat_juice,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"I've been using ""DIY Locker"" for about a month now. It's been okay at best. I can set a custom wallpaper. It doesn't drain my battery. It has security options. Like you mentioned, however, it has a few small things that irk me.    You can only swipe right to unlock (very incongruous with 5.0+ lock screen).  You only have a small selection of lock screen widgets to drop (a shitty music player and quick launch tray, mind you). You can only have the digital clock set to left, center, or right aligned. Height not adjustable.   We might see some arguments of ""I only ever look at my lock screen for one second anyway"", but honestly, what's wrong with wanting a consistent overall aesthetic experience with my phone? I feel like we're missing the UCCW of lock screens right now, and I'm sure many are willing to fork out a few dollars if it ever existed."
androidthemes,3dwwl9,ktmfinx,2,Mon Jul 20 13:33:23 2015 UTC,"All I want is a lock screen app that plays nice with Kustom. I'll take it from there!

I don't care about notifications.  I don't care about extra ""features"" that I'll never use.  Just work with Kustom's visible if locked feature. please."

androidthemes,3dsnhr,maracusdesu,2,Sun Jul 19 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"I love this theme! Looks super clean but I'm having some trouble getting it set up on my phone.   The app icons seem to be acting opposite from what they should be doing. All three sets of apps show all the time and when I click one of the 'group titles' (social media for example) then that group of icons scrolls down and fades out. Any ideas on how to fix this? I tried removing the music player and the app drawer groups and adding another 'app' group in their place, pretty much like the first three groups (music, media and utilities) but I can't for the life of me get them to behave like the original groups. I guess what I'm asking is how did you get those first three groups to behave like they do? I understand that they fade in/out with the menu/player globals but I can't seem to understand the scroll/scroll inverted animations that the originals have. Hope that makes sense, any help would be greatly appreciated!   EDIT: So I got the new groups to animate correctly! Now I'm stuck on the app icons showing all the time. Also, the horizontal lines scale out but don't stay when each group is clicked. Any Ideas?  EDIT2: So I got it all worked out. I basically just had to invert everything. I changed the scroll inverted animation for the app icons to just a scroll animation and changed the angle/speed accordingly. Changed the scale out horizontal animation on the horizontal lines to inverted and it worked fine. Not sure what went wrong in the first place but it's looking sharp now.

Other than that, one question: How are you creating the graphics for all the different elements (clouds, blocks, Mario, ...)? Are you making them in Zooper? PNGs in Zooper? It would probably be easiest to make the wallpaper completely in Photoshop, and than use transparent PNGs as icons for all the actions and just overlay them in the correct position.   Would be possible with Widget locker, it let's you use custom sliders and custom graphics for you sliders. Find an invisible slider, change the ""handle"" to Mario. A doesn't need Zooper, change the icon of a folder. B also something Nova can do (Nova action, transparent icon), or if you're constructing the warp pipe in Zooper and it's not part of the background use a shortcut to the nova action. Don't think so. Search for a visualizer/equalizer widget. Media utilities and Tasker, via Tasker variables. You can only get some specific information about the music playing, such as title, album, length of a song, and even cover. That's the reason you can't build a music visualizer in Zooper. Although, what you could (maybe) do (probably terribly complicated though) is build something that looks like that but doesn't work, and just acts randomized. I don't think so. You could look at Flipboard's widget."

androidthemes,3dkp3d,pheymanss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:12:52 2015 UTC,I use Nova and have my app drawer split into two separate drawers: One half for general apps that I need on my phone but don't open all the time and another half for all my favorites. I then group related apps into folders so they aren't taken up room in the drawer when I'm not looking for an app of that category.   Here's what it looks like so it makes more sense: http://i.imgur.com/EEd810g.gif

androidthemes,3d9urw,Surgency,2,Tue Jul 14 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"Launcher: Nova  Simple self made clock in zooper.   Icons are a mix of Polycon and Candycon.   Left icon brings up whatsapp, swiping brings up regular texting. Middle icon brings up a folder of social media apps, swiping brings up the play store. Right icon brings up folder of Google apps, swiping brings up a popup widget for Google play music.   Double tapping blank space brings up my phone dialer.   Swiping up in blank space brings up my app drawer, which is also organized by category.    I have a second page which is organized similarily, but with stuff like twitch, banking, android wear, etc etc."

androidthemes,3dacor,jabaarthezebra,3,Tue Jul 14 19:04:00 2015 UTC,Can you change the color on that clock widget? It might be easier to read if it were at a bit more of a contrast with the background. Otherwise very simple and clean.

androidthemes,3d8yvx,EnigmaP3nguin,7,Tue Jul 14 12:56:14 2015 UTC,what the hell is the app drawer icon for if you're on action launcher
androidthemes,3d8yvx,N4ever,2,Tue Jul 14 14:46:29 2015 UTC,To be honest I use the app drawer more then the slide out panel
androidthemes,3d8yvx,N4ever,8,Tue Jul 14 14:53:33 2015 UTC,that's what sets action launcher apart from nova tho

androidthemes,3dar13,Boxcow45,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:41:22 2015 UTC,If you want to change it by the current temp you can do something like this: $#WCTEMPN#>60?[bo]0[/bo]$ This will make the first bitmap disappear when the temp is over 60°. Then put this in the advanced section of the second bitmap: $#WCTEMPN#<=60?[bo]0[/bo]$
androidthemes,3dar13,fatty77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:39:59 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried this just yet, but to my understanding as long as the temperature is over 60 the alpha of the second bitmap will be 100 correct?  To clarify, I'd like the bitmap to change to the current weather forecast (cloudy, scattered thunderstorms, etc). Is there a state variable similar to the one used to the battery state?"
androidthemes,3dar13,fatty77,2,Wed Jul 15 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried this just yet, but to my understanding as long as the temperature is over 60 the alpha of the second bitmap will be 100 correct?     That's correct.    To base it on the condition you can use #WCCOND#. Here's a list of all the conditions Zooper recognizes: * UNKNOWN * STORM * THUNDERSTORM * DRIZZLE * RAIN * SHOWERS * FLURRIES * RAIN AND SNOW * SNOW * HAIL * FOG * HAZE * WIND * PARTLY CLOUDY * MOSTLY CLOUDY * CLEAR * FAIR"

androidthemes,3d9lq0,Hamm1701,3,Tue Jul 14 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, with KLWP, simply create a global switch and have a shape set its touch to toggle a global switch. Then create images with the icons and add fade in animations to them that are triggered by the global switch."
androidthemes,3d9lq0,02Alien,2,Tue Jul 14 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah. In KLWP, you can set that image as the background. Then, you can create invisible rectangles and rotate and resize them until they're approximately where you want them to be. You can set those invisible rectangles ""touch"" property to open a nova folder and you're done!"

androidthemes,3d5yc9,bingleding,5,Mon Jul 13 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"Firstly, apologies for the crappy quality gif, the conversion tool I used wasn't too good.  So this is my first real theme made with Kustom, other than taking other peoples designs and adjusting them slightly. I'm pretty happy with it! I will probably change the colours/background pictures which are mostly placeholders, as well as make some touch ups to the design where it looks a bit 'off', but I thought I'd see what you guys thought.  Its almost entirely made within Kustom, with the Google Keep widget activated using pop-up widget. The reminders section uses Tasker to check whether I've accessed certain apps (namely Duolingo and MyFitnessPal), and reminds to complete my daily lesson/log my food if I haven't already.  The structure and labelling of the items in Kustom are a bit messy, so let me know any of you guys would like it, and I'll clean it up a bit and upload!"

As I say the structure is quite messy, and probably not as efficient as it could be, I'm still learning the tricks and shortcuts. All of the 'background mask' items are used to clip the following module, so it appears a certain shape. If there's an easier way of doing it, I welcome feedback!  Enjoy."

androidthemes,3d4jdx,cl1que,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:36:18 2015 UTC,It should be linked to whichever gmail account is associated with your account. Try marking ask your emails as read. You can change the settings for the email by going into the zooper widget and clicking on the component and clicking the edit text manually button.
