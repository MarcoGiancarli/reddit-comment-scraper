From reddit apps that reddit bought that stopped development after reddit bought them, like reddit blue for iOS or the lack of moderator tools., Nothing moved despite constant complaints.  And then this Victoria lady gets fired. Not ""Victoria has seen fit to leave reddit in pursuit of new goals, we wish her all the best!"" but everyone knew that she got terminated, in the middle of a running Ama.  And then, while Moderators where trying to figure out what happened (because why would you inform them of anything) one of the co-founders of reddit basically laughed at them. ""Break out the Popcorn!"" was it?  Frankly, i think much of the reaction was quite tempered and i don't think the People who signed the Petition to get CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao, removed from her Post should be seen as a ""Lynchmob"". She wasn't very good as a CEO of a Company with a Structure like Reddit, in which you have to keep your Moderators happy in Order to draw in People. Because if you don't, you will find yourself without Moderators for your Boards. Ellen Pao failed spectacularly at that. And i i signed the Petition seeking to remove her because i legitimately think it would be better for Reddit if she where to be removed. Which she did.  Cgpgrey said in the HI podcast #43 that Pao got kicked out because of a Lynchmob and i feel like i'm being tossed into the same Pot as some rather disagreeable People.  As for the bans for some hatespeech subreddits; meh. Generally i'd keep those around just because i don't believe in banning of any sort of speech. Let People build and dwell in their own Ghetto if they so desire. Of course i'd follow the Letter of the Law so hard that the Letter would call for a Restraining Order against me.

There will always be some Idiots around but i'm rather tired of giving them validation by merely mentioning their existence.  They aren't something new, since some psychologically challenged Person will be amongst the public because they are part of it the same as anyone else. A rather ugly part to be sure but a Part of the whole like diseases are part of human life.  Or, to use another analogy, let's say you are the Public, the entirety of it.

nerdfighters,3dmts6,nazgulkoopa,7,Fri Jul 17 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"It seems like a lot of the people for the ban fundamentally don't understand the reasons that people are against the ban. It's not so much that all these people wanted /r/fatpeoplehate to stay around. There are a lot of us who are against the ban that had never gone on any of the banned subreddits. I'm against the ban and I didn't know that /r/fatpeoplehate existed until the fallout from the ban started to pour in. I only went on to it after it relocated to see what all this was about and the community itself is not something I want a part in. the torches and pitchforks aren't coming out because everyone lost their favorite sub. They're coming out on principal.     Many Reddit users see the site as a bastion of free speech. It's very well set up for this for two reasons. First, it allows you to say whatever you want anonymously with the volume of your voice determined democratically by the community, within the community. Second, it is very easy to determine what you listen to. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Like I said, I didn't know this sub existed and I've been a redditor under different accounts for quite a while.    ALLOWING THESE SUBREDDITS TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT DOESN'T HURT ANYONE. The only people who are going to see it are those who, of their own volition, subscribed or visited the subreddit. If it offends you, you don't have to listen to it. That's the beauty of Reddit and that's why free speech works so well here. Since these subs weren't doing anything illegal, banning them for the views they express is encroaching on free speech.    I do not agree with /r/fatpeoplehate. I do, however, agree that they have just as much right to say what they please as I do. I do not believe that they should be censored when they can be easily ignored. I detest this recent ultraconservative trend of the ""progressives"" deciding ""I don't like it therefore it shouldn't exist"" and I'm not alone in this belief. That's just my two cents.    TL;DR: It's about censorship, not fat people."
nerdfighters,3dmts6,TrustMeImAnEngineer_,12,Fri Jul 17 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"But FPH wasn't banned for what was the content of the subreddit but I would be fine if it was. It was banned for the fact that the Subreddit actively harassed people.   ALLOWING THESE SUBREDDITS TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT DOESN'T HURT ANYONE   In this case it did, not only were the posts hurtful and aimed to increase world suck as much as possible there was also personal information posted there of the Imgur admins.  https://www.reddit.com/comments/39c0n3/ is a good repository of evidence against FPH.  You can be as pro-free speech as you like, FPH actively broke the rules of Reddit and thus should have been banned.  You also say that you could have unsubscribed, but in the evidence you should find a post about someone in suicide watch who was thinking about harming themselves and FPH gathered and posted comments to the effect of ""You are fat, so do it"" and there were lots of downvotes for posts that were actually trying to help. I'm sorry, if your idea of free speech includes part of that then I don't want your free speech."
nerdfighters,3dmts6,Nymain,0,Fri Jul 17 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"I still don't necessarily agree with the ban. Similar to how the KKK is legal in the US. The subreddit itself was simply a way for like-minded individuals to congregate. I disagree with what they were doing, but I don't think they should be banned.   ""You are fat, so do it"" and there were lots of downvotes for posts that were actually trying to help. I'm sorry, if your idea of free speech includes part of that then I don't want your free speech.   You're missing the point of free speech. Free speech has no limitations. Telling someone to kill themselves is wrong, but you should have the right to say it if you choose. They might be promoting world suck, but the world would suck a lot more if they weren't allowed to say it to begin with."
nerdfighters,3dmts6,Slev23,5,Sat Jul 18 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"Telling someone to kill themselves is wrong, but you should have the right to say it if you choose. They might be promoting world suck, but the world would suck a lot more if they weren't allowed to say it to begin with.   Could you elaborate on that last point? When it comes to free speech, it's still our responsibility to delineate its terms -- for example, we carve out exceptions for libel, fraud, and extortion, and those exceptions exist because their legal justification managed to hold up to scrutiny. It's hard for me to see why a policy of free speech, with provisions against harassment, would be such a bad thing. I get that determining what qualifies as ""harassment"" is going to be super tricky, but defining reasonable terms to any policy is always going to be a difficult exercise."
nerdfighters,3dmts6,the-maltese-penguin,0,Sat Jul 18 01:45:53 2015 UTC,"Libel is knowingly spreading false rumors which isn't the case here. Our laws against harassment are extremely lax for just such this reason. In fact the SCOTUS ruled that making death threats online is not illegal because the actions taken online are not the same as actions taken in person (such as mailing a physical letter.)  The internet allows for fast and impulsive behavior and that's what a lot of these ""brigaders"" are doing. This is a slippery slope. First you ban the harassment subreddits, then you ban subreddits that are mean spirited, then you ban subreddits that disagree with the reddit admins.  Before long you have a totalitarian reddit regime banning anything they don't like. The spirit of banning FPH was good, but where it leads may be anything but."

nerdfighters,3dnims,ThomasTulak,13,Fri Jul 17 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"I guess if I didn't like the TFiOS movie, I would be worried about this movie too, but since I did like it I'm not worried. I also just generally think that it's a little unfair to criticize the movie based on its marketing since my understanding is that in Hollywood creators usually don't have a ton of control over that."
nerdfighters,3dnims,HoopyHobo,14,Fri Jul 17 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Even if they did have control over it, the point of marketing is to get as many people to watch it as possible. There is absolutely no point in pandering to the book's audience, because the big fans are almost definitely going to watch it regardless. The trailers (and various other forms of marketing) must seek out the average crowd that hasn't heard of this movie.  But regardless, I don't mind the marketing being superficial and everything it needs to be to get people's attention. It doesn't matter what made people come to that theater, what matters is what they see once they're there."
nerdfighters,3dnims,drapollo,5,Fri Jul 17 19:08:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the TFiOS movie because it failed to capture almost a single moment that spoke to me in the book. It traded out all the introspection of life for generic teen romance.  John keeps going on about how the same writers are working on Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska and that is the most worrying thing for me. Those writers are clearly good, at teen romance plots. But I don't trust that they'll include the parts of the books that make me care. John has said there's less Whitman, but I worry about the cracked vessel metaphor that I so love. I'm still going to see the movie, partly so I can participate in discussion and partly out of some remaining hope. We'll see."
nerdfighters,3dnims,hydrohawke,2,Fri Jul 17 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"truth -- i find for the most part i'm only going to see movies now to informedly participate in discussions -- which is a bummer, b/c I'd I like to get equally excited about the actual experience of the film."
nerdfighters,3dnims,zentouro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:01:17 2015 UTC,This pretty much sums it up for me as well.
nerdfighters,3dnims,barkett,3,Sat Jul 18 03:28:07 2015 UTC,"At first it kind of felt like you were complaining that you were a more competent cinematographer the people behind the movie, since you said there was all this cool stuff that you would do with it that they didn't do.  and then you kept talking and clarified that it's not that you believe your version is inherently superior, but merely that the real actual version is never going to be what you imagined.  Which, of course, is true.  Anyway, if you have genuinely felt this strongly about the book and spent this much time specifically visualizing a movie in your head, I agree with you that it won't pan up to your expectations. That's because as you said -- at this point, nothing will.  edit: but to clarify, what gave me the impression that you believe your head-version to be inherently better is your title, which actually suggests that the movie will objectively not be good. That's something that I think is way more of a reach than what you described in the video.  Movie not panning out to your very specific expectations = well, of course, it would require an insane statistical anomaly for it to be exactly what some specific reader envisioned.  Movie not being good, in general = well.... this is a lot more of a subjective ordeal."
nerdfighters,3dnims,drapollo,3,Fri Jul 17 19:02:47 2015 UTC,Have seen it already. The movie is alright. But I don't agree with John that it's better than the book. No way.
nerdfighters,3dnims,sleepwalkcapsules,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:45 2015 UTC,"other points notwithstanding, i think it's very hard to actually judge a movie by it's trailer. there are many movies that i thought were gonna be crap, but were totally different than what i expected based on the trailers.  trailers are meant to sell movies. they pander to certain demographics that the expect to like the movie. this trailer is aimed really hard at the female teenager demographic, or what advertising people think teenagers like, so the trailer seems super cheesy. i don't think the movie will be as cheesy as the trailer makes it out to be."

This used to not be the case, Hank used to lock his tumblr asks to only users who also had tumblr, but now everyone can ask him questions.  And also they used to respond to many YT comments if you commented within the first few hours of the video being up, but I'm not sure if that still happens because I just don't understand how to navigate through YT's commenting system anymore.

Issac Asimov is famous for writing about androids, and robots, and weather or not they are real. What is real anyway? What separates a man from a machine? When is one life and one a construct?  There are similar stories built around aliens, and other creatures. One of my favorite Piers Anthony series has a bit of all of it (the Robot Adept series). One of my favorite classic SF stories is ""The Still Small Sound of Trumpets"" which shows how small things can make big changes in society. And ""A Case of Conscience"" by James Blish which explores religion, space travel, and aliens.   If you are looking for something more contemporary might I suggest many things by Stephen King. He is famous for writing character sketches that he puts into books. Needful Things and Under the Dome are both great examples of that."

People spend more time inside, hiding from the sun now than in past centuries.  Somehow, with all this skin healthy progress, we have more skin cancer than ever before.  If I had to guess, and since this is our health we do have to guess, this will go down in medical history like our fear of dietary fat."
nerdfighters,3d6dwm,seer0,5,Tue Jul 14 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Prior to the 1900s people usually wore hats, long sleeves, and long pants and skirts most of the time. The Southern part of the planet that receives the most intense solar radiation was fairly sparsely populated with fair skinned people prior to the invention of air conditioning, and let us not forget that CFC was invented in the 1890s and took some time to come into widespread use and to be put in every aerosol can on the market and accumulate in the upper atmosphere where it destroys the ozone that plays a large role in blocking incoming UV radiation. In short, there are a lot variables you're missing.  We have a very good understanding of the effects of UV radiation on human cells and how exactly they cause cancer. This is not like dietary fat, it's more like cigarettes.  EDIT: I'll grant that sunscreen can contribute to skin cancer if it means you're spending more time in the sun and your sunscreen doesn't protect against UV-A radiation, which is often a problem. That's why recommendations usually include reducing the amount of time spent in the sun as well as using sunscreen. But it's still the radiation from the sun that's causing the cancer."

The idea that we'll be harmed when exposed to our only source of light seems absurd to me.  In response to your edit:  If that is the case, you would see a positive correlation between sun exposure and skin cancer, however, outdoor workers receive several times the exposure of indoor workers and have less skin cancer.  http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jsc/2011/858425/  This study seems to imply that sunlight from a window is more damaging than being outdoors.

Eventually, though, Paramount made a deal with the same production company and writing team that made TFiOS and Paper Towns. The reasoning behind this from Paramount's perspective is probably just that their goal is to duplicate the success of TFiOS and keeping as many elements the same is probably the safest way to accomplish that. I would guess that Polley was not interested in directing after she was no longer writing the screenplay, but I have not seen anything official about that."

I do agree with the assessment John makes, but as someone who is likely going to see his students run into this page because of its url and its creator, I would rather have them see the varied (while in my opinion incorrect) statements about the Civil War.  While it is important to know what triggered the American Civil War and know its causes, it is also important to know that for a long period of this nation's history, that was the story put forth from many sources that were considered authoritative and definitive.  It matters that people learn this information, but also realize that many people do not hold the same viewpoint, and that has characterized their actions, adoptions, and uses of the Civil War and ""southern"" hegemony to further their causes."

nerdfighters,3cxo0o,ARayofLight,5,Sun Jul 12 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"You didn't read anything I said, did you?  In fact I have had that article bookmarked for some time now, and enjoyed reading it quite a lot.  The issue I have is not the message, but that it ignores the social reality that whether or not it was slavery, it doesn't acknowledge that for several decades for many parts of the country this was not the narrative that was put forward.  To clarify- sometimes the truth does not matter.  What matters is what people believe is true.  There are several thousand people (currently and historically) who would claim and believe that it was all about the power of individual states above all else.  This is true.  Is their interpretation or belief one that I agree with? No, I do not.  The point is that history is not just about knowing facts, it is about observing the different reflections and interpretations of what has happened over time.  What John did here was treat history like a science textbook- trying to just state something as a fact and ignore the conversation (the evolution, let's say) of how the Civil War has been treated and dealt with.  If he wanted to be of some use he would have put some of this historiography on his website.  He has stated his thesis (which I tend to agree with) and supported it, nothing more.  The problem is he has not defended it, which in this situation is paramount and important because of all the baggage that surrounds this discussion.  He has done half of the work that is necessary."
nerdfighters,3cxo0o,hungrycaterpillar,4,Sun Jul 12 01:04:49 2015 UTC,"My purpose in linking that article was exactly what you're calling for... a refutation of the false claim that slavery was merely a secondary cause of the war.  You say he has stated his thesis without defending it.  I am attempting to further a defense.  People who gloss over the primary sources of history in order to further a convenient myth miss the mark on more than interpretation... these are facts, as solid and incontrovertible as any science.  Interpretations come and go, but as long as the primary source documents remain, the positions they reveal are as close to true facts as can be posited.  This website is essentially a way of dealing with a difficult subject matter with some humor.  It's not historiographically dense because it doesn't need to be.  He leaves the historiography to people like Coates; probably because it would be redundant.  Whats more, I would argue that it does not in any way ignore the narrative.  Rather, it is a direct response, in no uncertain terms... a ridiculing of the lie of the noble lost cause."

I don't think it reflects on him well that he is doing just as poor a job as the others who he is mocking with this site.    As I said, I am not going to be thrilled to have to wade through the students telling me they know what happened because they Google ""was the civil war about slavery"" and because of this url, it's going to easily be in the top 5.  It is not helpful.  If you want to make a joke, make a post or do a video, and make it quite clear.  Don't use a domain which is only going to give actual educators head aches in the future."

Proper sources and citations are good, and reductionist arguments are seldom helpful.  That being said, however, I just can't agree that John is out of line.  He is speaking directly , as simply as possible, on a subject of historical importance which has become topically central in current events.  It is precisely because of the mountain of misinformation about the causes of the war and the nature of American racism that this direct, no-nonsense statement of fact is necessary.  It is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in this country that such a simple statement would possibly be considered controversial; but it's not John's mission to answer every asinine argument that Southern apologists make for the historical treason in defense of slavery.  The bottom line: he's not wrong.

Of course, it wasn't just a chattle issue. It was also an issue of economics. If farmers suddenly didn't have access to cheap and/or free labor, well, that's gonna be a big change for them, and we saw a lot of fortunes dry up in an afternoon once the war ended. Especially as the North was unwilling to offer any assistance in rebuilding in light of the damage caused. Granted, this wasn't nearly the damage that we see in modern wars, what with massive explosives not being the constant and all, and no tanks, but we still saw destruction, and that was destruction no one was willing to help fix once all was said and done. Basically in their loss, the south was left with a lot of burned out buildings, a lot of salted farms, and not a lot of economic stability after the fact. Which only served to make them resentful. We've seen this sort of thing happen a lot actually, when a culture or group is suddenly pushed out of their norm, while also being pushed full-force into poverty. We should consider ourselves among the lucky here in the US, as when it happened in Iraq, well, we wound up with ISIS, and when it happened in Germany, we ended up with the Nazi party.   Hopefully these things can teach us to, as a nation, have a bit more grace in our victories. Some wars definitely need to be fought, but when you leave a people with nothing, and show no willingness to help them pick up the pieces, you create a disenfranchised, potentially violent powderkeg that can go, for lack of a better term, tits-up at any given time.

nerdfighters,3cxo0o,GeorgeTheWild,6,Tue Jul 14 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"Secession definitely occurred because the southern eliete wanted to make sure that they could continue to own slaves.  If John had said ""secession was about slavery"", then I would whole heartedly agree with him.    However, the  civil war itself is more complicated than that and resists such a black and white view.  Tailors and iron workers in the north didn't take up arms to just free the slaves in the south.  Rather the states of the north were fighting to preserve the union regardless of the motivations of the southerners who seceeded.  Slavery wasn't even universally abolished in the union until the ratification of the 13th amendment at the end of 1865.  The much heralded emancipation proclamation only freed slaves in confederate territory that was not under Union control so slavery persisted in the border states that hadn't seceeded until the 13th amendment.  The armies of the south were mostly filled with the ranks of poor whites who didn't own slaves.  The possibility of one day being able to own a slave was not the only motivation and may not have been the primary motivation for them taking up arms against their brothers and cousins in the north.  TLDR: secession was about slavery; why the populace of each side chose to fight a brutal war after secession is more complicated.  Edit: secession not succession"

nerdfighters,3cxo0o,typicaliconoclast,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"The possibility of owning slaves was one factor. But don't forget about the social ladders. As long as there are slaves, the poor white tennant farmers were not the bottom rung of society. Also the end of slavery meant more black people competing for jobs. Much of that same reasoning is why segregation came about after the war. Plus, how often do the opinions of the poor actually affect war declarations (or secessions in this case)?  The emancipation proclamation ensured that the war was about slavery for the north as well. Beforehand, the north pursued the 'rose water' strategy which meant to appease he south. Emancipation was a threat, either end the war by January or the the war becomes about slavery and will end for anyone still in rebellion, that is precisely why he border states plus Tennessee and Louisiana were excluded- they were no longer fighting. The war was about slavery for the north too. Maybe for border state unionists from 1861-63 the war was about other things, but for all others, it was about slavery."
nerdfighters,3cxo0o,InevitablyPerpetual,3,Sun Jul 12 06:06:15 2015 UTC,"It's also important to consider the economics of it all. Areas in the south prospered almost entirely on their cotton and other crops. Slaves go away, and all that prosperity goes with them, and because the south wasn't big on diversifying their economic profile, that meant they pretty much went from a well established, safe, secure, relatively rich place to live, to a complete poorhouse, in the eyes of the people of the south, especially those that were on the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder. Prices would spike, income would drop, and the entire southern economy would crash. Which, as it turns out, it did."
nerdfighters,3cxo0o,InevitablyPerpetual,2,Sun Jul 12 11:13:21 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how often this is a common thread in wars involving liberating a people. Remember that prior to WWII, America was Also pretty bad in their treatment of Jews, and even long After WWII, they were still pretty bad in how they treated gays and lesbians, just as most of Europe was and indeed Is still pretty bad in how they treat Romani peoples, all of whom we mobilized to save in WWII.  The rallying call of doing something good doesn't necessarily stop a person from doing bad things, I'm afraid. I imagine that there were plenty of localized propaganda pushes regarding the south as well, similar to those in WWI and WWII, that basically made them out to be the big bad evil, as many people even in the north wouldn't be swayed solely by ""They have slaves and we shouldn't do that""."
nerdfighters,3cxo0o,whatstheonething,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:03:46 2015 UTC,"I find arguments about why the North was fighting a bit distracting. Mainly because that's the argument I was taught as a young person growing up in the South. That the North hadn't abolished slavery and didn't care about slavery all that much and certainly didn't get involved in the war to stop slavery. You can certainly find evidence for much of that in the words of Northern leaders, but it's beside the point. That is usually brought up by people who ignore all the words of all the Southern leaders making it quite clear that their central cause was slavery. The North may have fought to preserve the Union, but the Union was only threatened because the South was willing to fight to preserve slavery. Also, there's something very deceptive going on in claims like ""slavery wasn't even universally abolished in the Union until...the end of 1865"". While this is strictly correct, we should note that the Northern states had all abolished slavery before 1800. It's just that there were a couple of slave states who weren't willing to secede and go to war for it. That two of the existing slave states weren't as extreme as the others doesn't change that the others were extreme.  As to why the people who had no real interest in the preservation of slavery fought, the simple fact is that the poor who make up the bulk of every army have always fought because they've been told to and usually because they've been lied to. And in many cases, because they had no choice because wars will sweep up anyone who is in their path and either kill them, destroy their livelihoods, or force them to fight (usually a combination)."

In addition to Disney, California congresswoman Mary Bono (Sonny Bono's widow and Congressional successor), and the estate of composer George Gershwin supported the act. Mary Bono, speaking on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, said:  Actually, Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever. I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the Constitution. ... As you know, there is also [then-MPAA president] Jack Valenti's proposal for term to last forever less one day. Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress.

However, and not trying to move the goal posts on your argument, I'd point out as a new argument, that I believe myths 2 and 4 stem from a level of unfairness, in the restriction of fair use. The point of patents is truly to improve society as a whole, not to protect property rights. Restricting the use of the products, of a self reproducing product seems unfair. It's like selling the plans to a chair design, but limiting the carpenter to only producing one. It may be legally within their rights, but it does not make the world a better place."

I don't really see what ""self-reproducing"" has to do with it.  You can't get a field full of GMOs unless you intentionally isolate them, harvest them, and replant their seeds or, if you're a company, intentionally isolate the same gene from the plants and insert them in your own plants.  You'll never just happen to get a field full of GMOs on by happenstance.

Also, once you got there, how where you going to monetize space? Trans-oceanic cables, high altitude photography, weather balloons, networks of radio towers, all can solve the same issues cheaper, with less risk. They where good enough, compared to the cost of space.

I like John and Hank and I feel like I have an inherent trust in them. They're familiar voices and feel like community members as much as teachers. I also really enjoyed WheezyWaiter in government and politics and Stan in intellectual property. To learn things. I'm really enjoying the growth into more specialized topics since I already have a biology/chemistry education from high school and university. More series with varied topics and instructors. I'm curious what the supplemental materials will look like and how they'll be distributed. I wasn't aware of it although I did know about SciShow Kids (through Animal Wonders). More equation-heavy courses will be a difficult topic. They would have to change the format from person-focused to paper/whiteboard focused. They managed a few equations in chemistry using the clear whiteboard thing but explaining physics (in mathematical terms) or calculus would require much more. There's also a dearth of channels covering physics even if it's not in a structured curriculum.
nerdfighters,3csgj9,hydrohawke,3,Fri Jul 10 14:35:10 2015 UTC,I hated astronomy and government when they started. They're now my two favorite hosts. I love seeing Phil get excited about how crazy big and amazing the universe is. The sense of wonder carries over after a few and you realize he's trying to share it like a gift. It started working for me then.

nerdfighters,3csgj9,thekingofwintre,2,Tue Jul 14 07:58:26 2015 UTC,"Astronomy's bugged me too, though I'm not entirely sure what it is about Plait's delivery that doesn't sit well. The content is great, and I like Plait's writing. But Astronomy's just, ehhh. I didn't expect to like either G&P or IP, but they've turned out pretty well I thought. WeezyWaiter's style is great, and IP's a lot more down-to-earth useful than I thought it would be. I like that they play to each hosts' strengths and personality as a presenter, rather than try to keep too even a format and style. Definitely agree. It'll be interesting to see how much math they bring into physics. There's actually a lot of physics content on YouTube here and there, but it's largely high-level, ""gut"" understanding kind of stuff. (Shout out to my favorite physics channel though, Look Glass Universe, who covers some pretty heavy math.)"
nerdfighters,3csgj9,faboo978,5,Fri Jul 10 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"I like World History and U.S. History, though Astonomy is close to the top of my list too. Biology moved really, really fast, but was wonderfully informative. John Green is my favorite host, I think because he comes off as the most casual/best actor. It doesn't feel like he's reciting a script, so much as just having a conversation with you about the topic at hand. I watch crash course because it's my best option to continue my education. My job makes it difficult for me to accommodate the schedule needed for community college courses, and the classroom style structure of class course gives me a good primer on a given topic, which I can then use as a jumping off point for independent research. I can already see crash course evolving into a more high level production with Crash Course Economics.  I expect we'll see more of this in the future, though I'd caution against letting things get too ""flashy"" - the clean, simple format is one of the things I really like about the show. I don't have kids, thus, haven't checked it out. Though educating children in the style of crash course sounds like a great way to supplement the often dismal state of public ""teach to the test"" education. I have tremendous confidence in the team's ability to break down difficult, traditionally difficult/boring concepts and make them interesting and understandable. To that end, I would LOVE to see a Crash Course Mathematics at some point. Those of us who got a lousy math education in high school could really benefit from a program that starts with basic arithmetic concepts, and follows those concepts all the way through to advanced ones, such calculus and trig. It wouldn't have to be 100% comprehensive... just explain enough to enable students to do independent research on their own. Given the horrific way math is taught in school, and Crash Course's record of making dry content engaging, I think you guys could do a fantastic job with this."
nerdfighters,3csgj9,iAmErickson,2,Fri Jul 10 16:42:34 2015 UTC,Reading your comment just gave me a new idea. Rather than a more equation-based math course it would be interesting if they covered logic. IMO the biggest missing factor of high school math curricula is the idea of theorems and proofs. Students get thrown from very concrete problems to the more abstract things with little transition.   This could be handled in a more verbal format and has applications in a lot of fields.
nerdfighters,3csgj9,hydrohawke,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks kind of what I was thinking. It seems to me that the reason so few people can pay attention in math class is because they all generally go ""here's how you sole this type of problem - now do it 100 times!"" There's no application of knowledge, so it gets forgotten as soon as the task is completed. If they covered why things work the way they do - maybe spent the first half of the episode talking about the theory, and the second half talking about practical, real-world applications, I expect it would stick in people's heads a lot better. Give people some context; a reason to remember the theory, and they'll actually remember it."
nerdfighters,3csgj9,iAmErickson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"I'll second math as being difficult. The CC Patreon points out Physics as difficult, and while it might difficult to present, modern physics actually breaks down into topics pretty well. Math, on the other hand, is a right mess. Fortunately, a lot of the really interesting stuff doesn't require you know number-crunching math like calculus and algebra. Set theory, graph theory, geometry, category theory - all that's pretty self-contained, but how do you figure out what to cover?  (This, I've long thought, is why math in (American, anyway) public school sucks - it's all the math that makes for good physicists and accountants, but not for good mathematicians.)  edit: formatting"
nerdfighters,3csgj9,faboo978,3,Fri Jul 10 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"I've been going through the Copyright & Intellectual Property Crash Course. I was pretty excited when I heard they were doing one of those, and was curious to see Stan as the host. I was just a little disappointed. I know IP and copyright law isn't the most interesting thing in the world, but it is something that interests me, and I thought it could have been a little more engaging than I felt it ended up being. However, that always could have just been me not investing myself as much as I thought I did.  So basically, for direct answers to your questions:   Don't think IP is as good as it could be. Stan's not my favorite. It seems like Stan is an awesome producer though (I don't want to sell him short in case he reads this lol)! So yeah, it's John. I'm a college grad with a full time job. So I'm not cramming for a test, and I don't really need any of them info in my line of work, I just watch whatever courses I'm interested in. Official school course curriculum for teachers to use to aid their lesson plans. Never watched CC Kids I would love a Crash Course: Communication Studies (I have a degree in Mass Communication). I'm just not sure how much widespread interest there would be, so who knows if they will ever produce that. I would find it interesting, at least. It would help me stay brushed up on my communication theory in case I ever decide to go back to school and become a comm professor.   EDIT: formatting"
nerdfighters,3csgj9,cmcsalmon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"I honestly had pretty low expectations for IP, but ended up like Stan as a presenter. He's got a nice voice and a casual humor that worked well for the topic, I thought. More time in front of the camera and I think he could be really good. I can see how you could be disappointed though if you were particularly excited about."
nerdfighters,3csgj9,faboo978,3,Fri Jul 10 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't been watching most of them lately. I really liked Crash Course History and Crash Course Chemistry at the beginning, and I think they're really well done, but it's not really new and useful material to me so I stopped spending the time on them.  So now Astronomy is my favorite, partly because it's not something I've ever taken a course in before, so while I do already know a lot of it, I'm also learning a lot and systemetizing what I know so it's more than just trivia.  John's still my favorite host though. Should really have left that question as just: why is it John Green ;-)  Because I just really like his delivery on factual material and his sense of humor.   But I like Phil Plait a lot, too, and Hank of course. But then, I just named all the hosts I've watched do Crash Course.  I watch for entertainment value, but I figured out that it's limited when it's a subject you've already taken a number of classes in because it is so much of a 101 level overview. Astronomy i watch because I really want to learn more about it.  I wonder if they'll do some mathematics. I know there are a lot of math videos out there, but I haven't seen any that are an entry level course in a specific topic and entertainingly done the way Crash Course is. I think a crash course algebra, crash course trigonometry, crash course calculus, and most especially, crash course probability and statistics would be great, but also really hard to do.  I haven't watched crash course kids or gotten my kids into it. They weren't interested in the first one at the time. They recently decided they like SciShow Kids, so I may go back and try them with Crash Course again, because I really like the idea."
nerdfighters,3csgj9,mylittlesoapbox,2,Fri Jul 10 15:37:11 2015 UTC,Son 13 enjoyed Psychology the most. Son 11 says World History. My favorite so far is Astronomy. Though I think the most useful of late has been Government as it dovetailed nicely with some internal house discussion.  I don't have a specific favorite mostly because the hosts are appealing to personal interests areas which make them each very good at presenting their subject.  I'm a learning nerd. And it also supplements my children's education which we are handling ourselves. In particular with World History it's been interesting to pair our curriculum with the course because the perspectives are quite different. Not really sure but I hope they continue to expand the areas they cover and even revisit old courses to add to them in particular with the supplemental materials to help us deepen even further our understanding of a topic. We haven't had a chance to view them. Typically we start watching again in September after taking the summer off. We are always behind on the newest content. Though I may make a specific effort to catch Econ as it's happening.  Physics would be a challenge. Philosophy as well. Geography & Cultures though that would be interesting to see how they would handle.   *edit typing error
nerdfighters,3csgj9,faboo978,2,Fri Jul 10 16:56:54 2015 UTC,"World History 1 is still my favorite. I really like the format. I don't think it'd work well for the science-y CC's, but it works really well for history. And there was so much in WH1 that I just had never heard before. Probably John? Which is interesting because I generally prefer Hank's Vlogbrothers posts over John's. It's hard to find good documentaries on Netflix. Probably more topics, at a minimum. Hopefully more partnerships like the one with PBS that can help increase their reach beyond us habitual YouTube watchers. Solid content and a Sabrina's good host. Some of the stuff they cover (like ""properties"") is unnecessarily old school IMO, but I'm totally cool recommending it to my kid and nieces and nephews. I'll echo /u/iAmErickson: physics and math. It would be really good for them to cover the algebra and calculus involved in physics, but that'll be tough to do given the format. I've got faith though :)   I would love a Crash Course: African History. Africa was seriously neglected in my formal education, and what's covered in World History is really interesting. Something more comprehensive would be great."
nerdfighters,3csgj9,JAG4444,2,Fri Jul 10 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"I like both brothers equally as hosts but I enjoy the science courses a bit more. I know that they're trying to expand, but I like the brothers more than the other hosts. The only host I really dislike is the government one."

nerdfighters,3csgj9,TBB11,2,Sat Jul 11 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"I would love to watch a Crash Course Philosophy, however you really need someone who knows there stuff for that. Philosophy is such a huge subject that it would be difficult to know where to begin (do you go chronologically? Or introduce different ideas? Go for different philosophical topics or arguments? ect.). Like I say, I would love this as a course but I don't know if it is realistic."
nerdfighters,3csgj9,Taugreatergood,2,Fri Jul 10 23:49:20 2015 UTC,1.World and US History because I like the style and I am interested in the subject.   John because he had the right mix of seriousness and humor that made me like the show. entertainment perpouses.   4.Crash Course applied thermodynamics   I am an adult   6.Philosophy because it is really subjective.
nerdfighters,3csgj9,thekingofwintre,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"1) I mostly enjoyed world history, both seasons. I never got into either biology or chemistry, mostly I guess because I didn't finish high school (not american) and even the introductory episodes went right over my head.  2) John Green.   3) Because it's a fun way to learn new things.   4) Not gonna speculate.  5) Haven't watched.  6) Gender studies, probably.

Right now you are judging people on shit that has nothing to do with you, whether your judging is positive or negative is irrelevant.  What you need to understand is that people's thoughts/feelings/choices for themselves are their own, and you have no right to judge.

I decided that you're a bigot if you discriminate against someone that is born with a ""type"", rather than making a conscious choice.  So, being trans or black or French is not a choice, you're just born that way.  It isn't fair, or right, or sensible to discriminate against them.  You need, and really want, to treat all people equally in that respect.  If someone is a Yankees fan, though, they've chosen that.  Feel free to discriminate!  Of course, that's not strictly true, since really any discrimination isn't going to be a good thing.  Your religion is effectively a choice, childhood aside, and discriminating against someone for that isn't good either.

Either way, he brought a bunch of diseases and everyone died. Then, later, England was like ""hm, I wonder what's over there and also our Queen isn't religious enough"" and went and again, everyone died, but the land was fertile and the English were lazy so they enslaved a bunch of people and brought them over to the new fancy fertile land.

So, the roles available to women are already usually limited to supporting roles, except for in niche ""chick flicks"" or dramas set in female dominated society. Of course, the reason for all of that is systematic sexism throughout the ages, but it's a pretty good explanation for why there are fewer women in film.

Their desire to maximize profit is much stronger than their desire for artistic integrity or equality or whatever.  That's why I'm inclined to believe that if Hollywood (as a huge group of producers who want to make money) makes almost exclusively films with white leads, then that's probably where the money is.  Again, I have no proof for this, but I kind of trust the fact that rich producers are going to go wherever the money is. Don't you think?  I realize this is kind of a chicken-and-egg argument, producers don't make non-white films because they don't make money, and thus non-white films don't exist so you can't know whether they make money, etc. but I just think that from the perspective of the business men behind these choices, there is no reason to step outside of ""safe"" films to make. Right now, I'm guessing that Hollywood looks like this because to them, those safe films are the ones with white leads.

And secondly I can't refute that this could be a major determining factor in the actor selection process. But I like to hope that other people aren't as caught up in seeing race as a barrier that they can't make a connection to a character in a movie who isn't the same race as they are, because if this is the case how far have we really come in society from segregating people just because of their race.   Personally I'm an optimist though and I like to believe that this isn't a major determining factor, and that it shouldn't matter what race is presented on the screen and that people will relate to them regardless."
nerdfighters,3cmnq9,Dynamite86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:06:58 2015 UTC,"People will relate to them for sure. It's not that huge of a difference, but it has been shown that the speed and consistency with which people make connections with fictional characters depends greatly on how much they resemble themselves. Why are all video game heroes, 20-30 something white guys with brown hair? Because the majority of action game players are 20-30 something white guys, usually with brown hair. It's not impossible for a white 20 year old guy to connect with a gay transgender teen Asian, but that surface level connection, where you see the poster and think ""That could be me."" isn't there.

nerdfighters,3cmnq9,Dynamite86,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with hollywood's stupidity and ignorance to roles that are cast (your example Tonto). But if you take into consideration the number of available white actors when compared to the number of black/ hispanic/ asian/ whatever race actors (especially if some of them are related) then it'd be immensely more difficult to cast a movie in the Middle East using all actors of the correct nationality.   This doesn't excuse the abhorrent disproportions we see though, and I'm not arguing against that there is a problem with racism in this country. I'm arguing that cherry picking movies where most of the roles are of interrelated persons then almost all casting directors will choose to take the easy way out and cast white actors to those roles because of that is the race that would have the most candidates available, thus the easiest to pick from. But in other movies where there are no interrelations between characters I give no excuse and that's just Hollywood making a muck of things."

If you want to look at a global population then half of Hollywood's cast should be Chinese and Indian.  Actors/ actresses in Hollywood are most likely to come from America. Why you may ask; it's because Hollywood is in America and it's easier for people who already live in the country to go to Hollywood and audition for the parts.   Imagine how much more difficult it would be trying to cast a movie that accurately reflects the global demographics when the country you're casting in has demographics that greatly differ from those on a global level.

nerdfighters,3cmnq9,Dynamite86,2,Fri Jul 10 02:29:20 2015 UTC,"Please go back and re-read my comment, because you missed the main point that it's all a game of statistics. Let's say you're a Hollywood casting director who has just been assigned to TFIOS movie production. You know there are two main characters, but as I said previously if you randomly selected two people from the population there would be a 56% chance both of them are white. The next round of supporting characters are their parents, whom (as I said before) should have the same traits as their children to be easily identifiable by the crowd. This means that if you made the decision to make one of them another race you would also have to make at least on of their parents that race as well, which would considerably cut the number of potential actors down. But don't take my word for it I'll show you the math on how much smaller of a population you'd be looking at if you decided to make either Hazel or Gus another race and only changed one of their parents' race as well.   Again I'll be using the US census as a baseline for available actor populations along with the assumption that the actors are picked randomly from the population.  Hispanic: 0.1710.171= 0.029241 or  2.9241% chance both candidates would be Hispanic/ Latino Black: 0.1320.132= 0.017424 or 1.7424% chance both candidates would be Black Asian: 0.0530.053= 0.002809 or .2809% both candidates would be Asian   So tell me casting director which will you choose one of the pools with significantly lower actors in an effort to ensure racial equality; or will you take the easy way out, keep the intended shooting schedule, and not get fired for holding up production. Because I know which option I would choose. If you'd like to refute my claim as to any of these numbers remember 3 things: first that I assumed the candidates were individuals randomly selected from the population, second keeping canon wasn't a factor, and third people will almost always take the easiest way out if given the opportunity (or as my old teacher said ""when you're managing a group of people you must make a task convenient for them to do, otherwise it won't get done"")."

Those rules were basically not to argue with simple math or statistics (including those of workplace environments).

I admit that I have watched the whole ACDC Econ course Mr. Clifford has on his channel and therefore I feel way more familiar with him, but that doesn't mean the criticism is because sexism.

Organisms with tetrachromacy are called tetrachromats.  In tetrachromatic organisms, the sensory color space is four-dimensional, meaning that to match the sensory effect of arbitrarily chosen spectra of light within their visible spectrum requires mixtures of at least four primary colors.  Tetrachromacy is demonstrated among several species of birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles and insects.   It was also the normal condition of most mammals in the past; a genetic change made the majority of species of this class eventually lose two of their four cones.

It is very easy to push a pointed embroidery needle through (not the blunt tip cross stitch needles).

The non crazy  parts of the church that view homosexually acts as sinful don't differentiate between it and other sexual sins (like pre-marital sex)... or usually  even between it and other sins in general from a theological perspective."

nerdfighters,3c2h1s,ComedicUsernameHere,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"This really depends on how you want to parse things. Most major Christian denominations believe that if you accept Christ as your savior you can be forgiven for nearly any sin and thus gain acceptance into heaven. But they also mostly believe that homosexuality is a sin (and if anyone wants to claim that it's only homosexual acts that are a sin, I'd point them toward Matthew 5:28), and most believe that if you are unrepentant of your sin, there's no forgiveness. Therefore, if you're gay and you aren't basically eaten up with guilt over it and don't believe you're doing anything wrong, then they believe you are going to hell. This is, admittedly, a bit sweeping, but barring a deep theological discussion, it's pretty accurate."

nerdfighters,3c2h1s,AngriestBird,2,Tue Jul 7 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"Jesus is clearly saying that you don't have to act on your desires to have sinned, simply having the desires is just as bad as acting on them. That's what that verse means."
nerdfighters,3c2h1s,Salanmander,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:43:09 2015 UTC,Setting aside that lust isn't any physical attraction. What does it have to do with homosexuality? Wouldn't that verse apply just as much to heterosexual people.
nerdfighters,3c2h1s,SJWDFTBA,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course it applies just as much to heterosexual people.  But wait a second here, because I'm not entirely sure I understand your line of questioning here. I should make very clear that this is a statement about teachings of Christian denominations, not about what I believe. I don't believe homosexuality is a sin. I don't even believe in sin in the first place."
nerdfighters,3c2h1s,AngriestBird,3,Tue Jul 7 20:07:10 2015 UTC,"I feel that Hank isn't difficult enough on Christianity here. Even the most liberal, non literal readings have extremely troubling elements.   The OT God destroyed cities. Even in a non literal reading that isn't an example of tolerance. It's troubling. Now some cite that the destruction of sodom was primarily for them being selfish and not helping the poor, not homosexuality, but still. Thats. Not. Tolerance. Nevermind the slavery passages. The new testament God endorses his own divisiveness and eternal punishment (for finite ""crimes""). Again. Not. Tolerant.   Please watch this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En8UnYTfZTY&ab_channel=TheAtheistVoice  Now don't take this personally - most Christians I meet are mostly awesome people.

I have a lot of problems with some of the things Paul wrote, and that's not even old testament. A thing to remember is that Christians relate to the bible very differently as well.

I think moderate Christians need to have a conversation with conservative Christians. This is particularly an issue because - I live in the South. They are not like John Green.  On the issue of the troubling elements, if we have to acknowledge the problems, then I don't see how that is compatible with saying the Bible is the (divinely inspired) book, instead of a book. As a nerd fighter I'm all for reading books, especially reading (or watching debates) widely - something I don't think is done nearly enough.   If you explore buddhism, utilitarianism or watch these Harvard lectures on justice: http://www.justiceharvard.org, you will see that many ideas, while none perfect, are built from the ground up without the troubling elements seen in Christianity, or in some cases, less or no unfalsifiable claims."
nerdfighters,3c2h1s,drapollo,5,Sun Jul 5 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"That wasn't the point and it doesn't matter how typical an argument is. You should be putting pressure on the non-liberal denominations instead of replying with an apologetic about how the liberal denominations are somewhat reformed and therefore non literal.  Since I wasn't clear enough, I'll say it again.   Even a liberal non-literal reading should disturb a reasonable and compassionate human being.  Too bad in the south a ton of these literalists exist. I've talked to them. There absolutely is a connection between religious texts and how people behave. http://www.patheos.com/blogs/americanbuddhist/2015/04/in-supporting-same-sex-marriage-buddhists-are-1-sort-of.html  It's time to admit it plainly."

If you're implying that I didn't mention the good things about religion - thats fine, I'll be glad to say there is. However, that's irrelevant to the original topic - if Christianity inherently has intolerant, unacceptable elements.   Third, I stick to my statements. Eternal punishment for finite crimes absolutely is not a compassionate or reasonable punishment. Neither is destroying a city. These actions, even if non literal, are examples of extreme unjustified intolerance. That is what you have to defend. Can you please give a specific argument, in what context is this okay? These are not overly broad statements; they have various specific correlated verses, such as Matthew 25:46. They are facts. This is not a religious studies assignment. That's irrelevant. It's less painful to say that my statements are too broad, or that I would fail a hypothetical assignment with no defined parameters - than to give a specific argument defending cruelty (there isn't any).

Confabulation is distinguished from lying as there is no intent to deceive and the person is unaware the information is false.  Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can also seem to be coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal.  Individuals who confabulate present incorrect memories ranging from ""subtle alterations to bizarre fabrications"",  and are generally very confident about their recollections, despite contradictory evidence.  Most known cases of confabulation are symptomatic of brain damage or dementias, such as aneurysm, Alzheimer's disease, or Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (a common manifestation of thiamine deficiency caused by alcoholism).

I'm not sure it's correct to say that believing gay people are going to hell is inherently intolerant, though. ""Tolerate"" means   1.    allow the existence, occurrence, or practice of (something that one dislikes or disagrees with) without interference.    So, if you're saying ""I love and accept you as a person but am of the belief that God will punish you for it"", the second half of that sentence is the ""something that one ... disagrees with"", in that you don't believe it's going to end well for them. The fact that such people (at least the group that Hank is addressing) may ""allow the existence, occurrence, or practice of ... [homosexuality]"" whilst still thinking they'll ""go to hell"" for it shows that it is 100% possible that they're being tolerant.  Again, I don't really think it's nice or beneficial to an individual's wellbeing, nor do I approve of it happening, I'm just a fan of using the right words in the right context."

nerdfighters,3c2h1s,frizbee2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:22:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps this is because I'm missing the rather crucial context of that picture, but I don't see anything interferent in those people's actions. If we, for a time, ignore the message they're promoting and focus solely on their actions, they appear to be rather passive in their promotion of their message (and, just to cover my bases, yes, chanting is a rather passive activity). They don't appear to be obstructing any public activity, and they don't appear to be attempting to gain attention at the expense of others attempting to go about their business. As a result, what I see is some pretty textbook peaceable assembly. Again, if I'm wrong about these circumstances, please correct me, but that's what I've gotten from what I've been given.  I struggle to see how any organized group of people fitting the bill of ""peaceable assembly"" could also be considered to be, in some way, interfering with some other person through anything other than their message. Again, as  I stated before, if we provide exception to the message they're promoting, these people don't seem to be doing anything in any way interferent to anyone else. Cover up the signs and they're not doing much of anything, after all.  If we can reasonably conclude all of the above, and I believe we can, then if we are to categorize the actions of these people as interferent in some way we must do so because of the message they are spreading. Here, specifically, is where my disagreement with your assertion that the actions of those people is somehow interferent comes from. I'll confess, I'm not a homosexual, but I cannot fathom how anyone, including homosexuals, could possibly claim that simply receiving such a message somehow causes interference in their lives. Aristotle is often quoted ""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."" Although his sentiment may indeed be correct, he was, unfortunately, incorrect in his wording. All people, by virtue of their consciousness and free thought, are able to entertain a thought without accepting it, the educated simply do so regularly. Because of this, if you hear a message from some peaceful protesters and, despite your efforts (or, in this case, lack thereof), receiving that message causes some form of interference in your life, I'd conclude that the issue lies with you, not with the protesters."

The real issue that many mods want to convey is that admin doesn't communicate with the community, and take advantage of the mods who are all volunteering their time to keep the site running.

nerdfighters,3bzvc2,Dynamite86,2,Fri Jul 3 16:19:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you but -- at least these days -- the president does have a lot of power. Executive agencies and orders, vetoes, and command of the armed forces are all important powers the president has. In fact, presidents can even bypass Congress and effectively go to war (see: Korea, Vietnam)"
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,SalsaHavaldorf,3,Fri Jul 3 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"The president has the power to appoint or remove individuals to executive agencies, but he can't control what they do directly; instead if someone were to do something he didn't like he could appoint someone else to that position in an effort to retract whatever was changed.  If the president wants to pass an executive order he must have a basis for doing so that is either approved by congress, or supported by the constitution (which congress basically controls).   But then the logical argument that would follow is the president has the power to veto any proposal made by congress; but there are quite a few ways to bypass a presidential veto. The most well known is of course is both the house and senate pass with 2/3 then he can't do anything; as well as certain conditions which depending on the president's location and status could also allow congress to pass a bill without him having the power of veto.  Command of the armed forces can be a little tricky, there is a limit to what a president can accomplish within the domain of ""control"", and the final decision of how much control (and what he can do with it) is left to congress. With this president can almost always position troops wherever he likes, but without a declaration of war his powers are limited; and take a guess at who holds the right to declare war (hint: it's congress).   However the is one (actually two, but I'm going to ignore the patriot act because it's filled with statements that are open for interpretation) way that the president can go outside of congress and flex his power. Those conditions are if the citizens of the country are under an imminent threat from an attacking force the president has the power to take executive command and assume control.   So let's make a list of powers the president actually has.   Be commander in Chief of the military and navy forces when called into service. Which as I mentioned congress greatly control this power. Have the power to grant reprieves and pardons (this is actually one power he can flex). *Require the head of any executive department to give him their opinion on the specific field that their associated with. (basically the same people he appoints he can then ask their opinion in the field he appointed them to) Make treaties (this is another of the presidents larger powers) Give unto congress the state of the union (which is a fancy way of saying he can give congress his opinion on matters for their consideration) During a recess of the senate he has the power to fill all vacancies. (which was important when it took a senator from a state like Arizona 3 weeks to get to the capitol, but in modern times where you can get anywhere in the world in under a day in the time it would take him to make the appointment the senator could already be back) *Nominate and appoint ambassadors, supreme court judges, and all other officers of the US. (I touched on this previously he can only appoint them after that it's their decision) Receive ambassadors, and other prime ministers. (""Hello, welcome to The White House I'm the president."") Commission all officers of the US. (another one of his real powers) Take care that laws be faithfully executed. (congress decides what the laws are) Adjourning congress (if congress either can't do anything or decides on a specific time to adjourn the president can force or enforce an adjournment) And finally as I mentioned before in extraordinary circumstance he can convene either or both houses (the congressman can't go home until he says they can, or until a decision is made ending the extraordinary circumstance)   That's it, if you look at what it says on paper there isn't very much. However the reason the president is the most powerful man on the planet isn't because of what it says on paper; it's because it looks really bad if congress goes against him. And if they did then they would in a way be committing professional suicide because whichever party backed them would probably drop them like a lead brick at the next election season. So if the president says ""Everyone deserves equal rights and that entitle marriage as well."" then he uses one of his aforementioned smaller powers to grant this to federal workers in the executive branch then congress has little choice but to approve it because going against the face that represents the US isn't a healthy option.  Also I apologize for the length politics is extremely complicated, and filled with many complications."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,Dynamite86,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"The president has the power to appoint or remove individuals to executive agencies, but he can't control what they do directly;    Neither can the CEO of a private company. The power to fire is a very reliable proxy for the power to get people to do what they want. If you feel otherwise, go find your boss and tell him you're not showing up for work for a few days because you don't feel like it."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,Smallpaul,3,Sat Jul 4 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, I can't dispute the logic of ""you do nothing and you'll get fired"" but I like to believe that's common sense. That's why I stated (multiple times) that the president can't unilaterally control the actions or motivations of the people he appoints.   This lack of direct control seemed to be confusing, so allow me to illuminate with an analogy. Imagine you're the owner of a small successful bed and breakfast, and so because the first was a success you decide to open a second. Now you quickly realize that you are incapable of running two bed and breakfasts by yourself, so you decide to hire a manager to manage the first one when you're not around. If that manager were to be given a large sum of money and told ""instead of serving blueberry pancakes serve your guests rat poison pancakes and there will be more money"" and the manager were to agree then guests would start getting sick (yes I know no sane person would serve guests rat poison pancakes, but Donald Trump is running for president so I feel safe to say that there are some crazy people in the world). After your guests began to get sick you would get word of it fairly quickly, from there you could then fire that manager and remedy the problem.  Now enlarge the scale at which the analogy is preformed (to use your comparison) you're now the very successful CEO of a private company that has 5,000 bed and breakfasts, but you've taken the time to appoint every one of the managers yourself (and thus only you can fire one of the managers). If one of the managers were to be given the same offer as before and decide to serve your guests rat poison pancakes there would be a much larger delay in the time it would take you to find this out (you're managing 4,999 other bed and breakfasts) thus it would take much longer to find and fire that manager when compared to the first analogy.  Now if I'm the head of [insert federal department here] and I set the regulations for [specific type of business] then it's not too hard to imagine that [a company] who works with [type of business] would want more lax regulations so they could make more money. So one day I'm approached by a kind looking stranger who says he's from [a company] and would like to give me and my family a vacation to Bermuda, but he then goes on to tell me he can't do that because the regulations I set are too strict. I may be tempted to loosen up a few of those regulations in order to receive my trip to Bermuda. But this isn't in the citizens greatest interest, so I'm technically not doing my job as originally intended when the president appointed me to my position.   This is why the president has no control over the people whom he appoints. Because if the president is in England meeting with the queen there is no one who can directly and instantaneously fire executive branch employees who act in ways just like I listed above.  They would still be working, but instead of for the people they would be working for their own agenda."

Basically, ""I am upset because of X"" is very different from ""I feel that XYZ needs to happen"". Heck, the ""shutdowns"" don't even have a deadline. For example, when websites went dark to protest SOPA, they did it for set amounts of time, to make a statement, but also continue to service users. A lot of the subreddits going dark right now are claiming that it is because they are having difficulties providing for us the users, but really, they're only shutting us off from content, but they're not affecting the reddit admins in any way whatsoever. Considering how important content creation and appreciation is t nerdfighteria, it would be completely backwards for r/nerdfighters to go dark.  edit: clarity"
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,Ramalama63,7,Fri Jul 3 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"Sad, yet to some extent, I understand why.  If the Admins were mistreating the Mods, (I'm not a Mod so I wouldn't know,) how else would they be able to get any kind of meaningful change, if not through flexing their collective muscle?  A site based on community can not treat that community poorly and expect it to remain loyal."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,jrayhiggins,8,Fri Jul 3 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"No need for a small subreddit to go dark. FWIW, I think discussing it everywhere has almost the same impact.  Revolt is exciting, but there's a lot of different interests in the reddit community so it's not like you can feel like you are allied with everyone who is protesting. Of course I have lots of sympathy for /u/chooter, who seems to be an awesome person."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,neutralinostar,6,Fri Jul 3 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a Nerdfighter and a moderator of /r/changemyview (for those who don't know, we have about 200k subscribers, and are a pretty heavily moderated sub.  My thoughts:  We didn't go dark- no one knows that really happened, and we would rather stay open for people wanting to discuss and debate what's going on rather than jump on a bandwagon.    Personally, I haven't had any issues with the admins.  There are things they could do to make things easier for us, and it is pretty silly that you need a third party extension (toolbox) in order to moderate effectively, but we do have it, so that's ok.  There have been some complaints on this thread about the power mods have.  Here's how I see it. Reddit offers free space for anyone who wants to open a bar/coffee shop/salon/art museum. If you have a good theme, and run it well. People will come and contribute.  If you're a jerk, they will leave.    There is also a TON of work involved in publicizing a sub that isn't obvious. By that, I mean that if you start r/startrek or r/randpaul people who are interested in that topic will find you.  But if it's r/showerthoughts or r/changemyview, it will take a lot more effort. (I came long after CMV was well established - none of the credit is mine - it's almost all u/snorrrlax).   So, you create a space, set the tone, keep it clean, publicize it, find others to help you run it according to your vision, and it becomes popular.   Then, some of the customers complain about the music you choose to play, or which are you decide fits the theme, or how you decide to deal with unruly visitors.    Now,remember that anyone who doesn't like it can get their own free space to mold exactly how they think it should be.  But, instead, the visitors think that because they really like the bar that they should get to make the decision, not the bar owner.  Of course, if the bar owner runs it badly, or turns it over to people who run it badly, the customers will and should leave.  But it should still be the owners right to run the bar he built into the ground if he so chooses.  I feel the same way about the admins. They gave us space on their servers.  They have an unquestionable right to do with them what they want - just as we, mods and users alike, have the right to leave if we don't like it."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,garnteller,4,Fri Jul 3 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"Mod/admin/ reddit management issues aside for a min -   We have no idea why she got fired. It might have been completely justified. It might not have been possible to give prior warning to anyone. People are seeing the best in her and the worst in the admins because (for some valid and some IMO not so valid reasons) they don't like the current administration.  We have no idea what happened. Not talking badly of your former employee or former employer is basic professionalism and respecting other people's privacy.   We have seen in the YouTube community how seemingly nice people can be awful. I'm not saying she DID do anything wrong but assume she got fired for 'no good reason' because she 'seemed so nice' is just silly. Could be the admins being power hungry dicks, could be that she did something to warrant getting immediately fired.  If she got fired because of a huge disagreement over reddit's future or similar then it's up to her to take a stand for that if she chooses to. If she doesn't come forward and do that then we shouldn't be jumping to conclusions."

What it comes down to is a power imbalance between a company and it’s community. The community is rebelling agains that power imbalance (which it is ultimately unable to change) and the company can’t be blamed for not giving more control to a community of rebellious youth who immediately resort to comparing an unexplained firing (or the shutting down of abusive, terrible subreddits) to Nazi Germany."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,SJWDFTBA,2,Fri Jul 3 17:46:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like, now that the mods have told their respective subs that they've talked to the admins about certain things and opening their subs back up, people need to stop freaking out about wanting to still protest. If you aren't the mod of a big sub, it almost doesn't affect you.  That said, I think this was the straw that broke the camel's back and I think the mods were right in doing what they did.

There where a lot of people calling the mods cowards and other unkind names if they didn't instantly do as demanded. Or stated that they where not going go dark because they where small or that it had to be a decision all mods agreed to.   The mods that made the decision to go dark generally did so gave reasons for it. They felt they weren't being treated well or they where offering support to other mods.

Being a private company doesn't somehow exclude someone from responsibility for their actions. The invisible hand of the market will not magically sweep reddit aside for another website. We're creatures of habit and we've already built communities here.   Having said that, when this started I did at first think in was an extension of the FPH nonsense. Still, there's a difference between protesting because someone important to your community has been sacked without a stated reason (and I gather this was the latest in a history of decisions ignoring the needs of the volunteer mods who make this site function) and being upset about someone trying to stop you from bullying people (course there's a discussion there over why so many other bullying subs have been untouched but I wouldn't want to give anyone the impression that I'm on FPH's side)"

Being a private company doesn't somehow exclude someone from responsibility for their actions.   Sure, I get that. I just feel like redditors tend to lose perspective on what this site actually is. Some folks think the site is essentially a public utility, and that the online space here constitutes a Public Space (in the sociological sense of the term). Neither of those things are, strictly speaking, true. Reddit is a privately-held company and, whether we like it or not, they can do whatever they want.  I do agree with you that they have some responsibilities to the community they host. To paraphrase a writer I admire, when you don't take responsibility for an online community you host, when you don't take responsibility for the culture that develops in your spaces, you are responsible for what happens in the vacuum. Until very recently, I've felt reddit has been derelict in their responsibilities to the community. I felt that nuking FPH was a positive step towards fixing that problem and actually taking responsibility.   But not everyone agrees! There are some who think that deleting FPH was, in fact, violating their responsibilities to the reddit community. Most of their reasoning boiled down to howling ""Freeze Peach!"" over and over again. I think most of those people are idiots who just want to say mean things about strangers and not experience any social consequences, and I'd be totally fine if they all left reddit.  So, maybe it's just the ""responsibilities"" that Reddit-The-Company has towards Reddit-The-Community have never been satisfactorily sussed out, and those needed conversations are finally happening now."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,SJWDFTBA,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"The deference between this and FPH is the fact that many people did not really care and was actual drama and a company has every right do whatever they want but when they are screwing over people who aren't paid but are essential to the community because they don't have any PR at all when it comes to reddit expect for victoria. If they had more people being active with the community this wouldn't be a big deal at all but reddit has not been active with them at all for the most part  This protest was because they wanted to show that the moderators actually are important and that their revenue relies on them and if the people who cleaned up spam, made CSS and generally made the community live able then reddit wouldn't even be close to what it is now.    I heard a good saying my brother told me was ""When the service is free the product is you"" and that is what we are product as we are seeing ads (unless you use addblock like a tool) that companies give reddit money to pay for or reddit gold which I assume is less of a cash cow but still and right now they aren't treating the people that keep their product cozy very nicely so even though they can do whatever they want we still can have a voice that they need to hear  The protest itself was not the best organized and didn't do much then hinder their revenue for 24h or less  and shows that most of the large subs stand united which is a small but good victory, I like the idea behind the protest but it could have been done better I don't know how but if Reddit(company) doesn't get better PR with reddit the community then there is gonna be an exodus I don't want to have as voat sucks ass"

This has nothing to do with FPH, this is about the mods, who basically are working for free for reddit by creating a healthy envyroment for people to share and entertain (and hate and what not, but lets go for the uplifting part) finally reaching a breaking point in which they can no longer even do they most basic chores (for AMAs at least) with the tools the admin provide them.  Mods have been asking for better tools and beteer cooperation with for years while they've been helping to bring ad revenue to reddits investors, in the mean time the management have been constantly ignoring them, and now, they have demolished one of the pilars that held together the precarious cooperation that was left.  So mods shut shop. First out of necesity, then out of solidarity.  This is not about the users as you are trying to make it sound, this is about the people that make this site run saying enough is enough and for the admins to hear them at once.  Mods are indispensable to run reddit, without them it would be a cesspool of spam. Better tools to fight brigading, spam, a better baning system that doens't require shadowbans and everything they ask is on the best of interest for all reddit users. Instead what they received its a kick on the nuts and a ""get back to work ASAP plz""."

I would argue that because of the moderators, reddit has become a cesspool. Just a different kind of cesspool. Instead of a lot of porn and 419 scams and ""hey bros check out my new album on soundcloud,"" we have a lot of ""black people are animals"" and ""fat people should be legally prohibited from going outside"" and ""actually it's about ethics in game journalism.""  Mods are basically feudal lords. They have near-absolute power over their subreddits and there's no real mechanism for other sub members to have a bad mod removed. (That individual was eventually removed by the admins, but it's not at all an ideal situation.) It seems like whatever this new drama is represents one of the few times in which mods have been vulnerable. Given how much power they already have, I'm finding it hard to take their side in this little pissing match.  I don't know. Maybe the solution going forward is for mods to have less power."
nerdfighters,3bzvc2,SJWDFTBA,2,Fri Jul 3 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"Yes but thats another inherent problem with reddit, mods have too much power, but thats because that's how the admins have decided to run the site.  You sound now like the people you were dismissing in your first comment :P.  Anyway I dont want to shut the discussion with that, solutions are far and between and what you propose would be a base shaking change. Not that I don't agree that it would be for better, it probably is, but thats slightly out of scope, besides, what would be the alternative?  Reddit was designed to run in a stamental(is that a word?) structure in which mods reign supreme with as little intervention with admins as possible, and it works out (most of the time anyway) because if it wouldnt, we would have not gotten to this point at all. The system has flaws, lots of them actually, but, as you say, if people dont like it, they do leave.  Lately everytime admins try to put their sticky fingers on stuff they fuck up, like with the closing of FPH, not that its closing is a bad thing but, under the same rules that made it possible, shouldn't other shit subs be closed? such as, for instance, Coontown?"

The courthouse that issues marriage licenses must do so to all applying eligible couples, but those who want to be married by a pastor still face the risk.

nerdfighters,3bw70s,nipedo,2,Fri Jul 3 07:11:31 2015 UTC,"You know, some rather left leaning idealists would like to see any tax-exempt institution held to anti-discrimination laws. Tax exemption can be considered a form of state support.  Either they are businesses and can do what they want, or they are charities and cannot refuse service on the basis of religious beliefs. They shouldn't have both.   Same goes for Christian hospitals that won't administer emergency contraception to rape victims."

nerdfighters,3bw70s,AngriestBird,12,Fri Jul 3 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"I'm embarrassed to say this, but I'm still genuinely confused by this one.  The statement to Hank was wondering why a gay couple would want to be part of a church, with a church leader that didn't want them.  If I was getting discriminated against by my church leader, I'd find another church (or religion) that fit.  What am I missing?  Is it that someone who's gay is part of some church group, and likes most of the religion, even though they get looked down on?  I'm athiest so it's hard for me to totally connect here, but I would have thought if you disagreed with the leader's statements on such an important thing, you'd leave.  The only thing that comes to mind is if you're in an area where you don't have any other convenient option, where the church pastor might be the only church around, and you didn't have a justice of the peace available.  I don't think that's what's really being asked, though."
nerdfighters,3bw70s,candydaze,3,Thu Jul 2 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"Firstly, finding a new church and a new religion are pretty different things.   Looking at religion overall, if you genuinely believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and died to save your sins, as documented in the bible, that bit is non negotiable. It's reality for these people. By believing that that is true, you also believe that other religions are largely false. To many Christians, saying ""find a new religion"" is like me saying ""well, on a maths test, I can't remember 12 x 8, so I'm going to believe it's 80"". You don't get to change reality, as much as you would like to.   Finding a new church is certainly a possibility, however. However, there are a few problems with this as well. Firstly, every church teaches a different ""set"" of theology, and while a particular aspect (homosexuality) might be one you disagree with, you may agree on everything else. On the flip side, if you agree with their stance on homosexuality, you may disagree with other teachings, such as the role of saints, women's ordination, the real presence and so on. So you need to make a call on which ""being right"" is most important to you.   Additionally, there is no guarantee that you will be able to find another church nearby that meets what you are looking for. There aren't GSM affirming churches everywhere, and furthermore, it can be hard to tell how churches fall on that spectrum without getting to know the church quite well. It took 6 months for me at my new church to work out how very GSM affirming they are, and 15 years at my previous church to realise how open they are to trans people.   Finally, a church is more like a family than a mobile phone provider. You don't switch because you don't like your policy or billing rates. A church is made of a variety of people that you share worship with, and often part of your life, successes, failures and so on with. Obviously, if a family is being abusive, you leave. But every one has their faults, and every family does too. Many GSM people have families that don't approve, but love them anyway, so ties aren't cut.   Hope that helps!"
nerdfighters,3bw70s,DirichletIndicator,-2,Fri Jul 3 07:41:27 2015 UTC,"It is still a belief for these people - it still isn't a reality. Textual ""evidence"" doesn't have sufficient statistical reliability for usual claims of vicarious redemption. That's not an arbitrary measurement. It's not like a history book saying there was a war or something. Those things happen all the time. They're not documented in the same way and using the word ""documented"" conflates the vastly different degrees of certainty.  Point is, there are secular religions (unitarian universalist, buddhism) or secular atheist groups that are willing to be their new friends and are just as welcoming as Christian churches. It's not impossible to just make new friends without entirely leaving your old ones.  Edit: I don't know much about the universalists, this is not an endorsement."

nerdfighters,3bw70s,BigRedTek,3,Fri Jul 3 09:41:37 2015 UTC,"I was in a sermon once where the preacher said that Christianity is not a religion, because religion is based on faith, and we experience christ every day, as plainly as we interact with our friends and family.

Do you discuss those types of issues with other churchgoers, especially the leader?  Being gay is such an integral part of every person I've known that was, I can't wrap my head around a situation like yours.  I'd ask you to AMA, but, well, you know ... !"

I don't come off as gay at all, not the fabulous type, and I'm not involved in the church beyond Sunday mornings (I moved relatively recently and spent a while bouncing around) so I haven't discussed the issue much.    The preacher doesn't spend much time talking about gay people, and it wouldn't be the only thing we disagree about.  I disagree with a lot of the stuff Hank and John say, but I still watch all their videos.    And they don't gay bash.  They want us to avoid temptation, but it comes from a place of love.  I wouldn't go if the church wasn't run by good Christians, which means they don't hate and don't judge.  We just disagree about what constitutes sin.  Anything that's said about gay people still applies to other sins, so it's still good advice. I just have to filter it through my own understanding of christ.   It probably helps that I'm not very hardline about gay rights.  I mean, I consider myself dedicated to gay rights, but for example I supported the Indiana law that everybody was freaking out about a few months ago.  I don't believe that anyone who doesn't see me as a paragon of morality is a bigot.  If you think gay people are mentally ill, or assume all Christians are the same as the Westboro Baptist church (cough reddit cough), your problem isn't politics, it's that you're a dick."

It's genuinely frightening that there are people who think that a religious leader should be forced to perform a marriage that is against their religious beliefs.

It's not always that simple. For a lot of people, leaving their faith community is a very traumatic event. Even people who leave exceptionally toxic church groups still struggle to come to terms with it, even while acknowledging that they did the right thing by leaving. Former members of Mars Hill Church in Seattle are a good example of this.  Anyway, I would caution against leaning too heavily on your own personal experience for this one. Maybe try talking to some religious people and ask them what their faith communities mean to them."

I can certainly see leaving a religion being difficult, even when you know you're not happy in the case of gay marriage.

In the mid 19th century, there were plenty of people who used the Bible to justify slavery and plenty of people who used the Bible to demand an end to slavery.   Opposition to gay marriage is not baked in to the religion. And, indeed, the Early Christian Church sanctioned it.   Now, one could argue that the Early Christian Church were not faithful or effective stewards of Christ or His Ministry, and that Church-sanctioned same sex marriage was an abomination that was duly corrected in the 13th century. I don't agree, but one could definitely argue that in good faith. But to say that Christians who support gay marriage- and by extension, as you suggest, LGBT rights more broadly- ""don't have faith in the parts of the [B]ible that say homosexuals are an abomination,"" is an oversimplification at best."

People who aren't bigoted against gays can find passages to help support their viewpoint, as can the bigots. And there is plenty of support for the bigots in the Bible.  I know lots of really nice Christians who I doubt would be bigoted against gays if it weren't for the Bible.

No religious tradition is ever only one thing. All religious traditions are massively diverse, like I am a Christian but theologically I probably have more in common with some liberal Muslims than I do with some conservative Christians. Religion is not just a set of practices or a singular monolithic belief system. Religion is a response to revelation and different people respond to revelation differently. We cannot continue to assume that each religion represents only one set of ideas!   The protesters are inspired by Islam, those who fight the protesters are inspired by Islam, the work we are doing in Bangladesh is inspired by Islam and the corrupt government of Bangladesh is inspired by Islam, it is not just one thing.

You're only proving my point: some people believe certain things in the bible to be true, some people do not. For example, some people believed the fact that slavery is never repudiated in the bible to say it's okay to own people as property where as other people didn't. The issue in that scenario is that some people did believe. The issue is the belief. Unless you want to claim that multiple generations of people were sociopaths who simply wanted to own people completely independent of scripture, the realization is that they thought it was okay because of what they believed.  To believe something to be true is to believe the world is in a certain state. If I believe the room is on fire I will run out of the room, if I don't believe the room is on fire I'll stay put. So if I believe the room is on fire and it isn't and run out of a reasonable cool room screaming like a maniac I will look silly because of my beliefs.

The problem with that argument is that these were people who were completely capable of empathy, they had families, they had children, they were perfectly normal people who just happened to have a certain set of beliefs.

If I believe my cell phone to be in my pocket and reach into my pocket and it's not there, the cause of me not having my phone in my hand was my belief. When people, who are Christians, or Muslims, or atheists, or nihilists, or whatever, act in a certain way it's because of what they believe. It's dismissive to say, as you and Hank are, ""No, it's not because of what they believe. They're just bad people"" They are acting based on their beliefs, if they didn't believe that, they wouldn't be acting that way. And just to be clear, this goes in reverse, if you believe that it is good to help people and you volunteer at a soup kitchen, it was your beliefs that caused that to happen.  And yet again, just to clarify, I'm saying people and their beliefs are inseparable, I am not saying people and ideas are inseparable. If I believe that unicorns are real you are completely free to say ""That is a silly idea"", that is not saying that I am silly for having that belief.  So the endgame is people admitting that beliefs are the problem (in this particular scenario,) and that some people just hold ""the wrong"" beliefs. It's possible to be a good person with bad beliefs which cause you to act similarly to a bad person."

He's not implying anything about Christianity in general or homosexuality that I can tell. Only that the debate should be had on faith as a set of beliefs.  Once he establishes that thought, he could then ""settle the blame"" on Christianity or even ""settle the blame"" on your bigots for holding a set of beliefs that condones hatred.

I believe that the World was created as a byproduct of several billion years worth of chemical reactions, starting with the universe rapidly expanding from a previously compact and super-dense state. I also believe that the World was created when the Earth was formless and void and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and then that God said ""Let There Be Light,"" and that there was light, and God saw that the light was good.

nerdfighters,3bw70s,AngriestBird,5,Thu Jul 2 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"For the definition of belief that I specified in my comments, it is. You could argue that I'm using the wrong word, which I'm open to if you want to let me know the definition you're using. To reiterate, belief is your representation of the state of the universe, you simply don't both (believe the room to be on fire) and (not believe the room to be on fire) at the same time. That said, I'm not omniscient so if you have research for me to read to say otherwise I'm all for standing up and saying ""I'm wrong"" but ""This is untrue."" isn't quite a full rebuttal."
nerdfighters,3bw70s,infinitum17,-1,Thu Jul 2 22:47:12 2015 UTC,"It's a weak definition. As the universe far exceeds our capacity to understand it, to function in the world as we find it we often are forced to accept contradiction both within the universe and in ourselves. There's also the unknown to consider. This has considerable impact on the nature of our beliefs.  It is completely possible and totally normal for a person to believe and not believe something at the same time."
nerdfighters,3bw70s,Defiance42,5,Thu Jul 2 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"As the universe far exceeds our capacity to understand it   This is irrelevant  For the rest:  OK, so you just proved my point, accepting contradiction is not believing something. If you believed it, there would be no contradiction, you would simply be representing that as the state of the universe. The fact that you think something is contradicting means it contradicts with what you actually believe is the state of the universe meaning you don't actually believe the thing that is contradictory  Now, you can believe something and act in defiance of that belief which might be another interpretation of what you're describing but again that is not holding the belief and lack of the belief at the same time.  Further, beliefs changing from moment to moment does not mean you believe it and don't believe it at the same time."
nerdfighters,3bw70s,conallkeenan,0,Thu Jul 2 22:57:51 2015 UTC,"This is irrelevant   This is central. The reason we have beliefs is because we cannot know. And we are constantly faced with things beyond our understanding that we regardless need to grapple with.   OK, so you just proved my point, accepting contradiction is not believing something.   This would be true if we could be easily and always aware of our contractions. But that's not the case. What actually happens is the contradiction is left out of awareness.  If you want to go any deeper about the nature of beliefs then you have to leave religious beliefs behind, because religious beliefs are far abstracted from the fundamental belief and knowledge systems of the human organism. In fact, as you learn about these systems it becomes clear why religious and other belief systems repeatedly emerge in human society."
nerdfighters,3bw70s,Defiance42,2,Thu Jul 2 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"The evidence used is completely subjective, though. I would completely ignore the story of Adam and Eve because, you know, logic. But if we're going to accept it as fact and use it against LGBT+ individuals then we can't ignore the fact that women's only role is to be a ""suitable helper"". We also must accept incest and talking snakes as natural.   Moreover, in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, which many use to back up their homophobic views, isn't criticising relationships between homosexuals, but they're being punished for gang rape. Had that story been about two female angels and the same thing happened would we conclude heterosexual relationships are unnatural?   In reference to Leviticus, just read through it. We're all going to hell if any of it is true.   So no, I would not say the problem is faith, but rather one's interpretation of faith. The idea of an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God who condemns homosexuality does not sit well with the majority of the Bible, as he needs to be all three of these for the very foundation of 'God' to exist, and if homosexuality is a sin all three of these cannot coexist, thus he is not truly God, if he exists ="
nerdfighters,3bw70s,conallkeenan,2,Fri Jul 3 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"By that logic, the problem is opinions.  If people didn't have opinions, or if there weren't people, there'd be no hatred.

The new testament was written to show the Jews of the time that all the horseshit in the old testament is not important. So, no, Christianity is not about hating gay people. All the people who use the bible to justify hate are misguided and are not doing what Jesus would want. Jesus wouldn't want them following the old testament.  So, no.

I personally believe that there is nothing lesser about the love between gay people, and I think that anyone that thinks otherwise is simply mistaken, and being misled by an ancient book written by misguided people. And so I do regard people who think that gay love is morally lesser than straight love as bigots. It doesn't matter if your view is based in religion, and it doesn't matter if you think you're a nice person. All the opposition to racial equality was also couched in religion by misguided people who thought they were doing the right thing, too. It's still bigotry.  Even concerning your definition of bigot, I'm not intolerant towards those holding different opinions—I know that lots of these people are wonderful, nice people—I just think that their views are not only wrongheaded, but also harmful, so I am intolerant of the views themselves."

Moreover, all you have to do is look at the news and you'll see racism is still very much alive in the U.S. currently, I'm sure if you went around you would find a shocking statistic of people in support of slavery, just like you're able to see the amount of people against same sex marriage."

nerdfighters,3bw70s,RuMorik,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"Well to go back to Hank's post I don't think he's calling people bigots for disagreeing with homosexuality, but rather oppressing people. He isn't say disagreeing with same-sex relationships is a Christian concept, because many people either identify with or support homosexuality. Denying them an equal opportunity, then, is grounded in personal feelings, and is straying away from their faith. A bigot is defined as, ""a person who is intolerant towards those holding different opinions"", which is the case here, I feel, at least. You can disagree with homosexuality without having to be outspoken and treat people differently.   If we view Christianity as a club, rather than a religion, it would be like treating people differently there purely because of their orientation. People wouldn't stand for it - we can clearly see that as oppression; so why, then, do we make exceptions for the unfair treatment of people in relation to religion?"
nerdfighters,3bw70s,RuMorik,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:30:05 2015 UTC,The science is pretty clear on how common and natural homosexuality is. Maybe bigot isn't the nice way to say it but I hope Hank doesn't backtrack on this.

I think the difference would be something you willingly choose vs. something that you have no choice over.    In this case, if you any kind of discrimination against gays, anything other than treating them like any other non-gay, your actions represent bigotry.  Here I think it's somewhat veiled, since I think people that are against gay marriage are actually against being gay at all, but marriage is a much easier to defend stance.  To take a more light-hearted view, I'm a lifelong Red Sox fan, and thus, I hate Yankees fans.

Go paint the USA for example as some kind of Capitalistic Demon that will roll over your Country, build McDonalds everywhere and in fifty years all that will be left of your Culture is the ""McFalafel"" in the McDonalds Restaurant that is being built right over there. Sadly People are generally not smart enough to realize that painting your own culture as abrasive and moronic will have every other Person drop your beloved Culture and eat up Capitalist Propaganda and demand seconds.

We have a little Problem over here in Germany with some People too stupid to realize that they're warming up ye olde Nazi Propaganda with the Fear of the endangerment of Culture and way of Life and all this Shit.

I businesses generally have the right to refuse people service. It doesn't sound like a terrible bill, though admittedly I speak from a deep pool of ignorance in the particular matter of this law.  If the bill was designed to do exactly what it seems to (though earmarking and hiding crucial phrases in legislation is a problem), it would still allow people to be married at a courthouse or by consenting pastors or ministers. I don't know about the state of Texas, but I know that in many states, pretty much anyone can be ordained as a minister in an insanely short amount of time, meaning that there would still be plenty of people who would be willing and able to legally marry a homosexual couple. It seems to me that forcing people to perform both a religious and legal rite when they are opposed to it in this way would create unnecessary animosity as well as awkward situations.  I think that part of the problem is something that people don't seem to get on either side of the fence: legal marriage =/= spiritual marriage. Personally, I am a supporter of marriage equality as a legal right, but as a person of faith, as it applies to spiritual or religious marriage I'm not so sure, at least within my little theological corner. I don't hate gay people; I wouldn't describe myself as bigoted or prejudiced against gay people, and honestly, I think that IF homosexuality is a sin, it's not necessarily worse than drunkenness or gluttony, and committed monogamous homosexuality is infinitely superior to heterosexual promiscuity, especially within the church.   I also believe that you can't hold non-Christians accountable to Christian morals, which is something that Paul specifically talks about in 1 Corinthians 5:9-13   I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people. What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.” (‭NIV)   I know that some people will take especially the end of this passage as a guarantee that all who don't follow their particular theology are destined to be condemned. Instead, I offer a counterpoint; we do not fully know how God will judge, and we do not and can not have complete knowledge of a person, including ourselves.  That is the primary reason Hank and John's slogan of ""imagine people complexly"" is so important, not as a tool of judgement, but as one of understanding and empathy.

I businesses generally have the right to refuse people service. It doesn't sound like a terrible bill, though admittedly I speak from a deep pool of ignorance.   This isn't about private businesses, this is about state government agencies. Municipal and county clerks refusing to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples because it violates their personal religious beliefs. This is an actual thing that is happening, and some, like the Texas AG, are grandstanding and insisting the state government has their back. Not only is it cruel, it's also a clear violation of the US Constitution (Supremacy Clause!) and an act of open defiance against the highest court in the land."

nerdfighters,3bxu8g,NoSarcasmHere,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"I really liked this. Very even handed and evidence-based (despite the short length).   I think one of the big drivers of negative issues mentioned in the video- from sexual aggression to reinforcement of gender roles to feelings of inadequacy to not being able to get aroused without porn- comes from some of the... I guess narrative conventions of mainstream porn?   (Continued below, NSFW, TMI, etc.)  Like I was with a guy once who, at the end, tried to do the whole pull-out-and-come-on-my-face-and-tits thing. I was all, ""wait, what are you doing?"" and stopped him. He was confused (and a little angry) because he wanted to finish and he thought that was just how sex ended. He thought that everyone- or everyone with a penis, at least- finished sex by ejaculating on their partner, because that's how they do it in porn. I had to explain to him that not everyone finishes like that and, regardless, I really didn't want to do that. He didn't believe me at first, and then just got really mad and left. He apologized the next day. We stopped seeing each other a few weeks later.  I'm not sure if this is porn's fault, per se. In the same way that I don't believe Game Of Thrones should be used as a model for diplomacy and state building, I don't believe that porn should be used as a model for sexual intimacy. I think if we had better sex education in this country people would know that porn is a fantasy and that most sex doesn't actually look like that. But we don't, so we do, and the result is both a lot of bad sex and a not-insignificant amount of broken people."

The last two paragraphs are very relevant to the... overall tone of this thread.   The people who have known have fallen into two categories: those who forgive and those who do not. I have yet to meet anyone who did not think I was asking for forgiveness in the telling. I have never been. Still, I worry that going back makes me less forgivable, makes my agency that much more suspect. At the least, I become a bad victim, untrustworthy to the core. The people who don’t forgive me no longer respect me, the people who do treat me as an object of pity. I don’t want any of that.  I don’t regret much of it, when I am being honest. The choices I made worked for me. People tell me they don’t blame me, and I wonder who they do blame. I have a sneaking feeling it will be me, if I don’t tell the story right, or reduce complexity into narrative. I’m not blaming anyone."

I think you're drifting toward Golden Mean Fallacy, ""gotta hear both sides"" territory. And, no offense, but I am not remotely interested in that. I, along with the person who posted this article in the first place, believe this move causes tangible harm to sex workers. In response to another commenter, I laid out why I believe so, and I believe I did so in a constructive and considerate way. In response, the other commenter resorted to ad hominem attacks, misrepresentations of both my arguments and intentions, came just short of calling me a liar, and then mass-downvoted all my posts.

The CC processors had multiple competing valid concerns which they had to address. Golden mean isn't appropriate as a criticism in this case. I think there is error in your viewpoint here, specifically.   In general, though, I think my statement is too broad and that some viewpoints can be dismissed from the start. For example, I almost certainly wouldn't entertain an argument that violent rape is OK no matter how reasoned or the context.

And being a UFC fighter.   And also, no, it's not necessarily violent and dangerous and exploitative. I have a friend who's a cam girl. She's self-employed, and is in no way being ""trafficked."" Also, her risk for physical harm is pretty low. Finally, she and she alone gets to decide when, where, and how she works-- she has total agency, and is not at all being exploited.  Regardless, if you're worried about the ""violence"" and ""exploitation"" of sex work, cutting off their lines of financial support sure isn't going to solve that problem. If anything, it just nudges them toward more high-risk means of plying their trade.  Off-topic, but this is your reminder that the downvote arrow is not a Disagree Button.  Edited to respond to your further comments:   It's violent, dangerous, and exploitative work, which is in no small part due to its illegality.   To the extent that it is violent, dangerous, and exploitative, it is that way because of its illegality. Example: several US cities have laws that use possession of condoms as evidence when arresting and prosecuting those charged with prostitution. The intention was to discourage people from engaging in sex work. The result is that sex workers just stopped carrying condoms. Laws that were meant to ""protect"" sex workers and address a public health issue are instead making things worse.  Legalized or decriminalized sex work would allow for stronger legal protections for workers and better access to needed resources. Cutting off their revenue sources just punishes an already-marginalized group of people.   It's naive to say otherwise, and until that is addressed, the economic incentives are very ethically problematic   I strongly urge you to read this article, as well as the book the article discusses."

nerdfighters,3bn4l2,Mercutiomakeatshirt,12,Tue Jun 30 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"Not drapollo, but I'll answer. I'm unsure. L4A was the first book I read of John's (also my favorite), and I identify with Pudge a lot. I was okay with TFIOS coming into the mainstream, and I know Looking for Alaska isn't some unknown gem. But I guess I feel some sort of ownership of the story that I don't really want to share with everyone."

nerdfighters,3bn4l2,Rose94,3,Tue Jun 30 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I felt this so bad a few months before TFiOS came out. My auntie was talking to me about this author she'd just found and how he's got a movie coming out later this year and she's got tickets to the midnight screening at our local cinema and she asked if I'd ever heard of John Green.  Now I love my Auntie, she is one of my best friends. But man I was furious. I have every single John Green book and had been a fan for 4 years. And I could not afford the money and, more importantly, the time to go to the midnight screening. I calmly said ""Oh yeah, I've got all his books, how good is he?"" but I was burning up so bad inside."

Like if someone reads it, it's an invasion of your privacy, because that's how personal it is to you. It's like the whole world seeing you naked, and then if they criticize it, it's like they criticize a part of you. If they love it superficially, that's even worse.  I know that's a dumb way to feel about a book, but yeah, it's just how it is. I don't feel this way about many books, but LfA was just the right one at the right time. There aren't many things that you can truly say made you the person you are today, but for me, Alaska was one of them."

nerdfighters,3bn4l2,Rafikim,7,Tue Jun 30 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"Is John not still writing books?   I'd also daresay that a seven year old wouldn't be able to take in the ideas that John (and Hank) share in each video, due to vocabulary, discussion of certain events, etc."
nerdfighters,3bn4l2,OhHiAndie,9,Wed Jul 1 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"I think the ""seven year old"" thing refers to the overly-perky act Youtubers have fallen into these past few years.   I've seen a lot of people, specially in the beauty community, go from calm and mature, to manic rambling and ""bloopers"".  Example: I still lover her, but Ingrid. Look at a video of her from 2009, and look at one from this year. She's got a full ""show host"" personal now that she slips into.  John hasn't changed as much as some others have, but he HAS sort of been affected by it a little since TFiOS hit it big. He needs to appear more capable of public speaking now, and the days of camera-shy John trying to get used to vlogging are long gone."
nerdfighters,3bn4l2,Rafikim,6,Wed Jul 1 03:54:56 2015 UTC,"I do not watch Ingrid, but I agree with what you say about John.   Obviously, the videos are much less about him communicating with Hank and more about him addressing issues either in the world today or still in his private life, however he's aware that whatever he shares will be viewed by thousands of people.   John and Hank are part of a big thing now. They are world-famous and have helped the world greatly by contributing to the arts, organizing fundraisers, and inspiring awe."

I wish that the girl from the old cover of Paper Towns could have been an actress and would be available for the movie. Thats the copy of the book I had and thats how I pictured her.

I was about to drop out of high school and I was thinking about suicide very heavily. While we never found out if suicide was the case in Looking for Alaska after reading the responses of every character in that book and how it effected people that weren't even main characters in the story I ended up getting professional help. I'm very very attached to this book, so a large part of me wants the actress to look even a little bit like My Alaska. I wouldn't be able to connect on screen to an actress of ethnicity.

The drawings are all nearly identical because her image is pretty clear. The race might've not been explicitly mentioned, but given her hair/eyes, and the amount of time Pudge spends describing her and never mentioned skin color, it is understood by omission that she's white. John claims to purposely not clarify, but if you look at drawings, there is a very clear image in all the readers' minds.  That being said, the best actress should play her regardless of race."

I mean, yeah, your project needs to have a big audience in order to generate any serious revenue. And of all the people who are fans of you and/or whatever it is you make, you're usually lucky if 5-10% of those are big enough fans that they'd want to support you/it financially. But I'm not sure I would call it a ""popularity contest."" It's more complicated than that.  I do think there are some Patreon campaigns that are launched by those who are already successful who are just using crowdfunding to mitigate risks and costs of whatever side thing they want to do next. But I also think that for every one of those, there are something like two or three others who work as webcomics artists or independent musicians or podcasters who would simply not be able to afford doing what they do without Patreon.  Since you're posting this in /r/Nerdfighters, I'm guessing you're bringing this up in relation to the Patreon campaigns of John and Hank's various projects. They did an AMA a while back after they sold Subbable to Patreon and they talked a bit about their specific projects and crowdfunding generally. If you can find that thread- I'm on my phone atm, sorry- and look at their John and Hank's comment responses you might find something that addresses your particular concerns."

Also, I would strongly caution against reading into stuff like this as cynical ploys to get more money/fame/attention.

And one of my fans told me that they're glad I signed up, and they were thinking of suggesting it to me before. It's still a pretty small amount of money, but my cash flow right now is so low that to me it makes a significant difference.   All social media platforms and crowdfunding platforms will have the problem OP brought up, where the more successful ones get more attention and whatever benefits come with that attention. But Patreon does make it easier for small creators to make more money as long as thy have built up some kind of audience. I mean, I'm proud of the amount of success my webcomic has, but it's still not nearly enough to support myself financially."

You can call it a popularity contest, but it's just people paying for the product they want.  The Internet makes it insanely easy for good stuff to get out there. It will take time, but if you make content people want to see, you will gain recognition. Patreon is there to pair that recognition up with monetary gain, which is super important, obviously."
nerdfighters,3bh1ll,drapollo,-2,Mon Jun 29 05:56:53 2015 UTC,"Based on what the ""crowd"" wants the only people getting funded are people who already have incredibly successful series.

Maybe I'm just nostalgic for the Internet before it became mainstream."
nerdfighters,3bh1ll,godaidgo,8,Mon Jun 29 08:08:03 2015 UTC,"This isn't true, though. A product has to become successful independently of Patreon, obviously, Patreon doesn't claim to be some venture capitalist system investing in ideas. That's Kickstarter.  You don't have to be extremely successful, you just have to have people who want your product. If no one wants it, you have no justification in expecting anyone to pay you to make it."
nerdfighters,3bh1ll,infinitum17,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:06:58 2015 UTC,Perhaps the way to correct this is to start a show of you own where you go onto Kickstarter and Patreon style websites and find good projects and promoting them.

nerdfighters,3bh1ll,BigRedTek,8,Mon Jun 29 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's hard to get noticed. But nobody deserves to be noticed. John and Hank put years of work for no or little pay into what they currently make good money through Patreon doing. You have to show people that you have a product worth paying for before they will pay you. Patreon is simply a way to thank a person for producing something that you have already loved and enjoyed, so that they can keep doing it, and there's nothing wrong with that."

It took me a few times of reading it to get your meaning.  Yes, I want to contribute to the person being successful - although they clearly got where they are without Patreon, I want to keep them going.  Crash Course is the easy example, as they got going with Google funding, but that's gone now.  Patreon replaces the Google funding so they can continue.  As the saying goes, past performance does not guarantee future results.  The second part, about funding new endeavors, is similar, where although the content idea might be a popular one, it still takes money to make the content happen at all.  It's one thing to be making money, but another to be making enough to have the extra it takes to start creating content with no up front return.  Youtube is somewhat scary in that respect, where you need to put in all the effort and money before you will get any returns ... including no return.  This is why when it comes to TV shows, you'll often see people making just a pilot episode, even part of one, before a network orders (pays) for an entire season.  Same idea here.  I love crowdfunding.  I've spent ~$500 over the last few years on various items, and I don't regret it.  I had one project bail out, but my overall win rate has been worth it.  Sourcing money directly from your audience seems like a clear win to me, far better than TV execs in a room choosing, or angel investors getting all the control."

I know most of you don't mean it that way, but that's how it reads to people.  Personally, I think it's worth actively seeking out a more racially diverse cast for LfA, including casting Alaska as a Woman of Color. I know some will bristle at the suggestion of quotas, but the fact is Hollywood already engages in artificial, merit-agnostic racial casting that heavily favors white people. It's called White-Washing, and it's a serious, ongoing problem.  I mean, did anyone trot out the ""they should just hire the best actor!"" line for Shailene or Cara?  Diversity in popular media is important, and I believe that working to correct Hollywood's overwhelming imbalance in favor or white actors is a worthy goal-- even if PoC actors end up receiving ""preferential treatment."""

As I have mentioned: it risks making race part of the story, which could distract from the actual themes of the story.

If they say ""we're going to cast a woc as Alaska for the sake of promoting diversity"", you gotta wonder if they compromised the quality of the acting in order to meet some weird racial quota.  Again, if they said Shailene was picked because she was white, despite a woc actress being the better alternative, it would be very problematic, because then they're prioritizing race over acting ability.  That's the point here: LfA is a really really important movie for many of us, and we want it to be the best it can be. We are worried about its quality being compromised due to an attempt to correct Hollywood's wrongs.   Diversity in popular media is important, and I believe that working to correct Hollywood's overwhelming imbalance in favor or white actors is a worthy goal-- even if PoC actors end up receiving ""preferential treatment.""   They would be receiving preferential treatment at LfA's expense. There are many big and important movies that can afford to choose based on race, but LfA is a movie that means so much to a small group of people, and to everyone else it's just another movie by that JG guy. LfA shouldn't be a martyr for that cause, it's not even important enough for anyone to notice.  Anyway, if the best actress to play Alaska turns out to be a blasian trans girl, all the more power to her, and I am so excited to see her perform. I want for this movie, more than anything, to get an actress that really gets the book and gets Alaska right. I don't care about anything else. By presuming racism you're kind of missing the point. If they decided Alaska must be played by a white girl, it would be a terrible idea, and people's reactions here would be the same. Their (and my) argument isn't that white actresses are inherently superior, it's that we need the best actress and we'd really rather not rule out such a significant percentage of the possibilities right off the bat."

nerdfighters,3bc40q,drapollo,2,Mon Jun 29 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"I'll start with this just to get it off the bat: your read is definitely incorrect. You purposely misunderstood the points people were trying to make, and after I bothered writing a long comment just for the sake of explaining to you what those people actually meant, you dismissed everything I said claiming that I am wrong for believing there is no racism in Hollywood, which is not only incorrect (seeing as I agree there is racism in Hollywood),but also has nothing to do with anything I said. I did not make commentary on what Hollywood does or why it does it. I purely explained to you why people are concerned with choosing actors based on race. You are choosing to paint me as making a racist claim in order to ignore my point, but the fact of the matter is you and I are on the same team, I also don't want white actresses to get roles because they're white. I (along with the people you are replying to) want race and casting to have nothing to do with each other, aside from characters whose race is relevant to the role.    Okay, now on to the bulk of your comment:   You referenced people who intuit the racial undertones beneath the ""they should just hire the best actor"" comments when you said:   Yes, I referenced you, because you're part of group number two. Clearly you do not have bad reading comprehension, rather you are making an active choice to twist the words into a racist message. in your op you flat out admitted understanding our real point, and then proceeded to complain about a possible racist reading of it. that reading is incorrect. No one in this whole thread claimed woc are less good actresses than white girls. No one.   ... presumably because you were trying to come up with the most extreme example possible in order to dismiss concerns.   No, I was not? What's so extreme about a blasian trans girl? If I was trying to be extreme I'd say something like ""black japanese shemale who is also dragonkin and suffers from a rare form of anxiety disorder that causes her to bleed constantly unless she drinks from her special cup that reads 'male tears'."" That's an example of what someone would say if he was making fun of minorities on the Internet. But blasian trans girl? What's extreme about that? Honestly I almost want to say it's racist to imply a blasian trans girl is extreme, but I won't stoop to that level. Just think that you're totally out of line with that claim. I simply chose blasian trans girl because it's the opposite of the typical cisgender white actress you're arguing against using.   No one connected with the movie would say they ONLY cast an actor because of her racial background. BUT, it's also entirely possible to put out an audition call that says something to the effect of, ""race is open, but women of color are encouraged to audition."" It would be no different than a job listing that says ""women and minorities encouraged to apply.""   That's totally cool! I am all for that!!! If I could have it my way, every non-race-specific role for all of humanity's future should have a big message saying ""all actors of all backgrounds welcome"", no one is arguing against that. What we're arguing against is choosing an actress based on her race, which, by the way, is the exact same thing you're arguing against. You just happen to think it's okay to do when it advantages poc, whereas we think it's never okay to do.   Maybe you think that's a quota and artificial and ""sacrificing quality."" That's on you, I guess. The entire point of my comment was to say that it doesn't, and that actively encouraging WoC to audition is not only totally cool, but would be a welcome change considering Hollywood's predilection toward white-washing roles.

I really doubt we're going to see underage kids smoking. Maybe drinking.  The infamous scene that got the book in hot water is probably going to end up cut as well. I'm all for having someone of color in a pivotal role on screen in any movie, but this film in particular is already on enough shaky ground for me, that deviating from the book any more than I'm already anticipating is just going to ruin the story from me. I'm not interested in seeing this film for any reason other than to see my favorite book make a proper transition to film and hopefully feel fulfilled and satisfied with the end product."

Now, I know how wrong that is and that it's impossible for me to expect this film to cater to my expectations, but there are some things that deviate from what I've built up in my mind too much for me to be truly satisfied.

It's been quite a minute since I've been able to sit down and read through the book.) none of the main cast of characters, (pudge, Alaska, the colonel, and takumi) were necessarily extraordinarily privileged or deprived. Alaska had a car, they all went to boarding school, and while they may not have come from the greatest home lives, they were all put into lives I would have a hard time considering to be impoverished. When I read the book I saw a bunch of teenagers who all fit into my same social bracket. Especially pudge.

This may be an unpopular opinion but I'd just prefer it if major characters in books always had their ethnic background specified or alluded to.

Wow, didn't think people actually said that. It's like saying ""we're talking about the PRC, not China.""   This is America, not this. I thought you're the one arguing against US-normativity?"

So I knew how to read music, I had good ideas about tone and intonation but I never realized how much I had to work to acquire that knowledge before. Well, I learned how much work it was during my first few weeks learning baritone and let me tell you it fucking sucked. I could hardly make a sound, I was/am a scrawny kid and holding that sonuvva bitch hurt, but the worst part was I had enough acquired musical intelligence to know exactly how bad I was, I could hear the other people in my section play and recognize that I didn't sound like them but I had to figure out why I didn't and how to sound like them. And now another four years later I'm majoring in music education and learning to play baritone that way is still one of the most important things I've done for my music career.  tl;dr no one realizes how little 'innate musical talent' exists, yeah it's out there but almost all musicians have to bust their asses to sound the way they do"

nerdfighters,3b7gcv,nerdfighterbot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"May I give my advice here? Mutual funds. OMG Mutual funds mutual funds, mutual funds. Instead of buying stock in one company and hoping for the best (its almost as likely that they go belly-up and their stock prices plummet, leaving you out of money as it is that they gain value earning you money) INSTEAD you should buy stock in ALL the companies. That's a mutual fund, and its the best way to diversify. You own less shares of each company in the mutual fund, but you have that money in like 500 companies instead of 1 or 2. The average of the whole stock market (all the companies ever) has historically been 7% gain per year. A good mutual fund runs parallel to the whole stock market in its 7% average gain.   The #1 important thing with that is though: BE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL! Assuming you are properly diversified (mutual fund) don't worry if your money goes down for a little while. IT WILL GO BACK UP! Just look at the stock market history and look at the millions of little dips. If you were around back then, should you have sold? NO! Because now its higher than even the high back then. So whatever you do, don't sell. Stay the course, diversify with mutual funds, and you're golden.   (For those of you who say ""Ok, I got that enough to want to start. How do??"" Open up an account (IRA, Roth IRA is what I use, etc) at a brokerage place. [I use Fidelity] And buy shares into a mutual fund. [I use FUSEX]. That simple. Enjoy your savings.) {{Please note many mutual funds have a minimum buy-in, something like $1k or $2.5k}}   I tried posting this to youtube but its being weird right now, or I don't know how it functions with G+ comment anymore."

But he did make mistakes, and they have had horrible effects on the victims, ones that are probably life long.  However, we're not really in the position to forgive, or hold grudges - these things didn't happen to us. It's up to the victims to make their decisions. I believed him when he says if he took a lie detector test he'd pass, but if a victim took a lie detector test they'd also pass. We weren't in those situations, so we can't truly understand it.  That being said, I wouldn't take away from what he did because it's 'less' than, say, Sam Pepper; an attempted murder isn't punished as much as an actual murder, but both are still a crime.

And since we're talking about all this again, here's the Vlogbrothers video that Hank made on sexual abuse and consent (published right after the allegations surfaced)."

nerdfighters,3azlri,SJWDFTBA,3,Wed Jun 24 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"Alex Day was a narcissistic asshole who pressured women into sexual activities they were not comfortable with, using his reputation as a prominent YouTuber to get away with it. The revelation of this came at roughly the same time as other YouTubers (Tom Milsom, Luke Conard, Ed Blann) faced similar accusations about their own personal lives. It also proved a precursor to other scandals, such as the one that surrounded Sam Pepper.   The news came as a shock at the time, and John and Hank were pressured to make a public statement about it, something they did both on Tumblr and, indirectly, in video form. However, given everyone's general hatred of how scummy the behaivour was, everyone hoped that this would mean their YouTube careers were over, and we could move on from the whole sorry saga.  It's probably difficult for you to find out about this, though, because the ""YouTube Community"" has reacted to it by treating Alex Day as, effectively, Lord Voldemort: He shall not be talked about, because the name's Taboo. As such, he has been personally expunged from removed from some parts of YouTube, with many people deleting videos from years ago where they collaborated with him, and refusing to mention him in retrospective looks at YouTube history, such as this one, for example.   Personally, I think this is a little disingenuous, considering not only how big a part he was of several online communities, but also how the culture of YouTube fandom enabled the whole scandal to happen. But then we run into the issue of whether the internet should be an archive or not.  Basically: We don't talk about Alex Day any more."

nerdfighters,3b08ba,Metalingas,5,Wed Jun 24 22:40:30 2015 UTC,"I think when it comes to movies the actual acting is far more important than image. It's like people who complained about Natt playing Isaac because of his hair colour wasn't the same as the book.  While I didn't think her acting was that great based on the trailer, John has stated that she understood the character and was who he would have picked. While characters ultimately belong to the reader (in my opinion) I'm going to place my trust in the opinion of the person who came up with them.  But yeah, your criticism has been held by a huge amount of people. Hope I walk out thinking she was perfect for the role, though :)"
nerdfighters,3b08ba,conallkeenan,3,Thu Jun 25 00:09:04 2015 UTC,"So I don't know for sure whether she's the right choice because I haven't seen the movie. However,I think a young woman who has the experience of being a famous super model would be fairly likely good at getting into the head of Margo for what I think are obvious reasons.  As for appearance. So, Margo is literally ""the girl next door"". And in my opinion, what we see of her in the movie helps construct that image. I don't think what she looks like outside of the movie really matters if you are able to put out of your mind she's a famous super model. This is partially how well they do with styling. Like I said already, I think the people working on this movie got that down.  However, it still maybe requires trying to forget what she looks like not in the movie. This is, for some I admit, a big ask.  I haven't really seen any great arguments against her casting other than people not liking what we've seen in trailers. Which is fair. I also haven't really participated in much besides trailer viewing because I want to go into the movie with as clean a slate as possible besides having read the book twice."
nerdfighters,3b08ba,thoughtsfromclosets,3,Thu Jun 25 02:00:27 2015 UTC,"Agree with everyone who has said that we won't know until we've seen the movie. Just a note on the finding it disturbing that one of the most gorgeous super models of today should play a quirky normal teen.... It's just that isn't the point of Paper Towns exactly that? We have these preconceived notions about people that are not necessarily the reality of them based on just what we see from the outside and we form our own reality of who they are without really knowing WHO they are. It's pretty much the same as us pre-judging Cara's effectivity as Margo in the very same way that Q had this whole understanding of Margo that is not necessarily who Margo really is. Sorry for the convoluted writing, try as I might, I can't seem to word this better."
nerdfighters,3b08ba,salotsalipunan,2,Thu Jun 25 14:07:22 2015 UTC,We won't know till we see her acting  If she can't act right then she was a bad choice  If she can act the character properly then she was a good
nerdfighters,3b08ba,lulzmort,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:44:34 2015 UTC,"I think that Cara was a fine choice. I think that Q always saw Margo as a super model anyway, so it makes sense that we would too.  That said, the girl on the cover of the book will always be my Margo <3"

This is a good video about why people (including me!) identify as Feminists as opposed to, say, Humanists or Equalists or whatever. I feel like this gets at the heart of the semantic differences reasonably well.  As for the specific term ""gender egalitarianism,"" it's a superficial reading of the principles of gender equality primarily espoused by, well, the kind of people who frequent /r/MensRights and /r/KotakuInAction. The kind of people who unironically use terms like ""SJW"" and ""Feminazi"" as pejoratives."
nerdfighters,3avggr,conallkeenan,0,Thu Jun 25 15:23:48 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, you're seeing people identifying as egalitarians in that way, when there are people who identify with the ideas of feminism, but because of people who falsely claim to be feminists, and instead are intended on removing men's rights, are turned away and believe feminism to be some form of cult.

I think the next time they did it that you bought an entry into a raffle. You'd probably get more people spending 10 quid for that than equal one rich person buying something they can afford that the rest of us can't.

nerdfighters,3aqv5m,Jethro_H,3,Mon Jun 22 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say some things about the ""no edge"" stuff, because I think I might have something useful to contribute.  This whole idea of ""what did it expand into"" is a weird one, and I think I know why people think like this. When you study topology, you often talk about ""embedding"" of objects.   The surface of a sphere is a 2D object, as you need only two coordinates on it to uniquely identify your position, but when you picture it you see it as a surface in 3D space. Whenever you picture any shape you're seeing it in 3D space. This is just because that's how humans see everything in real life.   It doesn't have to be this way though. For the surface of a sphere to exist mathematically, it doesn't need to be imagined through a 3D space, it can exist on it's own. We can study all of it's properties using differential geometry without needing it to be contained within another, higher dimensional object. This is kind of obvious really, or else we'd have an infinite tower of objects. (What's my computer in?? 3D Space. What's that 3D space in?? 4D Space. What's that in?? etc.) Basically, objects can exist on their own without needing to be contained by even bigger objects.  I think that people who need to understand ""what"" the universe is expanding into are looking through this implicit human lens, without knowing it. Our universe, space-time itself, is a 4D surface. Distances on that surface change with time (they're expanding). That doesn't mean that the surface of our universe is 'in and expanding into' a higher dimensional object though."

Returning an hour later, of course, some things have changed. On /u/crow1170's ""libertarian stance,"" I'm in much the same boat as you: I can consider the argument, but I don't agree with it.  Additionally, I'm tired of people disregarding an entire argument based on a 10 second clip of Sarkeesian. She's just one feminist critic who made it big with the aid of the Streisand Effect, not some taboo spell which must divide the entire bloody internet and summon a torrent of bile."

Ruined some peoples livelyhood for no reason whatsoever and such.  If this was in some post on reddit or on some clip on a 24 hours newsclip, I'd given it a facepalm and though ""oh, that's embarrassing"" and wouldn't have wasted another thought on it, enjoying the rest. But I think we should hold LWT to a higher standard. If their writers can make such a blunder, it calls into question quite a lot of things.  Also, I don't see this as an isolated incident. Those writers have made quite a lot of blunders and it saddens me, because I like John Oliver and his format that's similar to ""The Daily Show"" in the most important regards."

nerdfighters,3aoqa8,starlinguk,24,Mon Jun 22 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a garbage fire this comment thread is.  So, hi everyone! I'm a lady. This is not my original reddit account. I used to be active on reddit (but not /r/nerdfighters) like 4-5 years ago. I primarily hung out on TwoXChromosomes. While the brigading from MensRights didn't hit critical mass until a while later (so I'm told), we still got a lot of assholes coming into the sub with the express aim of Fucking Shit Up. The one thing they all had in common? They announced themselves as male.  One day, one of these special children decided he really didn't care for my opinions on... well, just about anything really. He made me a project of his. (In fact he used that precise word-- project. I hope none of you ever have to experience the unique sense of dread that comes with someone telling you you've become a project of theirs.) He stalked me across reddit for several months, mass-downvoting all my posts and comments, reporting all my shit for Spam, responding to my comments with some pretty vile shit.   Then about 2-3 months in, he made a text post under an alt in 2X that was basically all my personal info-- address, photos of the outside of my apartment building, phone, personal email, social media accounts, my work place, my boyfriend-at-the-time's address and phone number, and my parents' address and phone number. The mods took it down quickly, but I saw it-- which was the point. Before his account got shadowbanned, he sent me a PM telling me I had 72 hours to abandon my reddit account or else to expect photos of the rape and murder of my parents.  On an intellectual level I don't believe in negotiating with or giving in to terrorists, but I was Freaked The Fuck Out, and I had no idea how far this asshole was willing to go. I called the cops (""Just turn off the computer""), messaged the reddit admins (silence), and did everything victims of this sort of thing are supposed to do (and which you're no doubt firing up your commenting fingers to ask me why I didn't do X-- trust me, I did it). In lieu of any actual support- or even just people, y'know, believing this is something that was happening to me- I complied and nuked my reddit account. And then I stayed away from this godforsaken trash heap for many happy years.  I came back a few months primarily for the Nerdfighter community. (Primarily. I have an alt which I use to complain about my NHL team.) I created a new account, tried very hard not to talk about my past life, and basically prayed that the asshole I encountered previously wasn't still around. I was really hoping /r/nerdfighters would be my One Nice Place On The Internet, like the YT comments on Vlogbrothers videos used to be. Based on some comment threads since I showed up- including this one and some of the discussions over the weekend re: the Charleston shooting- I'm wondering if maybe I was overly optimistic.  (And to be clear, this wasn't my only experience with this sort of thing. I had to nuke my Twitter account last fall because of #GamerGate. So to everyone citing Thunderf00t videos to say that Anita Sarkeesian is a bad person, know that the subreddit rules and my personal commitment to the values of Nerdfighteria are pretty much the only thing stopping me from telling you what I really think about you.)   Are men victims of online harassment? Of course. Just ask my boyfriend-at-the-time-- he had to get a new cell phone number. But if you're seriously going to sit there and say that men and women are equally affected by this, you're either not paying attention or you have an agenda. I'd like some of you to consider why is it you feel compelled to dismiss gendered online harassment as a Thing That Exists. I'd like you to consider why it is that all it took was John Oliver to invoke the name of Anita Sarkeesian (who, let's just get this out of the way, is a fucking personal hero of mine) to pull the Your Argument Is Invalid card. I'd like you to consider why it is that you're totally okay with dismissing the actual lived experiences of women in online spaces in order to satisfy some Golden Mean Fallacy, ""Both Sides Are At Fault"" bullshit impulse. I'd like you to consider why it is you suddenly feel compelled to fire off a long response to this comment telling me why my lived experience is irrelevant to this discussion and why I'm wrong.  I don't intend to respond to comments. And, in fact, after this weekend and after seeing this comment thread, I think I'm going to take a few days off from reddit and engage in some of that self-care that all those Tumblr SJWs y'all seem to hate so much talk about. But I had to say something, if for no other reason than you people keep talking about this like it's some hypothetical situation that probably won't affect you. It may not ever affect you, but it is far from hypothetical.  Signed,  An SJW and Woman On The Internet  (PS- my previous reddit account is dead and buried. I won't be sharing my username or example threads from that experience. If you're demanding ""proof"" in order to see my experience as valid, that's your problem, not mine.)"

Even though it was for such a short amount of time, and even if they aren't lying and playing professional victims, there are still many people who are against them and it hurts their credibility among certain groups. I feel if they are going to talk about Sarkeesian and Woo there is just so much going on around them that they need to devote one of their 12-15 minute sections to it and do a lot more research. It's just such a complex and controversial issue that the >1 minute they presented of them doesn't really do it justice.  They still could have made their point without including them. As they showed there are plenty of other people who receive harassment online. And I'm sure they could have taken a more balanced approach. The way he presented it made it seem like white males never get harassed, which as we all know, isn't true. The statistics say that woman are sexualy harrased more than men, but that doesn't mean that sexual harassment towards men is nonexistent and/or negligible.  I would have been satisfied with him showing some statistics, and then saying ""It's a bigger issue among women, so lets focus on that"" but he didn't. Instead we have to go by anecdotal evidence, which sucks because he didn't need to go by anecdotal evidence to make the point he did. And anecdotal evidence sucks when talking about big issues like this.  If I used only anecdotal evidence I could make it seem like white males are the only ones who get harassed, but the moment I step into the realm of actual data, that claim is instantly proven false. Which is why using stories as evidence for big issues like this sucks.  All in all, I'm glad that they are passing laws to make revenge porn illegal, but LWT certainly could have handled this issue better."

This feels very specifically crafted to attract controversy/publicity for the show."
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,The_Hectic_Glow,13,Mon Jun 22 16:09:42 2015 UTC,"This Pew report is helpful to understand the gendered side of this issue. For example, while ""men are more likely than women to encounter name-calling, embarrassment, and physical threats [44% to 37%],"" young women ""experience certain severe types [stalking and sexual harassment] of harassment at disproportionately high levels"" in addition to ""heightened rates of physical threats and sustained harassment common to their male peers and young people in general.""  Admittedly, this issue should be confronted at all fronts; however, with the heightened threats facing women and certain recent internet brouhahas, I can understand John Oliver taking a gender-focused approach.  Notably for Nerdfighteria, the report mentions that ""those whose lives are especially entwined with the internet report experiencing higher rates of harassment online,"" recalling the threats John Green received towards his family a while back."
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,MilksMan,6,Mon Jun 22 16:50:02 2015 UTC,"I really wish they would give some numbers for those ""disproportionately high levels"", because that's a pretty vague-ass statement.

For example, what do these rates look like for online content creators?  How do they differ between someone who regularly plays online game vs someone who doesn't?  My instinct is that the rates would be very different if you compared a group of people that only uses the internet to read news, facebook, and for emails compared to a group of people who game for dozens of hours per week, have a blog and are active on communities like youtube, reddit, etc.  Also, a separate thought - maybe they only mentioned by name people who were ok with being mentioned, and probably made a target?

nerdfighters,3aoqa8,Logios,4,Mon Jun 22 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"Correct me if this is amended later in the article, but looking at the graphs on the first page, rates of online harassment are not significantly different between men and women in almost any issue, except in those where woman are more often harassed. 51% versus 50% is hardly significant, nor is 38% to 36%, or 26% to 23%. Obviously all of these rates are far from acceptable and we should aspire to lower rates of online harassment across the board, but in those categories where there is an obvious disparity on the basis of gender, women experience significantly more harassment. These would be stalking and sexual harassment. The other category, in a different graph, would be ""Called offensive names"" where men are more commonly experiencing this harassment (32% vs 22%).

If what I had to say mattered as much as what the more equal farm animals have to say, I'd say this:  Mr Oliver,  Yes, changing words in sentences makes different sentences. That's why suggesting not owning a home is hilarious and why not taking nude photos is reasonable. You might recall this gentleman, who famously published his social security number to tout his company's ability to defend people's privacy and identity. Clearly, it didn't work. You can't control the existence of your naked body or your social security number. You can control if you share it.  In fact, that's true of most things. Losing control of photos of your naked body is dramatic and, not unjustly, commands empathy. But justice and law are not about empathy. It's not enough to justify FEDERAL LAW with a handful- even hundreds- of heart wrenching cases. If it were, these wronged individuals would be dwarfed by the thousand people who drown every year. Having the Office of Mandatory Pool Maintenance dispatch inspectors all over the country is not wise.  But like I said, the law is not about empathy. It's about authority. Right up until the point of death (assisted), you are allowed to give whatever you to whomever you want. Whether I give you my very favorite potted plant or my life saving medication doesn't change what you implicitly owe me- Nothing. No one can be made responsible for protecting someone else's privacy, health, security, or temperament. If I give you a secret, my medication, my keys, or my preferred temperature you are not compelled to change the thermostat, break the key, deliver my drugs, or keep my secret.  Is what happens to these people awful? Of course. Many things are awful. Some of those awful things are preventable. As an individual, I'm happy to offer sanctuary, food, and support of all sorts to people who fall prey to awful things- even preventable ones. My government should not compel that. It's the business of governments to facilitate- not control- society.  The reason this isn't and shouldn't be a crime is because not all bad things are crimes. The government must use discretion when it chooses to intervene with the public. The possibility and frequency with which matters tailspin into life or death situations make the federal government FAR too dangerous a tool to use for this matter. The appropriate tool is obvious, and your desire to flirt with fire does not make the US legal system a more appropriate tool.    You want to take those pictures? You want to put your SSN on a billboard? You want to start a business, invest in penny stocks, or keep cash in a mattress? Want to walk a tightrope between two buildings, eat til you die, free dive in dangerous caves, smoke cigarettes, tunnel without precautions, become a sword swallower or firespitter or liontamer? Fine. But that doesn't put the onus on us to make those things less dangerous or protect you more than we do others.  No matter how many foam safety covers you put on playground equipment, some things are still dangerous. Don't do them."

Also, i don't think that it's a stupid one or anything like that. You are reasonable throughout.  Still, I have to say that I strongly disagree with your stance. While I agree that the comparison with the house was completely ridiculous (yet another thing I can add to my mental list of why I dislike the writers of LWT), the point is a valid one.  You obviously can't stop people from doing stupid things and ruining their own live and even if you could, in some instances it'd be wiser to ask if you should. So far, you are right.  Still, when you can prove malicious intend, there should be laws that protect people. Obviously, such things are not without danger. We know of similar laws when it comes to stalking and restraining orders, for example, that are not always unproblematic, but ultimatively good. Sometimes such laws are being abused but in most cases, they are very helpful and in some they even save lives.  Now, this law will probably not physically protect people. But having your privacy violated in such a way is devastating. We should hold companies like google and porn sites liable if they host naked pictures of people without their consent. It should be illegal to share naked pictures of others without their consent. In most cases, it's hard to prove who really did the uploading and it becomes a he-said, she-said. That's what investigations and the ""presumed innocent until proven guilty"" concept are for.  And yes, there will probably be singular cases where a woman is crazy enough to take naked pictures of herself, send them to her own family, boss, etc. with the sole purpose of blaming it on her ex to get him incarcerated. That is a problem. But that holds true for pretty much any law. It's simply morally wrong to leave those people unprotected by law."
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,crow1170,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:02:53 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we can talk about this. I appreciate that you acknowledge the edge cases and I agree that we can't base our laws or attitudes on them. I think the reason I would disagree, on principle, with any legislation like what you propose can be outlined with two points from your post:  # Intent  Consider that maliciousness is not unlawful. In fact, it's usually protected speech. In America we are guaranteed the right to publish any factual information we can find, particularly to the end of defaming people. The topic at hand is revenge porn, but malicious intent includes things we presumably like: Did Snowden have malicious intent against the NSA? Deepthroat against Nixon? Salinger against meat packers? Nutritionists against McDonald's? Lawyers against... Anyone? It may be petty to do this to an individual, but think about it dialecticly: if someone were imprisoned for revealing a video of Mr Blatter of FIFA infamy ranting about... Ohh, I don't know, wanting trannies not to watch futbol, which side would you be on? I don't think it's a stretch to say you'd have done malicious intent of your own. You might even claim that people 'have a right to know'.  On the other hand, we don't want to inadvertently allow non vengeful non consensual porn- it might be that this video you made happens to be your very favorite and you want to share it with friends non maliciously! That's certainly not any better for the subject of the video.  So to that end, I don't think intent ought to have any affect on the matter.  Consent  This issue is near to my heart- I ended up on my university's Instagram feed once in a very unflattering picture. Hundreds of people saw me, dozens mocked me, and I only found out by being laughed at in public. Believe me when I say I'm sympathetic.  Here's the problem, though: It wasn't my photo. I went out into public looking like that. I fully understood that people would be able to see me, even photograph me. I could have dressed differently. I could have avoided people. I didn't.  I didn't own that person's camera or have any right to the data on it. Consider the precedent if I did. I understand wanting to focus on nudity, but that's not what a law like this would do. In short time, it'd cover sexually suggestive images involving lingere or cfnm porn. Then, it'd be reasonable to include any defamatory imagery because of an excellent fit wrenching ad campaign about some website where abusers trade images of the women they've beaten.  Eventually, Beyonce gets to remove that one image from the internet, paparazzi are jailed, and movie extras have to sign paperwork before stepping on camera. So far, nothing bad.  But now suppose Romney can delete the 47% video. Suppose that basketball coach can make that phone call recording go away. Suppose sick Cheney can hide interviews suggesting his lies led to the Iraq war.  The reasoning is the same- this media is of me and I stand to lose a lot if people get it. The authority doesn't move, though. It may be of you but it's by me.    I've come at this subject from a lot of angles. For me, it's the same subject as the fappening, NSA leaks, Napster, and Sony Hack. They're all interconnected, instigated by the immense sense of what's mine and what's yours and what you can do with my things. What I've found is that my heart, mind, and gut always say different things about it when we come from different angles. My heart would be at rest of we could claim copyright over our nude bodies. My gut would be settled if we had full authority over anything on our property. My mind would be at ease if we could convince people nudity wasn't such a big deal.  It frustrates me when middle schoolers and talking heads claim a solution is simple. That's the same attitude that's left us with very complicated problems today in finance and government and real estate. Boomers thought that was simple and these laws were good enough and time shows they aren't. Why would time treat Oliver's opinions any better? The right solution is one that can be installed programmatically, with no regard for content, consent, or intent. Those belong to social graces. That kind of solution requires an educated and disciplined populous, though. It requires discussion, experimentation, humility, and compassion and we're never going to get it while Oliver keeps putting band aids on our hearts."
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,Max_Insanity,2,Mon Jun 22 19:50:38 2015 UTC,The argument re the fappening is worth noting as an exception.  In that case it was private photos stolen through hacking. That is theft of private property.
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,ReneG8,0,Mon Jun 22 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good point- I concede that the original thieves are clearly in the wrong. The question I have is: Are we compelled to destroy the images after the the thieves are dealt with? Does imgur have to receive punitive measures for having hosted the images?   The nearest analog is accessory to a crime- should the imgur taxi service be held liable for driving a bank robber away from a crime scene if imgur did not know the circumstances?  What about the proceeds? If I rob a McDonald's and go door to door offering illicit hamburgers, are the eaters responsible for the crime? If not, then the fappening photos  are fair game to keep.  That's why I included the fappening example. You might follow the same track for Snowden- maybe it was against the the Espionage Act to acquire the information, but is possessing a copy of that leak equally punishable?"
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,CJ_Jones,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"The legal aspect I am not sure about. Is there a difference between knowing that something is stolen and not knowing? Is it a crime to knowingly take/buy/use stolen goods? if imgur is informed the images are stolen, are they legally obliged to take them down?  Then there is the moral aspect of course.  If images are stolen, isn't it morally appropriate to then not pass them on? The user knows that the person they were stolen from does not want their privacy invaded. I would say the moral thing to do would be to not pass the picture on, or use them. The trouble is, people are not obligated to do the right thing morally. Therefore, should there be a law to uphold people's privacy?"
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,FutureGreenChemist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:42:05 2015 UTC,"The trouble is, people are not obligated to do the right thing morally. Therefore, should there be a law to uphold people's privacy?   This is a dangerous leap- VERY dangerous! I'm all for privacy, and legal enforcement of privacy, but not as moral mandate. That same line of reasoning can be used to be dangerously regressive:  My morals are good. That man is acting immorally. Let's make such action illegal, so he'll have to have morals. Excellent, now everyone is moral, straight, aryan, sharia, so on, so forth.  This is not a great leap from the current discussion; see UK porn filter.     Again I agree with upholding privacy, but it seems to me that it's a preventative act. Coming from IT, for example, and thinking of this as a data breach against a company, I want that company to be equipped to prevent a breach and I want the people doing the attack to be stopped, but I don't want a government body to be able to take the data off wikileaks.  And when we compare our stance on nudes to all other stances there's a discrepancy in our preventative efforts. We want middle schoolers to have condoms and churches to provide birth control to their staff, we make drivers prove their skills to prevent accidents, we mandate informing employees about workers comp and we tolerate the beast that is the TSA all in the name of preventing tragedy. Revenge porn is tragedy. Why aren't we preventing it? Even if the proposed bill were sufficient to punish after the fact, why don't we have 'the more you know' psas about not taking nudes? Sure, teen pregnancies aren't all bad (one made me, after all) and neither are nudes but maybe we throw them in the same part of the sex ed lecture.  So my points are: A law would be dangerous. People probably shouldn't take the photos. People definitely shouldn't share them. Morals aren't a good basis for legislation. Prevention is better than retribution.    Welp. I'm tired. This was insightful. It may not look like it but this discussion has changed some of my opinions. I think we're as far as I could reasonably ask for.  G'Night."
nerdfighters,3aoqa8,The_Hectic_Glow,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:41:51 2015 UTC,"Intend often plays a role in criminal justice, for example when it comes to murder, where you literally have various degrees of it. It is often easy to show if something was solely motivated by feelings of revenge (for example if you upload pics of your ex on a ""revenge porn"" site).  I come from a country where we are on the far other end on the spectrum on this issue, Germany. Here, it is illegal to make photos or videos of other people without their consent, unless it is a person of public life (my attempt to translate the phrase), such as politicians or celebrities or if you actually made a photo of a place or event and they just happen to be there at the time (you can take photos and create videos at concerts and the like). Video surveillance etc. is ok as well, as is pretty much everything you photograph etc. as long as you don't share it. What you can't do, is just follow a random person, photograph or film them and without asking publish that material, no matter the context. We value privacy very highly. So if I were to wear a silly outfit to a public event and someone filmed it and put it on facebook, that's ok for them to do. If I anything I like while taking out the trash and some asshole I know happens to walk by, makes a photo and uploads it on his blog, that's illegal. If I do the same naked, someone makes a photo of it and takes it to police to prove that I did that, that's ok on the other hand.  There is no issue of abuse of that system here. I have never heard of a single instant of someone using that law to supress free speech or something similar. Feel free to ask me for specifics, but I don't see a single flaw with that law. The burden of proof is on the one suing because they were filmed/photographed/whatever that it was the defendant who created the material and released it to the public. If that is proven, the defendant has to show that he did indeed have permission from the... other person. Accusator?  In any case, it is unproblematic to create a similar law when it comes to the matter at hand. We should have the rights to our own bodies. The fappening victims should be able to sue those who did that to them should they be found. The right to privacy should trump the public interest in almost all cases except to unveil crimes and the like. That's why there is an exception in our law for people of public interest, because we need to keep a close eye on some of them and the public needs to be able to make a picture for themselves of those who are famous. If Harrison Ford makes a racist rant, people should be able to get that information so they can boycott his movies, for example (just an example, I don't think he's a racist)."

This is just one thing in a long list of issues I have with ""Last Week Tonight"". It's just not on par with ""The Daily Show"". What angered me the most was the way he portrayed Edward Snowden. While he seemed to be on his side overall, I was very disappointed in the way he conducted that interview. I get that he has to make a joke out of things, that's the premise of the show, soften the blow of bad news with humor, but he made Snowden look like an antihero at best, if that makes sense.  I believe he should get a new team of writers. His are simply not good enough for the job. It's clear that quite often, they aren't well informed enough themselves, a lot of their jokes are not remotely funny but stale and boring and there's simply no comparison between that show and the one it originated from with Jon Stewart.  Also, people need to differentiate hate speech and trolling from criticism. Sometimes, it is ok to question a whole bit/article/book/whatever based on some of the sources. If one of my sources on a book for biology is a known creationist, then I shouldn't be suprised if people don't take me seriously.  tl;dr: I agree with most of what you two said and like to go on tangents."

I bet you wouldn't argue the way you do if the show had made a bit with Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, etc. as a source on which they built their argument.  Now don't get me wrong, I agree with most of the video, but that part was so out of place, that I found it downright disturbing.  Also, many people are downvoting his comment because they disagree, even though downvotes should be reserved for comments that don't add anything to a discussion. Even if you don't agree with him, the choice of picking her as a source puts into question the research skills of the team that produced this and, if you are as paranoid as me, also makes you wonder if the writers have an agenda, since Sarkeesian is most commonly known in the SJW circles. Now that last bit is just speculation, but I'll keep my eyes open for more things that might point in that direction in the future. Because that, too, would undermine the credibility of the show.

nerdfighters,3aoqa8,Gregorofthehillpeopl,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's useful to keep in mind that the terminology around this entire issue is entirely unhelpful to the discussion. The term ""Social Justice Warrior"" is not a flattering term even if you are a feminist. It's original meaning is based on ""Social Justice Activist"". The ""warrior"" part implies that they are not genuine, that they are simply using the guise of Social Justice to get attention. It's basically a feminism-specific word for attention whore.  The term later expanded to refer to the entire bad side of feminism, so SJW's are to feminism what /r/atheism is to atheism. It's the stupid people that don't think for themselves, are unopen to criticism and generally make the movement look bad. Every even semi-large group has these kinds of people. There are idiot democrats and idiot democrats and idiot republicans. There are idiot atheists and idiot believers. There are idiot feminists and idiot not-feminists. The point is to be aware of these people and not mistake them for the entire other side.  So at this point, the term is more or less ideology free. A feminist could theoretically call someone an SJW, similar to how I can call someone an /r/atheism-style idiot while being myself an atheist. The problem is that people on the other side of the ""debate"" started using this already pejorative term as an insult for all feminists. They do exactly what is important not to do: They conflate the idiots of the opposition for the entire opposition.   So now you have 3 meanings for one word, all used by different people under different circumstances. This immediately makes the word useless. People who try to use the word to deliver valid criticism get lumped with the meninists by the people they're criticizing. Their arguments dismissed. People who try to point out that a certain person might just be an attention whore get misunderstood as, again, meninists and their points, again, dismissed. And the meninists have effectively sabotaged all valid criticism of feminism by removing an essential word from the vocabulary of those critics who had at least a chance of being taken seriously.  This entire wall of text to say: Don't just dismiss people who use the word ""SJW"". Some of them might be reasonable people. It's just that their meaning of the word differs from yours."

nerdfighters,3apu7w,azlhiacneg,6,Mon Jun 22 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"I believe that a nerdfighter is anyone who wants to be a nerdfighter, and I think if we try to define it any other way then we start running into problems. No one is perfect, and the difference between nerdfighters and non-nerdfighters is that nerdfighters consciously WANT to decrease worldsuck and be made of awesome, and also identify as nerdfighters. How well we succeed at it will vary, and this is why you will find nerdfighters who seem to be doing things that go against what nerdfighteria is supposedly about - because we're not perfect, and sometimes people have clashing opinions or misunderstandings that turn into conflict.   As for the world sucking, I agree with you that overall, I don't think the world sucks. But there is always some suck in the world, and we would like to reduce that suck when possible.   I also think what you're saying about John Green has some truth to it. John acknowledges that there was a lot of luck involved in him getting famous, and that there are books of a similar quality to the books he writes that don't get nearly as much attention, and I agree with him on that. There are plenty of people who call themselves nerdfighters (myself included) who don't like every single thing that Hank and John have created. I don't even like John's books that much, but I like his personality a lot. It doesn't make you less of a nerdfighter, in my opinion."
nerdfighters,3apu7w,Sylvia3,3,Mon Jun 22 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Like the humans that make it up, the world is complicated. Lots of things are great, but lots of things are also terrible. Pretending that the terrible things don't exist is dishonest and further serves to disenfranchise those society exploits for profit and would treat as subhuman. Decreasing world suck is the attempt to not only unflinchingly look at these problems but work to find solutions."
nerdfighters,3apu7w,baudtack,2,Mon Jun 22 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"John's answer is a good one, why are you struggling with it? Don't let being made of flesh and blood stop you being a nerdfighter, and don't let it stop you from appreciating John and Hank despite their flaws. We all like different works of John's and Hank's more than others, why is that a problem? We're all meat people, being a nerdfighter is aspirational, we TRY to be made of awesome, even after screwing up, ESPECIALLY after screwing up. It's a determination not to forget to be awesome, it doesn't mean we're awesome all the time."
nerdfighters,3apu7w,rationalparty,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:42:32 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I've watched their videos for 5 or 6 years now. When I first found the channel, I went back and watched all the previous videos. I like them both. They seem like good people who genuinely want to use their influence for good. At the same time, though, I don't see myself as a Nerdfighter. I don't see the community as an all-inclusive, progressive force for good. For example, after a national tragedy like what just happened in Charleston or what happened in Baltimore or Ferguson, I don't see almost any response from the community. John was one of Time's 100 most influential people, but there's no video about this stuff (correct me if I'm wrong). On the flip side of things, my friends who have nothing to do with Nerdfighteria are all actively engaged in debates, reading articles, etc. I posted in this sub before about it, and I was scolded for expecting too much from them. People made all sorts of excuses, saying that they posted on Tumblr or whatever.   I don't know exactly what I'm trying to say here. I guess I'm just frustrated with this community that basically defines itself as trying to do good things and make bad things happen less, but at the same time won't stare bad things in the face and try to find a solution for them. And I know John and Hank do a ton of good stuff. I'm not accusing them of anything. It just seems to me that this is more of a fandom that leans toward benevolent actions than a community that's really about making the world a better place. I'm sure this will be unpopular, and maybe it doesn't really answer your question, but there you go."

(I'd like to add that Racism Is Not a Mental Illness.)  And here's another thing on the illegitimacy of that narrative.  Speaking as someone who lives with mental illness, I have many problems with the Charleston shooting being explained away by insisting he has mental illness-- particularly since there's no real proof of that beyond some people wanting to distance themselves from the shooter (insisting that THEY would never do anything like that). It's very frustrating that the only times our society even acknowledges that mental illness is a thing that exists is to explain away mass shootings like this. (Except sometimes we also use it to medicalize and dismiss certain marginalized people, like trans folk.)   I have serious doubts that What's His Face was mentally ill. But even if he was, it was not the reason he went out and killed nine people in a church. I really wish people would stop hiding behind the mental illness shield and look at this for what it really is-- disgusting, contemptible, violent white supremacy.  Edit: here's another article on how white shooters are characterized as ""mentally ill"" while black shooters are always called ""thugs.""

In all seriousness, though, the fact that he killed nine people is, in and of itself, self-evident proof that he was mentally ill. Unless you have some form of proof to the contrary, the evidence speaks for itself. You may not have stated that people in general can't both have a mental illness and be racist, but you most certainly have stated that Dylann Roof wasn't both racist and mentally ill, insisting instead that he is only racist. Until you offer proof to support your claim, a very firm application of Hitchens' Razor is in order here.   And also that framing the shooting in terms of mental illness does real, tangible harm to the country's mentally ill (the vast majority of whom, myself included, manage to go about their lives without killing people).   No one with an IQ greater than that of a sea sponge believes that, because of this incident, they ought to be more suspicious of others with diagnosed mental illness.

He's unqualified because that's the only substantial thing he's ever accomplished. He's not a psychologist, he's not a criminologist, he's not a researcher of any kind, he's not even a credible journalist! Chu's the type of person who participates in lynch mobs and media blitzes.   Between 1982 and 2012 there were 62 mass shootings in the US. 44 of them were white men.   You've never heard of a representative sample size, have you? That figure proves literally nothing.   Because the shooting was racially motivated   Yes, it was. Dylann Roof was a racist, and a disgusting one at that, and literally no one denies this.

Would it be the same if we charged him with one murder carrying the death penalty rather than genocide carrying the death penalty?  I'm going to say absolutely not.  Society owes the other victims the satisfaction of at least being recognized in his crimes.  Likewise, to fail to charge this kid with a hate crime ignores the crime he was trying to commit -- intimidating and victimizing all Black people.  This is his stated goal after all.  Clear as day.

I'm not sure if I agree with that idea that it isn't spoken about enough overall, and I'm not going to defend the details of the article or arthur chu. However, some reports for the Isla Vista killings did not go into details about the somewhat complex racial issues there - he seemed to struggle with the fact that he looks asian, not white like his father, while simultaneously having a hatred for asians.   Causality isn't always straightforward as racism is likely itself partially caused by tribal competitive instincts, as well as social reinforcement, but I don't think it should be controversial to say race and racism is a complicating factor. Rodger wrote hateful things and then killed asians while being half asian. There's underlying simplistic hate rhetoric going around - anyone could see it on the internet if they know where to look.   As for why this recent shooting probably should be prosecuted as a hate crime, look at what he wrote. If it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it probably is a duck."

Kids either going to get LWOP or CP already without the hate crime enhancements.  Legally its completely moot.  It's a duck alright, but the question is ""does it have feathers?"".

There definitely is evidence to claim he was a part of a system of learned supremacist hate ideology. For example in his published manifesto he said he had respect for east asian races but had a problem with jews and blacks. These are textbook nazi ideas. A google search reveals hate groups that still exist. America's dirty laundry exists, and its been dirty for a long time. This is not a rush.   You are probably an awesome person, but you should be careful to not sound like you're deflecting criticism of hate groups or racial issues. Criticism of these groups is not criticism of the white majority. These groups deserve pressure put on them, and so do people in the news who underreport."

But what I can't really understand is how John and Hank advocate for education, research and trying to decrease world suck, but if someone points out that something isn't accurate, that more research is needed, or a specific attempt to decrease world suck directly attributes to more world suck; this subreddit comes out with downvores and personal attacks.

See, this is the kind of thing we actually need to pay attention to, specifically, What was the killer's motivation, and would he have still killed if that motivation were not there. Is the motivation actually a motivation, or is it an outlet and an excuse.  If someone's broken enough upstairs in the way that they lack all human empathy, and have the desire to kill people, whether it be the perception of ""Doing good""(which seems to be disturbingly common in cases like these) or otherwise, they're going to find whatever they can to link to the reason of doing so. I've seen victims of all races, perpetrators of all races, and the like, and it always seems to be that the motivation is simply an easy outlet for the killer in question.  Sane people don't walk into buildings and kill a bunch of people they barely know(Well, aside from in the case of the extremist militants of the world, but those usually have very direct, very specific instructions to do so, not just broad sociological disdain). Hell, sane people don't typically walk into buildings and shoot people they DO know.   The kind of mental illness that can turn what is otherwise a relatively normal human being into a killer doesn't discriminate. It damages everyone equally, both those that are stricken by it, and those that become victims whenever someone of this nature directs their rage outwards."

Mental illness claims lives every single year. In most cases, they claim their own. Sometimes they claim others. It's easy to say ""It's ____"", to blame it on something in order to claim some sort of systemic issue, some connection, especially since it breeds outrage(And people like outrage) and it feeds into that human need to find patterns in things, but at the end of the day, these people with this serious an illness are the ones that don't fit the pattern. Perhaps that's why people are so unwilling to try and solve things, perhaps that's why people are so willing to blame things on everything else(Though I suspect that that's being doing so that people can point fingers and blame others), but at the end of the day, treatment of mental illness is a Societal condition. It's no one faction of us. It's All of us. We are all guilty of this, of marginalizing and of refusing assistance where it's due in terms of those in need that do not have the faculties to live safely, whether for themselves or for the people around them, and for claiming that mental illness is a weakness, or that going to a psyc is a weakness, or that using medications when it's needed is somehow abusive to children or something.   So let's stop pointing fingers for the sake of moral superiority. Write your congresspeople(for those in the US), and encourage funding for facilities to treat those in need. Mental illness may not be visible, but it has real-world casualties, constantly. And despite the horror stories of the past(Which were blown way out of proportion in many cases, or in others, patently false), larger facilities were, for a long time, far, far better for the treatment of the mentally ill, for addicts, and otherwise.   I'm not saying Racism doesn't exist in the US, of course it does, in all directions. Human compassion is a tricky thing to teach others, and breaking stereotypes and disassociating cultures from genetic markers is just something no one seems to be all that willing to do. Teaching people to be critical of their own associations is very, very difficult, and teaching people not to scream at something as a first instinctual reaction is just as hard to do.  I feel that a mark of a healthy society is to maintain empathy, even in cases of the worst of us, or of those of us that far too many people think of as beyond help. Let's do something positive out of this.   For those in the US, here is a link that can help you find your district representative. This is how we used to make change happen, by writing to our congresspeople.   http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/  You might just get a form letter response, but the point is, if enough people raise awareness for the shortfall in our mental health system, even if it saves just one life, that's one life saved. And there's no number that can be placed on that as far as how invaluable it is.   Edit Yes, I know, that last paragraph doesn't make much sense, and gets repetitive.

Yes, there are firearm shops that deal under the table, and there are firearm shops that don't perform the legally required background checks, but the checks themselves don't fail.

The jump from ""this dude says stuff I don't like sometimes"" to ""let's get the authorities to shut him down"" should not exist in a community like Nerdfighteria. We are not totalitarian, we're supposed to see people with empathy. Sure, he seems to be a depressed man who frequently says disagreeable stuff, but no, there is no reason to exclude him from the conversation. There is a downvote button for a reason: if you feel something is irrelevant, you can downvote it.  But there is no reason to call the mods on every dude that we slightly disagree with."

Also, just to clarify, I'm not saying that the mods should kick him out or anything--reading the sub rules, I think that their involvement would start with just telling him to cut it out.

nerdfighters,3alq3i,SJWDFTBA,2,Sun Jun 21 21:12:36 2015 UTC,Why?
nerdfighters,3alq3i,drapollo,4,Sun Jun 21 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"Because he writes self posts and comments that are baffling or confusing at best, and at worst display opinions that are sometimes harmful (like his Mental Illness comments irt the Charleston shooting). And when anyone responds with something he doesn't like, he lashes out. Seriously, go look at his comments over the past 24-48 hours.  I'm starting to believe that he's becoming a toxic influence in this community, and if I were a mod I'd ask him to leave (at least temporarily).  Edited to add: also if you look at this very text post, there is language that suggests he doesn't really consider himself a Nerdfighter, and is mostly being active in this sub as a way to build an audience for his forthcoming (???) vlogging channel. If that is indeed the case, then I have a problem with that. I'm all about people promoting their projects- and I've found a few new YouTubers this way- but if someone's only going to hang around for the sole purpose of goosing their viewer numbers, I have to wonder about how invested they are in this community. ESPECIALLY if they're also going to be aggressive and antagonistic toward other members."
nerdfighters,3alq3i,SJWDFTBA,3,Sun Jun 21 21:25:14 2015 UTC,"Because he writes self posts and comments that are baffling or confusing at best   Just downvote.   and at worst display opinions that are sometimes harmful (like his Mental Illness comments irt the Charleston shooting)   Opinions/information is not harmful to anyone. If you disagree with it, you are free to ignore it. He did not post anything against the subreddit's rules. Stating an unpopular opinion (or a negative opinion) is not against the rules of the subreddit. I also did not see anything in his posts that appears to be discriminatory or promote hate, but if there is something, I would like to see it.   I'm starting to believe that he's becoming a toxic influence in this community, and if I were a mod I'd ask him to leave (at least temporarily).   How is he a toxic influence? Everything he says is practically immediately downvoted to oblivion. If anything, he's given you guys a common enemy to bully.  Seriously, this just seems like a poor guy with some unpopular opinions. Give him a break.  edit: about your edit, looking at his post history it appears he actually contributes a lot to nerdfighteria as a nerdfighter, and only sometimes talks about his own stuff. he also has nothing to promote and it seems like his motivation to make videos will never come to fruition, so I don't think he will end up advertising anything.  (also, everyone in this community seems to hate him, so said advertising has no potential for success.)"
nerdfighters,3alq3i,drapollo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"Just downvote   But then someone will come along with a ""HEY GUYS WERE YOU WONDERING HOW ALEX DAY IS DOING??? WELL HERE'S AN UPDATE!"" post, it'll get downvoted, and then the OP (and a few other commenters) will complain about downvotes with no ""discussion."" So there's no way to win playing that particular game.   Opinions/information is not harmful to anyone   I've posted in other recent threads why I believe characterizing the Charleston shooter as ""mentally ill"" is damaging, and as a mentally ill person myself it's something I care about a lot. You're welcome to disagree, but I invite you to look at my past comments (check my history) to at least understand where I'm coming from.   If anything, he's given you guys a common enemy to beat on.   I'm not sure who exactly you're referring to with ""you guys,"" and I'm also not sure I fit into whatever cohort you're thinking of. I pretty much try to pretend this person doesn't exist-- I tried to interact with him and disagree reasonably and then he turned around and called me a ""stalker."" (Which is ironic, since he was so quick to side with John after some Tumblr rando called him ""creepy"" and was pretty verbose in calling out that kind of language. I guess it's okay when he does it.) But I participate in this sub too, and he's starting and escalating a lot of arguments here, and shows no signs of slowing down. So, yeah, I think maybe he could use a timeout."
nerdfighters,3alq3i,SJWDFTBA,3,Sun Jun 21 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"Hey I really do get what you're saying although I disagree, but it's probably not worth mine or your time to continue a debate over this, so I'll just reply quickly and we'll get this over with. You don't have to reply, I just wanted to clarify a few things.  about downvoting: downvoting is just a form of excluding irrelevant material, whether that includes alex day updates or personal rants. (for the record I think discussions on alex day are relevant to the community, but whatever, that's okay.)  about mentally ill stuff: I'm sure you know more about this than me, seeing as I don't think I'm technically mentally ill, just normal old sad and lonely, but I actually read a bit of your back-and-forth and although I don't necessarily agree with him, I don't think his opinions are harmful or bad or anything.  By ""you guys"" I'm referring to anyone who seems to think we should be giving him special negative treatment based on the fact we disagree with his opinions. I included you because you're suggesting a temporary ban.  Stalker stuff: yeah, again, I agree that some of his opinions may be weird or unpleasant. I don't see it as grounds for thought policing, though.  this all just boils down to the fact that I think Nerdfighteria is a mature enough community to allow diversity in opinion, and that we don't need external help from authority to exclude people we disagree with."
nerdfighters,3alq3i,drapollo,2,Sun Jun 21 21:45:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, on all points. I definitely agree with you on Downvote-And-Move-On. I just get frustrated with people who cry about being ""censored"" or ""bullied"" with downvotes and then turn around and mass-downvote someone else because they don't like them. I haven't been here that long but I've already seen it in this sub way too much.  And to clarify, I'm not talking a ban- temporary or otherwise- because of his opinions, but because of his behavior. Specifically the aggressive and antagonistic tone he's been taking with anyone who disagrees with him, as well as his self-posts. A really good example is this post he made just a few minutes ago in response to that ""On Racism"" thing being deleted. That post is not contributing to the community, it's escalating a fight."
nerdfighters,3alq3i,SJWDFTBA,4,Sun Jun 21 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough back at ya. Really enjoyed this pleasant discussion, you don't normally run into people in the Internet that you disagree with and can still talk to. Hope to see you around this community more!"
nerdfighters,3alq3i,drapollo,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you taking the time to understand. Few others have, and with the present zeitgeist in this sub, I imagine that few have the desire to be bothered to try.   I'm kind of used to this sort of behavior. I've seen it in every single community out there, I watched a lot of people become absolute monsters to one another over the past year in the gamers versus journalists nonsense, and pretty much every other time something sets people apart on the net, I've watched people that hold themselves up as ""Righteous"" perform some of the most foul acts possible.   Earlier today, I watched them drive a person, speaking as a historically oppressed minority, off the sub completely for daring to speak against the norm.   Throughout the past year, I've watched people dehumanize one another throughout tumblr, throughout twitter, throughout reddit, pretty much everywhere. And it was worst from ALL sides. But it neatly encompassed the fact that apparently no matter where you go, there will be someone willing to use the language of social justice to dehumanize you for their own social benefit, and for the stability of their own insular ideology.   I fully intend to create content. But it sure as hell won't be for this sub. Thankfully there are several communities of Nerdfighters, at least three of which have openly stated that this sub is a bit of a public embarrassment as far as Nerdfighteria is concerned. I for one don't hold that view completely, I feel that the sub is redeemable in a major way, that people could perhaps learn to see others as more than just pawns in their social climbing exercise. Another member of this sub has stated that I am setting myself up for disappointment for thinking so, but I try to be optimistic.  That said, the message I received not too long ago that stated that if I started creating content under this name, my life would be in danger? Really does just neatly drive the point home that something is very, very wrong."
nerdfighters,3alq3i,nerdfighter123,2,Sun Jun 21 23:06:10 2015 UTC,I'm worried that he is suffering depression or something like that. I think ignoring him might not be the best solution.

I didn't downvote this post, but also I have no idea who you are or why you feel the need to defend yourself, and as a casual I don't really care. More power to you if you create stuff, though.  I'm mostly here for one-click stuff - a link to a video or a funny picture.   So, maybe, just maybe, your downvotes are coming from people who don't know who you are, don't care, and just happened upon a wall of defensive text which seems completely unrelated to the actual topic of the sub?"

Spam filtering (if done well) means that people who don't want to listen don't have to. Censorship is preventing people expressing their opinion to others that want to hear it."
nerdfighters,3af3nx,AbstergoSupplier,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:27:27 2015 UTC,"Censorship is preventing people expressing their opinion to others that want to hear it.   That's certainly one part of the censorship definition but I'd say there's more to it than that. For example nudity and extreme violence are censored of daytime TV, but there are no doubt people who want to watch Game of Thrones at 2pm; Steam (the gaming platform) censor hate speech in the videogames and in most cases when they've used that power of censorship, people have had no problem with it.  Basically my point overall is that censorship has become something of a dirty word and the nuance of it is often overlooked. Censorship in and of itself isn't bad, there's just good censorship and bad censorship."
nerdfighters,3af3nx,trixter21992251,4,Sat Jun 20 13:42:06 2015 UTC,Spam isn't a person expressing their opinion.  It's automated advertising posted/sent by companies.   I honestly don't see how you can compare the two.

It could be about Facebook. It could be about Twitter. It could be about YouTube comments, or comment moderation on any blog, anywhere. It's probably about all of the above."
nerdfighters,3af3nx,intravenus_de_milo,-3,Fri Jun 19 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm about to find out how my opinion fares among nerdfighters, but I was a big fan of fatpeoplehate.  Yes, brigading is wrong, ban those people. Yes, exposing/mocking people without their consent is wrong, ban those too. But the core -similar to atheism, shitamericanssay etc. - making fun of broken logic was great fun. I'm happy /r/fatlogic survived.   And that's the main point: fatlogic wasn't banned. That means it was the brigading and personal pictures that got fatpeoplehate banned. Not the general opposition against being fat.  And that's where a lot of people are wrong. They use the banning of fatpeoplehate to argue that being fat is fine. But fatpeoplehate wasn't banned for being against obesity. It was banned for brigading outside the subreddit and posting pictures without consent.   So reddit is not against being opposed to obesity. So if Hank is referring to fatpeoplehate, then he isn't necessarily saying it's wrong to be against obesity."

I've never read this rationale anywhere.  It was banned for actively harassing people, not having a point of view.  But to the point of view -- part of free speech is free association, and no one owes anyone a platform to exercise bigotry of any kind.  With any luck Reddit in the future will shut down a lot of hate subreddits; I certainly don't like associating with them on this website, and I certainly will never give this site any money as long as they do."

At regular intervals, or when there is a significant change (i.e., scene cut), the full frame is sent.  If you don't get one index frame, then you'll get Delta frames that don't actually do anything coherent to your existing frame, and you completely fail out and get artifacts like this."

nerdfighters,3a52dz,jetsethi,2,Wed Jun 17 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"The point isn't whether or not you feel outrage. The point is whether or not you feel outrage over what is effectively nothing. Someone in another state or country saying something to other people in another state or country that has no chance of altering policy or even cultural doctrine in any way should not cause a person more outrage than the fact that people still, in the nations of abundance, starve to death every year.  Deciding whether or not you should be outraged over something someone said, and whether it deserves more attention than actually decreasing suck in the world, is much like deciding whether Honey Boo Boo deserves the same attention, or the Briefcase, or the Kardashians, or whatever. It should be a no-brainer. One of those two things will affect absolutely nothing in the long run, the other can help to make life better for a person who is suffering."

nerdfighters,3a52dz,SJWDFTBA,5,Wed Jun 17 08:02:00 2015 UTC,"That's all fine, but really doesn't address the issue you're trying to solve. Often the best way to get past a bias, or a conflict with another group is to meet people in that community. Once you can put a face on    an issue, its usually no longer an extreme. You probably still won't agree with them, but at least your grounded in that these are people, and not an abstraction your upset with. So, my suggestion would be not to silo yourself if you can. Meet other people than ones that share all of your interests."

nerdfighters,3a52dz,SJWDFTBA,-2,Wed Jun 17 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, a few thing here, as there's a lot to unpack.  1: This is not debate class. This is real life. There is a distinct difference, and the constant grinding on arbitrary rules of ""Debate"" on what is effectively a call to action, and Not a request for yet another pedantic internet argument, is boring, ineffective, and does not work to solve problems in any way. However, if you wish to cling to debate rules, I suggest looking up ""Argument from Fallacy"".  2: Stalking from thread to thread attempting to discount a person's position is more than a little bit creepy, and speaks volumes to many, many different problems in question. For instance, you have a lot of time on your hands. Do something productive with it.  3: ""Outrage Culture"", as you condescendingly quoted, exists, and it exists Everywhere. It's the reason people wait for any excuse to jump on anyone they can, especially successful people. It's the reason John got attacked through Tumblr. It's the reason that news sites constantly run stories they know to be false. It's the reason that ""Critics"" are still, to this day, flipping out that Doom 4 will have violence in it. Outrage generates clicks. Clicks generate ad revenue. And yes, I don't let that go, because serious social concerns that act as an effective barrier in the fight towards ensuring that discussion is consistent, open, and perpetual(Hence the name). The constant pedantry towards the mindset of ""JUMP ON THAT PERSON"", rather than ""Discuss with people"", the consistent issue of stating things people know are false solely so they can hear the other person deny it? That's Outrage Culture. It seeks out outrage, it clings to outrage, and when it can't think of anything else to be outraged about, it Creates outrage from nothing. And if you think that is somehow more important to focus on than the idea of ensuring that, in these nations of incredible abundance wherein we have cities built in deserts, piping water in to stay functional, hosting daily buffets that go Mostly uneaten, and yet, we have hundreds of thousands on the street, digging through the garbage for food, that the people who need it most get help, and the people that Can should find ways to pass that help along? Your priorities, they need to be realigned somewhat, I feel.  If you truly work for ""Social Justice"", then tell me something. Why do you fight against social change that would work towards helping those in need? Why do you cling to the language of social justice in methods of maintaining divisive nonsense, rather than working to make the world better?  You forgot TBA. Don't."

nerdfighters,3a2xpy,chaotically-diverse,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"The beverage industry did indeed have a big part in it, I imagine, as it's way, WAY cheaper to just melt down and reuse old cans than it is to stripmine new bauxite. Aluminum's cool that way, you can melt and reform it repeatedly without losing too much in terms of structural integrity, and the non-aluminum slag will float to the top of the melted metal, easily scooped off.  That said, there was one guy at the center of the US push for curbside recycling, and for his work, he got a huge paycheck from the US government after a lengthy diatribe about a garbage barge named something like the Mobro 5000. His story went on and on about how the barge was going up and down the east coast because it couldn't find a landfill to dump its garbage, because they must all be full. Well, turns out, that wasn't true at all. See, the barge was actually going from New York to the south, because the landfills there charged far less for dumping than any NY landfill did. Well, turns out, the landfills in VA and FL got wise to this eventually, and eventually turned the barge away, forcing them to return to NY to dump their load. None of the landfills in question were full, it just turned out to be a bit of shady business that got put to an end.   Don't get me wrong, I'm all for recycling when it works. Recycled bottles are really quite smart, as they can be cleaned and sterilized easily enough if they're still whole. Recycled cans? Awesome. Recycled steel cans? Awesome too. Salvaged and stripped auto parts? WOOT. Except here in the US, we're very, very bad at all of those things.  Deposit-based can return machines shatter all bottles that come in. Automotives are shredded for the steel mills, leaving countless amounts of materials that could be salvaged in other ways, up to and including copper, platinum, and other much, much more expensive metals. Paper is pulped and leaves behind a downright toxic residue of paper dyes, inks, and other materials that is very difficult to get rid of safely. And even with all that in mind, depending on where in the country you are, all the sorting and such that you do doesn't matter all that much in the end, as it all gets batch-dumped on a reclamation facility, sorted by low-wage workers and, if there's oil or food products of any kind on the material to be recycled, in many cases, it'll just get landfilled anyway.  Cans make sense. Bottles Would make sense if we didn't just shatter them all(Cola is great at that, their bottles are hard to break, and stand up to a lot of punishment. Beer bottles, not so much). The list goes on. But it's not a magic bullet."
nerdfighters,3a2xpy,InevitablyPerpetual,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:41:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Recycling isn't nearly so effective as we want to believe it is. What I found interesting is that, historically, it was really just a way for beverage companies to continue making their cheaper bottling products (plastic and metal cans), while also appeasing the public outcry - not for landfill use, but for cleaning up the streets that they themselves had dumped their empty cans into. It was actually wildly successful in that regard. Plus, they did it while getting the Fed to foot the bill!"

His response was that what punk is really about is the DIY approach to doing things, particularly outside the mainstream, and that punk would never be dead as long as that went on. Which basically means that Hank is as punk as punk can be and Nerdfighteria is basically helping keep punk alive."

nerdfighters,39wflx,mjt1226,3,Mon Jun 15 12:08:09 2015 UTC,"Of course. But that is my opinion. Gay marriage is a struggle of those with the stability and financial means to get married, and want it to legally count. Trans acceptance is much more a question of physical safety and people's lives. Therefore I rate it as more important."
nerdfighters,39wflx,whatstheonething,5,Mon Jun 15 13:14:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but a simple counter argument would say that Gay Marriage affects more people than Trans Acceptance.

nerdfighters,39wflx,armedrobbery,2,Mon Jun 15 18:28:54 2015 UTC,"I don't. I think cishet society is more willing to extend privilege to cis gay people who are 'normal' enough, rather than examine why such privilege exists.

The result was that no "".de""-domain worked for half a day for all users unable to identify the issue and configure an alternate DNS server that still had valid caches of the domains (like google's 8.8.8.8).  If you can somehow take down all root servers, you would break a lot of stuff for a couple of hours or maybe days. But that is practically impossible.

nerdfighters,39xd8k,runalovegood,5,Tue Jun 16 05:30:20 2015 UTC,In no way should anyone online tolerate incredible hatred. We all as a community online need to disincentivize hatred. How we do this though is a trickier question rooted in how websites survive and thrive. Is there an easy fix? No. There most certainly isn't. The best we can do is to work towards global social change and teach OUR CHILDREN that IT IS NOT OK TO HARASS OTHERS EVEN IF IT'S NOT IN PERSON! Given a generation or so we should leap the hurdle without chilling free speech.
nerdfighters,39xd8k,Zazie_Lavender,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"I've seen hate come from all sides of the free speech debate, it's troubling in a big way. One side says free speech foments hate, but they're just as guilty of harassing, doxing, stalking, or threatening anyone that disagrees with them, the other believes they should be able to say anything, no matter how horrible, to anyone. And if I'm honest, all if it is wildly depressing in a big way to see happen."
nerdfighters,39xd8k,InevitablyPerpetual,4,Tue Jun 16 06:26:08 2015 UTC,"Answer: As long as it keeps generating clicks, and as long as there is zero consequence. Seriously, many people go to sites like Tumblr because they want to be assholes to other people. They get off on the superiority they feel from trashing others.

nerdfighters,39xd8k,SJWDFTBA,-2,Mon Jun 15 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"Seems to be a pretty large number. I'd say the majority of Tumblr is inhabited by fandoms, strange porn, and people that thumb their noses at anything anyone else does, calling it Sexist, Racist, Misogyny, Harassment, Microaggression, or any other term they can redefine for outrage's sake."
nerdfighters,39xd8k,InevitablyPerpetual,3,Tue Jun 16 05:24:58 2015 UTC,"Whoops. I was on your side until this comment. Keep in mind the difference between being 'offended' and being hurt. You don't get to just say whatever you want. If it hurts people (say by being racist or misogynistic) you will at the very least face the repercussion of someone telling you to shut it. You are not the victim in this scenario. As much as some take it too far, comments like this make it seem like social justice types are just being upset for the sake of it."
nerdfighters,39xd8k,whatstheonething,0,Tue Jun 16 05:50:19 2015 UTC,"The problem, and in fact the great tragedy, is that the social justice types often scream misogyny about all sorts of things that, let's be frank, aren't. Additionally, there's a growing trend in telling women that they're being the wrong kind of woman, up to and including some social justice types openly stating that Choice is not compatible with their particular brand of social justice. At that point, it's no longer about justice, it's then about control. And that's never okay.  Using outrage to control others is not alright. If there are REAL instances of such things, then yes, we need to address them without hesitation. The difference in thought being, if there are real instances IN ANY DIRECTION, we need to address them just the same, whether that be injustices in law enforcement regarding youths of color, or the injustice of a university's Diversity officer stating that white people weren't welcome.   Racism/Sexism isn't just suddenly okay if it's done in the other directions. Two wrongs Never make a right, and the growing trend in the social justice movement is to paint anyone that they deem ""Privileged""(a theory based entirely on judging a person based on their gender or skin color, by the way) as worthy of being marginalized, disenfranchised, and otherwise treated like garbage."
nerdfighters,39xd8k,InevitablyPerpetual,2,Tue Jun 16 06:09:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of this, but then you talk about 'reverse racism/sexism'. Racism and sexism aren't just discrimination, they're discrimination backed by huge societal forces."
nerdfighters,39xd8k,whatstheonething,0,Tue Jun 16 07:07:06 2015 UTC,"That's as may be, but ""Reverse"" racism/sexism does not exist. If you are making your decisions about a person regarding their race or sex? Then you are a racist or a sexist, respectively. Seriously. There's been this great push amongst the Tumblr communities of frothing-at-the-mouth SJW types that actively tries to redefine what Racism, Sexism, Classism, and the like, actually are. People that actively work to attempt to change what it means when we say ""That's actually very racist/sexist/whatever"", specifically so they can say that they Aren't that, when in reality, they really are. The phrase ""It's okay when I do it, but not when you do it"" seems to cover it neatly.   It's not okay. For anyone. And all it does, regardless of ""Societal Forces"", is generate and foment further anger between races/sexes/otherwise. All it does is prevent people from working together, from collaborating, from working towards a better world, a better life, and a better society.   You'd be surprised how many people have similar ideological backgrounds in regards to what they want. Equality for All, in All ways, equal opportunity and equal respect, equal understanding and equal kindness. The understanding that all people will be assumed innocent of a crime before they are assumed guilty regardless of their race or sex, that people will receive equal treatment of sentencing, and that considerations of gender will Never be taken into account in court proceedings, whether that be in prosecuting a rape case, or in delineating custody. But so many people are so heavily focused on whether or not they're part of ""This"" group, or ""That"" group, so focused on whether or not someone takes your title, that getting that work done together becomes almost impossible.   The heavy mindset of ""You're for us or you're against us"" permeates these cultures powerfully, and it does not help Anyone at all to hang on those things, in any way.   The world is bigger than titles. The world is bigger than named ideologies. And everyone. Everyone is going to need to drop their interideological hatred in order to make that world a better place for all."
nerdfighters,39xd8k,InevitablyPerpetual,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:37:57 2015 UTC,"(And the inevitable problem is that many of the folks doing this know full-well they're not actually addressing real-world issues, only narrow perceptions. Ultimately their goal is to generate a world ruled by fear, wherein people second-guess every single thing they say or do for fear of it being blown out of proportion through Tumblr, Twitter, or other sites wherein people actively seek out reasons to be outraged over any tiny detail they can. And that's not the kind of world I've fought to nurture, nor is it, I imagine, the kind any of you have. I for one do not relish in the idea of living in a world where people are so scared of offending anyone that no art is created, no songs sung, no statements made, and where everyone fears the hanging Sword of Damocles wherein anyone that wants to take offense, no matter how much of a reach it is to get there, to anything you say or do can turn a successful life into a life forever locked in poverty for yourself, your family, and anyone that dares associate with you.  It's Bullying, nothing more, but instead of calling people names, it's manipulating the emotional responses to certain words and phrases for their own gain, and ultimately, everyone's loss.)"

Then you don't have an accurate picture of what Tumblr is actually like. Fandom communities are a big part of Tumblr, yes. There's some porn-- I don't see a lot of it, but it's no more common there than, like, the rest of the internet. And your third point just tries to paint a wide swath of Tumblr users as ""evil SJWs."" Speaking AS an ""SJW"" myself, I don't much appreciate your broad and uninformed characterization of people who care about social justice as frothing keyboard warriors addicted to ""outrage.""   Most of what I see that is concerned about social justice is more about supporting each other than attacking others. There are a lot of people on Tumblr who are members of marginalized groups-- race, gender identity, socioeconomic class, ability, mental illness, etc. Many of these people on Tumblr use the platform to talk about their daily lived experience as members of a marginalized group and how, in both one-on-one interactions and in interactions with institutions and abstract social structures, they are routinely shat upon. And on that platform, they find people who have similar experiences, and people who face different struggles but stand in solidarity with them. On Tumblr, people who otherwise have no support and no voice have found both. I don't know what all that looks like to you, but I suspect this is an instance of you refusing to Imagine Others Complexly-- which, coincidentally, is what those trolls did last week when they called John a pedo.  But hey, you want to talk about toxic culture in online communities? Let's start right here."

The author owns the canon version of that character, and they're not obligated to change anything about the way it's written. The readers own the versions of the character that they imagine, and they can make the characters do whatever they want to in their own minds. There ends up being multiple versions of every character in fan fiction. Some authors don't like the idea that fan fiction of their characters exists, but I think that goes against the ""books belong to their readers"" principle. That's how I see it."

Are there nonprofits against bullying/cyber-bullying that are aimed at a wider audience than youth/teenagers?

You'd probably lobby central government in order to get or avoid having certain types of energy production situated in your area.  Citizens like the jobs it brings, but they generally hate having  a power station or wind farm on their backdoor.  ...actually that would be an interesting mechanic to have in a city builder.  Might work better in a multiplayer setup where multiple players are using the same centralized pool of power production and production has to be shared around.  You could extend it to all the utilities, really.    Now I'm just imagining a city builder with an on-line mode which is essentially a country builder game where you get to decide whether utilities and infrastructure should be privately run, publicly run, or some PPP hybrid...mashup of Democracy 3 and Cities Skylines.

I am a survivor of an abusive relationship, and one of the ways my abuser would manipulate me was to tell me ""no one else will love you, they will just tell you what you want to hear to use you and throw you away. They only want you for sex.""   It was his way of keeping me tied to him, under his control. It made me feel useless and unwanted. Like I was worthless. It was a horrible existence and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.   I find it despicable that rape and rape culture has become this political statement and social justice battle. It isn't a culture of rape, it was one man with bad intentions that did what he did to me. He was wrong because he was wrong, not because society told him it was okay, or because he was raised to think he could. He doesn't get an excuse to be an abuser he just is one.   And when people like that Tumblr guy accuse good men (or women) like John of such horrible things because ""it's the thing to do"" it just pisses me off that much more. This is a real thing that hurts millions of people every year. An accusation that could ruin someone's life. And that person who dares to even ""joke"" about it is the lowest example of humanity."

Also, I agree with you that there's a good chance the author of that hateful tumblr post wasn't someone who realistically believed their theory about John, but rather that they were simply promoting the most damaging idea they could come up with, with the intent of destroying John's image and/or bringing attention to themselves.

I figured if by some stroke of luck he sees it, it might help him to be reminded that for every mean-spirited person trying to bring him down, there are thousands of others who have been positively influenced in some way by his work and his ongoing efforts to make this world a better place, and that we are willing to share that positivity with those around us and pay it forward. Anyways, I decided to add the hashtag #BecauseOfJohn in hopes that others might like the idea and join along. My tweet went as follows: ""@johngreen I now think twice about what I say online and always remember that behind every computer screen is a human being #BecauseOfJohn"". It's not much, but It's honest and I hope in some small way it helps."

But professionally I am a librarian and the YA librarians I've talked to hold him in high regard.   He's always interacted with his fans with candour and sensitivity. The guy doesn't deserve death threats or any form of intimidation, really. He's a family man with a social conscience, a talent with words and an inclination for philanthropy.

I know there was some controversy over him using the word ""retarded"" in one of his novels. Part of it is because they think it's creepy that he aims his books toward YA audiences (hence the insinuation that he's a pedophile), others say that he's at fault for having POC and/or gay characters only as side characters, others are mad about his privilege (I've never really understood that argument). I think he was also getting criticized for casting choices in the movies based off his books. Oh, people were also mad about his use of Anne Frank and the Anne Frank house in his book.   A lot of it seems like people just trying to be angry combined with herd mentality."

For a lot of these people it's just a general frustration with all of the praise John and his work gets which they might not think is deserved and often those feelings get reflected on to John himself. Remember that whole fiasco where John said that he couldn't remember seeing a girl kiss a guy in a movie or something like that? I saw quite a few people on Tumblr being like, ugh, there goes John Green again, thinking he's the savior of young adult literature! Even if as fans of his we obviously don't share those attitudes, you can sort of see how these things develop, right? I know there are celebrities that I didn't care for and then later realized that I didn't have a very accurate picture of who they were as people and was too easily swayed by popular opinion (Taylor Swift? Kristen Stewart?). I didn't get to know more about them at the time because I thought I already knew that I didn't like them. It's that whole idea of imagining people complexly that John likes to talk about it--we all suck at it.  What has happened to John now with this Tumblr post is sort of that taken to a particularly awful extreme. The people expressing those opinions have this idea of John that has probably snowballed over time and they just aren't thinking of him realistically and respectfully as an actual human being."

nerdfighters,39lvv0,forgettableme,2,Sat Jun 13 07:36:22 2015 UTC,"I remember back when I was in 8th grade and all the girls were fawning over New Kids on the Block. The guys hated them. Why? Cause the girls liked them. Pretty much that's what it was.   John's books are young adult, and popular with females because of the subject matter (not to mention the fact that boys don't read as much as girls in general).   So you have teenagers trying to get the attention of the girls, and seeing them fawning over this author who isn't bad looking, and is a great guy in general, and what do you do? Oh ya, you talk shit to your other friends because f that guy.   Only now it isn't on the play ground or in chat rooms. Now it's on Tumblr and twitter where the guy can see it. Now they are talking about someone who actually sees the messages and talks back to people. Now they can even go to his house and take a picture to threaten his kid.   Sadly, this isn't anything new. It's just new to us because before John was just a fellow nerdfighter. One of THEE nerdfighters, the origin of the group, but still one of us.   Sadly... I don't think he can be one of us, at least not in the same level, anymore. It isn't safe for him or his family. And as much as I hate to see things change from the highly interactive place it was, I know that his family is far more important than keeping nerdfighteria as it use to be."

nerdfighters,39libd,nerdfighterbot,12,Fri Jun 12 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"This is partially a chicken and egg thing, because why have those administrator salaries been able to rise so much?  I've hear fairly convincing arguments from conservatives that this has been a natural free-market thing:     Colleges are run as businesses, so compete their price down to the level the market will bear - this is i.e. the ability to students to pay   Students (especially those not from wealthy families) have trouble paying this 'going rate' and thankfully the government stepped in with grants and student loan programs suddenly the college businesses discovered the ability for students to pay was rising, and so they raised prices because they could. Repeat from point 2.   In this way of thinking, student loans are so terribly high because they are simply what people are willing to pay for a college education. It really has very little to do with the quality of the education, what the teachers get paid etc - those are consequences of the college budgets which in turn are the result of the above process. Rather, college is so expensive because colleges could reliably count on the state-backed spending power of students.  Where conservatives go wrong (in my opinion) is with the idea that it would all be much better if the government didn't interfere by offering these loans. Rather, the take-away should be that it's unwise to place governmental pressure on one side of the scale, without controlling for it's tipping.  In many European countries the loan/grant amounts render college almost or completely free, not because the grants are much higher, but because the governments limit the maximum tuition, keeping rampant costs under control and spending at a reasonable level."

nerdfighters,39libd,yolomatic_swagmaster,2,Fri Jun 12 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that this explanation sounds accurate, but I think it shows that the supply and demand model doesn't work with education. People need education much in the same way as healthcare. Someone without education is more or less dead-weight on society and can't function properly. College can charge what it likes and people need it to get into the jobs. The Government needs people in these jobs, so they give people incentives to go into the jobs. The Colleges are abusing this in-elasticity in demand by charging what they likes. Proper regulation would prevent this, while a libertarian response could result in education breaking.  Note: Not an expert, just like everyone else."
nerdfighters,39libd,Hazzardevil,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"The issue of how to handle education as a society has always escaped me, in part because of its complexity, but also because of how I view education. To me education is just learning, so if there is something I want or need to learn, I go and learn by whatever means, especially now that I have amazing online resources. Do I need to get better in math? There's Khan Academy. Do I need to learn Portuguese? I can learn the basics and start reading books in Portuguese. What ever it is, I feel there's a solution, and more often than not, it by passes education. The value of our institutions is in the degree we walk away with, but the actually developing an understanding of anything is ultimately on us. Because of this, I feel we could go really far just on a good public library system, but this is my bias as an autodidact."

nerdfighters,39libd,Hazzardevil,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:26:58 2015 UTC,"You're totally right, but that doesn't mean that the only useful education is the one that produces a degree, even if the information is traditionally taught in classes. I think computer science and IT are great examples of this. While you could get a bachelor's in IT, what the world actually wants is someone who can fix their computers, so all you need to do is prove your education via past work or certificates. It's much more malleable than, say, an academic position. I think we sometimes underestimate what we can do without a degree."
nerdfighters,39libd,yolomatic_swagmaster,8,Sat Jun 13 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"As a student services professional, I'd like to take the time to talk about my experiences in higher education. Because I think Hank misses some important points. I'm going to try and not write a novel (I've already written enough on the subject getting my degrees!), but this might get long.   Student services, also know as student affairs at some institutions, is a relatively new field in higher education. In the early days of the colonial colleges faculty often served in multiple roles to help keep colleges and universities open. When higher education opened up to public after WW2, the number of students attending exploded. As did the number of services needed to keep everything together. On top of that, student development theories emerged in the 60s that shifted some of the ways in which administrators viewed learning and how they supported it. But since then, state support has been drastically reduced.  Student affairs is a field that covers a lot of the jobs that faculty do not have time to do (while they chase tenure and do research, teaching, and service) or that they just plain do not want to do. We help ensure that schools are accredited and compliant with state and federal regulations (financial aid is a beast!). We offer tutoring and academic support like advising to students. We engage students in experiential learning opportunities like service-learning to get them to think complexly. We provide counseling and medical services for students. We host multicultural and diversity centers to help support minority students and challenge majority students on important issues. We council student groups and help minimize legal issues, especially in areas where the courts have mandated that institutions are liable (greek affairs is a big one!). We help students in crisis and are there to guide them through the transitions that they face as they become adults.  Much like it's faculty counterparts, entry and mid-level professionals (who more often than not have advanced degrees) are overworked and under-paid.   The ""climbing wall effect"" is real, but it's not as outrageous as the hype seems for most institutions. The biggest offenders seem to be small, private colleges that need to act more like businesses to maintain enrollment numbers. Certainly a state institution has less leeway in adding fancy features due to state oversight.  I'd argue that the main forces behind ""administrative bloat"" are college presidents and athletic directors/coaches who have multi-million dollar salaries.   In all of my research on the subject, it is clear that a well supported student has a better chance of graduating with a degree, and a lot of student affairs works to provide that support so that faculty members can get down to business with creating new knowledge. Both fields are important.  I also think that /u/TurielD makes a great point. Education has often been touted as a lighting rod to overcoming institutional barriers associated with poverty and many families see the cost of higher ed as a necessary evil needed to access the benefits. We are just now having national conversations about college access and where that tipping point is in society.  TL;DR: I would argue that there has been an increase in institutions providing  support services to students as well as academics and that's not a bad thing. I think we need to continue conversations about college access and debt because they are important, but we shouldn't minimize the efforts of folks working to support students and help keep institutions open.  *Edit for grammar."

That number turns out to be way, WAY lower in those cases, even for full time profs. One of ours confessed to us at one point that he was earning in the ballpark of 35k, and he was the lottery-selected department chair for that year. And yet, tuition even in community colleges is going absolutely insane.  Perhaps what's worse is that these community colleges are so eager to cut their course load. Now, it varies from department to department, but in the department I just left at the CC I attend? They had a mandatory class cancellation for every course that wasn't within five seats of being Full by the time one week before the class hit.   Sufficed to say, it was bad in every direction. Just one of the many, MANY reasons I left that department, not the least of which being that the department had recently made the decision to increase their maths prerequisites because ""Students that get higher scores in math just make more attentive students"", as one instructor explained. They weren't bumping the requirement because the material needed it, they were doing it to pad out their pass/fail metrics. And given the quality of instruction involved, it wasn't going to help."

See, the vast chunk of student loan spending these days comes in the form of additional expenses. Specifically, living expenses. And Rent has gone, for lack of a better term, batshyte insane lately. Now, with this in mind, students depend heavily on those loans to be able to pay that rent. Make college free? Suddenly the student loan program sees no reason to exist in many cases. ""Why do you need student loans? Your college is free"". Suddenly that student can't afford rent. And while they no longer have to fulfill a full-time requirement, which means they can cut classes to work during that time to make the difference(It won't be enough), it will mean that their time to graduate suddenly increases tenfold.  And yes, I know, some students work while in college. Not everyone can. Not every program is designed to be able to handle that kind of workload.  I'm all for Sanders, and I'm all for dealing more directly with educational institutions in order to force costs down and maintain quality of education while making those programs free for students. I'm all for investing in our future(And in terms of the future of our workforce, by my estimates, about 75 million people working today will be out of a job in 10 years due to automation alone). But it's something that requires nuance. A living stipend would go a Long way.   As with all things, it's complicated. :)"

Yes, a large amount of his following is female, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's pandering to them. I would actually suggest his work is mainly aimed at adults - a key theme within all of his novels is that teenagers should be viewed complexly, something he's argued some adults fail to understand. I think on a smaller scale his work is quite like 'The Catcher in the Rye' - aimed at adults, but commonly mistook to be aimed at a younger demographic, while John's is more universal.  God forbid, an adult remind people that they are important and to feel comfortable with who they are. Is it such a horrible thing now for a person to want to make someone ""feel important""? Should we instead put people down and make them feel unimportant? I fail to see how this is ""weird"", this is something we should all strive to do.   Moreover, the person literally displayed the whole motive behind this when they stated, ""lets get this enough notes so he has to address it and try to defend himself lmao"" - their whole aim seems to be to spark a reaction from John.

I agree that he does not pander specifically to teenagers, or to girls in particular.  In fact, I believe there are a lot of ""guy jokes"" in his first three novels.  (Like the beer sword in Paper Towns...)  But there are real, legitimate reasons that people would perceive that his work is ""for teens,"" and anyone who has no idea what sort of life he actually lives and what causes he genuinely works for could easily see Hazel as an attempt to pander towards girls in particular."

Agreed. I read LFA and identified a lot of the humour and dialogue to rely on ""guy jokes"" in contrast to TFiOS. I think his work is categorised as being aimed at a female audience purely because TFiOS drew in such a huge audience, and many of the most vocal of those were teenage girls  I also agree with your point on Hazel. I think, however, what those people fail to note is that Hazel is an honest representation and readers, of both genders, can relate to her, despite the chances being they're not a person suffering with cancer who is in love with another person with cancer, because her thoughts and feelings are utterly familiar to us.

The movie, in the UK at least, did seem to be marketed towards a female audience - again, if you watch 'Teens React' to the trailer one of the guys is shocked by how 'girly' it is, which definitely agrees with what you said!"

nerdfighters,39j1n2,TurielD,7,Fri Jun 12 03:19:48 2015 UTC,"An ironic statement, given John specifically pointed out the attacks coming from the people using 'social justice' as a bludgeon."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,heychrisfox,2,Fri Jun 12 09:20:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly how he meant that, he talked about using the language of social justice, but not exactly how. The post, as I read it, didn't sound very much like the language of social justice as I know it. There are people, however, who continually attack John on Tumblr for things he never did or said, or for things he said in very old Vlogbrothers videos that he's clearly learned were wrong and apologized for. So I'm not sure this particular post was in that line somehow. It did read more like it was written by an an anti-SJW sort of person, to me at least."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,TurielD,2,Fri Jun 12 13:32:54 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he meant ""the language of social justice"" in the context of using public discourse to uplift an issue, but within the discussion he was presenting, he meant using it in a way to uplift an issue that isn't there. You get that a lot in ""SJW"" issues, where people are basically just hollering and screaming about issues (many of which are important) just for the sake of screaming about something. Then those same people often begin disregarding realities and facts because it isn't in line with their purported problems.   Which is basically what John is dealing with here. People are accusing him of a myriad of things. Why? No reason, really; because they feel like it. Anyone who actually thinks John's language in Paper Towns makes him as a person an ableist, or who thinks by him having a female demographics makes him a guilty of sexual abuse of teens, is completely delusional. Not only is the argument not even remotely relevant to any evidence, but once it starts ricocheting around people's echo chambers, the already garbled nonsense compounds into a massive ball of outrage that makes even less sense.   Welcome to the internet, I guess, where anyone can say anything nonsensical and present it as fact if they type convincing enough words."

But on reflection, I don't think the original post calling John creepy has anything to do with political views. It's just a dumbass."

I think there's a really strong temptation to be cynical, once you've seen people twist the principles you stand for and proclaim themselves advocates of those ideals. Sadly it seems a natural thing that the most extreme and destructive people will be the most vocal in any movement - and then decry those who turn away from the extremism as traitors.  That's been my experience with social justice.    I’m tired of seeing the language of social justice–important language doing important work–misused as a way to dehumanize others and treat them hatefully.   They are the personification of everything I thought right wing zealots invented as a strawman when bemoaning my liberals convictions. And so I choose to call those hateful, identity-erasing bullies, bigots and petty tyrants Social Justice Warriors.

I meant to add a story about accusations and why they are terrible:  I'm a teacher, and this year one student thought it would be funny to set up social media accounts making fun of teachers. It was one of the worst things that has happened to me in ten years of teaching.  I am a generally well liked teacher, but I know kids (particularly the age I teach) can be cruel. I'm not trying to stereotype- kids have a lot going on, and my class is generally not near the top of their lists. I get it.   But this account took a photo of me from a school publication and used crappy photoshop to accuse me of drug use and worse things. Not funny. Not cool. And on the Internet for anyone who googled my last name to see.  It hurt my feelings, and it nearly cost me my job- all for a stupid, immature troll joke.

I've been watching your videos since 2007, like so many other people (in fact, even people who have only been watching you since this year will know enough to conclude that you are one of the better people in this world). These people constantly trying to get a rise out of you frustrate me so much because they obviously don't know anything about you and are just making these baseless insults because of your heightened popularity of late.  There will always be people here who know who you really are. They are the majority, and we will always defend you.

(Also some words occurred to me while I was writing that so here's this)  I was talking to a friend of mine recently who just started watching Brotherhood 2.0, and I commented on how interesting you and Hank's recent videos have been, and also how interesting it is to see the massive increase in quality as far as production elements (camera, lighting, etc) go. And my friend was like ""Oh, have they sold out or something?"" and I responded (a little bit to loudly probably) ""NO NO, no no of course not.""

In the blog post linked above, John wrote:   I’m tired of seeing the language of social justice–important language doing important work–misused as a way to dehumanize others and treat them hatefully.   I'm reposting this quote because redditors really seem to like dunking on Tumblr culture and characterizing them as ""evil SJWs."" It's already started happening in this thread. I shouldn't have to say this, but people who are genuinely committed to social justice don't accuse celebrities of pedophilia just because they don't like them. Actual advocates for social justice value transparency and accountability, something which the contemptible trolls who started that thread on Tumblr are clearly not at all interested (the OP deleted her original post).  What you're seeing is not ""SJWs In Action"" but rather an example of Call-Out Culture, an exceptionally toxic brand of trolling that latches itself onto social justice discourse. This article is a little old but does a great job of illustrating the difference between the two.  So please, before you use this incident as an excuse to rail against ""SJWs"" please take a moment to both Imagine Others Complexly and consider what actual advocates for social change do. In other words, don't do what the trolls in the above Tumblr thread did to John.  Thank you, good night."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,Anna_Mosity,9,Fri Jun 12 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"This.  I'm not much of a tumblr guy, though I have an account, but the first time I came across 'social justice' it was just an abhorrent stream of hate. I am cis-white heterosexual male from an upper middle class background and therefore I have an abundance of privilege which I try to keep in check. Back then I'd only heard the word 'privilege' used in this context once or twice, not that it meant I was oblivious to the struggle. But my first glimpse of 'social justice warriors' was bandwagoning anti-privilege hatred, which serves no purpose other than to further divide and segregate.  My second encounter was 'SJWs' attacking the vlogbrothers over their use of Hanko de mayo. More unnecessary hate.  My third encounter was of radical misandrists (and I don't use that term lightly) claiming all m/f sex was rape, but the patriacrhy has brainwashed women into thinking they like it. They then claimed that m/m homosexuality was not innate homosexuality but a plan by men to reinforce the patriarchy by taking power away from women. They also seemed to refer to 'The Patriarchy' as some kind of secret organisation, or a conscious bond between all men to suppress women. This delayed my understanding of what real feminists (in which I now include myself) mean when they say patriarchy.  All of this led me to the common position seen on reddit and across the internet, that SJWs are a rabid lynch mob. This position is very similar to the view of some that feminists all hate men and want to suppress them (another falsehood). It took a long time for me to learn that real SJ is about building a safe environment for all and promoting egalitarianism. I still haven't got to the point where I would feel comfortable referring to my actions and words as SJ purely because of the stigma I'm struggling to drop."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,206-Ginge,0,Fri Jun 12 15:43:56 2015 UTC,"The reality is there is no stigma. People who have a problem with real life social-justice are people who spend less time advocating for the needs of others, and more time on Reddit yammering.   If there's an issue close to your heart, speak out for it. That's all that matters. Screw anyone else who ""doesn't like it."" People not liking you for having an opinion is not your problem. They're part of the call-out culture, calling out people for having passions that they disagree with. They are part of the problem social-justice speech is aiding in stopping. Any argument decrying this is just white noise."

Prerecord a month of videos, draft Maureen Johnston to fill in again like she did when Henry was born, and disconnect from everyone who isn't a valued physical presence in his life."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,whoneedsthumbs,26,Fri Jun 12 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite part of all this has been reading the replies to John's statement from his detractors. ""No one said you were abusing teenage girls!!! Jeez, where'd you get that idea? We were just pointing how it's creepy that you make videos and books that appeal to them and encourage them to follow you. That has nothing to do with child abuse! It's just heavy insinuation."""

nerdfighters,39j1n2,MrNameisme,33,Fri Jun 12 04:01:27 2015 UTC,"I hereby accuse John of secretly kidnapping George R R Martin and keeping him from writing more novels.  THERE! I SAID WHAT WE'VE ALL REALLY BEEN THINKING! DEFEND YOURSELF, JOHN! /s  God people are idiots.  What I just said has literally the EXACT amount of evidence and credibility as John abusing children, which is to say it has no basis in reality.  Hank made a great video about gay marriage in which he coined his term ""HypotheTheory"" which I think is the appropriate term to use in this situation.  Basically people need to realize that all actions, even online ones have very real consequences to real people."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,MrNameisme,21,Fri Jun 12 02:34:45 2015 UTC,"The issue is they fail to see the consequences as it doesn't appear they even view them as 'real people'. For them, there doesn't seem to be a difference between @johngreen and actual John Green. They see these tiny portions of his life and work he shares with the world and deem that as who he is, which is silly. Of course, we also don't see actual John Green (nor should we, I feel have a barrier of privacy is important for anytime of professional personality) but we are aware that he is human - that he is a father, husband, brother, son and so on. He is a lot more than an Internet personality. And if you can't grasp that then it's no wonder that the same people can't grasp that saying these things can have huge consequences. If all John is merely an Internet personality, then this comment is merely an Internet comment. At least that's how I imagine their thought pattern goes.  Moreover, while John can face both personal and professional struggles from these accusations it can have an even wider effect and actually take away from real claims. We can see this in the 'YouTube Scandal of 2014' (I don't like referring to it as that, it makes it sound like tabloid gossip, rather than the serious issue it is, but it's very late and I can't think of how I actually want to word it; I'll edit it when I wake up) - when claims started originally coming out and people were validating them people jumped on the bandwagon and started making false claims towards Dan and Phil and Tyler Oakley on the same day Alex Day's accusations came out. When Hank confirmed how Tyler's were false and then Dan and Phil's were also shown to be false a lot of people assumed Alex's were also done for click bait; now could you imagine how you would feel if you've spent years struggling with what happened before deciding to detail it online in order to help others, to then have to read people claiming you're lying and looking attention. That would be heart-braking. In a similar way to how that could have seriously damaged actual cases, this too could have a similar effect"

Nerdfighteria and nerdfighters are awesome, and while it's great that John's work is being able to affect more people and help spread his positive message throughout the world, it also lets nasty, toxic personalities into the bubble of nerdfighteria. I know John has anxiety issues, and I think vlogbrothers and the nerdfighter community was a way for him to escape the stress of society and retreat into a community that was always supportive of him, regardless of his faults and mistakes. I worry that his success could do more harm than good for him, and it likely is why he hasn't written a book in so long. With success comes scrutiny, and while John has so often eloquently and respectfully responded to posts like these on numerous occasions, I have a sickening feeling that these are taking a massive toll on him internally. I hope /u/thesoundandthefury will see this thread, at least to let him know he's got people who support him, and that despite the stress of celebrity, he is still our nerdy friend who makes videos on the internet."

nerdfighters,39j1n2,conallkeenan,5,Fri Jun 12 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"He is working on one at the moment, but the process of writing is completely different from any of his other jobs. With a vlogbrothers video he's playing to his strengths, he has a deadline each week and a timeframe for how long it should be and he's never really going to run out of ideas. Writing a book, however, is a completely different process and changes each time you do it"
nerdfighters,39j1n2,MrNameisme,9,Fri Jun 12 06:07:30 2015 UTC,"In my experience teenage girls are more willing to be enthusiastic fans of popular culture than any other demographic.  If you think of the fan base of any pop artist today it's going to be predominantly teenaged girls.  Even Harry Potter has a mostly female following, despite being narrated by a male and limited romantic themes.  Saying that these creators pander to teenaged girls just because those are the kind of people who most actively respond to their content is a really flawed way of looking at the situation.    Also knowingly falsely accusing someone of this kind of crime is disgusting."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,heychrisfox,15,Fri Jun 12 11:36:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sad at how Tumblr has evolved since its start. Cyber bullying seems to have grown immensely there now.

And that people underestimate the capacity of the youth of the world.   No one deserves to be accused, bullied, tormented, or threatened just because they think the Internet is anonymous. People forget that behind these handles are real people that can internalize these negative comments. Its draining, damaging, and a huge act of cowardice."

And, unfortunately, posts like these aren't at all uncommon to see on tumblr, which makes it harder for a lot of people (including John) to exist on the site in a healthy way. I know that's why I stopped using it anyway.

Not in any sense. But, at least on Reddit, you have your subreddits that you look at. IF you don't want to see gore, you don't see gore. If you don't want to watch john green explain the Mongols (but really, who doesn't?) then you don't have to. Reddit, and even 4chan is so much more accepting than tumblr is.  John Green is awesome, and I recommend his books to nearly every student I work with. I know which student type to recommend which book. It doesn't really matter what sex they are. At my library (a high school library) I have given John Green books to more boys than girls.   While it is true that the nerd fighter community is more female than male, he doesn't pander to the girls. He writes romance with comedy, with awkwardness. He doesn't sugarcoat it and make it seem like love is the best thing in the world. He doesn't make it seem like sex is the most important thing in the world. He makes it awkward, like it is."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,narwhal_of_death,11,Fri Jun 12 04:04:16 2015 UTC,"Reddit, and even 4chan is so much more accepting than tumblr is   Yeah, um, about that."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,waltercorgkite,11,Fri Jun 12 04:17:38 2015 UTC,"The thing is there are a lot of SJW who are actually doing good things, but they're being ignored and are casted as part of this stereotype. The type of SJW that bring a bad name to it are similar to 'feminists' who hate men, which have made people think feminism is a movement towards female domination, rather than equality. These people make a mockery of something that could do so much good in the world, it's such a shame"

nerdfighters,39j1n2,AngriestBird,6,Fri Jun 12 05:13:32 2015 UTC,FWIW here's what the UPLIFT (formerly YouCoalition) Tumblr has to say about it.
nerdfighters,39j1n2,drapollo,5,Fri Jun 12 04:42:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this!
nerdfighters,39j1n2,heychrisfox,3,Fri Jun 12 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in the comments are talking about how Tumblr has evolved into this, and I think that's true, but I also feel like John was criticizing internet hate as a whole. I think we should try to view this as an internet issue and not just a Tumblr issue, even though Tumblr is likely the biggest source."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,FutureGreenChemist,2,Fri Jun 12 04:22:06 2015 UTC,I agree. There's a lot of hate/shaming across the Internet as a whole. And perhaps now is a time when people need to start moderating each other more for actions towards another.  The Bystander Effect works online too.
nerdfighters,39j1n2,narwhal_of_death,5,Fri Jun 12 16:51:10 2015 UTC,There are people who don't like John?
nerdfighters,39j1n2,thedailyday,13,Fri Jun 12 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"There's some communities on tumblr that are wholly 100% focused on making people feel bad about themselves. They hate pretty much everyone, but especially anyone successful/male/white.  Thankfully these communities are pretty small and even others on tumblr don't tend to take them seriously. Problem is when these idiots get too pissed and start with shit like death threats."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,conallkeenan,7,Fri Jun 12 08:04:04 2015 UTC,I don't get it? Is it just a phase people go through where they mistake being jaded for being wise? There's plenty of suspicious privileged people they can go after but John doesn't seem like one of them.
nerdfighters,39j1n2,conallkeenan,-1,Fri Jun 12 09:47:53 2015 UTC,"They don't want to go after obvious choices, like people who actually beat women or rape or murder or whatever.  They want to pick someone who seems really good, someone people like, and then convince the world that the person is terrible.  But yeah, it's nothing more than kids going through a phase."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,conallkeenan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. To quote John, ""Imagine people complexly."" These people likely have reasons for their anger toward John. And that's totally normal. We don't like everyone in life. You'll hear me decry someone like Rick Perry from the rooftops day in and out, but there are logical reasons behind it.   But what you said further up is the reality: these are incredibly small communities of people who are frustrated with SOMETHING, and latching onto issues like this bit of drama involving John is just what they do. It's how they get their kicks or get their self-fulfillment. This is just one issue that rose to some actual level of prominence.   I mean just look at the ""stopjohngreen"" tumblr thing which far precedes this issue. This type of randomized hatred for people who got famous is ridiculously common. But the audience for such things can't be more than a few hundred, and despite whatever reasons they have for holding such opinions, it's rarely based on anything more than vapid anger and misguided hatred."
nerdfighters,39j1n2,thedailyday,3,Fri Jun 12 17:06:42 2015 UTC,What a bunch of blowhards.

nerdfighters,39j1n2,SJWDFTBA,2,Fri Jun 12 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Has anyone read Jon Ronson's book So You've Been Publicly Shamed? Jon's been taking a lot of flack for it, and for things that were leaked that he never even included in the final book, which all seems to boil down to Jon treating men who were publicly shamed for sexist behavior with too much compassion and giving them too much room to tell their stories, and maybe not giving enough to some of the women covered in the book. I don't know if those accusations are true because I haven't gotten the book yet (the library hold list is in the hundreds), and because I have nearly every privilege there is to have so I may not be an objective judge, but it's ironic that a book about internet shaming would result in the author being internet shamed. And because Jon Ronson is the most scrupulously fair journalist I've ever read in his treatment of people who are different. He brings out the humanity and complexity in everyone he writes about, and yes, he even manages to humanize some pretty nasty people.   TL;DR: Probably worthwhile to read So You've Been Publicly Shamed for an in depth treatment of some of this sort of thing, because Jon Ronson is awesome."

It's only used within a certain... well, subculture, and even then it's often primarily used jokingly, to make a point, or as a friendly nudge to fellow Idea Channel viewers."

This is the distinction between correct and incorrect, at least for me (although I seem to hold a minority opinion). It is the least widespread, but it is as fully correct as any other pronunciation.  However, at this point, we wouldn't be arguing about the correctness of the pronunciation of /ʒaɪf/, but rather our philosophies of language and what it means to be incorrect in the first place.  An argument that I'd be willing to have, but we should make it clear before proceeding. I will certainly concede the point that, under some views, yes, /ʒaɪf/ is the least correct of the three, or even incorrect. Just not under my view."

So what's cool about Pornhub is that they are constantly working to increase the legitimacy of their site as an adult media network. They work hard to build in the same community structures that exist on places like Youtube, all while working with their content creators endlessly in order to create partner relationships, and have been known to encourage collaboration as well. It's interesting to see the parallels, and just what social taboos do to the perception of those parallels. So to see that someone's posted one of John's videos there as a giggle amuses me endlessly, as John is heavily in favor of collaborative works and such, and the power of socially networked media. Granted, I don't think it's going to help them in their attempts to achieve those goals, only major social changes in the world will, but at the end of the day, it's a giggle, and it certainly doesn't hurt anyone. Also, nerdfighters can enjoy adult material too, so there's a good chance that whoever posted this there may have actually made some new nerdfighters in the process."

Anything and everything will only aggravate a sizable group of people one way or another, and that's the opposite of helping this sort of situation.  The main virtue of the more ""niche interest"" subreddits right now is that, by and large, they're keeping their noses clean. Depending on where you're subscribed, you can browse and post without even having to see any of this. We're doing an excellent job staying clear of the fire, and we should continue to do so. Much more useful than attempting to contribute in any way right now.

I promise I'm not trying to out-savvy you or be haughty about this or anything, because it's entirely possible your experience of reddit is vastly different from other users. But, well.

Yes, even /r/nerdfighters (though I can't seem to conjure up an example so do take that with a grain of salt). Fat people just seems to be one of reddit's main bugaboos. I couldn't tell you how thick the hate flows for fat people compared to POCs or women (although as a woman my past experience on reddit has been... not great), but it's pretty bad.

nerdfighters,397ti2,GerardDenis,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:21:05 2015 UTC,"The contest in question is about what it means to be ""human"". However, john spends much of the video using ""human"" and ""person"" interchangeably. While it is common for the word ""person"" to be used as a synonym for ""human"" this is generally because the vast majority of humans only recognize humans as being capable of being people. When the only fruit you know of is an apple, the words ""fruit"" and ""apple"" can start to lose their distinction.  But we actually talk about non-human persons all the time, though traditionally more in mythology and today more in sci-fi. For example, gods have always been seen as people; the word ""person"" comes from the greek ""persona"" which means ""mask"" as it would appear in a play, showing that it was less about being a human and more about being a character in the story. Likewise, Vulcans and other aliens in Star Trek and other scifi have absolutely been seen as people, even though they're obviously not human. Even today, we are starting to in science support the idea of non-human persons, with certain highly intelligent apes, cetaceans and elephants being considered developed enough cognitively and emotionally to be considered ""people"" by some.   Anyways, to get what I'm saying, just watch the video again with these distinctions in mind, and I think you'll see what I'm talking about."

More broadly, a connectome would include the mapping of all neural connections within an organism's nervous system.  The production and study of connectomes, known as connectomics, may range in scale from a detailed map of the full set of neurons and synapses within part or all of the nervous system of an organism to a macro scale description of the functional and structural connectivity between all cortical areas and subcortical structures. The term ""connectome"" is used primarily in scientific efforts to capture, map, and understand the organization of neural interactions within the brain.  Research has successfully constructed the full connectome of one animal: the roundworm C. elegans (White et al., 1986,  Varshney et al., 2011 ). Partial connectomes of a mouse retina   and mouse primary visual cortex   have also been successfully constructed.

nerdfighters,397ti2,Magikarp_13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:19:08 2015 UTC,"This was an interesting thing going on where John tries to get at both a collective humanity and an individual personhood. I think there was some problematic conflation there, but also an attempt to really get at the heart of the thing. I think the problem exists even if we don't focus on definitions of words. Obviously ""person"" and ""human"" can mean many different things to many different people in many different contexts.  But this thing where John dismisses definitions of human because they don't apply to everyone is problematic. Some people can't tell or hear stories? Some people can't read and write? That's true, but some people also can't feel empathy. Are those people not human? We look at things like imagining and telling stories and empathizing as traits that separate humanity from the animals, and they do, but that doesn't mean that every human has to have those traits to be human. At the same time, those traits can be used to describe humanity in the general and abstract sense, so I find that argument fails as grounds to, for example, throw out story telling.  I think that in addition to those abstract traits, we can also define humanity on a scientific basis as a species. There are many ways of establishing that species, science gives us morphology and DNA and interbreeding as potential species demarcations, but we don't have to do a DNA test on anyone to know they're human, as individuals operating in the real world we use a fairly broad morphological definition in a heuristic approach to determining any being's humanity. Successful interbreeding, DNA studies, and abstract characteristics should have established for any reasonable person a broad enough heuristic that ethnicity, disability, mental illness, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, intelligence, belief, language, national origin, or any number of factors I haven't thought of off the top of my head, should not disqualify anyone from humanity, nor justify dehumanizing them. Anyone out there who considers anyone else who would meet a scientific test of humanity, or who was born to someone who would, regardless of whether they themselves can, for example, interbreed, has a broken heuristic."

nerdfighters,397ti2,Darth_Hobbes,2,Tue Jun 9 23:14:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Well checking Wikipedia:   As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind. As a metaphysical position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist.   So the epistemological position is obviously logically sound, and I thought Solipsism just meant what is apparently the metaphysical position, which would require evidence. TIL."

nerdfighters,397ti2,StrategicSarcasm,2,Tue Jun 9 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"This is demonstrably untrue, both in terms of animals and in terms of humans. Most insect colonies survive only through the fact that self-preservation instincts aren't as prevalent as the instincts to protect the colony. A bee loses its stinger and dies whenever it stings you, the entire purpose of the stinger is protection of the colony. Humanity doesn't have anything close to that, it just has the most situations where the question comes into play."

Writing off all the people who say bigoted crap is a bit much. I mean, I said plenty of stupid stuff as a kid and now I say different stupid stuff. Most of the people I know are the same way. I, like all humans, am a work in progress.  What you're describing is kind of a major problem of American (and other) politics. There is a staggering amount of money spent on political campaigns and almost none of it is used to try to talk to people who disagree with us, but instead to re-cement those who do.

This video probably would have helped me a lot as a teenager (at least late teens, once I'd had enough exposure to the idea of transgender to be thinking about it at all). I have a similar gender identity to ViHart's, and I didn't realize that I could express it that way until a couple of years ago (I'm 28 now). Realizing it has helped me understand myself better, and also helped me understand other people better.  So maybe some people are too entrenched in their bigoted viewpoints, but definitely not all people are. There's a lot of unfortunate views that come from lack of understanding, not from willful hate."

nerdfighters,39290f,marrio91,3,Tue Jun 9 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I think both 'sides' are making too much of a deal.  One side is acting like one important thing is SUPER IMPORTANT to their self image and mindset, when in reality it can't change. Since it's how people are born, why take pride in it? I don't take pride in my hair color, why should I care any more beyond 'yep I am' for my gender?  The other side is being a bunch of buttholes, acting like gender is super important and very defining, but that the 'others' aren't real. This comes along with both sides of the political isle blocking rights for all people making rights for some, not rights regardless of sex, gender, race, religion etc.  All in all, people need to stop being so damn offended, everywhere. If somebody calls you something you aren't, correct them and move on. If they continue to do so, bloody don't talk to that person again. If you don't like how people present themselves, and it doesn't actually hurt you, then stop being a self-involved twat and focus on something important in your life."
nerdfighters,39290f,Raeil,3,Tue Jun 9 07:49:01 2015 UTC,"Since it's how people are born, why take pride in it?   One of the driving forces for preventing people from being open about themselves is systemic shaming of particular aspects of themselves.  The best way to counteract those feelings of shame is by instead being proud of the shamed aspects.  The LGBTQ+ community picked the word ""pride"" for this very reason."
nerdfighters,39290f,marrio91,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:17:47 2015 UTC,"I guess it's arguing semantics then really, it's not really 'pride' so much as it is a drive towards refusal to be shamed or demeaned.  I honestly tired to think of an action or something I do, that is how I've always just done it, that society deems the process of that action, or that action itself bad. To be honest, I can't name a single thing. I mean there's beliefs I hold or things I choose to do that people dislike or find bad, but nothing that I was born with."
nerdfighters,39290f,peeja,3,Tue Jun 9 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: Rub a little piece of fabric against your foot, just a little bit. It's the tiniest sensation in the world. Now walk around all day in bad shoes. It's just little movements, but after a day or two you end up with a painful blister.  Now imagine you are told constantly that you're not okay, that you're weird, that you're an outsider. Sometimes it's explicit, sometimes it's implicit, often the person saying it doesn't know that they're saying it, but it's embedded in the way they treat you. It becomes painful and sore, and little things that should be easy—like taking another step in those shoes—can make you move strangely to avoid the pain. It looks like you're overreacting, but you're not. You have a blister, and the people without blisters can't really understand that.  The reason to take pride in who you are is to remind yourself (and others like you) that you are okay, that you do belong here, and that you're not alone. That's a psychological need that many of us have the privilege of having constantly fulfilled without even noticing it.  Incidentally, there are people who take pride in their hair color. They're redheads, and in many places they're the targets of discrimination and abuse. There are also people who take pride in their skin color being white, and those people are using pride in a completely different way."
nerdfighters,39290f,marrio91,2,Tue Jun 9 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"Right, for me pride (something I seldom feel) is more a result of something I did. Some personal mountain I moved, or something I accomplished after hard work, you know? Just to kind of level the understanding, what emotional state represents that to you?  I feel how you described above thanks to my a.d.d. I have always been pushing, always behind, but doing great work. I'm not the 'lazy smart person' that a lot of redditors like to think themselves as, but I realize I am constantly screwing up, I have less of an ability to control that than others do, and I push more to 'fix' that.  I get told regularly that my illness is fake, that I'm just lazy, it's an excuse, if I just tired harder... all that. It removes legitimacy from a part of myself I make no excuses for, acknowledge, and fight.  In uni around finals time I avoid meeting new people in class, or joining study groups, or doing things that would legitimately help myself, because they tend to involve other people. And as soon as I explain why I struggle, I turn into that pill guy. I had a girl a while back, friend of a suite-mate, came into my bedroom, tried to be all 'cute' short of getting in my bed, and after five minutes, asked me for 'smart drugs.' As if 1) that's all I am, 2) as if they just make you smarter, not that they alleviate legitimate medical issues.  I don't feel I should take pride in overcoming my add, or that I should take pride in treating a disorder a fair amount of people think is blown out of proportion, or fake. I know I'm probably harming some long-term function of myself even by following instructions and my doctor's guidance, but why take pride in what others deem shameful or bad? I think that's them winning, it's me even thinking that point has some semblance of legitimacy to anybody, and counteracting it.  Sorry if this is too ranty, near the end of first year of grad school finals."

nerdfighters,39290f,kataskopo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"why take pride in it?    Because other people make fun of you, make your life hell, and kill you because of it.  It's a message that says that it's ok to be that way, to be ""different"" and fuck all those people who say otherwise.  You did not actually paid attention to the video, because it's about empathy and about understanding other people.

nerdfighters,393m8l,aydiosmio,5,Tue Jun 9 03:30:19 2015 UTC,"There's a good reason they don't. Going to states with higher populations means that a higher number of people who want go to an event can. There are more people in San Jose, CA than in Lincoln, NE, after all - if you wanted to give the most people an opportunity to go see The Brothers Green, which one would you pick to visit for an event?  That said, I do wish more tours would take travel distance into account. Lots of event tours do ""the coasts"", and end up doing stops in both Philadelphia and New York (~2 hours apart) or three separate stops in Southern California, whereas midwesterners outside of driving distance to Chicago have really rough pickings. Again, understandable because of basic math, but still a bit frustrating when it's a consistent pattern.  Of course, none of this accounts for the other 5 inhabited continents, but you can only take this discussion so far before it becomes implausible."

Ultimately, we're all basing just about everything we do on the notion that somehow things will basically keep going as they are economically, so we'll all get to have jobs, save money, and eventually retire. But we don't actually know if the whole complex financial edifices we've built will in fact come crashing down. We don't know if there will be jobs for anyone to do even if the economy keeps rumbling along (see CGP Grey's ""Humans Need Not Apply"").  One of the problems inherent in global capitalism is that it requires constant growth. But what if the potential for growth is finite? This is basically what Malthus proposed, and the green revolution ""proved him wrong"", but what if all the green revolution really did was put things off for a while? Surely there is a limit to the sustainable human population of earth. If we go by U.S. standards of living, we've long ago surpassed it. Many think we can eventually create technology to always solve these problems, but can we? Technology requires resources, too. What if we're actually approaching an end point? What if we're not, but we no longer need humans to produce anything, but the economy still demands more humans as consumers to continue to grow?   If we need consumers, but not producers, how to we allocate resources? We've relied largely on free market competition with some government intervention to solve this problem, but what will we do if there's no market for labor anymore? Complete state run socialism hasn't worked out well so far, and part of the problem with it is that it's an artificial system trying to change something that has basically evolved naturally. But what if the natural tendencies that drive the free market system are completely incapable of solving the issues we face? Can we craft an intentional economic system to solve these problems?  And what if we can't?"
nerdfighters,393m8l,the_ak,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:21:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have a clear answer to your question but I would like to point out that it is not simply a case of choosing between 'state run socialism' and  capitalism with some government intervention. There exists something called non state socialism, often referred to as libertarian socialism or social anarchism which is where  workers own and run the means of production but the state does not plan the economy. Personally I think that is the most reasonable economic system. It ensures both freedom and equality as well as giving humanity a greater ability to survive on a planet with limited resources."
nerdfighters,393m8l,thataccountforporn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"I've been putting off replying to you because I want to be thoughtful and substantive and respectful, but I don't have it in me right now to write all the things I think about this subject, so I'll settle for trying to be thoughtful and respectful while also being brief.  I'm aware of the difference between different kinds of socialism and communism, I referred to state socialism because it's the only kind that's ever been done on any kind of scale (to the extent that it was actually done...), but in the end, what I see as the biggest problem with it remains even when you take out the state. It's a utopian ideal, but it's entirely artificial and goes against our animal nature. I'm simply not convinced it can be done on large scales for that reason. I think it would be great if it could be, I just don't think it can. Well, it can be done, but the outcome likely won't be the positive one we would like.   So I think the only solution I can see is something in the middle, more like democratic socialism of the European model. This still doesn't solve what I see to be one of the largest issue: the Capitalistic demand for constant growth in profits. That's the thing I feel like we need to kill to make any alternative system work, and I don't think we actually need to eliminate (mostly) free markets to do that, but I don't have a solution. I often think that the system that will work will arise naturally on its own when the circumstances warrant it fully, but I'm not convinced that's true and I am convinced that if it does happen, like anything in our economic system, it will only happen when too many people have already borne too high a cost."

nerdfighters,38vmdc,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:54:02 2015 UTC,"Acronym:       An acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial components in a phrase or a word. Usually these components are individual letters (as in NATO or laser) or parts of words or names (as in Benelux). There are broad currents of consensus but no universal standardization of various names for such abbreviations and of their orthographic styling. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of word formation process, and they are viewed as a subtype of blending.     Interesting: Three-letter acronym | Backronym | RAS syndrome | Recursive acronym   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Sure, Mars might be nothing more than a cold dead rock, but if you think about it, AFC Wimbledon is nothing more than a group of guys kicking a ball around a pitch. I think both are equally interesting, myself. I think it's a little hypocritical of Hank to suggest that sports are inherently unimportant, and yet still support Nerdfighteria's sponsorship of a sports team. I might be overthinking it.   Still pretty great. I'm excited for the next one!"
nerdfighters,38vmdc,faboo978,7,Sun Jun 7 13:30:22 2015 UTC,"I think Hank is mostly razzing his brother.  OTOH you could reasonably argue that sports are both inherently unimportant and also a fun thing to rally around sometimes. Personally, I think one of the things that draws us too sport as a spectacle is that it is unimportant. When we watch or participate in a sport, we get to experience excitement and joy and disappointment without the inherent consequences of other emotionally charged activities."
nerdfighters,38vmdc,yolomatic_swagmaster,2,Sun Jun 7 13:54:02 2015 UTC,Couldn't you get so into sports that it would be an emotionally charged activity?

I meant to get that across in my original comment - sports are an emotionally charged activity without high-stakes consequences of hunting a boar or running a business meeting. So when watching (or playing) a sport, we can have the kind of really emotional experience that we have evolved to seek out, but the worst the happens is we lose a game, rather than get gored by a boar."

I don't think he supports AFC Wimbledon the team, but rather the community that's formed around the Wimbly-Wombly videos, and the community in England around the actual team. It's all about communities. The funny thing here is, of course, that a football team IS about community. I don't know if Hank realises that though; he doesn't seem to care much about football."

For a YouTube vlog, especially one on a channel with a strict four-minute limit, it works fine, but it seems a little too rushed for a podcast."

After a few clicks and stumbles, I managed to accidentally not only find the pathing for client-spawned environmentals, like cars on the road, but also managed to find the identifiers and listing locations for every single spawn point in the game's map files. Mission-granting NPCs, baddie spawnpoints, paths for EVERYTHING, guardian spawnpoints, directions for each spawn, even pathing to egress points like doors, along with a listing of every single listed identifier by individual ID.

I was referring to the notion that reddit - specifically /r/nerdfighters - is some especially good example of nerdfighter values. This is often not true because typical reddit behavior is often antithetical to nerdfighter values and /r/nerdfighters is in no way completely isolated from that overall culture. Any online community is going to face this to some degree.   There is a difference between individual people failing to live up to a set of values and the ecosystem pushing us towards failing to live up to a set of values.  Now obviously these are all vague feelings that I'd have to back up if I wanted them to be taken seriously. Nonetheless, I feel like your reply misconstrues my point and I wanted to solidify my point."

nerdfighters,38vlur,TimePrincessHanna,3,Sun Jun 7 17:41:27 2015 UTC,"I have found in the past that facebook groups tend to facilitate a certain kind of negativity. I'm not sure exactly why. It might have something to do with the idea that if there are a lot of comments on one thread, the comments can get kind of overwhelming because they aren't separated into sub-threads, and people get notifications if people comment after them even if the comment has nothing to do with what they said. So it's easy for people to get caught up in facebook threads and get frustrated, and when people are frustrated they tend to communicate less respectfully.   Anyway, I don't know what Australian Nerdfighters is like or if this has anything to do with the conflict. I have heard an account from tumblr about someone who had a very negative experience with that group in person, so I would believe it if some really core bad stuff was going on and it wasn't just facebook."

I fully support john taking a break and I hope that the rest of the community isn't going to backlash at john because at that point I would re-think being apart of this community"

A break from everything to be with his family and away from all of this would definitely be beneficial. Would he take one, is the issue, however? He seems like a man very motivated by his work and he's so involved within the community it would be a difficult choice to make. I can't think of anyone in Nerdfighteria, however, that wouldn't fully support this decision.   You have to applaud John and Hank for all they've done over the years, their dedication and hard work is insane. They've done so many amazing things over the years but at the end of the day their health and the safety of those around them should take priority over everything. I hope as discussions like this progress over time John will take note and at the very least take it into consideration"
nerdfighters,38sc9b,nerdfighter123,25,Sat Jun 6 14:09:20 2015 UTC,"John did say that he really enjoys making vlogbrothers videos and its rhythm so maybe it actually helps him fight his mental health problems? lhttps://twitter.com/johngreen/status/605768707760005122  I still do agree, I think John and Hank should take at least a month off every year to relax."
nerdfighters,38sc9b,InevitablyPerpetual,13,Sat Jun 6 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"True, I didn't think of it like that. Perhaps, then, a break from everything else apart from Vlogbrothers might be a good break for him?   They remind me of Casey Neistat, who frequently talks about the thought of not working is the worst thing for him - he wants to work right up until he dies. I guess if you find something you're truly passionate about it never feels like work.  All, the issue is the threats, etc, not the actual workload. So if this was simply hate comments take a break from the Internet and coming back would be helpful, but there is a serious threat here, one that would still be there when he comes back. Trying to work out a resolution to this issue also would be adding even more stress on John. God, I hate this position he's in"

Case in point, Tyler Oakley. After Liam Payne tweeted him calling him a fake fan, or something along those lines, Twitter blew up with abuse towards Tyler. Tyler then took a couple of days break from the Internet, to which a huge amount of One Direction fans rejoiced (I know, they were happy that someone felt sad, lovely people) and claimed to have won, before he came back with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6lH_r4AsT4  So he took a few days off to collect his thoughts and came back stronger than ever.

When that's combined with the sort of shitty ""feedback"" that sometimes comes from internet anonymity I think it can get really toxic and harmfull to the creators.  What I mean by all this is that of course John should put his own (and his family's) health first, and if that means taking a break, or cutting down on his workload to focus just on writing, or just on Vlogbrothers, and letting others handle the rest, then that's what needs to happen."

The reaction of the subscribers was overwhelmingly positive, with people saying that they could wait however long it took.  I think this rage towards creators exists primarily as the result of the vocal few, the tendency of people to remain silent when everything is good, and the priority of people to accentuate the negative in life.  I'm not sure what can be done about this. To some extent, it could be alleviated with a moderated system such as reddit or proper forums, and maybe reddit's upvote/down system.  I don't know :/ Good luck, John."
nerdfighters,38sc9b,ursineduck,2,Sun Jun 7 00:46:28 2015 UTC,"The YouTube comment system is flawed, from what I gather, they put the most interacted comments to the top, rather than the system Reddit has. So if someone leaves a hate comment and a bunch of people respond defending said creator the comment will go to the top. So it appears like all of the top comments, which should display the general reaction to the video, are filled with hatred, when in fact it's people defending a crappy opinion. That's why I just block any user I see leaving hate and report them as 'Harassment and Bullying'"

He doesn't want to The average person is not mentally prepared to deal with that just because they became a public figure. Theres no bootcamp they can go to to prepare.    I'm sure many of us have encountered bullies before who justified their cruelty through 'if you can't take it, then you deserve it' its the same logic used to justify telling depressed teenagers to kill themselves.   Most likely some terrible person though it was ok to send these messages because they didn't see John, Or Henry as real people, just internet faces, and didn't really think it would cause them distress.   So I think its good to acknowledge the fall out, I want them to feel bad, I want them to see everyone condemn their actions.  Everyone should know this is 100% unacceptable."

They sent him a picture of his house with his son's room circled threatening the kid's death.

So when we hear about people doing terrible things all the time, we think ""wow, I've heard about like 50 terrible people, that's a LARGE FRACTION OF ALL PEOPLE"".  It's still depressing, but a lot less depressing, when you remember that it's really a tiny fraction of people who do terrible things like that, and all it takes is one for us to hear about it."
nerdfighters,38nz61,TheManWithNoGoal,8,Fri Jun 5 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"As a very casual nerdfighter and completely out of the loop, is this really about casting? How can someone react like this over casting?"
nerdfighters,38nz61,definethegreatline,17,Fri Jun 5 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"It's because Acacia Brinley (I think that's how it's spelled) is rumoured to have been cast in the role. The Internet seems to have this irrational hatred of her, it's honestly disgusting. Basically, when she was 13 nudes of her were leaked (or maybe she posted them, I've seen conflicting reports) and this led people to mock and insult her. She then dated Sam Pottoroff (Or however that's spelled aha) who was a part of O2L, which people claimed was for fame, and at the time Sam and Kian (another member of O2L) fell out, which led people to blame her for the cause of the fallout. She then was alleged to have dated one of the members of 5 Seconds of Summer (a popular band amongst teens) which led their fans to hate her. So people have this assumption that she dates people to try and become famous and not, you know, dating people for fun. Like anyone growing up, she's gone through different 'phases' and styles, another thing people give her abuse for, as apparently this is seen as her trying to flirt with famous people or something ridiculous like that. She's been pretty open about the hate she receives, case in point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpD4ZPamt68  So basically, all of this has now led not only her to receive abuse, but now John and his family. God, I love the Internet"

I always knew I was in the eldest demographic within nerdfighteria, but t is horrible realizing you are getting old!  Great post and many thanks for explaining the current situation.  Now, I am trying to put into words what I feel about people threatening the children of the creator of content they supposedly appreciate for decisions made by others regarding an adaptation of said work... I honestly hope they get the help and attention they need from somewhere."

nerdfighters,38nz61,eadlith,13,Sat Jun 6 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, because when a 13 year old girl wants to flirt with famous people and has nudes on the internet, the rational thing is to hate her."
nerdfighters,38nz61,elkins9293,3,Sat Jun 6 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"So basically this is about slut-shaming too?    wow, how come  so much internet hatred comes back to misogyny?"
nerdfighters,38nz61,FutureGreenChemist,5,Sat Jun 6 12:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, and to a 13 year old girl. The worrying thing is that the majority of hate directed towards her comes from girls, not guys, who seem to think trusting someone with intimate photos of yourself and having that person break the trust is somehow the sender's fault"
nerdfighters,38nz61,lulzmort,0,Sat Jun 6 12:31:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. Because when a 13 year old makes a stupid mistake, they deserve hatred even though the law sees those people as VICTIMS. No big deal."
nerdfighters,38nz61,whatstheonething,0,Sat Jun 6 05:59:09 2015 UTC,"This is literally the dumbest reason to hate/send death threats to someone.

It used to be people would have to disgraced their god personally, or have some really bad mental illness, and read really deeply into some masterpiece of literature."
nerdfighters,38nz61,lulzmort,0,Sun Jun 7 08:32:44 2015 UTC,"Just my 2c to chip in. Yes a lot of hate stems from her being able to hang out with people that her haters themselves want to hang out with (jealousy) but at the same time Acacia has been blatantly caught out lying on many occasions for the sake of fame, not nice to people, and she is very young and romantically associated with people who are not minors... and she comes off like she does that to boost her ego. That should be more disturbing than anything else. TL;DR: you don't resort to death threats, but Acacia is no angel either and there are reasons why people really don't like her."

Some people are so obsessed with the fanfiction relationship idea of John and Sherlock that they couldn't handle this.   Its not like shes actually with Martin Freeman in real life so it doesnt matter right? Nope. Those people sent death threats to the women dating Martin Freemans character even though shes already actually dating Martin Freeman.

Even for people with schizophrenia, the classic ""unstable"" mentally ill people, those who actually commit crimes are a small minority. If you don't like someone's behaviour, criticise their behaviour. Don't demomise mental illness."
nerdfighters,38nz61,arghsinic,3,Sat Jun 6 00:44:56 2015 UTC,I am sorry that I brought mental illness into it by no means did I mean to demonize mental illness  but I still think that if you are sending death threats to someone's child then there is something you need to work out in your home life
nerdfighters,38nz61,whatstheonething,2,Sat Jun 6 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that those making the threats are failing to see John as a real person. I hope legal action was taken.

nerdfighters,38q2i9,AliJDB,21,Fri Jun 5 21:38:39 2015 UTC,It's really sad if people are using the nerdfighter name without the actually embodying the ideas of nerdfighters. The problem with creating a label for a group of people is that some will hijack it an use it for abuse.
nerdfighters,38q2i9,cgimusic,8,Fri Jun 5 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, it's heartbreaking to hear that kind of thing happens within the community."
nerdfighters,38q2i9,conallkeenan,8,Fri Jun 5 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"I hate to be that person, but am I the only one who sees a link between this and John's insane mainstream popularity over the last year or so? John is becoming literally a household name, and with that comes a huge amount of support to everything he does. Which is good, it's how I fell into this community. A few years ago I read 'Looking For Alaska' noticed he had a website that answered questions and while there I noticed he talked about his web-videos. I then went to the Vlogbrothers' channel, remembered watching a few of their videos and then started to binge watch them, and just haven't stopped. While I'm aware this is also how a lot of other people fallen into becoming a Nerdfighter, I have plenty of friends who simply know John as the guy who wrote TFiOS, and nothing more. Not surprising - it is such a huge book. I had a friend who read a few of his books, and proclaimed herself as the biggest John Green fan to exist, yet she was shocked when I asked her how she enjoyed Vlogbrothers, as she had never heard of it. I'm aware there is a difference between a fan of John and a Nerdfighter, the two are not synonymous. But the thing is, there are people who become a fan and hear the term 'Nerdfighter' and might just assume it's the name of John's fandom, rather than the community it is. Something similar to a Belieber and Directioner. Within those fandoms on Twitter you see horrible things. I can remember making a silly joke about Justin Bieber a couple of years ago (nothing overly malicious, it was in reference to Drake Bell and Justin and I said something like, ""Justin probably doesn't even remember who Drake Bell is"", regardless, I'd like to think I'd mature beyond that) and the reaction was horrible - my interactions blew up with people encouraging me to kill myself, people threatening to kill me, calling me worse than cancer, etc. All over something like that. I fear that as John and Hank grow and draw in more and more people that people's perception of what a Nerdfighter is will change.  I hope I conveyed what I was trying to say appropriately and didn't come off rude or anything. If I did, please call it out so I can rectify it :)"
nerdfighters,38q2i9,nerdfighter123,3,Sat Jun 6 11:55:59 2015 UTC,Yeah with John's death threat and people calling themselves nerdfighters and threatening other people. this is getting out of hand. This is one of the problems a truly open community faces.
nerdfighters,38q2i9,TimePrincessHanna,3,Sat Jun 6 04:23:02 2015 UTC,I've also over the past three and a half years (that's how long I've been in the community) seen the values of Nerdfighteria be diluted. I think that too is a problem of a truly open community.
nerdfighters,38q2i9,InevitablyPerpetual,4,Sat Jun 6 05:41:35 2015 UTC,"This happens pretty much Anywhere, and believe it or not, we most certainly don't have the worst of it. Regardless of the politically insular nature of groups like the Adult Nerdfighters group on Facebook, we're actually pretty open and tame as compared to other groups throughout the web, or in the real world.  We've got it pretty easy, as in the public eye, we don't have much of a reputation to build or to destroy, which is helpful, but others don't have it so easy.  Many who carry the title of Feminist, for instance, happily champion the cause of equality, but enough people have used that label as an excuse to attack, defame, threaten, or harm others that there are many people that mirror the ideological goals of feminism, but refuse flatly to carry the title in question. The same goes for some charitable organizations that have done some questionable things(Komen comes to mind), groups of gamers, even some fandoms.   When you don't have leaders, you wind up with different power structures forming, where in-group/out-group mentalities begin to flourish so much that the only people who climb to the top of those groups are the ones that are more radical than the last ones. Thankfully, this is not something we appear to suffer from on a global scale, but it does affect some of our satellite groups. It is something we should constantly remain vigilant about, and something we should pay very, very close attention to if it happens anywhere.   I've observed from the outside for a very long time this wonderful group of people, and I've watched dozens of other groups fall on their own swords. Nerdfighters and the people within it have a unique advantage of simplicity in our ideal structure, but we're not immune. We need to constantly ensure that our moderates have an open platform to speak(Which means Not downvoting comments into oblivion that we don't necessarily disagree with, by the way), that we listen to one another openly, and that we endeavor to be understanding of the complexity of each individual we interact with at any given time.   The most egregious demonstration of the problems I refer to can be seen in the Society for Creative Anachronism, a group I used to do a lot of work with. Many people within that group who had clawed their way up the social ladder would use that group's clout and their own social followers to strongarm others into doing their bidding in one fashion or another, whether that be changing a facet of their personality that frankly didn't need changing, or forcing the person(s) in question out of the SCA in its entirety. In this, the person, in the name of the group, had personally wronged the other person in question, and the group did nothing to stop the wrongdoing, nor did they do anything to help rebuild the bridges they burned. This is not good social policy. I'm thankful that we Nerdfighters can show the person that was wronged that that is not what we're about, and that we're willing to publicly state that no matter what social hierarchy's toes we step on, but I think I've stumbled on something in a big way.  We don't Have that sort of hierarchy.  I'm starting to realize this post might be a bit of braincrack, but what it seems to boil down to is that groups that have that sort of insular, established social hierarchy of celebrity and such tend to have a greater instance of top-down bullying, people who attain social power to use it against others. And that makes us a bit unique as compared to the other groups mentioned. And I think we should use that to do good, wherever we can in the world."
nerdfighters,38q2i9,cgimusic,2,Sat Jun 6 08:52:52 2015 UTC,"You bring up some very interesting points, especially about not having a power structure. Hopefully nerdfighteria is someone stronger in that regard since we have Hank and John as figureheads who can better define what it's all about.  The saddest part is it seems to ruin good friendships just because one person calls themselves one thing and another person calls themselves another thing. I can think of a few examples, involving both friends and minor celebrities related to the video game scandal I will leave unnamed to avoid incoming brigading. You just want to scream at these people ""YOU BELIEVE IN THE SAME IDEALS! WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING OVER WHICH HASHTAG YOU CHOOSE TO USE!"""

(Side note, structures emerge Everywhere. If there's no leadership, there will be ideologues. And the dynamic of the group as a whole will be selected by the ideologues they rally behind. John and Hank make a good choice for this. Other groups have... less than stellar examples of this)"

We could just trust Hank, because we love Hank, and know he's smart, but that's not how science works.

nerdfighters,389czj,techno_logic,6,Wed Jun 3 07:25:50 2015 UTC,I don't think you need to feel attacked. Most of the video is about him being amazed by nature in spite of himself.
nerdfighters,389czj,kentonj,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:20:02 2015 UTC,"If I had to venture an opinion, I would vote that nature makes him uncomfortable at times and in ways that he probably doesn't understand too well, because he spends his life examining the narratives of interesting people, as opposed to the depths of the outdoors. Both are equally fascinating! John just spends his time primarily in one sphere, and I think that this video is him acknowledging that although nature makes him uncomfortable (In the way that some people truly enjoy skydiving, while others would have nothing to do with it whatsoever) it's still a fascinating and wonderful thing to be had (read: I would never skydive, but imagine to feel like you're flying, if only for a second!)

It's a pretty handy FAQ vid for new people, and I'm not sure why they don't show it anymore.  That vid is 6 yrs old (wow I'm old) so there are some things that have happened since then. For instance, no one says decepticon in reference to people who are anti-nerdfighter. We're too inclusive for that. Also I've never heard the term not-some being used as the opposite of awesome. The playlist link at the end also doesn't work anymore.   Also this video doesn't mention the project4awesome, which has several vids explaining what it is. The formation of spinoff youtube channels like crashcourse, hankschannel, hankgames, gameswithhank, healthcaretriage, scishow, scishowspace, lizziebennet, etc. are also not mentioned. Also, John's more recent books are not mentioned.

These days nerdfighters are understood to be members of the fandom, and I don't think we want to imply that fans of the vlogbrothers are better than other people because we're made of awesome. Personally I think everyone is somewhat made of awesome, but no one is perfect. The thing I like about nerdfighteria is it encourages people to focus on the awesome in themselves, and the ways they can be more awesome. So if you're trying to be a good person, I think that's enough. Even if you feel like you're failing at it, if you're continually trying then I think that's the important thing.   Also I think selfishness is not always bad, depending on how people define it. People need to take care of themselves, just not to the extent that they're being inconsiderate of other people."

Now, they are talking partially to each other but mostly to the audience.  They keep in contact with each other through other various means so it doesn't have to be as personal.  I believe everyone (YouTube stars, actors, any famous person) has a right to privacy - they have a right to have a personal life that doesn't get thrown around.  This is why John's daughter has never been seen on camera - he wants to keep that separate.  When people get 'big' enough they need to draw the line somewheres."

nerdfighters,381rcn,JayConz,10,Tue Jun 2 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"Which is interesting because these doubts were even present in the videos I've seen so far. There's a video where Hank discusses a comment on a previous video where he pretended to drink an entire bottle of Strawberry Hill wine, where the commentator was scolding him for promoting alcoholism or whatever. Basically Hank just shrugged it off and just said ""that's not how it is, and I think it should be pretty clear I don't advocate heavy drinking"" and that was that. That's not how they work nowadays, it seems."
nerdfighters,381rcn,tanhan27,9,Mon Jun 1 19:31:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I think we all need to keep in mind that back when they started they didn't have thirty or so employees relying upon them. When something you say can have an impact on the livelihoods of that many people, and by extension their families, most people would be a little more careful about what they have to say. That being said, I would love to see what would happen today if John had to spend fifteen hours in a Target like Hank did as a punishment back in the day."
nerdfighters,381rcn,squid_actually,5,Mon Jun 1 21:53:48 2015 UTC,Sadly so.  John's recent multiple apologies are evidence of this.

Granted, I'm glad they have the platform they do now and are able to do so many great things with that platform.  But part of me is very selfish.  I miss when it was fun and not about trying to stand for something.  Before they were some of the top vloggers when they could have bad videos with crappy cameras and silly ideas and cuss and do whatever.

nerdfighters,381rcn,conallkeenan,6,Tue Jun 2 18:14:11 2015 UTC,"I discovered the vlogbrothers in 2009 and watched them casually until early 2011 when I binge watched every video. It's crazy that was over 4 years ago when they had <200k subscribers. The channel has definitely gone through immense shifts and I remember being much more enamored with their videos and much more involved in the community. Anyone else remember the ning? Compared to other content creators, however, the tone has pretty much remained the same which is pretty incredible."
nerdfighters,381rcn,brightneonmoons,3,Mon Jun 1 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with the tone thing. They have to more heavily curate what they put out because, well, they're only doing one video a week each, so they kind of have to pick and choose what they talk about, but overall it still feels the same - genuine, smart, encouraging, embracing, awesome. I love what they've been doing with SnapChat recently, though - it's much more mundane, off-the-cuff, silly stuff like they used to do. (Gotta check them every day though and there's no way to go back in time and see what they've posted which is sad)."
nerdfighters,381rcn,MrEpicSushi,2,Mon Jun 1 21:56:57 2015 UTC,"I too am a fan of the snapchat stuff. I never used it before Hank started. I appreciate that it's a light medium for them to use. Honestly, I have no idea how they make videos at all. I'd be terrified if I had that many subscribers."

nerdfighters,383d75,Crystal_Joy,6,Mon Jun 1 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"Okay then.  John has written four solo books (in chronological order):  Looking for Alaska  An Abundance of Katherines  Paper Towns   The Fault in Our Stars (TFIOS)  I have read TFIOS, Looking for Alaska, and Paper Towns. All three are really great books so you should read all three of them at some point, but I personally think that Looking for Alaska is the superior book. Not only is it more mature in scope it is also his first book. It does have some NSFW content but it's all necessary for the story. What I think created the most impact for me was that Looking for Alaska is based off of John's high school experience at Indian Springs High School in Alabama. I also think that Alaska herself is just a fascinating and very well written character if not entirely my type of person.   TFIOS is a tear-jerker and brilliantly written. I have read it at least three times and it is wonderful. I do have a few criticisms of TFIOS but they're pretty superficial. For example I think that it's a bit too teen romance-drama for me. I read it for the coming of age and life lessons but not the romantic elements as much. That being said I still cried at the end of both the book and the movie so those elements still hit pretty close to home.   Paper Towns is (almost) a mystery book with adventure and action elements. Overall I found the plot to be somewhat lacking in the emotional punch that TFIOS brought or the sheer awesomeness of all of Looking for Alaska, but I digress. This book is just pure fun for most of it, but really brings in life lessons and emotion near the end. Paper Towns broke the stigma of mystery books for me, and that stigma being that everything is purposeful. Overall Paper Towns is still a great read which is full of action, suspense, comedy, and ultimately a great lesson for the reader.   I haven't actually read An Abundance of Katherines but many of my friends have and they tell me it is their least favorite book.   Now John has many collaboration books as well such as Will Grayson, Will Grayson in which John wrote half of a book while David Levithan wrote the other half. I actually haven't read it but it's supposedly pretty good; many of my friends and fellow nerdfighters have recommended it to me. He also collaborated on Let it Snow, but I don't know anything about that book so I can't help you there.   Also try to read ome of the Nerdfighter Book Club books like Behind the Beautiful Forevers. I have read BTBF and it's really good. It tells the story of five years within a slum in the city of Mumbai. It's depressing, heartbreaking, but most of all eye-opening like no other book that I have ever read. It's definitely worth checking out.  Hope this helps and DFTBA!"
nerdfighters,383d75,FrogsRock,2,Mon Jun 1 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"Oooh I read Let it Snow. It's a three part book, with the stories fairly disconnected. John, Lauren Myracle, and Maureen Johnson each wrote one. Personally I found them enjoyable but also fairly generic young adult stories, not a lot of meat which is to be expected for the format."
nerdfighters,383d75,hydrohawke,4,Tue Jun 2 02:33:04 2015 UTC,"Which one to ""start with"" is kind of a matter of personal preference.  TFiOS is by far the most well-known and most recent, so most of the more common references to John's books come from here nowadays. Regardless of anything else about the book, this is probably the best and fastest way to jump into John's books (and, by extension, Nerdfighteria) at this point.  Looking for Alaska is his first book, and feels the most ""raw""; doesn't pull a lot of punches in its content. Starting with his earliest book isn't a bad way to go.  That being said, An Abundance of Katherines and Paper Towns are both fantastic for their own reasons. AAoK is my personal favorite, so I wouldn't put too much stock into what people say is the ""weakest"" or ""strongest"" - that's highly up to the reader.  The last two (Let it Snow and Will Grayson Will Grayson) can be saved for last, since they're collaboration works with other authors who are pretty prominent figures in the Nerdfighter community."
nerdfighters,383d75,Data_Error,5,Mon Jun 1 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about AAoK. I really like it, but it feels kind of different than John's other books, so I can see why others might not. I think it feels more ridiculous, like you definitely know you're in a story, but I really like that. I'm also a math nerd, so that makes it extra fun."
nerdfighters,383d75,thenerdiestmenno,4,Mon Jun 1 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"Welcome new nerdfighter! If you're a fan of young adult literature, then I can tell you John Green will most surely be a treat.  /u/FrogsRock Did a fantastic job giving you a list of his work, the only thing I think he missed is a holiday collaboration he did with Lauren Myracle and Maureen Johnson called Let it Snow, in which there are three short Christmas-themed romance stories that all tie together, and John writes one of the stories. It's cute, but so short it is hardly worth your time imo.  I agree with most of the things FrogsRock said about LfA, TFIOS, and Paper Town so I double those recommendations. If you're going to start, start with Looking for Alaska. Now, let's talk about An Abundance of Katherines and Will Grayson, Will Grayson  aAoK is about this super intelligent boy who has dated like, 20-something girls named Katherine in his life, all of which dumped him rather than he dumping them. Frustrated and upset by being dumped, him and his best friend go on a road trip and they find this neat little town and yeah. It's pretty good, but in my opinion it is the weakest link in John's solo works. If you like the other three it's worth your time, but don't start with it.  WGWG is about two boys named Will Grayson who meet up through some pretty interesting turns of events. While it is co-authored by David Levithan, it is very clear who wrote what because each author writes in their respective Will Grayson's character perspective. John Green's half is arguably a fairly normal teen romance novel where his Will Grayson has to learn some hard truths about himself to become a better person, etc etc, and Levithan does something similar only his Will Grayson is gay. It's a very funny novel, but quite an offshoot from John's normal work."
nerdfighters,383d75,blessedhellfire,2,Mon Jun 1 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"I've read and own all of John Green's books. I started with The Fault in Our Stars and although it is probably my favorite, I wish I read some of his older books first. You can definitely tell how Green has progressed in his writing while reading his older books. Also, TFIOS is his only book narrated by a girl so it was kinda weird to get used to a boy's perspective while reading his other works. They are all fantastic and I don't think it makes a big difference in the order in which you read them. An Abundance of Katherine's and Papertowns are very similar in my opinion so I wouldn't read those two back to back. Papertowns the movie comes out next month so maybe read that one first before it comes out? Enjoy and welcome to the club!"
nerdfighters,383d75,sourpatchedmisfits,2,Mon Jun 1 20:22:50 2015 UTC,"Looking for Alaska is John's first, and my favourite.  Just buy it and read it.   If you read any summaries you will go into the books with preconceptions, which might spoil the experience."
nerdfighters,383d75,eadlith,2,Mon Jun 1 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Looking for Alaska is one of my favourite books. I was blown away by it when I read it last year, and that isn't something I can say about many other books. It also led me to discover Nerdfighteria and all 17 (or however many there are) of Hank/John's channels. TFiOS is also a good first choice."

Its much harder for women as we saw in the video where that girl walks down the street in NYC and people keep judging and approaching her. That doesn't really happen to men; we're not held up to a standard in every situation the same way. Also this video was largely about bikinis and while I'm not one to judge I haven't seen many men wearing them.  Edit: I came off a little preachy. This is imho"

nerdfighters,37o0i9,Rose94,4,Fri May 29 01:26:13 2015 UTC,"I think John's key issue is that he doesn't like the idea that Batman tries to take on a multitude of problems as judge and jury all on himself, when the effort would be better suited to a collaborative effort wherein it could call itself on bad behavior, whereas Hank's view is of a person that sees a problem, and immediately works to put his resources towards solving that problem. Both arguments actually have a lot of merit, and they demonstrate an interesting truism about the character, something we see a lot in future renditions.   That is to say, he doesn't trust anyone else to be able to make good decisions other than himself, but that he still puts himself on the line to get the job done. A laudible, if flawed, mindset that ultimately will lead to more problems caused than good.  I think the Hank v. John Batman argument can actually tell us a Lot, from both sides, about problem solving in the real world. No man is an island, but those that take the initiative to solve problems can still find nobility through action, and will find more of it if they work together with others."
nerdfighters,37o0i9,InevitablyPerpetual,4,Fri May 29 03:38:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just rewatched the two videos (and the song! I love that song!) and I think you're right that they're arguing two different things. I think this issue is that John wants to look at Batman in a realistic sense: the actual act of spending billions on hyper-advanced weaponry to fight crime is NOT a good strategy. And batman does do a terrible job if we impose real-world concerns upon him.  But Hank points out that Batman is a simplification. And as he himself says, all simplifications are lies. Batman represents how all of us want to help out (we are all batpeople), and Batman represents this quality in us. Having said that, I think he's wrong that Gotham's underbelly merely represents evil, and John's right that even in the simplified Batman story the poverty here causes major issues.  Basically, the issue as I see it is that Hank wants to analyse Batman as a simplified idealism, where of course we have to portray the good guy as literally fighting the bad guys. John wants to introduce elements of reality, ""Gotham never gets better for long"", and I think really what he wants to say is that IF anyone does get hold of a billion dollars, do NOT become batman. And I think that's a worthy point to get across."

nerdfighters,37ktng,TitoTheMidget,6,Thu May 28 16:35:58 2015 UTC,"Its the same director and producers as TFioS, and I think John said in a video that he had a more active role in this film. Plus, Nat Wolf is awesome. They're probably going to change a few things for the sake of the medium - film is different than a novel - but I think that things will be OK if not awesome.  The one thing I am concerned about is the marketing campaign; the advertisements for TFioS were atrocious and lead a lot of non-nerdfighters to believe it was just some standard chick flick where the girl HAPPENS to have some sort of illness. I hope they're more honest this time, but I'm not expecting it and at the end of the day the trailers, posters, and TV spots are really the least important thing about the movie."

nerdfighters,37kyph,Cutlesnap,2,Thu May 28 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"This community is about a huge variety of topics - pretty much anything that can be considered relevant to nerdfighters, the people who make up the community. There is no narrower definition. The particular nerdfighter who posted this video might consider its topic to be very relevant to them. And it is relevant to what makes this community what it is: an educational video on YouTube that covers a topic many people might not be familiar with.  So instead of pushing it away without a second thought, maybe engage in a discussion or debate about it. Say what it is you don't like about it. If not, ignore it and look for a post here you might consider more relevant to the interests of the nerdfighter named 411eli."

If we are going to be ok with similarly related topics, we should be open to a discussion about BDSM. The video made me look at the topic from a manner I had not previously.  Do we have a sort of NSFW tag in this sub (or is it standard)? Might help to alleviate the fears of minors or people at work having this pop up."

nerdfighters,37kyph,LovisTheWise,4,Thu May 28 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"There's nothing in the video that an underage person might be harmed by, but I guess that depends on your definition of harm. If you consider being exposed to sex in any form harm, even if it is a healthy, educational discussion, then perhaps it's inappropriate for underage people by your standards.   There are also subreddits for every single topic covered by every video ever posted here. Subreddits for economics, world history, politics, and sexual expression. But videos have been posted in this subreddit for every single one of those topics, linked only by the fact that the people posting them were nerdfighters and thought the topic was relevant to them as nerdfighters.   Videos by Sexplanations are considered relevant to nerdfighters. Why not this video that covers a very similar topic in a very similar way?"

I'm part of your demographic so, kinda interested."
nerdfighters,37ieg6,lokilugi_,1 point,Thu May 28 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"It mainly had to do with time restrictions and the type of study I wanted to run.  If I wanted to get a lot of responses to simpler questions, I could have done a survey, but I wanted to be able to go more in-depth about people's motivations and viewing choices.  Basically, I decided to study a few detailed conversations rather than a bunch of hard numbers and trends.  And I wanted to at least attempt to get a more diverse pool of respondents, so I took to Reddit hoping to get some feedback.  I got a lot of responses, but only 17 actually followed through and answered my questions in the few weeks I had to finish this project.  This topic could certainly be re-studied via quantitative methods like a survey, but I just decided to go with interviews because I wanted to go a little bit deeper and take my time.  Let me know if you have any other questions!"
nerdfighters,37ieg6,lokilugi_,1 point,Thu May 28 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for the response! I have two questions, I'll ask them in different threads for ease of following the topic.   ""The desire to learn has been correlated with the increase in education levels over the past few decades.""  Do you think that this is a causal link? Without some education to give them a very basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity for example, they just won't be interested in entertainment based on this subject? Or was there something else that the participants had in common that drew them to edutainment?"
nerdfighters,37ieg6,lokilugi_,1 point,Thu May 28 20:41:53 2015 UTC,"It was a little bit of both.  For the most part, people talked about school providing them with a basic knowledge of the world and lighting the spark for lifelong learning.  They then took to YouTube to either supplement what they learned in the classroom or answer questions they couldn't have answered in school.  There is a great article in the New York Times about this http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html?referrer&_r=1  Other students really disconnected from their formal education experience and said they watched YouTube because their schooling completely failed them and they had a natural curiosity to learn more.  In general though, I think it really depends on the person.  Formal education can improve all it wants, but some people are satisfied with what they learn in the classroom, and others are willing to put in the effort to learn as much as they can.  However, the more tidbits of knowledge people receive from increased education, the ""cooler"" is becomes to be smarter.  So, I think we'll continue to see a correlation between more education and use of educational YouTube videos as more content is created."

EDIT: This is what he said when asked about it   It's certainly something we're considering, but right now we're focusing on the tools that will be most useful to students in secondary school, particularly those who may not have access to the newest and best resources through their school systems. We're doing little series--Intellectual Property, for instance--that we think are really important to an Internet-based audience. And that may be how Philosophy makes its initial appearance. But I think it'll be a year or two down the road. (It's hard to expand crash course, because there's no real economy of scale benefits, and each course costs a LOT to make.)"

nerdfighters,37gdqq,brought_,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:10:34 2015 UTC,"The latter link is not a good source. It reads like someone who knows nothing about Greek philosophy or Hindu philosophy at all. Just random quotes smattered about.   “In the same way, he continues, the worshipping of the Virgin Mary in Catholicism is probably borrowed from the Hindu cult of Devi”   Catholics don't worship Mary(no matter how many protestant propaganda websites you open up).   sacred bread (Prasadam)   Again,something which can only be put by someone painfully ignorant of the whole thing. Here is what 'sacred bread' means.   (the ancient Sanatana Dharma: Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh)   Conveniently forgetting that Vishnu/Shiva is elevated to God in Vaishnava/Shaiva vedantic schools respectively(I simplified here) and the only Vedantic school which retains the triad subordinates all the three to Devi.(Shaktas they are).And no one who knows what Christian trinities are supposed to mean can map them to 'creation-preservation-destruction'.  Also,btw,it's really funny to me that that fraudulent idiot with no paramapra,Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is quoted as an authority on Hindu stuff.   “we the Greeks have stolen to the Barbarians their philosophy”   This refers to the Church fathers using Stoic and Neoplatonic metaphysics in their philosophy and cosmology.  Also,those people saying 'Samkhya is basically Pythagoreanism' have seriously outdated information on their hands.The only thinga in common Samkhya(atheistic) and Pythagoreanism had in common are their beliefs in reincarnation,vegetarianism and ascetic practices. Samkhya folks don't believe that everything is numbers and mathematics(a very fundamental belief of Pythagoreans,for starters).   “the Greeks were always speaking of India as the sacred territory of Dionysus and historians working under Alexander the Great clearly mention chronicles of the Puranas as sources of the myth of Dionysus   Because all Saivite ascetics are clearly known for participating in drunken orgies all the time. (Only vamachara-tantrikas do such things,and even then,it is to a small extent).   Roger-Pol Droit   I'm pretty sure his statements are taken out of context here.  If you want some actual Indian influences on Greek philosophy,some Bauddha ascetic practises and some sramana monks(the Gymnosophists) are there."

nerdfighters,3778ss,thoughtsfromclosets,54,Mon May 25 13:25:28 2015 UTC,"I have actually been thinking the same thing over the past few days. It's really weird to have most of their posts on social media reposted here. I know that John and Hank started nerdfighteria, but it's not like we are a cult who worships them. There should be more an emphasis on OC that exemplifies the nerdfighter values, instead of just what John or Hank had for breakfast today."
nerdfighters,3778ss,icethepartyplanner,9,Mon May 25 14:14:32 2015 UTC,This is a much more awesome reasoning
nerdfighters,3778ss,AncientSwordRage,5,Mon May 25 15:44:35 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a daily/weekly summary of some of the less-important posts?  It would reduce the flooding quite a bit, while still delivering content that apparently some people do want to see."
nerdfighters,3778ss,_talking_bird,5,Mon May 25 14:37:24 2015 UTC,"Damn. You're angry. I'm sorry if this has caused any problems.  I'd like to get a consensus here. I am just posting Nerdfighter-related content, which is, well, Hank, John and Nerdfighteria. I noticed the posts from this account did fill the subreddit a bit, but reddit has a natural algorithm to deal with posts people don't care for and I've had no messages from anyone so I assumed things were fine.  I've noticed the Instagram posts are less engaged with than the others since they are just Hank and John's day-to-day activities, but the posts from the effyeahnerdfighters Tumblr seem to be enjoyed by the people here."
nerdfighters,3778ss,nerdfighterbot,12,Mon May 25 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"Not angry at all. I just find myself overwhelmed with the thought ""Wow if someone had a bot pulling all of my social media content onto reddit. That'd be kind of creepy.""  I know the bot is well-intentioned, and I'm not advocating for your demise or anything. I just find it's kind of clogging the pipes a bit with content that doesn't make sense. A lot of it is either unengaging or minorly enagaing. Like a picture of John's neighbor hanging an Irish flag because of marriage reform seems very much on the cusp of not needing to be posted here. It is like world-suck decreasing and stuff I suppose and it did engage well, but it also doesn't really have substance other than the fact that it's John posting it. This does not seem like great criteria for posting something.   I feel like if Hank and John produce good, engaging social media content, then it will be posted here naturally."
nerdfighters,3778ss,nerdfighterbot,5,Mon May 25 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"I actually updated it earlier today so each Instagram post will end with '- John Green on Instagram' or '- Hank Green on Instagram' so it makes more sense for someone scrolling past.  I actually agree with what you're saying though about sharing their Instagram though. Most of it is largely irrelevant, and though it is in the public eye sharing it all here is a little creepy. I'll turn the connection to both of their Instagrams off, but can return it if there is demand for it. (I doubt it though)  I think I'll keep the connection to effyeahnerdfighters though; again it depends on the consensus or admin thoughts. Among the fan-art, it also shares useful information for involving yourself in Nerdfighteria in different ways."

nerdfighters,378mfv,lem0nhe4d,1 point,Mon May 25 20:51:12 2015 UTC,if you bring your own bike my sure you get an extremely good lock as theft i common.  id recommend using the Dublin bikes program. its 20 euro for a years pass. the first 30 minutes after you take the bike out is free then 50 cents per hour after. http://www.dublinbikes.ie/misc/maintenance.html

nerdfighters,378mfv,lem0nhe4d,1 point,Mon May 25 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm from Northern Ireland so I'm not sure on everything but;   The cost of living in Dublin is quite high compared to the rest of the country. The average rental cost of an apartment is around €1000 per month which is about $1100 depending on the exchange rate but UCD halls could be cheaper.  In terms of money I guess just bring as much as you can! Like I said though Dublin can be expensive but here's an overview of the average costs of everyday items in the city. You can change the currency on there to give you a better idea of how much you might need. Dublin transport is pretty good. UCD is about 2 or 3 miles out of the city centre but there's a good central bus service, a tram network, a rapid transit system & loads of taxis. Here's a link to the Dublin transport page. I can't think of any factual books or films off the top of my head but movies like Once, Intermission, Adam & Paul and the Roddy Doyle trilogy (The Commitments, The Snapper & The Van) show a more realistic side of Dublin as opposed to the stereotypical fiddledy-di image that is usually portrayed.   I hope this helps and enjoy your semester!"

You autographed my annotated copy of Looking for Alaska. That book literally got me through high school, which I was thinking of dropping out of, and saved my life.   I have since purchased many copies of that book, which I rotate out to friends and acquaintances. Sometimes I get them back and send them out to someone new, sometimes I have to replenish stock and that's okay.   The only book I've never borrowed out is my annotated copy that you were kind enough to sign and shake my hand. I went on vacation and had it in my suitcase as I always do and the airline lost my bag.   I am currently in the process of reannotating a new copy. One that isn't as worn and held together by batman duct tape. Everytime I've read that book I've written something new in the pages.   It would mean the absolute world to me if after I am done with this read through if I could send it to you to sign. I'd pay for postage both ways of course. I'm just utterly heartbroken as this was something I wanted to give to my daughter when she hit high school.   Thanks for taking the time, John.   Much love,  Cassi"

But (and be honest), do you die a little bit inside every time you have to say ""brought to you by our friends at GEICO"" in a Mental Floss video?"
nerdfighters,36nejj,hazelgracelancaster,117,Wed May 20 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"GREAT question. And the answer is basically yes.  Geico is actually by far the best of mf's sponsors, because they don't want anything more than ""brought to you be Geico."" The others want us to be like, ""Check out Samsung's amazing new phone with its 5g processor and unprecedented call quality,"" or whatever, and THAT definitely makes me die a little inside.  That said, I really love mental floss video, and so many people enjoy it, and it's not the kind of thing that could pay for itself with crowdfunding, so I do think sponsorship is the way to make it sustainable. I understand that, but as I'm sure you can gather from our overall approach to the business of online video, it's not our favorite way to pay for things. But there are also exceptions--Emerson's relationship with Scishow is so genuine and real (they just really love Scishow) that it doesn't bother me at all.  I'm also aware that the success of mental floss pays for a lot of stuff that I love doing but isn't as lucrative, like The Art Assignment, so mostly I just want to say to Geico thanks for letting us make The Art Assignment!"
nerdfighters,36nejj,cjhelms,18,Wed May 20 17:46:25 2015 UTC,Couldn't you pay some of it through crowdfunding(like you do with HCTriage) and limit the sponsorships?(sorry I'm a newbie to online video production costs)
nerdfighters,36nejj,Albriech,45,Wed May 20 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"Well, with mental floss it's a coproduction between us and the magazine, and to support the other parts of their business they often have to include video in an ad sale.

I've felt all those angers toward famous people in my own life, so I do get that. What I don't get is making threats against people. It's very disappointing and scary and sometimes it does make me feel like maybe I should not live such a public life. I am not one of those brave people willing to stand up to those who would do me harm; I am a coward and above all want to keep my family safe.  There are some protections on the legal side of things, but not enough. The underlying problem, I think, is that it's difficult for any of us to imagine those we think of as celebrities as real people--and so we talk to them differently from how we would talk to real people. The dehumanization of celebrity certainly isn't the biggest problem facing the world, but it's symptomatic of a much bigger problem, which is that it's very hard for all of us to understand on a second-by-second basis that everyone around us is really real, and that their fear and grief and joy is as real and intense as our own."

You're now able to match $20,000 donations on a whim, drive a Tesla, and I'm guessing your investment accounts are much larger than you ever imagined. Have your political or social views been affected? How does someone in your position perceive income inequality and the distribution of wealth?"
nerdfighters,36nejj,watthefoxx,57,Wed May 20 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"Great question.   For the record, I can't match $20,000 in donations on a whim; I can only make it LOOK LIKE I'm matching $20,000 in donations on a whim. :) Sarah and I believe in an idea introduced to us by Hank called secular tithing, in which we give a certain percentage of our income to charity each year. Most of that money is given privately, but I also think matching donations is a great way to help people who don't have lots of resources see their donations go further, so I'm trying to do more of those (hence the recent one). Obviously we've been able to dramatically increase the money we give to charity, which is amazing, and we've been able to set aside money for our kids to go to college, which is amazing, and we have what I never thought would be part of my life as a writer--real, lifelong financial security. Our sudden wealth has changed my political and social views--because now I understand just how much the social and economic and political orders are biased toward those with wealth. I guess I understood it abstractly before, but I see it on a daily basis now--wealth itself begets more wealth, and more access, and more power, regardless of your values or your personality. I think it's almost impossible to be affluent and have any real sense of what it's like to struggle financially, particularly if you grow up with a lot of money. So it's important to remember that, and to listen to people who are not well off, because I think a lot of times wealthy people are surrounded by other wealthy people who have wealthy person interests (golf, say, or art collecting) and inside that echo chamber you completely lose touch with what life is like for almost everyone living it, which is kind of tragic for you as well as for everyone else.  So yeah it's probably made me slightly more politically and economically ""liberal"" in the sense that I'm more convinced now that redistribution of wealth is good for the economy and good for the social order.  I want to be clear that I'm not a saint--I like nice stuff and living in a nice house and everything."

This machine allows you to tape an entire evenings worth of your own dreams, which you can then watch at your leisure. However, the inventor of the dream VCR will only allow you to use this device if you agree to a strange caveat: When you watch your dreams, you must do so with your family and your closest friends in the same room. They get to watch your dreams along with you. And if you don’t agree to this, you can’t use the dream VCR. Would you still do this?  Defying all expectation, a group of Scottish marine biologists capture a live Loch Ness Monster. In an almost unbelievable coincidence, a bear hunter shoots a Sasquatch in the thigh, thereby allowing zoologists to take the furry monster into captivity. These events happen on the same afternoon. That evening, the president announces he may have thyroid cancer and will undergo a biopsy later that week. You are the front-page editor of The New York Times: What do you play as the biggest story?  You meet the perfect person. Romantically, this person is ideal; You find them physically attractive, intellectually stimulating, consistently funny, and deeply compassionate. However, they are one quirk: This individual is obsessed with Jim Hensons gothic puppet fantasy The Dark Crystal. Beyond watching it on DVD at least once a month, he/she peppers casual conversation with Dark Crystal references, uses Dark Crystal analogies to explain everyday events, and occasionally likes to talk intensely about the films deeper philosophy. Would this be enough to stop you from marrying this individual?  A novel titled Interior Mirror is released to mammoth commercial success (despite middling reviews). However, a curious social trend emerges: Though no one can prove a direct scientific link, it appears that almost 30 percent of the people who read this book immediately become homosexual. Many of the newfound homosexuals credit the book for helping them reach this conclusion about their orientation, despite the fact that Interior Mirror is ostensibly a crime novel with no homoerotic content (and was written by a straight man). Would this phenomenon increase (or decrease) the likelihood of you reading this book?"

Thyroid cancer is highly treatable, and many thyroid masses are benign, so there's a very good chance the President does not have cancer at all. If she does, it's likely curable. Still, I'd lead with that story, because the others might be hoaxes and I don't trust the reporting unless I've got my people out there in the field, which they wouldn't be, because I would never station anyone near Loch Ness.

nerdfighters,36nejj,MJtheProphet,21,Wed May 20 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not John, but I will also answer you.  Everyone has different ways of dealing with anxiety and depression. Like John, I had OCD (mine started when I was only about 6, and felt like it would never go away!), and other anxiety issues and pretty bad depression. For him, CBT and drugs are helpful - for me, CBT was totally useless and drugs were unappealing. Yet now, I'm pretty much completely free of my OCD, and although I have my bad moments my depression is not really a big problem anymore.  The point is that different therapies work for different people (or no therapy at all - the things that helped me most with my problems have been without the aid of professionals. But friends and family of mine have benefited greatly from good therapists). It depends on your particular situation and what you need to do, as a person, to overcome whatever it is you are trying to overcome. Medication and some behavioural therapies are for managing your symptoms so you don't suffer as much and can deal with your problems - longer-term therapies and other practices are about making you into the person you want to be. Mental 'illness' isn't all about symptoms, it's not something that can be separated from every other aspect of yourself!  Be honest and patient with yourself about how you feel, and why you think you feel that way. It's a long process. For some people it involves uncovering old and difficult memories. For other people it involves coming to terms with present realities. Most of the time it means you will need to gradually change certain things about your life, your behaviours, the way you react to things.  None of that is easy, and if you need help doing it, look for that help! If one therapist is crap, find another one. If you can't find good therapy look elsewhere. Self-help, religion, sports, music, gardening, whatever helps you connect with others and yourself.  As for making friends at school, try joining groups. I ended up joining the philosophy club (I'm in philosophy) in first year kind of on a whim, and made some lifelong friends. Going to class isn't really enough if your program doesn't involve a lot of discussion or group work. Look for cool things you want to get involved in - whether its a nerdfighter club, chess club, sports, activism. It's tough to put yourself out there, but once you do it its easy. If you can't find friends at school because all the people around you suck, then look elsewhere - a youth centre, a community garden. Volunteer somewhere once a week, you'll be surprised at the good relationships you can build!  Also talk to your professors. I mean, as long as your professors aren't assholes (plenty of them are!). Professors spend a lot of their time complaining that no students ever come talk to them in their office hours. But they didn't get into their field because they don't like talking about it - if you want to have a conversation about something you're learning in class, go talk to your prof. They are just people after all. It's a good way to overcome some fear most students have of going outside their bubble of comfort.  Anyway, that was a long ramble but hopefully somewhat helpful. Good luck!"

nerdfighters,36nejj,cooperific,92,Wed May 20 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"Well, the main thing is that I understand now that children are not, like, angels who are corrupted by the world. Children lack empathy and learn it as they go. And they have rich and complicated interior lives from the very beginning. In short, I always imagined kids straightforwardly and it turns out that so far as I can tell from the very beginning they demand to be imagined complexly."

nerdfighters,36nejj,MightyNib,87,Wed May 20 17:52:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, just come up and say hi and hopefully we can have a brief, pleasant conversation in which we can both express our real mutual gratitude and maybe take a picture and then both go about our days. I love those conversations and am very grateful to have them.  To be honest, it's almost never a problem when it's a nerdfighter--or even someone who knows the word nerdfighter. Those people KNOW me. They know I'm anxious. They know I have a real life and a real family and that I'm a real person. What happens a lot more now is that I'm just a celebrity--just someone people know they want to meet because they want to meet a famous person and one of them is right here in the Target in Indianapolis--and they're maybe a little more aggressive or whatever.   Or yes as the person says below when people just like follow me around or take pictures of me or whatever, or take pictures of my kids. (I am not thrilled with strangers taking pictures of my kids.)   What I try to do--because I find myself starstruck regularly--is 1. to say thank you to the person for their work, and 2. to ask for a picture if I want one, and 3. to keep it short. That's what seems to work for me as a fan."

What's the best piece of parenting advice that you have? 2. What kind of roles do you see older Nerdfighters [30+] having in relation to the younger members of the community? 3. What has been your favorite moments in the adaptations of the books? 4. Who the eff is Hank? 5. How about those fishing boat proceeds? Anything in that box yet?  DFTBA!"
nerdfighters,36nejj,union_jack_sparrow,30,Wed May 20 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"Love your kids and when you lose patience leave the room for a minute. 2. I think older nerdfighters are hugely important to the community and have been since 2007. They serve as mentors and help orient the community toward different kinds of worldsuck-decreasing. 3. My favorite moment on the Paper Towns set was staying up all night with everybody in the cast filming some stuff on the road trip and just feeling overwhelmed with gratitude toward these kids, who were so deeply committed to the movie. 4. Hank is a kind of goose that's not FROM Canada and therefore is not Canadian. 5. I BALL SO HARD BUT STILL NO FISHING BOAT PROCEEDS."
nerdfighters,36nejj,MJtheProphet,15,Thu May 21 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Really, John, the fishing boat proceeds shouldn't be that hard.  You just need to be a crew member on a fishing boat with normally less than 10 crew members, and get paid a portion of what the catch sells for.  Basically, what you're looking for is the opportunity to be on Deadliest Catch.  I guess you could say you're ... looking for Alaska."

nerdfighters,36nejj,crystal1107,50,Thu May 21 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"So one of the themes I see in ""Paper Towns"" is that we should not romanticize people because it turns others into people they are not... But then I feel like Augustus in ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is one of the most romanticized versions of any teenager... he really breaks that theme in Paper Towns.  Is this thought legitimate?   Anyway, love your books and thanks for doing this!"
nerdfighters,36nejj,BartokTheBat,146,Wed May 20 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"Well, Hazel certainly romanticizes Augustus at the beginning of the book--for starters, she calls him Augustus, which is the name of Roman Emperors.  But as she gets to know him better, there's more and more that annoys her--particularly Augustus's fascination with leaving a mark and living a grand life. Where she initially finds his pretension sort of sweet if a bit over-the-top, she starts to see it as a symptom of his unwillingness just to be himself--his small, unromantic life in which he is loved deeply but not broadly.  Part of this can be seen in her journey from calling him ""Augustus"" to calling him ""Gus."" But it's also hopefully in the scenes where she just refuses to accept his romanticized worldview that good lives are lived on big stages. So the whole idea is that he goes from this larger-than-life, performative person to a guy who can't get out of bed and ends up pissing his pants--but it's that person, the real person with whom Hazel is finally and irrevocably in love.  Don't know if I pulled that off in the novel, but that was the idea."
nerdfighters,36nejj,malls_co,84,Wed May 20 17:57:45 2015 UTC,You pulled it off in the novel.

nerdfighters,36nejj,WayfaringStranger808,23,Thu May 21 02:09:07 2015 UTC,Yep now I see it... Holy smokes John Green just helped me understand his novel. Wow this is cool. Thanks!
nerdfighters,36nejj,asoccer22,6,Wed May 20 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"In the beginning, sure.  I mean, I'd say he romanticizes himself.  But after Amsterdam, when he can't plan everything out or design speeches or really keep up appearances, we (and Hazel) see the Gus beneath the Augustus.  And in that way, I'd say that Augustus's character holds up the Paper Towns theme fairly well.  Anxiously awaits validation from an author who doesn't believe in authorial validation"

nerdfighters,36nejj,13isaluckynumber,54,Wed May 20 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"Read and write a lot. Go to readings in your town. Meet other people who are writing, both online and in your town. Make writing and reading and talking about books a part of your daily life.  I have also worked as a restaurant server. It is hard work, and physically demanding, but if you can protect your interior space and remain you on the inside, and let your mind run wild while you bring out food and serve drinks and get treated terribly by most of your customers, you will find this actually helps your writing, because you can spend hours alone with your stories and then when you sit down to write your body will be tired but your writing mind will be rested and excited to get to work.  That's what worked for me anyway. Good luck!"

nerdfighters,36nejj,sophloaf247,36,Wed May 20 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"Sarah and I were talking about this. We recently celebrated our 9th wedding anniversary and we were both, like, you know, we got really lucky but we really had no idea what the hell we were getting into.  And maybe it's not even possible to know what you're getting into. You're not just marrying a person you love and want to hang out with for the rest of your life. You're also, like, hiring a co-CEO with whom you will run your household and your family. You're agreeing to become part of someone else's family, and their family will become yours in all the best ways and the most challenging ways. You're agreeing to have children together, or not have them, and to raise them together as best you can, which means that you're agreeing on some shared value system that will evolve through the years.  Basically, the promises you're making are so huge and so crazy that you cannot possibly know what you're promising to do when you promise to do it, which is why they call it a vow. The whole thing is nuts.  But it's also just like anything else in life: You want to be with people you respect who respect you, people with whom you can be open who can be open with you, people who are kind and trustworthy and share your values and will be on your team no matter what.  Godspeed, MightyNib. Adulthood is fascinating and wonderful and full of great and terrible surprises. And I'm still (hopefully) just getting started."
nerdfighters,36nejj,sophloaf247,4,Thu May 21 13:23:33 2015 UTC,"As a fellow nerdfighter my advice is to find someone who first and foremost respects you and who you in turn respect. If your relationship is not one of mutual respect, it is not one you should stay in. Period. After that, someone you don't get tired of, someone who makes you smile and who you can make smile, someone who takes care of you and who you take care of, someone who will be a good parent if you want to have kids or of you aren't sure, someone who is a good roommate, and someone who you love and who loves you."

Do you have any advice for someone (currently a senior economics major in university) struggling with faith, the idea of a god, and religion as a whole?"
nerdfighters,36nejj,MissMuse,43,Wed May 20 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"I think my Christianity is one straight of orthodoxy, but it's definitely not evangelical.  I guess I'd say I'm glad that you're struggling. It's good to struggle. I hope, though, that the struggle is over the big and interesting questions--what should my values be, what are my responsibilities to others, where are the places where my talents and skills meet the world's needs, how can I live hopefully and honestly in a world so defined by suffering, what meaning can I find in life, etc. Those are good questions to be struggling with. I hope you're not worrying about, like, going to heaven or going to hell, because there are so many good and interesting and beautiful things to be thinking about that are right here in this world. I believe we can worry about the next world, if there is one, when we get there.  Here's my honest advice: I don't think you need to believe in God or go to church to have a rich and fulfilling life. I think for some people, God and/or church can be helpful to living an outward-focused life. For me, religious faith is a helpful lens when it comes to thinking about the big questions I cited above. God--whether God is ""real"" or ""constructed"" is of very little concern to me--helps me to be closer to the person I wish to be, closer to the kind of person who as Hank put it solves more problems than they create. And I like church. I like kneeling. I like thinking about the scriptures. I like the richness of these stories that have been read and reread for over a thousand years.  But there are lots of ways to live a good and fulfilling life. That you are seeking yours is good news to me."
nerdfighters,36nejj,Harry_sully,13,Thu May 21 13:52:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm a writer and I'd like to know, how much creative control should you have when it comes to adaptations of your own work? I wrote a book a while ago and I also wrote a short story spinoff that a filmmaker somewhere is working on adapting into a short animated movie.  Thanks for doing this AMA, I can't wait to see Paper Towns (I have to read it)... Also, if it's not too much to ask, please do more Crash Course Literature. I love that series."
nerdfighters,36nejj,hazelungraceful,38,Wed May 20 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"Like, movie adaptations?   Many people will disagree with me about this, and I might be wrong, but my general feeling is that most novelists don't know how to make movies. I certainly don't. So I think authors should be consulted, and I think their opinions should be valued, but I don't think authors should have veto power or ultimate creative control.   I don't even really WANT that kind of control to be honest, because I'd rather let movie people make movies and then be able to keep doing my work, which is books and YouTube.  But it's pretty easy for me to say that because I've had two charmed experiences with incredibly generous producers and directors who care deeply about the books and their themes and make really good movies. If the movies had been less good, I'd probably feel differently."

nerdfighters,36nejj,omgpewpz,41,Wed May 20 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Chbosky is a tremendously experienced screenwriter and director and movie person, so he is in a different category.  I should also add that like Gillian Flynn wrote a GREAT script for Gone Girl, so obviously some novelists can do it all, and I congratulate them. I'm just not one of them."

Both Paper Towns and TFIOS contain the word ""fuck,"" but it's used rather sparingly compared to TFIOS.  With Katherines, I was trying to make a specific comment about how censorship has functioned in the U.S., especially since at the time there was a lot of it happening in YA literature where authors and publishers--including me--would self-censor because they wanted their books in schools and large library collections.  I'm sure I'll never be quite as free and oblivious to the reality of publishing as I was when I wrote LFA, but I try really hard to separate writing from publishing. (That's one reason I haven't written a book in a while. There's been SO MUCH publishing--foreign editions and movies and fan mail and bonus content and etc. etc.--that it's been hard to think about writing.)"
nerdfighters,36nejj,Redrum01,7,Wed May 20 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I read all of your books in a swoosh (over about a month's time) and that was something that stood out to me.  The swearing in LFA felt very natural, and its absence afterwards was jarring for a bit; but then your writing kind of went in a new direction and the absence wasn't as felt.  (Quick fan moment -- TFIOS is rightly lauded but your short story in ""Let it Snow"" is one of the most perfectly crafted YA nuggets I've ever read.  Though Maureen Johnson's preceding it was also stellar.)  Sucks that natural, lived-in language faces censorship like that though.     I just looked this up and couldn't find it -- are there any actual standards about this?  Like, a book can have no more than five uses of the word ""fuck"" or it won't be in the Young Adult section?  Or is it one of those pernicious ""know it when you see it"" deals?  P.S. Sorry about writing vs. publishing.  What you say makes sense."

nerdfighters,36r7b5,_9a_,2,Thu May 21 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"Your ad graphic in the beginning cut off half your face. Either recenter it or full screen it.  Pull the camera back a bit and center it a bit lower. The top of your head is cut off.  Leave the story title caption on screen longer - I think you had a funny pun in there but it flashed by before I could read it and enjoy the wit.   In that vein, sync the title captions with the beginning of the story, not after the intro.  I liked the fullscreen with voiceover you used with the ""craiglist on crack"" story more than the split screen. If you do use split screen, consider a graphic doodle to outline it; it will set off the information more.  Bridging off the split screen, if you do use it, sit off to one side and fill the empty half of the screen with the pictures. Pretend it's your invisible co-host. That way it won't clip your face.  Slow down your delivery some, and give a beat or two before launching into the next story. Treat it like a paragraph break - it signals that that old thing is done, here is the next one.  The tone of the clip is entertaining. I hope you find enough material to keep it going. If you want some quality inspiration, check out LoadingReadyRun's Check Point"

Also, hope this is going to be open to all kinds of projects, not just the kind that need attachments :P  I'm definitely thinking 'project' should be a very broad term here, and anyone with any nerdfighter-related idea can submit a project, so not just online projects, but hopefully also things like creating IRL nerdfighter gatherings and IRL projects like...idk, positive pranking, scavenger hunts, whatever people want to do to bring nerdfighting to their communities.

nerdfighters,36nu5w,Ima_Person,2,Wed May 20 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. A more meritocratic Harvard is probably a more asian Harvard. Some say Harvard simply limits asian enrollment to make it as diverse as possible, however this is a fallacy as there is still diversity within asian groups.  I think however, asian americans should simply win the legal battle yet not get so attached to the Ivies. The ivies seem to mostly function as a selection institution, like a modeling agency, not as a training agency, like a karate school, basic military training, tutor, or personal trainer. In the latter they are more so confident they could pick anyone committed and the training itself would be the value added. At Harvard they more so depend on getting ""Harvard"" types of people, perhaps the Emma Watsons of the world. This should tell you something about the nature of these institutions.   Theres another issue in the asian american community. They, in combination with the presence of the ivies - might be primarily pursuing a method of education where everything is sacrificed in high school in favor of all personal time spent on AP classes, sat scores, and so forth. It is a focus on things which are easily measured. Some say it is hypocritical to want the Ivies to go more purely by test scores and then protest going by testing only. This might in fact be a little contradictory, but I think asians should want to win - and deservedly so - because it is good to get people to admit racism isn't over. As for the system in general i wish it was more egalitarian. Students should pursue what they are interested in, have plenty of sleep, be somewhat happy, instead of worrying about their class rank or AP piling so as to get a chance to get to harvard. The presence and ""brand"" of the Ivies are harmful in this regard."

In my mind you advertise more charities and teach us more about poverty and overall do more good to create peace. Hank seems more of an educator and while educators are important I feel peace makers are more important. (not trying to suck up)

I wrote a bot to work with the v3 API: https://github.com/notatallshaw/arandabot   I'm still working out kinks, but a few people other than me have got it working and in general feel free to look over the code to see how I handled stuff. My biggest ommision right now is it still relies on username and password for reddit, which is being decomed in favor of oauth in August. but I'll be pushing an update way before then.

nerdfighters,369f11,zurtex,1 point,Mon May 18 03:44:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the link! However the issue isn't integrating with the v3 API, it's that the v3 API is inherently slower than the previous API, sometimes taking up to 30 minutes to report a new video. In order to be faster than other nerdfighters, /u/vlogbrobot needs to be able to see newly posted videos within at least 90 seconds of being posted. Right now I'm looking at doing some intelligent parsing of the actual video pages, but I just need to spend more time making it more robust and stable."
nerdfighters,369f11,dstaley,1 point,Mon May 18 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"My experience is that is with the play list method, but if you use the search list method and give it the channel id, you get much more timely results.   The offset though is you go from making calls with a quota cost of 4 to 102, but if you're only querying a few channels you can make queries every few seconds and use the batch http request to make all the calls at once."
nerdfighters,369f11,zurtex,1 point,Mon May 18 05:08:37 2015 UTC,"Is it actually slower? It feels like it might be, but I haven't tested that myself. I should see if I can get some stats on this from the wiki."

Probably going to be later this week before I can test everything out though. If that works I'll open source the code so others can use it as well."
nerdfighters,369f11,dstaley,1 point,Mon May 18 15:04:48 2015 UTC,Please post an update if you get that working okay. Specifically if you're able to do it in an automatic way and not have to register each channel manually through a form :).
nerdfighters,369f11,zurtex,1 point,Tue May 19 04:56:51 2015 UTC,Well the first few releases will definitely need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running. However if it works well enough people can build easier ways off of it. This will just be a proof of concept that using PuSH as opposed to the YouTube API is a viable option.
nerdfighters,369f11,dstaley,1 point,Tue May 19 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the reason I haven't tried implementing it in my bot is that it seems like you have to manually interact with a webpage to get it started. And my bot has the feature of reading your subscribed channels and then checking them individually. So in my case I would need to set up over 160 channels.  But I would like to know if it really is more timely. The play list method I have found to take 15 - 60 mins to update with a new video, most my testing for the search list method has shown it to be fairly consistent at less than 30 seconds. Now presumably these both have the same underlying data source so it's a bit weird that they get such different timings, I'd like to know what their pubsubhubbub gives."

The people with the most powerful jobs and biggest bank accounts are absolutely more responsible for the state of the world than those with no power. They are the people who not only get their own input into how the world works, but they also get to have a certain control over what other people's input will be. They get to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch or whatever they want to be. As inspiring as it might be to think of the little people as having the ability to shape the world, it's not helpful to dismiss the unequal distribution of power that means some people's whims are more important than some people's lives."

nerdfighters,36021b,minimalistperson,2,Fri May 15 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude! Mean a lot :) I hadn't much experience with Nerdfightaria in real live until this and was so pleasantly surprised when I went to the meet up, everybody was so nice and chatty. I'd been afraid they'd think I was an outsider because I was new to the group and hadn't watch tonnes of Vlogbrothers videos but it went really well. The Irish Nerdfighter Facebook group is one of the most active and cool groups I've seen, they're all just so open and friendly :) I need to get into this Reddit community more too! There was more of the interviews that I wanted to include but there was a limit of five minutes for the assignment, I might do an extended version in the next few months."
nerdfighters,36021b,WGeorgeCook,2,Fri May 15 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"Nice job!  I feel you found some fairly eloquent talent - something that isn't very easy to do when you're asking people about themselves. The music was nice and you did a great job editing around the bit of wind noise. I just have two main critiques:  You relied on text pretty heavily. I think with the group of people you had together alongside the historical footage you gathered that a narrated history would've been much more engaging.  The color was a bit of an issue for me too. When you were outside you had very saturated blues and especially in your darks. It looked like you were in an overcast sort of situation, which tends to go there and aren't bad in and of themselves, but then you would cut to the restaurant.  Of course the lighting in there was tough and shooting at  wide open is incredibly difficult in interview type situations. But the juggling between very saturated blues and accentuated oranges was a bit disorienting for me. A quick color correction would've done wonders!  Otherwise, you did a fantastic job :)"
nerdfighters,36021b,WGeorgeCook,2,Fri May 15 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the points :) I know what you mean about the colour differences, I decided to leave the colour correction because I was editing on my laptop which can't handle heavy filters and because I just didn't have the time before my deadline. I would have really liked to do some colour correction on the interview shot, they do have a very stark different look to them. On the narration suggestion, completely agreed! I don't have a very good reason other than I was too self conscious about doing it myself. I did feel I replied heavily on archive footage and text, I actually took out a fair amount of footage that I'd used to introduce questions because it was just too much.  I say my tutors will have similar notes for me, I'll hopefully be getting some results in the next few weeks so will post the ones for this here when I get them.   I just had a thought! Do you think we could get a volunteer or two to do some voice over? That'd be cool, having a Nerdfighter voice the documentary. A voice over narration would really add to it. Any ideas on how that could happen? A call to action of sorts."
nerdfighters,36021b,WGeorgeCook,1 point,Sun May 17 10:21:20 2015 UTC,"You could get a volunteer to do it, you could do a recording yourself, or you could look through more footage and see if Hank or John (or even, accidentally, your on screen talent!) said anything of the things that could play the story on.   I don't really see where a call to action would be. This is sort of A Brief History of Nerdfighteria and it's Community in Ireland. Would you be reaching out to non-Nerdfighters and asking them to join? Would you shift the story a bit to what Nerdfighteria does in the community and call out for more community involvement?  Docs are awesome because they're so open to anything you want them to be! Sometimes that can be reallllly daunting though. You're off to an awesome start already :)"

I think it'd be good to start on a wider scope doc on Nerdfighters and just the YouTube community in general and include parts from this doc in that. I'd planned to do a couple of interviews with some bigger Irish YouTubers but they bailed on me, one guy just never showed up, no notice or anything which was quite frustrating.

nerdfighters,35w4bq,Slev23,11,Thu May 14 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to keep in mind that, assuming the $5m figure is accurate, John probably didn't make that money off of Crash Course. Or even all of the Vlogbrothers' media projects + DFTBA Records. If he did make that kind of money, it's because his New York Times Bestselling Novel was adapted into a feature film that grossed over $300m.  Crash Course, SciShow, Healthcare Triage, Sexplanations, The Brain Scoop (before it got bought out by the Field Museum), even DFTBA Records-- no one is getting rich off of this. However, this business means that over 30 employees are able to earn a living wage producing both high-quality educational content for the web and high-quality, in-demand merchandise featuring a wide range of independent artists. Hank and John probably take a larger slice of the pie than, say, Zulaiha, but I'd bet you dollars to donuts the wage gap is much smaller than what you'd find in most US corporations.  To date, Hank and John have been very upfront about the costs entailed with their business. They've done several AMAs recently, and you can probably find some relevant answers to similar questions in their post history ( /u/ecogeek and /u/thesoundandthefury, respectively ).   WRT your aspersions cast on their crowdfunding campaigns, I'll just point you towards comments Hank made when the Patreon buyout of Subbable was announced:   “I worry about the psychological difference between being required to pay and being asked to pay. If we /made/ people pay for Crash Course we would make MUCH MORE MONEY! But no one would call it immoral, that’s just business. Like, pharmaceutical companies make people pay to not die, and that’s just America. But when you ASK people to pay, like they aren’t required but you would like them to, suddenly the burden is on you to prove that you need the money. This is very odd, but it’s something we all feel. Getting over the psychology that weights forcing a fan to do something rather than asking the ones who can afford to pay to pay is very important not just for Patreon, but for the future of independent creation.”   Look. I'm as anti-capitalist as they come, but I seriously think you're barking up the wrong tree. If you think Vlogbrothers has become over-commercialized, that's fine. It's a valid criticism, and that topic has come up before in recent years within the community. But John and Hank aren't ""pushing a narrative."" Nerdfighteria is a community, and they're a part of it.  And for the love of God, no one ""lulled"" you into anything. John and Hank made some stuff you liked at one time. Things you can stop liking any time you want. No one tricked you into being a Nerdfighter.  edited to correct a spelling error"

Instead, I'll leave you with this quote from Ursula K. LeGuin:   We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings.

In general it's less the asking for money and more the overall concept that they're producing all this content in a way that is the same as how any average Joe would.

To me it seems obvious that they're running these companies now to produce different content, and yeah, they talk about it on Vlogbrothers because it's a big part of their lives now. But the narrative you seem to be referring to involves a certain kind of dishonesty, and I don't see that. Maybe if you gave some actual examples of things they've been deliberately hiding, I would understand. I feel like they are ""one of us"" in that they share a lot of values with the rest of Nerdfighteria and they're working toward the same goals.

nerdfighters,35w4bq,nerdfighter123,1 point,Thu May 14 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"They once said that each Crash Course episode takes more than 5000 dollars. Every month they release about 20 videos. 20*5000=$100000. Subtracting their patreon support money, it cost approximately 70000 dollars each month. They probably use a mixture of sponsors, ad revenue and other support to pay this. Plus Crash Course is going to add more courses(Economics, Physics, Math, etc.). They're asking for money because they need it.  For John's approximately 5 million dollars salary, he still couldn't pay for Crash Course for more than a few months(even without any tax).  John and Hank also use their money to support creators like HealthCare triage, Lizzie Bennet Diaries, How to Adult, Animal Wonders, sexplanations, thebrainscoop,the art assignment,etc. They didn't earn money from vlogbrothers for the first(correct me if I'm wrong) 6 years. And when they did they decide to help support charities and other creators(like Vi Hart). If it was about the money, why would they start P4A?"

You're seeing a huge amount of money going to the top of the chain, while so many at the bottom still suffer(I'm right there with you, my family's income is rock-bottom, and our SNAP assistance just got cleaved in half, and because my channel plain-old wasn't going anywhere, I've had to restart from the beginning. Not a huge loss, other than in time spent alone, as the only subs were 15 inactive viewers).  The thing is, John and Hank built this all from... Well, Not from the bottom, I won't say that, because they did start out in a relatively decent position, but they still put a lot of work into getting their dreams started. Their success was helped by the media(I remember the articles about Brotherhood 2.0), but also by collaboration, and a whole mess of other factors, not the least of which the countless hours of hard work they put in.  Now, I get it. I fully understand that it is very hard to see someone you once looked up to rocket ahead of you while it's very hard to move forward yourself. I'm there with you on that one. But I don't know if it means that their narrative isn't True, per se, but it might mean that they might not be aware of the perceptions involved. To be frank, we don't know where all the money is going, and as far as PBS is concerned, they're constantly running on low funding, so if they're funding Crash Course, they're not funding it for much. That said, the Crash Course Patreon is kind of enormous, their monthly income exceeds my entire family's annual income by more than a factor of two. Perhaps some additional transparency might help dissuade some fears or apprehensions? Just a thought.  In the meantime, I kinda see what's going on between the lines here, but since it involves a potential wall of text idea of mine that should probably have its own discussion board, I'm going to post a new thread about it in a few minutes.

Honestly?  I wish that more was done within nerdfighteria to alleviate financial (and other) struggles within the community, nerdfighters coming together to help nerdfighters (in addition to nerdfighters helping people worldwide on Kiva, SaveTheChildren, etc.)  I wish John and Hank launched some kind of project or platform for nerdfighters to help nerdfighters.

I come from a similar ethnic and religious background as Zulaiha, but we went about completing our assignment very differently because our lived experiences are unique. Zulaiha wore a shalwar kameez out in a Western country (something I don't feel shy about), while I began wearing a hijab while working in a Muslim-majority country (something Zulaiha is already doing in the US).

nerdfighters,35jcmi,VetMichael,17,Mon May 11 01:31:14 2015 UTC,"Proponents of pro life aren't TRYING to interfere with women's sex lives. They believe the fetus is a person and should have a persons rights. They are simply (in their mind) trying to save people's lives. To them this debate would sound like not interfering with ISIS's religious beliefs when they kill people. Wherever you stand on this debate I think it is important to not villainize the other side. Pro choicers are not out to kill baby's and pro lifers are not out to try and tell people what to do with their bodies. It comes down to the issue of a fetus being a person or not. To fail to recognize this makes one paint someone who believes otherwise as some sort of evil person which means there is no real discussion, learning, or understanding. And it will certainly lead to never being able to convince someone otherwise. Because if you are simply talking about a woman's rights then they will say a woman's rights do not supersede someone else's right to life. The concept of someone else's rights not being able to be more important than someone else's right to life is something I think we could all agree on. So any argument must center around the fetus if you truly wish for genuine dialogue.   EDIT: I'm disappointed in downvotes without dialogue. I'm not even advocating pro life. My point was understanding the motivations of pro lifers so that disingenuous villification doesn't take place which keeps anyone from learning or changing.  EDIT 2: this is the thoughtful discussion I was looking forward to!"
nerdfighters,35jcmi,Lone_Star_122,13,Mon May 11 02:10:23 2015 UTC,"Proponents of pro life aren't TRYING to interfere with women's sex lives.   I, and many news stories, disagree:  Texas Ohio Mississippi Michigan Colorado Wisconsin  But I take you at your word that you are not advocating this extremist position. Let us differentiate between moderates and extremists; we need new names for both.   Regardless, Planned Parenthood is often the target of extremist anti-abortion advocates who garb themselves as ""Pro-life"", despite the fact that Planned Parenthood's founder abhorred abortions and advocated sexual education for women. And it is not just men or male politicians who are being close-minded and judgmental on this topic; there are quite a few women who adopt the same stance as their male counterparts. The result is, in state after state where ""pro life"" extremist politicians introduce so-called ""anti-abortion"" bills, Planned Parenthood clinics are forced to close because of either restrictive and ludicrous demands (such as in Ohio's law where PP physicians have to have admitting privileges to non-state or county-run hospitals; i.e. religiously-run hospitals) or their funding is cut off all together. The result is that women are unable to get low-cost, reliable, anonymous cancer screenings, sexual education counseling, anonymous and cheap contraceptives, and other reproduction-related services. All under the guise of trying to ""prevent abortions.""  To borrow your analogy, this is the equivalent of trying to stop ISIS by banning Islam or closing mosques. It is ludicrous and a step toward a theocratic state when one segment of the population can, based upon their largely-religiously oriented beliefs, prevent others from getting the medical care they need.   And to be fair, being Pro Choice is allowing people to have the option to express their beliefs and make choices independent of political pressure, popular rhetoric, or religious teachings of others. It is a private issue that should be decided privately between a woman, her partner, and her doctor and nobody else should ever, ever be involved for good or ill. Unfortunately a lot of people claiming to represent the ill-monikered ""Pro Life"" position do not see this issue in this way.

nerdfighters,35jcmi,StageCrewNinja,1 point,Mon May 11 07:08:11 2015 UTC,I agree many pro lifers also want all of PP close including their other services including access to birth control. And I will agree that these people do in fact want to legislate morality and not just protect a life.   Anecdotally however I guess I have just never met someone that was pro life that I felt didn't just genuinely care about trying to stop what they viewed as baby murder. I think the people we see out at protests and in the news are on the more extreme side.
nerdfighters,35jcmi,Lone_Star_122,7,Mon May 11 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I consider my self pro life, because my understanding of when life begins. That said, I don't think abortions is evil, people who have them are bad people. I just think a fetus is alive.  I always promise myself I'll never read these threads (but I always do), because they're frequently filled with pro choice people who see pro life people as a bunch of bible thumping, every sperm is sacred, women-hating men... When really think that fetuses should have rights and the only way to prevent abortion is through good female reproductive care, good and honest sex education and really good birth control. Even then, I know it will never go away, there will always be some woman who will need to kill her fetus to continue with her life or life style.  And I've made peace with this. But I also never want any woman to feel forced into abortion, because of poverty, her lack of health care or her lack of birth control.   I really want to end abortion, I think we all do. But I don't think getting rid of planned parenthood would help with that."
nerdfighters,35jcmi,obsessivelyfoldpaper,10,Mon May 11 04:23:29 2015 UTC,"Worth noting (as Mama Green's letter does) that expanding access to birth control is a big part of PP's mission. And there's a growing body of evidence that increased access to birth control reduces abortion rates.   Everyone has varied opinions on abortion, and I understand that it's a very personal thing. But I feel like- and I could be wrong!- that most reasonable people wouldn't oppose better access to birth control."
nerdfighters,35jcmi,Salanmander,5,Mon May 11 05:03:03 2015 UTC,"There are people who oppose better access to birth control on the grounds that it enables, encourages, increases the frequency of, or tacitly approves of premarital sex.

Sure, I get that, but I feel like that's a less... volatile? conversation to have. With abortion a lot of the conflict is founded on a question which is difficult to conclusively answer (""When does human life begin?"") and has a lot of cultural, political, and religious baggage surrounding it; whereas the one you're hinting at (""Does increased access to birth control also increase incidence rates of premarital sex?"") is maybe a little more straightforward and can be studied. Of course, if it does increase the frequency of premarital sex then the conversation becomes about whether that's a bad thing, and that can certainly get touchy, but probably not as touchy as trying to determine whether a particular medical procedure results in the death of a human life.  But yeah, I do agree that Planned Parenthood does not sit squarely within the abortion debate."

nerdfighters,35jcmi,german_the_llama,0,Mon May 11 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"Proponents of pro life aren't TRYING to interfere with women's sex lives.   Wrong.  That's the whole point, whether you believe a fetus is a person is irrelevant.  Asserting a fetus is a Person and being pro-choice are not mutually exclusive; it's just an anti-choice red herring.  Terry Shivo was a person .  It was still none of the state's business in deciding if she needed a feeding tube to sustain her life.  The case of non-viable  fetuses is the exact same moral calculus.  This is the standard put forth in Roe v Wade.  If the human life isn't viable, then the mother has the right to do what she thinks is right under circumstances particular to her and her family's future.  And let's be clear here.  The so-called ""pro life"" movement is not consistent; only the most extreme anti-choice advocates think rape babies, for example, should be carried to term.  Every anti-choice advocate I've ever met draws the line between justifiable abortion and unjustifiable abortion in a different place.  And this is what's so hypocritical and infuriating about the anti choice movement.  They are fine denying other's the latitude of moral judgement they give themselves.  They are pro choice as long as it's they who get to choose.  It has nothing to do with people, and everything to do with controlling other people's lives who could just as well make these decisions themselves.  The only thing disingenuous is to twist that into some kind of principled position.  It's not.    It's nothing more than reproductive authoritarianism.  Be against choice, fine, but don't pretend like that's not about controlling other people's lives."

They might think they know better, but it doesn't change that central fact.  No on is obliged to assume the false premises of the people they disagree with.  That's not ""imagining people complexly.""  On the contrary, you're creating a fiction.  Or to put it another way, no one runs around thinking they're the bad person.  They rationalize their points of view to be self evident; well I'm saying it is not self evident that establishing personhood somehow resolves the conflict.  It doesn't.  The core disagreement remains.   Sugar coating it, obfuscating it, or misrepresenting that fundamental disagreement about what choice means is not helpful."

nerdfighters,35jcmi,Lone_Star_122,2,Mon May 11 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone questioned ""pro life"" motives or how sincere they are.  But it's fundamentally dishonest to reframe the disagreement to be about ""personhood.""  It doesn't change the basic argument about choice.  Like I said, ask a ""pro life"" person where they draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable abortions -- and you find there is very little agreement on that point.  From never, to health of mother.  Then ask yourself, what makes their choice about where to draw the line more valid than the person actually carrying the pregnancy?  Why do they get to choose?  Even the term ""pro life"" is loaded, as it implies the opposition is somehow pro-abortion.  They're not.  They're pro choice -- it's simply an affirmation that maybe the mother knows more about her pregnancy, it's particulars, and what might be best in the long run than anyone else.  That's why Sydney Green doesn't think ""men in power. . . know what is best .""  That's not demonizing the opposition, that's an accurate assessment of what they believe."

If a pro lifer thinks a fetus is as much of a person as a new born then for them it is as fundamentally about life as it is choice for a pro lifer I think. Hence the names."

If a pro lifer thinks a fetus is as much of a person as a new born   That's a pretty big ""if.""  That is the most extreme political position.  It's saying rape babies, babies with life threatening deformities, complications that could kill the mother, lockers of frozen embryos are the moral equivalent to whole cities,  and lord know what else are on par with a live infant.  Some people do hold this insane potion, but they're in the minority -- and I think quite a few ""pro lifers"" (from my experience at least) wouldn't want that kind of personal telling them not to get an abortion if it were their pregnancy gone horribly wrong."

If you're someone who doesn't know him or his victims personally but is still aiming to destroy his online existence because of allegations, I genuinely think it is time to leave him alone and let him carry on creating content on his new channel. He is allowed on YouTube up until YouTube personally deactivates his accounts.  It was probably good for him to brush his old 'nerimon' self off and create a new channel for his more mature content."

nerdfighters,35hkzs,RiskyBrothers,2,Sun May 10 15:55:06 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a small but loyal contingent that really, really wants the broader YouTube culture- and specifically Nerdfighteria- to ""forgive"" him and let him carry on as before. Some (not all but some) do this by making specious arguments that what he did wasn't even that bad, with a bit of casting doubts and aspersions on his accusers. Some of them even try to cast what happened as a ""lynch mob"" prosecuted by ""Tumblr SJWs"" which is the kind of crap I expect from reddit but not so much from Nerdfighteria (especially given that Hank and John and other prominent voices in the community are pretty solidly behind the victims).  Anyway Alex Day is the worst and I wish people would stop posting his shit in this sub."
nerdfighters,35hkzs,SJWDFTBA,-2,Sun May 10 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen tumblr lynch mobbing on harmless videos, ostracizing an actual rapist doesn't fall into that"
nerdfighters,35hkzs,Pixelsplitterreturns,3,Sun May 10 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"I personally think the prevalence of ""Tumblr lynch mobs"" is overblown. (I also think the use of the term ""lynch mobs"" to describe something other than an actual lynch mob is... not great. And I try to stay away from that.) Call Out Culture is definitely a thing, and it's toxic and has sweet fa to do with actual social justice. Even other social justicey people see the behavior from those folks as a problem. But I think there's also a lot of irrational dislike towards the kind of people who use Tumblr, who skew young, female, and tend to be engaged in specific kinds of fandom and, yes, social justice activism. Reddit culture in particular seems to breed a lot of resentment for Tumblr's userbase.   And so when the discussion about Alex Day and other abusive YouTubers started, a lot of that conversation happened on Tumblr, and a lot of that side of the conversation was resolutely supportive of the victims. So I think some Redditors saw the YouTube sexual abuse controversy as the latest chapter in the tribal and political conflict between Reddit and Tumblr, and specifically saw Alex Day as being unfairly victimized at the hands of people they didn't like anyway. That there were actual human beings that were hurt by Day became somewhat incidental as far as some Redditors were concerned.  Keep in mind that I'm not even pretending to be objective about this (in case the 'SJW' part of my username didn't give it away). I've thought through these things at length, and I try hard to be aware of and examine my biases, but my opinions are heavily informed by my personal values and beliefs and I do not equivocate on that. So, take from all this what you will."

nerdfighters,3575kz,NickandCam,1 point,Thu May 7 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"This is a thing that I've done a lot of thinking about actually, and it kind of makes an odd sense. Like, as we have phones that do more and more, it almost makes sense to make them a little bit bigger, or to give them silly things like touch-screen pens. Part of that is accessibility, as I don't have fond memories of one of my earliest video players(An old-school Archos machine that has a whopping 2 inch screen) of squinting to try and see what's going on. In fact I ran into similar problems with one of my longest-weathering MP3 players, the Sandisk Sansa, which also played video, but again, on a tiny screen that made it barely worth it.   So phones get bigger so people can consume content better, and do more. Which kinda works, I mean, they do fit in the pocket easily and stuff. Which, while that's awesome, creates that problem of ""If the phone is large, is that content easily to hand anymore?""  Which is where the Smart Watch comes in, allowing you to control that content easily on a relatively natural interface. But in my mind, the smart watch, much like Google Now's speech recognition, isn't Quite smart enough for me yet. I'd love to see smart watches improve, but they've got a little bit more of a ways to go before I'll consider them amazing."

Otherwise, here is an abridged version:  If you grew up with Ataris, you may have heard of 'SwordQuest'. It was a contest, where you could win very valuable prizes (like a gold-encrusted crown, or a golden cup, like medieval ones). Unfortunately, the contest that was sponsored by Atari, happened during the infamous video game crash of 1983.  Supposedly, 3 of the prizes that were not distributed are in the possession of the late Jack Tramiel's estate. However, no one is clearly sure if it really is.  The mere discovery of the 3 items would be like discovering potable nuclear fusion in the gaming community.  So, my challenge for Nerdfighteria, is to find out if Jack Tramiel's estate truly does contain close to the order of $100,000 in equivalent, and a potential treasure to nerds everywhere."

Although some may see this as a deliberate tactic on Hank's part, I see it as unfair and should be taken out of the equation. Secondly, John is holding the camera with his right arm, which puts his body in an unnatural angle and limits the range of motion of his neck. His ability to execute such fluid double-take motion despite his handicap, scores him top marks for me.    Hank 6/10  John 7.5/10"

nerdfighters,34x4eg,Fexmeif,20,Tue May 5 08:08:27 2015 UTC,"Either:  A small island in the Pacific Ocean. First colonized by the Spanish in 1521, Hank is today known primarily for his beautiful coral reefs and large American military presence.  A spherical mass of ice and rock, visible from Earth only with a telescope. Approximately one fifth the size of the Earth’s moon, Hank was considered the 9th planet in our solar system until recently when it was announced that Hank is, in fact, just something orbiting out there in the distance.   A veteran of the CIA directorate of operations and Navy Seal Team 3. He is 5 foot 10 inches tall, weighs 170 pounds, and has green eyes. Hank was an operative of the 3rd Echelon, a clandestine division of the National Security Agency. Hank is extremely agile and an expert in the art of stealth. When in the field, Hank prefers to work alone.  A sausage covered in cornbread batter and deep-fried.   A tiny yellow song bird said to represent the soul of France. Hank has an important but as of yet undetermined role in the omnictionary project.  A breed of dog known for its distinctive white coat. Hank was originally bred to dig out foxholes, but these days, Hank is known primarily for being adorable, licky, and for urinating in inappropriate places.  An optical disc originally created to store sound recordings. But these days, many different kinds of data are recorded on Hank.  A small coral atoll 703 nautical miles south of the equator. Hank is known as one of the most remote uninhabited islands in the world.  An unincorporated community in central Donley, Texas.   A city of just over three thousand people in southern South Dakota known for its pheasant season.  A comic book superhero from the DC Universe who first appeared in 1939. Hank is also known as ""The Caped Crusader"" and ""The Hank.""   A Trans-Neptunian object 27 percent more massive than Pluto. Hank was originally named Xena, after the warrior princess, but then the scientific team that discovered Hank decided that Hank should be named something more astronomy-ish. Like Hank.   A sentient android from the Star Trek: The Next Generation universe, who, as any true fan would know, is capable of reproduction because he had a daughter!  May be the largest island in the Tuscan archipelago, but Hank wasn't big enough for Napoleon.  A cat running for the United States senate from the great state of Virginia.  An American folk rock band originally formed in Claremont, California.  A mass of incandescent gas located about 26,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way. Hank is responsible for 99.8% of the solar system’s mass. If you stare at Hank for too long, you will go blind.  An uninhabited atoll located just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean about 3,100 km southwest of Honolulu. The climate is equatorial, with little rainfall, constant wind, and strong sunshine. Since the war, Hank has been uninhabited. Feral cats were eradicated from the island in 1964.  An extreme low-density solid derived from a gel in which all liquid was replaced with gas. Useful nowadays in many industries as a thermal insulator, hank was by Steven Kistler in 1931. Hank is semitransparent, and feels like Styrofoam to the touch.  One of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. Hank was probably written near the end of the eighth century BC, somewhere along the Greek-controlled western Turkey seaside, Ionia. Hank is, in part, a sequel to Homer’s Iliad and mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (or Ulysses, as he was known in Roman myths) and his long journey home to Ithaca following the fall of Troy.  A large flippered marine mammal found in the ocean and Hank may also refer to the movement that a Hank makes.  A small Italian plumber who goes on sideways adventures. He jumps on stuff and bops bricks with his head to save a princess  or  A bunch of unstrung pearls that someone will take to a jeweler to be strung as a piece of jewelry or home decoration."

nerdfighters,34wedr,Pwallable,6,Tue May 5 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"I really feel like ""reason"" and ""logic"" are overblown in the context of internet discourse, mostly because when people throw around ""logic"" as a thing they're doing and the opposite of what the other person is doing what they're really doing is acting incredulous at your having an opinion they don't like.  That said, I generally agree that talking to other Nerdfighters can be an enriching experience.

Things like tone of voice add nuance, whereas with internet discourse does not utilize all the non-verbal aspects of human communication.

Yes, it does create a bit of friction (in the user experience sense, not in the emotional sense), and you may decide it's more trouble than it's worth. That's totally valid. Still, it wouldn't hurt to consider."

nerdfighters,34wedr,DrShadyTree,2,Tue May 5 12:12:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people who leave negative comments just think they're shouting into a void and that no one is listening to them. The host of Scam School regularly interacts with his commenters including the negative ones and a lot of the time their attitude improves a lot as soon as they know they're being listened to.  Sometimes people are just trying to be combative, and those people you probably shouldn't waste your time engaging with, but I think you'd be surprised how often people who seem like trolls actually weren't trying to be trolls."

If there was an actual threat then there'd be something one needs to deal with. But there isn't. I greatly disagree with all the anti cyber bullying speeches given by several nerd-famous people because i reckon that the Attention is what some trolls are craving.  This phenomenon that people would lash out and hurt, bully or insult others rather than go unheard and with no perceived Importance to anyone.  But now they're doing it on the Internet and apparently everyone and their dog forgot that you shouldn't acknowledge the idiot who wants to start a barfight.  But it isn't even that on the internet. The aforementioned Idiot might punch me in the Face whereas the average Youtube Commenter might find it difficult to do so.  There have been some People to make actual Threats happen against People only visible on the internet but even Anita Sarkeesian needed to be in public view for two years before someone bothered to find out where she lived, only to then run into the police.  So if someone posts a Picture of your House or something, get the phone and call the police, otherwise ignore it."
nerdfighters,34wedr,Madenmann,6,Tue May 5 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"I greatly disagree with all the anti cyber bullying speeches given by several nerd-famous people because i reckon that the Attention is what some trolls are craving   Your reckoning is incorrect. It's also a silencing tactic.  EDITED TO ADD: One of the ""nerd-famous people"" you referred to is John Green. And I quote:   One of the most common defenses of cyber-bullying is, “I’m not a bully. SHE’s the bully.” These feelings are real: We all feel marginalized and frail and defensive. But it’s not okay to ridicule people or threaten them or their fans. I’m tired of seeing ANYONE threatened and attacked online and off. [...] The worst thing about cyber-bullying is that it’s so terrifying that it can remove people from public discourse altogether. This tearing down without building up is not just the Internet at its worst; it’s our species at its worst, and we have >10,000 years of history showing us that it doesn’t lead to positive change.   Not that anyone should ever fall in line on an issue because of something John Green said. But when someone asks a question about online harassment and abuse in an online Nerdfighter community, stuff like this informs the context in which these discussions take place.   The aforementioned Idiot might punch me in the Face whereas the average Youtube Commenter might find it difficult to do so   So does somebody actually have to die before you take this stuff seriously?   even Anita Sarkeesian needed to be in public view for two years before someone bothered to find out where she lived   The threats and doxxing against Anita happened almost immediately after she started Tropes Vs Women.   So if someone posts a Picture of your House or something, get the phone and call the police, otherwise ignore it   Except the cops don't do anything."
nerdfighters,34wedr,Madenmann,-2,Tue May 5 08:32:19 2015 UTC,"Your reckoning is incorrect. It's also a silencing tactic.   Against whom? Who is going to be silenced in a video? Well, as long as i keep it online i guess. If i where to pull it, i'd silence myself.  Also the analogy with the Child sucks a bit. You'd be responsible for the development of the Child and may want to have a close eye on that development.  Whatever random Development some Person on the Internet is going through is not your Problem. If it even is a Person at all, i'm virtually certain that someone made a ""You suck!"" bot for shits and giggles. My Point here is that you can't be sure who or what is commenting. For all you know it might be someone who uses the internet and all the comment sections to vent frustrations or something.   So does somebody actually have to die before you take this stuff seriously?   I don't like this Argument. The Idiot i used in this example, the one attempting to start a barfight, is not attempting to kill people. He does not deserve to be thrown into the same bin as a murderer.  The People who write ""You suck!"" do not deserve to be thrown into the same bin as People who manage to scare oppinions they don't like off the Internet. One has to be very differential here or otherwise everyone who has any kind of critizism will eventually be thrown in with potential Murderers. Possibly by other trolls, because you'll find the entire spectrum of BS on both sides on any argument. I don't agree with all the things Sarkeesian says and i would resent being thrown in with Murderers but then again, should i really get my knickers in a twist because someone on the internet failed to put properly differentiated labels on people? Not really, because quite frankly i do that all the time, so, Glasshouses and stones and stuff...   The threats and doxxing against Anita happened almost immediately after she started Tropes Vs Women.   Threats alone have little Meaning. As seen in about two years of a great many empty threats. If a threat is not an empty one you will have to deal with that. But frankly you may not even bother with that. It's more likely you'll be killed by a cold. Or indeed pretty much anything. It is indeed more likely that some random idiot on the street kills you.    If someone who knows where you live is threatening you you may want to seek help; If you're a Lady you can have me teach you self defense in a Class. Well, you'd punch and kick me because i'm a big man who stands in for random crook. Luckily i'll be wearing some padding. Girls can kick really hard :(   Except the cops don't do anything.   Ah wait, it's one of those ""4chan is evil"" things. Like it is one homogenous group so we can put all of the prejudices we want on ""them"".  The random board, /b/, can be rather boring. Actually it's very boring most of the time. And sometimes it can be inspirational, in unconventional ways to be sure but whatever...  But i very much doubt that you will ever see lists of nice things /b/ occassionally says because someone being an asshole makes for better clickbait.  But back to the threats. I find the reaction of the police to be rather reasonable. If you want to nail someone who you think might be dangerous you'll do well to nail him for a rather long time. A possibly drunken death threat over some forum which you may or may not even read is in itself not that much of an offense. That won't even be enough for prison time and will merely tell the potentially dangerous suspect to be more careful next time.  Better yet, record everything. If the Police officer has more than two braincells to keep each other company he will tell you that despite him not going to do anything about this death threat you should call him anyways even if you and him both know that he will do just as much the next time you call. And the next time. If it does turn out that he isn't actually dangerous then whatever;  However, in the unlikely event that he is dangerous he will have harassment thrown on top of his legel cake which comes with a side of pre planning. Something that is rather hard to swallow because it causes heartburn and mandatory psychological evaluation."

nerdfighters,34r1x8,JustinBPerry,2,Sun May 3 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"i posted this on the video, im curious to if i am wrong. i think im correct in saying the usage was misplaced, can anybody counter?  keep doing this, home videos is an increasingly powerful way to change things. keep it up do what you think is right.  this is not as important, but i feel i your usage of the word genocide is a bit stretched. its certainly race based killings but i feel the application of it here is a stretch of its definition. genocide needs a kind of systematic and end goal nature that the race killings lack. this is racial violence which is the step just below genocide. if it escalates it becomes genocide but i feel you shouldn't use genocide here. im only saying that because it clouds out the real meat of what you are doing. remember when getting the truth out avoid stretching the definitions of the words you use as much as possible, because that clouds the truth you are saying."
nerdfighters,34r1x8,gamelizard,3,Mon May 4 03:26:17 2015 UTC,"I think you raise an interesting point but I think that the word ""genocide"" may have been intentionally used to draw a comparison to the current situation without necessarily asserting that it is a correct usage of the word or that we should take it literally (i.e. a metaphor/ hyperbole).  Then again, I am also sympathetic to the idea that the ""race killings"" in America right now do fit the definition of the word ""genocide"" as the police (a systematic, government-controlled organisation) are intentionally targeting black people.  Just some thoughts, I'm not too sure myself."

Now, what you could do is start a Nerd Factor channel. Get together with a couple other Nerdfighters who also vlog and set it up as a platform for other YouTubers to get their work in front of a wider audience. If you're loud enough in your promotion of it, John/Hank might plug it, which will draw more eyeballs. You could even set up a Patreon to develop a ""prize fund"" for a potential ongoing competition, with the money going to the winner to upgrade their production set-up (better camera, better editing equipment, training, etc.)  I realize this may sound like I'm directly criticising you, but I'm not. As a general rule, I feel like Nerdfighteria doesn't do a good enough job of supporting projects and creators that aren't ""official,"" i.e. those that aren't part of the Vlogbrothers/DFTBA Records ecosystem. There are a few exceptions, like Charlie McDonnell and Hannah Hart and Wheezy Waiter (and, still and bizarrely, Alex Day). I'd really like Nerdfighteria to take on more of a DIY ethic where we make more stuff without counting on Hank and John to bestow legitimacy or credibility.    So part of that is we need to make more stuff, but also we need to support each other when we make stuff. Whether that's watching videos or posting links or contributing to Patreon campaigns. It's one thing for everyone to start their own YouTube channels, but if no one watches them, things stall.  (I realize this is difficult given the subreddit rules on self-promotion. I'm not a mod, I can't do anything about that.)  tl;dr, Nerd Factor can still be a thing even (especially) without Hank and John's involvement."
nerdfighters,34q6f6,Frackenpohl,1 point,Sun May 3 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great idea, but I really don't have the time, being a full-time student and everything.  Nerdfighteria is an interesting case study in the formation of online communities, in that it is probably too centred around John and Hank as individuals, but much less so than, say, the Dan and Phil ""phandom"". I agree with you that I'd like to see more of a DIY ethic, but I think that realistically, in order for that to develop, it might require the brothers to give it a kick up the backside, hence my idea.  (With regards to the ""Prize Fund"" idea: Maybe Nerd Factor could tie in to the ""Nerdfighter Indie Creator Grants"" that were announced a while back...)"

There's a lot of progress being made wrt marriage equality, but civil rights for queer people goes well beyond that. ""Conversion therapy"" is still a thing, many states still allow companies to fire employees because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and trans* folk suffer shocking levels of discrimination and violence. There's plenty of work to be done and, frankly, not enough hands on deck.   Regardless, don't beat yourself up over feeling like it's not enough. You're doing what you can.

Which is a big deal, but right now it's just words. There isn't even drafted legislation at the moment.

But as an online creator, it just wasn't something I could be a part of. Literally. Creators could join the service by invite only. And on a practical level, the creators who received invites were mostly those who had a previous or current working relationship with Hank and John. (And while they said they wanted all kinds of creators using the service, in practice it was almost exclusively YouTubers.) I understand why they did things that way, as too much growth too fast can kill a project, and community management by a small team can be nearly impossible for a platform which anyone can join and would inevitably attract bad actors (coughcoughSarkeesianEffectcoughcough). But for all the ways I felt Subbable was a superior platform to Patreon (in community terms if not financial terms), I didn't need to know the right people in order to sign up for Patreon."

So the failures that he does have tend to be very small, and more like trial and error than any type of huge failure.   Here's one example: At DFTBA Records, they used to cover the manufacturing costs of T-shirts, and give creators a flat percentage of royalties, but they realized that they were losing money that way with shirts that didn't sell very well, so they changed it this past year, and now creators don't get royalties until the manufacturing costs are paid for, but then they get a higher percentage."

nerdfighters,346cf3,Northern-Pyro,5,Tue Apr 28 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"I've always thought there had to be a balance. Because film and books are so different in nature, it's very hard to get a 1:1 translation from one to the other. It's a hard balance to strike. What compromises do you make for the medium? Too many, and you've strayed too far from the book. Too few, and it won't be a good movie, because no accommodation was made for the different weakness/strengths of film relative to books.  Most of all, I'm glad John approves of the end result!"
nerdfighters,346cf3,randomlytoasted,3,Tue Apr 28 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to note that where the balance (insofar as there is such a thing, or that balance is something to strive for) lies is relative.   High Fidelity- the novel- was set in North London. It worked for the book, not least because of the author's personal experience living in North London and because the demographics and overall character of the area fit the story Hornby was trying to tell.  The movie version was set in Chicago. Wicker Park, to be precise. There are a lot of books that are so tied to their setting that displacing them in a cross-media adaptation would undermine the story. Yet for High Fidelity, it kinda worked.   Also, the Lord of the Rings films deviated significantly from the source material, but I still loved them. And I'm saying that as a fairly hardcore Tolkien nerd and someone who can get pretty nitpicky about canon.  So to the extent that a balance is possible, and that achieving some semblance of it is key to a successful film adaptation, where that balance lies is different for every story."

nerdfighters,3479cj,roguebluejay,6,Tue Apr 28 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"I think either you missed the point or you're absolutely unwilling to budge on your opinion that audiovisual adaptations of literature change the source material.  The version of Harry Potter that lives in my head- and John's head and everyone else's head- isn't the same version that was portrayed on film by Daniel Radcliffe. The movie didn't ""destroy"" my version of Harry. (It didn't particularly enhance it, either.)   I'll give you a personal example. I love The Neverending Story. It was my favorite story as a kid and is still in the top half of my table. (And yes, I do use promotion and relegation.) In the book, the narrator describes Bastian in a way that strongly implies he's chubby. As a fat kid, this was kind of a big deal to me. Reading a story in which a fat, dorky, shy kid was a hero was both a comforting and a formative experience, at a time when I really needed both.   The movie versions of Bastian were not fat. The movie versions of Bastian looked like this. (Just an aside, I don't include the movies other than the first two as part of my canon.)  That was another formative experience for me. It taught me two valuable lessons. One, people really don't like fat people, to the point where adults in charge of producing popular media and entertainment are willing to erase them and their experiences, and that the abuse I suffered as a kid was probably not something that would just go away once I grow up and leave school. But also, those weren't the versions of Bastian that I knew. Not really. Those versions could exist, but they were someone else's Bastian. Not mine.  You may feel differently, and you're absolutely entitled to your own view. I would just caution against holding up your particular opinion as objective fact.  I would especially caution against doing that in regards to the feelings of the person who wrote the book. Not that authors have a privileged view of the source material- John himself has said they don't, on several occasions. But his feelings aren't invalid either.   Whether or not you agree with John, he's not wrong.   (Edited to clarify a sentence.)"
nerdfighters,3479cj,SJWDFTBA,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:03:27 2015 UTC,"Incredibly cogent response. I guess my issue is that when John says ""my Harry Potter is just mine"" I don't see how that can be true. While I may have a more corruptible imagination than some, I don't believe that anyone can watch a movie and not have the book in some way tainted, unless they are so completely different that they don't connect.   How do you feel about the podcast example I used? Do you consume content in audio form? Does it change your experience when you see the presenters face for the first time?"
nerdfighters,3479cj,silam39,2,Wed Apr 29 08:01:37 2015 UTC,"tainted   That all depends on your point of view. My view of Harry has changed from seeing the films, but I wouldn't say it's worse for it.  The point John says when he states ""my Harry Potter is just mine"" is, I think, that the way he sees Harry is not the way anyone else in the world sees him. It might have some similarities with movie!Harry and by extension, with other people's Harry's, but there is a lot of his perception of Harry that comes from his personality and his own personal experiences. Just like your idea of John and my idea of John is different from each other and from what John is really like, it all depends on where you're coming from."

Again, I think this is more of a You Problem. I can, and do, watch movies based on books. Sometimes there's a lot of overlap between the film version and the version in my head. (Shailene Woodley's Hazel is more or less my Hazel too.) Other times there's much less overlap.   This is my point. You're making sweeping proscriptions about other people's personal, subjective experience, and you're doing it by holding up your own personal and subjective experience as objective fact. I say this with all due respect: knock it off."
nerdfighters,3479cj,LovisTheWise,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"I think we agree more than you realise. You just said ""much less overlap."" My point is simply that that overlap exists."

No. Batman is nuts. Joker is right in some points. Batman makes mistakes, is selfish at times and would love to kill but holds himself back. Does that sound like a hero to you? Joker has had such a horrible past that he refuses to remember it and has an unhealthy fixation on one man. He too, sounds different than he appears to be.

He's not saying the joker wouldn't be a psychotic maniac if he was looked after better (but he might) he seems to believe Gotham is a symbol for what happens when a city doesn't look after it's people.  Also would it kill batman to help rebuild the city after he half destroys it instead of buying himself a new toy?  But yeah, I do agree that Hank has excellent points at the same time.

It's more about the ideals and approaches to criminality/worldsuck that these characters represent. Batman's just an anecdote and a jumping-off point for a much bigger argument, I think.  But I completely agree that you don't have to firmly take one side or the other. Both camps make some excellent points, and present certain flaws in their approach. But just like truth itself, any argument with two reasonable sides resists simplicity. Even if it is focused around a grown man in a bat costume."

I think Batman is indeed a source of good, but I don't think well-adjusted people can identify with him because he has deep psychological problems. Unlike Superman or pretty much any other superhero out there, he's not a person who sometimes pretends to be someone else. There's two identities at work inside him, who are very much aware of each other, and when he suits up, he really lets his other identity take the wheel. First is Bruce Wayne, whose primary motivator is the pain he felt from losing his parents. He wants to work with police, and tries to be a good detective, because any time he sees a fellow Gothamite suffer, he feels it viscerally, as if his parents were murdered all over again. He's terrified of just standing by and letting another Bruce Wayne be born in Crime Alley again. The second identity, the id to Wayne's ego/superego, is the Bat. The Bat hunt the criminals because he likes to hear their bones snap and lives to hear their screams of terror. He's the one that smiles from the darkness. He's the one who declares himself vengeance. Neither is really a complete person, neither can really be looked up to or identified with.  He's a different entity altogether than either the rich guy who likes bats or the person wanting to make a difference."

nerdfighters,33eygy,thoughtsfromclosets,21,Wed Apr 22 09:59:29 2015 UTC,"They're both right. Hank's argument doesn't really invalidate John's argument. It actually kind of supports it - John argued that Batman isn't really that much of a hero, because he could be improving things long-term by addressing the root causes of crime, instead of just continually keeping it at bay. Hank argued that Batman is just like all of us, and he's just doing what he believes is the right thing. He argues that Batman is likable because he's relatable.   So both Hank and John agree that Batman's approach isn't particularly revolutionary - if we're all bat people, then how is Batman really any more of a hero than any of us? He's just trying to make the world better in his own way, just like the rest of us.   The only thing they disagree about is how much they like Batman, and that's an opinion, so you can't say one is right and the other is wrong. Again, they're both right."

He is also constantly trying to build Gotham into a better place through developing new buildings in run down neighborhoods and supporting local politicians (who happen to die a lot.).   As Batman he tries to protect his plans  by fighting off corruption through fighting the mob or protect the citizens from Gothams never ending parade of villains.
nerdfighters,33eygy,spacedfan,30,Sat Apr 25 00:31:35 2015 UTC,Batman is just a rich guy with an affinity for bats

nerdfighters,33eygy,DimityGirl,4,Wed Apr 22 10:33:17 2015 UTC,"As Hank once said: ""All dichotomies are false dichotomies"""
nerdfighters,33eygy,nazgulkoopa,6,Wed Apr 22 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"I think they're both fairly right, but John was arguing more like he was regarding Batman as a real person and Hank was arguing more like Batman is a story, which are both valid ways to argue about fiction but they don't argue against each other very well and actually very much compliment each other."
nerdfighters,33eygy,SJWDFTBA,2,Wed Apr 22 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"Follow-up:  Whatever our individual feelings are regarding Batman, I think we can all agree that Bat-Cat is the hero we deserve."
nerdfighters,33eygy,rationalparty,4,Wed Apr 22 08:46:44 2015 UTC,"Questions about whether Batman is effective and justified are at the center of why the story is interesting. All of the villains are designed to reflect pieces of Batman's own issues and ethical compromises back at him. The question of whether he inspires more (and more audacious) crime than he prevents is also frequently explored. In that sense, both John and Hank are correct. John is correct because there are very serious doubts as to whether Batman's actions are either ethical or effective, and Hank is right that those are the very questions all of us find ourselves asking in our own efforts to decrease world suck around us, and the very dilemma which makes the character so relatable. Where John gets it wrong is he seems to latch on the point of the story as a reason not to like the story. Since when is it bad to identify with a flawed or ineffective protagonist? Batman stories exist primarily (though not exclusively) to explore those very questions. The Nolan films make that exploration particularly explicit, which is one of the reasons why fans of the comics tend to like them better than the other treatments."
nerdfighters,33eygy,SJWDFTBA,10,Wed Apr 22 12:35:41 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it because I really do like Batman comics (/movies/games/whatever) and have for most of my life. Like, as a kid I dressed up as Batman for Halloween TWICE.   But I'm with John on this one. Rich guy + affinity for bats.  Aaron Diaz wrote a thing about Batman that I think is relevant.

nerdfighters,33brr1,eisbaerBorealis,3,Tue Apr 21 06:00:17 2015 UTC,"Are you thinking of a game that is in third person, like gta? Great idea, btw ;-) It would probably be difficult to make the ""legal path"" exiting, so I think it would have to be backed up by great dialogue with multiple choices. These choices would of course be essensial in wether you act as a criminal or not.   I apologize if there are a lot of errors in this comment. I am writing on my phone, and the autocorrect is set to another language."
nerdfighters,33brr1,Olav_,2,Tue Apr 21 09:08:47 2015 UTC,"My idea is for the video game to have two paths: a criminal path and a non-criminal path. The player can treat the game like GTA; commit crimes, get money, spend money to get better equipment, commit bigger crimes, get more money, etc. This path would be literally impossible to complete. Be it through jail/prison time, the cops becoming increasingly aware of your antics, or even other criminals, you would not find victory down the criminal path. You could see how far you could get, but the money and influence you got would be much less than if went down the non-criminal path.  However, I want the non-criminal path to be something beyond a Sims game. While it would start out by turning your life around, getting a respectable job, etc., I'd like the player eventually move to improve their city.  I rewatched John's I Kind of Hate Batman video, and thought about his arguments on how best to use money to fight crime. While including a vigilante crimefighter option would be cool, I'd like the player to have the option to maybe become a politician (for example) to change some laws and redirect money, or become a charitable billionare and use money to improve the city's infrastructure and education system, etc.  So I don't know the details on all the different options to use money, power, and influence to improve a city, but my overall idea for the video game is: allow criminal activity, but severely limit the possible rewards for the player. Also allow a law-abiding alternative where the player can be a great impact for good and decreased city-suck."

I mean he writes books but doesn't get this stuff and suggests something as ludicrously boring as a game like GTA where you can ""turn your life around""? That misses the point of GTA entirely. YOU, player have to turn your life around, IRL, YOU must see that this stuff leads to bad consequences...  Also you don't HAVE to commit the crime... Just don't follow the storyline and drive around like a fucking drone, respecting a pixelated red light and paying your digital taxes like a good citizen.   How very silly of John to miss the point of GTA entirely and insulting an art form like that. And he calls himself an author. I love that guy, for all the good things he's done! But if he pushes this very simplistic view of videogames like the rest of the idiots in the white house or anita fucking sarkeesian I am going to lose any respect for him.   Ok why don't we rewrite the Great Gatsby and have all evil deeds be made good... Why not rewriting Catcher in the Rye and have Holden's friends be nice to him.

nerdfighters,337d3y,Im_a_real_girl_now,4,Mon Apr 20 08:15:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I don't intend to. I was a little silly in my intro, but in all seriousness this will indeed be a well researched and well prepared-for trip. Technically, I may have oversold the dangers and difficulty a bit, but I certainly would rather oversell than undersell them -- because if you don't know what you're doing, then the dangers are indeed very real. But the truth is, I have had many family members, including ones who were 60-70 years old, do this hike. Every year they say it's their last year doing it, but they always make it. But they make it because we are a family of very active athletes and we take training seriously. Also, many of them are doctors and really, really know what they're doing with hydration and training. I think the reason they make those recommendations is because people don't take hydration and training seriously. If you do, though, and you go early or late enough in the season, you should be fine."

I'm glad to hear that you seem to be taking this fairly seriously, but it bears repeating a few times that not many people can do this, even people with years and years of bouldering and hiking and cross-country and whatnot experience have ended up in serious condition or dead because they figured water was kinda heavy.

One thing I try to remember is that it doesn't matter for me how well some other person on the internet has done something that I am trying to do. I just try to do my best and (on average) do better than my past self. (Sometimes this can be hard though.)  To be honest, I rarely meet my own expectations or goals. At least, I don't accomplish them with the same level of quality that I would like. It can be a real struggle at times: working so hard, and still not feeling like you have accomplished anything.

This can be either by making the future better by eliminating suck or learning new skills, or by just being enjoyable in and of itself. Try to find things that you really like to do, regardless of your skill, or alternatively, try to find a thing or hobby you do excel at (don't tell me there isn't one, there is), and try to get even better at it. Not compared to anyone else, not even compared to your own expectations, but compared to your past self. I'm sure that you'll find something positive :)"

Try not to compare yourself to others too much, because out of seven million people, or even out of the couple thousand in your town, there will always be someone slightly better at a thing you like. That's not a sign to stop, that's a sign to get better! Remember that even Mozart had to start at Mary's Little Lamb, and even Einstein had to be explained that F=m•a.

Who cares that you're an average programmer when you're the only one in your country/state that can program in that one weird language almost no-one knows? Who cares that you're a mediocre gamer when you're playing an indie game with five other downloads, including the developer? A unique collection of things can help you stand out."

It's okay to turn things into a competition if you really want to - professional eating competitions exist, but you need to realize how absurd it is to apply this logic to everything. If John thought this way he'd never write a book because it probably won't be as good as Shakespeare or Rowling.  Success isn't all about the easily quantifiable aspects.

I'm not saying that you can't be a star, because I'm sure you have that potential, but I also think it's important to realize that the world needs people to be part of teams and work diligently just as much as it needs stars.   Also, I think that a good way to feel better about yourself is to do something good for someone else. Volunteer somewhere! Teach underprivileged kids how to program so that have a shot at a good job someday. If you like animals, volunteer at a shelter.

Parasocial relationships can feel intimate but we're his audience, not his friend.  From his videos, Alex definitely has adopted a new attitude. This experience has changed how he perceives things, heck, even his ex-girlfriend Carrie Fletcher congratulated him on using his platform to spread love and compassion after a hefty argument in the comments of one of Alex's videos.  I personally continue to watch his video. I find The Daily Day genuine, engaging and inspiring. I'm inclined to do so. Other people who avoid him because of allegations put forward about him are also inclined to abandon him if they choose to also. As far as we're aware, he hasn't been accused of anything illegal, but whatever someone chooses to do after hearing allegations about a creator cheating or manipulating other creators is a personal choice. We're in no position to forgive him though."

I think it all got handled very poorly and I am a big fan of evidence and hearing every side of a debate. One of the problems is, that what he supposedly did usually isn#t something that leaves any evidence. If I'm alone in a room with someone it will always be their word against mine, what we did and how consensual  it was.   But I unsubscribed a few days ago, after I watched on of his videos on the upcoming british election. I just sat there with my mouth gaping open, asking myself how someone who I thought of as an intelligent person could spew such nonsensical bullshit about elections and politics. He talked about a TV debate and kind of made fun of it and everything he said was just dumb. Like he either didn't think about it at all and just blurted out some provocative shit off the top of his head or like he wanted to troll people. Either way that's not something I enjoy or need in my life. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about a good discussion, but the things he said were just plain stupid. That combined with the fact that I hadn't really watched or enjoyed many of his videos in the last few month lead my to unsubscribe."

(For anyone confused, this is the video being referred too. TL;DW - Don't vote because government is corrupt and there are better ways to get your message across)  I think he was sincere in his opinion of avoiding the vote. He spent a lot of time in a Buddhist monastery in France, and afterwards became an active follower of Russell Brand's work (who makes videos similar to The Daily Day) who also believes that voting is inefficient, and that if majority stopped voting and took active protest towards a more fair system for the civilians there would be a change in the governmental system. (Not that far off of an idea, remember Martin Luther King Jr? There was never a vote over black rights)  I'm not here to speak on his behalf for his reasoning, but it seems like he has put a lot thought into it to completely shift his opinion on the voting system, and many other issues. He didn't seem like he was trying to ""troll people"" either."

nerdfighters,3344t0,SJWDFTBA,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:20:22 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you're trying to say
nerdfighters,3344t0,minimalistperson,3,Wed Apr 22 06:47:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like part of the dynamic behind some of the pro-Alex stuff I've read boils down to, ""he shouldn't be shunned/lose his fans/lose his livelihood as a YouTube Creator because of a mistake/indiscretion/accusation-that-may-or-may-not-be-true."" And I believe that plays into the first Geek Social Fallacy-- ""Ostracizers are evil.""  This unfortunately leads to a lot of geek communities, of all sizes (from small gaming groups to entire fandoms), becoming toxic.  I think there's a reluctance on the part of some to stop supporting Alex Day's work and stop giving him attention because of a somewhat irrational fear of casting someone out. And to some extent, I'm sympathetic to that.  But the fact remains that healthy communities self-police. If you're part of a group of friends and your behavior among them is awful, your friends will stop wanting to hang out with you. It's not a conspiracy, it's not a fault on the friends' parts. People just don't like hanging out with jerks.   I believe that if people don't take responsibility for the communities they're a part of and the spaces they inhabit, they bear part of the responsibility for what spawns in the vacuum. If people don't tend to their communities, if they refuse to throw people out of them due to reprehensible behavior, those communities end up being taken over by the people everyone else threw out.  I want Nerdfighteria to be a community that does not tolerate abuse. I want Nerdfighteria to be a community that supports victims and dissociates with assailants. FWIW, I believe John and Hank agree in principle. My hope is that a consensus of Nerdfighters feels the same way (while also recognizing that some will still support Alex Day, and some of them will have understandable reasons for doing so).   If this means that Alex Day doesn't get to make a living as a YouTube Creator, that he loses his fan community, that he has to figure out something else to do with his life... frankly, that's an acceptable outcome. Sometimes people screw up badly enough that they don't get to come back from it, not completely. Brian Williams' life isn't ""over,"" even though his career in broadcast journalism probably is. But the fact remains, Nerdfighteria is too big and too important to be poisoned by something like this, and I care a lot more about the integrity of my community than I do about whether Alex Day has to go find another job and stop being internet famous.  Also, just to be clear I'm speaking in very broad strokes and this isn't necessarily a direct response to you. I don't know how you really feel about Alex Day (other than perhaps not wanting him to fade into obscurity, since I saw your post asking what happened to this thread). Even if you did/do support Alex Day, I'm sure you have your reasons, and I'm not especially interested in trying to talk you out of them."
nerdfighters,3344t0,SJWDFTBA,2,Wed Apr 22 07:17:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've said, with the caveat that I think the casting out should only happen when it's clear that the person being casted out will only continue to do further harm by being around. I think people's unwilingness to help with education, rehabilitation, or forgiving those who are ready to contribute in positive ways without causing further harm is a problematic thing.  Even if it's not seen as anyone's job but my own for me to fix my problematic behaviour, I think the possibility should still be alive that I might once again find a home here once I've managed to do that in a demonstrable way.  Of course, the easy argument is that so much damage has been done by this situation that even my mere presence is going to do more damage than the amount of positivity I might be able to provide to counteract that. Perhaps that's true, though (obviously) I would disagree with it.  We do have a responsibility to keep communities safe from harm, but I think part of that is fostering an attitude of compassion, to all sides involved in all situations, and considering the worth of any individual in a community from a place of future worth instead of past harm.  In any case, I'm certainly not making any effort to engage with the nerdfighters (with the exception of this post, which I argue is free reign given I'm the subject of it). I don't post in this subreddit regularly, I don't make video responses to John or Hank or the nerdfighter community, I don't go to VidCon or Summer In The City (I don't even know if I'd be allowed in, but besides the point, I don't try), I'm not tweeting people in the community, I'm not addressing my videos to people in the community; I'm just reaching out to anyone who wants to receive it, letting them pick it up if they want to."

But then I read through every one of those posts linked on the YouTube Scandal Masterpost under Alex's name, and his behavior was not anything that I felt comfortable supporting. I've been sexually coerced before. I know how it feels for someone to try to use their power over me. Finding out that Alex Day did that to other girls - not just girls speaking anonymously, but girls with names, faces, and online presences who have so much to lose by coming forward against a very popular YouTuber - meant that I would not be able to enjoy those Twilight videos again.  I'm glad he seems to have turned his life around. I hope he continues to use the scandal to go forth and do better in the world. I just won't be giving him that second chance."

If it came out that Schoolboy Q was kinda pushy with sex it wouldn't be a big deal because he puts himself out there in that light. He raps about money and women, fans are expecting him to be that way.   Alex day however has a fan base in the nerd culture with mostly teenage fans and portrays himself as socially awkward boyfriend material (if only subconsciously). Its an abuse of the community hes built more than anything.   It'd be like re-homing puppies and then training them to be guard dogs. Plenty of people have guard dogs but its weird if you're the kind of person who wants to house rescue dogs too.

nerdfighters,331li1,jmigandrade,41,Sun Apr 19 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"I am surprised no-one posted John's nerd quote yet:   Saying 'I notice you're a nerd' is like saying, 'Hey, I notice that you'd rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you'd rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even 'lame' is kind of lame. Saying 'You're lame' is like saying 'You walk with a limp.' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he's done all right for himself.   I think it's one of the most accurate definitions of nerd."

nerdfighters,331li1,Rowan93,3,Sat Apr 18 19:49:30 2015 UTC,"I don't interpret that as nerds actually choosing to be more intelligent, because that's not a choice people are really able to make - I mean, there's a few things people can do that might possibly add a few IQ points, but nothing with a strong body of evidence for it and certainly nothing that would be as simple as just choosing to be smarter. Instead, it's about how we value intelligence, contrasted to average people who, although they wouldn't actually say they like stupidity,  do tend to think there's such a thing as ""too smart"", especially if the type of intelligence you have and/or the way you use your intelligence gets read as ""book smarts"".

That is, they may not be more learned, or quicker to pick up new things, or whatever than anyone else, but that they value careful consideration of things, and will generally opt for challenging truth over easy falsehoods?  (This is truly an honest question. I tend to think that valuing thoughtfulness to be a shared value of nerddom, but not that there's some thoughtfulness-level-gatekeeper.)  [1] I'm deliberately saying thoughtful instead of intelligent, because it's an action verb instead of a state verb.

Here's wiktionary's definition of nerd:   nerd (plural nerds)       (slang, sometimes derogatory) A person who is intellectual but generally introverted. (informal, sometimes derogatory) One who has an intense, obsessive interest in something.

But why are you using murderers and terrorists as examples for why someone guilty of Redditing instead of getting a job should be considered worthless?"

In this case, an extreme example of this type does the opposite of help prove a point. ""Terrorists"" are extreme examples of the category ""people who don't contribute to society"", and for comparison ""billionaires"" are extreme examples of the category ""people with positive net worth"". And if someone was arguing ""everyone with positive net worth owns a ferrari"", listing a bunch of billionaires who own ten ferraris would be an extreme example that would be totally useless and missing the point."

Sorry, but this entire sentence doesn't make sense to me. Could you possibly re-phrase it?  And fine. I retract my example. My point still stands, though. If you don't contribute positively to society, then you have no worth as a human being. I mean, give me one good reason why I should think I have worth.

It can be hard to talk about personal stuff in online spaces (especially since there never seems to be a dearth of people ready to attack you for it).  What I would say is that you're likely never going to have the questions you asked definitively answered. You're going to change a lot over the course of your life. Even when you get to a stage where you're supposed to have everything figured out, you won't. I'm in my mid 30s and I'm still changing, still discovering new things. This is good! You should always be open to changing your mind about things, and you should always be willing to examine yourself and the part of the world you inhabit. Growth is good, change is good.  So, don't worry too much about not having all the answers and not having a complete sense of who you are. You may never know. But keep asking the questions.

On a less granular scale, I guess the post is decent within the category ""blog posts by 17-year-olds about their self-image and self-identity"", but that's not a very high-value type of thing and it sort of reads more like a diary entry than something actually intended for a reader.

What he almost certainly means by it when he says that is that John is very emotional, and will tear up because of relatively ordinary things that have just affected him more than they usually would have.  Both times he's used it, he's used it to imply that John crying because of something isn't a good indicator that that thing is particularly sad, or beautiful, or emotionally powerful, but rather a good indicator that John is feeling emotionally sensitive at the moment."

It was also really trusting because you're just surrounded by a bunch of passionate Harry Potter fans and I never really felt unsafe or out of place. I think if I could go again I would prefer to go with a friend, just so I have someone to share the experience with, but don't let the idea of being lonely put you off going alone, because there'll always be someone to talk to. (If you're not too confident about just going up to people and starting conversation, join the Leakycon Loners Facebook group like someone else suggested, that way you can make friends before you even get there and meet up with them.)  When I was waiting in the queue, one of the people I had started talking to asked who I was with and I said I had come alone and she said, ""You're never alone at Leakycon"" which turned out to be so true.  Tl;dr: definitely go, you'll love it."

nerdfighters,32rtqn,davieli,5,Thu Apr 16 04:59:35 2015 UTC,"The gaming one I consider a particular peeve of mine - An increasing number of games actively ban accounts for running accessibility software on the ground that it counts as ""cheating"".  Putting aside the ethics of letting people play the games they've paid for however the hell they want... IMO this sill puts the cart before the horse - If you can cheat in an online game based on software running locally, with no privileged access to the server, the game itself has something fundamentally broken in it.  But instead of fixing the real problem, instead, let's alienate a community already at a disadvantage?  Seriously, WTF?"

I personally have Asperger's Syndrome, and it has made it nearly impossible for me to get a job, since I tend to be very quiet and anxious during interviews, and that just turns most employers off and makes them not want to hire me. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get hired, and I feel like there's no one out there who wants to help me for free/low-cost.  I also feel like there are very few doctors out there who understand disabled people. I've had two doctors so far as an adult, and the first doctor I had was outright rude to me about my anxiety issues. My second doctor is less rude, but she still doesn't understand my anxiety issues at all. As a result of this, I hate going to the doctor anymore and I refuse to go.

nerdfighters,32oqpv,armedrobbery,3,Wed Apr 15 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"Your reflection in a (flat) mirror doesn't flip on the X-axis, either - Your left side still appears on your left, and your right side still appears on your right.    The illusion that you've flipped horizontally comes from our ability to empathize - If we stood face to face with another person and waved our right hand, the person in the mirror would wave ""his"" hand left in response.  But the motion occurs on your right side in both case.  As another way to think about this, take a clear piece of plastic and write a word on it.  Now hold it up facing a mirror - The words in the mirror look exactly the same as the words you see through the plastic, both left-to-right and top-to-bottom.  Mirror-you would appear the same, if we could see through humans."

When you look in a mirror, your left is on the left of the mirror, but it's the right side of someone facing you. That's more or less what makes the horizontal reflection.

nerdfighters,32jpxw,fridge_logic,2,Tue Apr 14 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"I've actually been wondering about this lately, Namely, how much of the two-party nature is due to the first-past-the-post system in use in the UK and US, versus how much is due to the fact that all the executive power in the US goes to a single person.  Basically, if you can find any decently healthy presidential systems with party-list proportional representation, please tell me."
nerdfighters,32jpxw,ShimmerScroll,2,Tue Apr 14 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the Ireland and New Zealand use a proportional parlimentary system which ensures representation of multiple minority political parties. Then there is MMP which has the added benefit of tending to undermine the political strength of majority parties and those benefiting from gerrymandering by diffusing their authority.  Although if you want a really good method of electing Presidents you need to employ ranked voting and then utilize the Shultze Method of vote tallying. It's a bit dizzying mathematically but the end result is that you should pretty much vote exactly the way you want to if you want your preferred candidates to win."

That way you can have a parliament and a Prime minister who manages all domestic appointments and operations and an independent military and diplomatic executive.   This way domestic policy is dealt with quickly, efficiently, and reliably through greater cooperation between the domestic executive and the legislature (no more defunding bullshit) Meanwhile the foreign and military executive is some what divorced from party politics and is free to pursue their agenda with less concern for partisanship making them a more potent negotiator.  This also creates another benefit in defusing executive power which currently has an exceptional amount of control over economic, military, diplomatic and judicial policy. One man should not be able to simultaneously trigger recessions, military leadership shake ups, judicial replacement, and foreign policy decisions; the opportunity for abuse for political gain is far too great."
nerdfighters,32jpxw,fridge_logic,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with the respective merits and flaws of presidential and parliamentary systems. My fundamental question is this:  The US has a strong two-party system. The two-party systems in the UK and Canada are weaker, but still present. Is this due to the first-past-the-post nature of the American executive, or some other factor?  If I knew of a presidential system with a proportional legislature, this question would be much easier to answer, as we would have examples of both presidential and parliamentary systems with both first-past-the-post and proportional legislative representation. As it is, though, I can't think of such an example, so the answer becomes harder to tease out."
nerdfighters,32jpxw,ShimmerScroll,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:29:00 2015 UTC,It's because of the nature of first past the post. No matter what office is being run for first past the post always forces candidates to drop out until there are only two.

Something on the UK government would be informative, for example, considering the changing landscapes regarding coalitions becoming likely and the imminent general election.

You can always do the, oh I left it in my car and then leave if they do card you.  There might be a local motel that wouldn't care or think you're old enough.  If I was in Chicago I would let you!

As far as I know, you shouldn't have problems with an age restriction on renting a campsite in any state, and most camping grounds will let you rent a tent site for ~$30 per night (there should be one within an hour's drive of city limits). See if you can borrow a tent (or two) and make an adventure out of it - the weather even looks to be clear all weekend and in the upper 40s to lower 50s overnight. Excellent camping weather! (Still, I'd call ahead to make sure not having a chaperone won't be an issue at your age.)  To address your alternate questions: it's likely that they the clerk will ask you for an ID before checking out the room for liability reasons - the same reason why you're probably going to get carded pretty much everywhere. Older people are seen as more likely not to damage property (intentionally or not) during their stay. It's probably not worth it to try and jump between hotels in a big city until you find one with vacancies that neglects to age-check you."

Reddit Nerdfighters being one, IRC Nerdfighters being another, the folks on the Ning, Your Pants, Tumblr Nerdfighters, the numerous Nerdfighter Facebook Groups to name but a few. Each of these groups have their regulars and their in-jokes, so I don't necessarily see the community side of Nerdfighteria crumbling under its own weight, but rather fracturing into niche groups."

More importantly, I don't think they've lost the spirit of their early vlogs.  Compare:    John reviews Kids Movies to A Surreal Descent into Madness (3 year gap)  Question Tuesday:  Butt Brains Edition to Question Tuesday:  100 questions (5 year gap)  Romance and Sexuality in an Airport to Gus is a Bug (3 year gap, though the latter video is 6 years old.  The connection is to point out that John has kept the ""the people in the airport think that I'm crazy"" joke.)  Professional Analysis of Gifs of Animals at Sporting Events to The Gift of Garey Busey (4 year gap)  And those are just John videos.  Some things have changed, but some things have stayed the same."

nerdfighters,324rkb,nerdfighter123,26,Fri Apr 10 15:59:41 2015 UTC,"This is sort of the issue that occurs when a group grows in size that anyone can say they are a part of. It's like when you say you're an anon now, or a punk rocker, or a goth, or a nerd and that is just kind of what naturally happens.  A group anyone can be part of tends to struggle with identity as they grow in size. Oddly enough the media example I can think of is Durarara's Dollars. They're descent into practically becoming a gang on par with some mafia is hyperbole but the equivalent is something I don't want to see happen to nerdfighteria, but you can't control a mob."

It feels horrible when you see people doing terrible things whilst associated with something you love. But it's not the thing you love it's some person who also has an affection for that thing. It's ok to be annoyed and angry but this isn't on you. It's on them. Whilst I welcome anyone who says this is not what we stand for we shouldn't let that affect how we feel about the group and it's ideals as a whole.  What I'm seeing in the twitter conversation is depressing.

nerdfighters,324rkb,LovisTheWise,5,Mon Apr 13 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"A couple of people are responding to this defending John, and while I definitely agree that he's not at fault for the actions of others, I also just wanted to say that I think our focus here should be on the fact that someone had some really hateful shit said to them and how this is shitty.  I think that we can be understanding that people would be very peeved if they get a lot of harassment, even if we think the target for that isn't where we think it should be. John is a grown person in a stable position and can handle people on twitter putting a little too much blame on him for these sorts of situations. The community needs maintenance and purging of hate more than he needs defense.   Idk. I just see in a lot of my fandoms that people seeing these incidents rush to defend the creators and then forget about it happening, rather than focusing on the original issue and trying to fix it. I'm not saying anyone here should be doing more/is wrong/etc, but just... idk. Don't let your only comment on this situation basically ""wow, that woman who got attacked by a racist on tumblr really should be more understanding of other peoples' situations."" I guess I'm just calling for nuance when we're in the position to embrace it. Imagining others complexly and all that.  edit: poorly worded sentence"
nerdfighters,324rkb,HoopyHobo,2,Sat Apr 11 03:07:48 2015 UTC,I wonder if she holds the same views even after the apology. Her comments suggest a certain stubbornness.
nerdfighters,324rkb,probablynotalaska,9,Sat Apr 11 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"Whenever somebody posts something hateful anonymously while claiming to be part of a group it's at least worth considering whether the anonymous person is being truthful.  That said, there definitely are shitty people who do shitty things while identifying as Nerdfighters. It's tempting to ""No True Scotsman"" about it and say, well that person must not really be a Nerdfigher, maybe they're just fans of John's books or back in the day when the group was much smaller there were proportionally fewer jerks, etc. etc. But really, I think we are doing a disservice to ourselves if we treat the issue that way without really confronting it.  I really like John's approach to this situation of encouraging us to be better. We all sometimes forget to be awesome. That's why we keep reminding each other not to."
nerdfighters,324rkb,_watching,2,Fri Apr 10 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"This needs to be higher. When someone speaks claiming to be part of a group but remains anonymous, then they are trying to hide from the group."

nerdfighters,324rkb,_watching,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:40:22 2015 UTC,"No, it's not that unlikely. But there's a pretty significant amount of John Green hate on Tumblr, so it also wouldn't surprise me much to find out that somebody is leaving hateful anonymous messages just to make Nerdfighters look bad. I mean, even if you are a hateful racist Nerdfighter, why would you feel the need to mention that you're a Nerdfighter as part of the message?"
nerdfighters,324rkb,HoopyHobo,1 point,Sat Apr 11 02:54:17 2015 UTC,"The message seemed to me to be part of a larger conversation/response to previous post re: nerdfighters/John, so it would make sense to bring it up if you wanted to start a flamewar. Sort of a ""u dont like [x]? WELL IM [X] SO SHUTUP"" thing.  That said, yeah, I guess that could be the case. John Green hate always cracks me up tbh, lots of people reaching for reasons to be angry on tumblr.  That said, no need to reach to be angry about this. Whoever was behind the comment should disengage from tumblr, calm down as a person, and read quite a few books on race and communication."

nerdfighters,324rkb,intravenus_de_milo,8,Fri Apr 10 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"There were a couple of facebook Nerdfighter groups a while ago that I left because the people in them suddenly decided that fat shaming was not only acceptable, but welcomed.  Not even just getting into discussions about weight/weight-related problems, but posting comics about overweight people and mocking anyone who disagreed and eventually even posting pictures of overweight people specifically so the group could make jokes.  They even went so far as to post my profile picture at one point (side note: am a fat woman who was trying to remind people that their actions were far from polite), but luckily the mods took that one down at least.  This sort of thing seems to be happening more and more in the online realms of Nerdfighteria.  I don't know if the reasoning is because Nerdfighteria has just had such a huge increase in size, or if it's because there are more and more possibilities for anonymity (or, quite possibly, a mixture of those, as well as other factors I haven't thought of).  Either way, I'm really glad that /u/thesoundandthefury took the time to remind us all to try to imagine people complexly or, at least, be freaking nice to each other once in a while.  Those were the sort of values that Nerdfighteria was founded on and it's one of the reasons why, despite these people, I still adore this community."
nerdfighters,324rkb,LectionARIC,10,Fri Apr 10 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"Trolling Nerdfightaria seems to be growing in popularity, and I'm not sure why, but it has something to do with the Redpill movement and other anti-social justice sentiments.  I see it in this subreddit on a fairly regular basis."

nerdfighters,324rkb,Ishima,3,Fri Apr 10 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"there's something deep going on.  I'd like to dismiss it, but I think it's going to be a serious problem.  Boingboing sort of alerted me to it:  http://boingboing.net/2015/01/28/a-beginners-guide-to-the-red.html  It's not well understood, but to counter it, it needs to be understood."
nerdfighters,324rkb,LectionARIC,3,Sat Apr 11 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"You can't be part of a large group of people and honestly expect there's going to be no bad people in that group, further more, this is the internet, it's at least 50/50 this is some troll who doesn't actually identify with the community.   This doesn't even warrant a response."
nerdfighters,324rkb,japascoe,6,Fri Apr 10 19:35:37 2015 UTC,I think the response it warrants is for those of us who identify as nerdfighters for ethical/idealistic reasons to double and redouble our efforts to decrease world suck. Drown the hate in a tidal wave of awesome.
nerdfighters,324rkb,_watching,2,Fri Apr 10 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Unlike more traditional societies and movements Nerdfighteria doesn't have any kind of membership or gatekeeping process. On the whole, this is a good thing. It means that all you need to do to become a nerdfighter is to say you are one.  However, the flipside of this, is that anyone can say they are a nerdfighter, even if they are acting contrary to the spirit of reducing worldsuck. Thus, if Nerdfighteria wishes to uphold certain values and ideals (as I think it does), it is very important to say, as a community: 'While this person may call themself a nerdfighter, their actions were inconsistent with the values we hold dear as a community.'  By not responding you give the signal that as a community you don't care about what this person is doing in your name, which is very easy to interpret as being fine with it."

nerdfighters,324rkb,eisbaerBorealis,5,Sat Apr 11 18:47:44 2015 UTC,"Tbh the problem is really how the books expand the community. You see this a bit on tumblr - I saw it on the page of the one user John praised for burning him the other day.  Basically, the community gets expanded, but it also gets expanded specifically to the worst parts of every fandom - the people who just use their fan things as reason to start flame wars. Usually they're pretty young too- when I see things like these hateful posts, the only thing it reminds me of is me in middle school going ""grrr pop music sucks my music better"". These people are really annoying and aggressive, hopefully they'll grow out of it.  The fact that someone went and mixed it with racism is pretty ridiculous and awful, but it goes to show that they are the types I listed above - they're not people in this community because they deeply identify with certain ethics or worldviews or ideals or just like community or whatever, but because they need a fandom to use as their identity and excuse."
nerdfighters,324rkb,jeffnunn,4,Fri Apr 10 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of the time we say of groups ""The group may do bad things, but it is important to remember that the individuals are often good people, and may simply be misled.""  I feel the opposite is true of Nerdfighteria. It is obvious that through the various large charity events, Nerdfighters are able to decrease World Suck very effectively. But looking at the comments in this subreddit and Youtube, it's very clear to me that Nerdfighters are generally very close-minded. You have an opinion that is a part of the minority? You will likely be downvoted and insulted. Nerdfighteria is an awesome place to talk to people about different kinds of ""nerdy"" stuff, or if you share the political/social views of the group as a whole. But Nerdfighteria is not a safe place for civil, open-minded discussion."
nerdfighters,324xon,DictatorDan,2,Fri Apr 10 16:45:49 2015 UTC,The statistics about children and young adult fiction being the last areas of growth in publishing are really interesting.

Currently, I'm a subscriber to a few thoughts including Daoist/Buddhist, the study of consciousness and quantum physics. I'm not an expert in any of these. I read them for fun. I read once that the brain can be seen as an antennae for the vibrations and intentions in the universe. While someone is alive, they are like a radio playing a portion of some cosmic broadcast. Everyone would be tuned into parts of the same broadcast but maybe our playback settings are different.   Maybe I was tuned into the characters' strength and didn't cry out of respect?

I think it's because I cried a lot as a kid and when I grew up I just found other ways of expressing sadness, and now it's very rare that I cry. Certainly not from fictional stories.  When I saw the movie I was pleased with Shailene Woodley's performance, but beyond that I thought the film was overly campy and didn't do justice to the book. For one thing it eliminated virtually all of the existential nihilism from the book and put all the focus on the romance, which I thought was of little importance to the story. Reading the book I wasn't really concerned with them falling in love, but more in their friendship and how they changed each other regardless of their romantic attraction. They could have just been platonic friends and the story would have been just as good. But the movie really watered all of that down, and I was heavily disappointed in that."

You might find a lot of by looking up a book about his philosophy. Sadly I really have not much to offer as a reference.  As for the video, REALLY good idea! I won't do a video, but here why I think about oblivion: I fear oblivion because I am always doing something, looking for something, but death is nothing."

nerdfighters,31zkbh,tokol,3,Thu Apr 9 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"That a cool project!  I think I've always viewed the oblivion of death somewhat neutrally. It was unknown. It was a preexisting constraint. I'd have to deal with it someday. I shouldn't forget that it's coming, because then I might waste what time I have. Ya know, that sort of thing.  But then I read something that really hit me. Specifically:   “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” - Mark Twain   So, really, it wasn't unknown. I remember being a child. I remember a few hazy things as being a toddler. But before that? Nothing. If ""I"" am not there to experience it, then it really has no impact on ""me"". There's a macabre comfort there.  For reference, the above quote is apparently a paraphrasing. I included it because that's the version I read that affected me. His autobiography contains this version:   ""Annihilation has no terrors for me, because I have already tried it before I was born—a hundred million years—and I have suffered more in an hour, in this life, than I remember to have suffered in the whole hundred million years put together."" - Mark Twain"
