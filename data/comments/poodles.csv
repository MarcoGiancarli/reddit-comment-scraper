We're going to look into getting a prosthetic on his front nub. His back leg probably not because his knee dislocates and using that leg would cause him pain- he'd likely need knee surgery to use a prosthetic well and we currently don't think that's a good idea for him. His back leg and knee don't bother him at all right now so no reason to mess with it. Prosthetic seems like it would do more harm than good. His front leg has fantastic potential though, so we're going to make an appointment with the prosthetic experts in Denver at Orthopets and travel to see them."

poodles,3ba1cx,danpeters,4,Sat Jun 27 05:31:07 2015 UTC,For poodles/poodle mixes grooming should be done every 4-6 weeks. The most important thing is routine. If you want to keep his hair long you should be brushing 3-4 times a week at home with a metal comb to make sure your getting any possible knots that are close to the skin and a slicker brush to keep the top layer of hair tangle free. Both of these brushes can be found at pet stores like Petsmart or Petco. I think they even have some semi-decent ones In the pet section at Walmart.   Source: Been grooming for 4 years and have a Standard of my own. :)
poodles,3ba1cx,goodGirlgoneReddit,2,Sat Jun 27 05:56:53 2015 UTC,I keep mine cut pretty short and they only need brushing 1-2 per week. I shave them myself every 4-6 weeks and bathe them weekly or every other week.
poodles,3ba1cx,WhiskersTheCurious,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"This is what we do too. When we adopted our standard, she had pretty long hair, but it would get matted and she was particularly sensitive of her ears at the time because she had an infection from living on the streets. So instead of trying to work out the mats, we just keep her hair cut pretty short and she doesn't tend to get any mats.  /u/WhiskersTheCurious, can I ask you an off-topic question--how do you bathe your poodle? My poodle's hair seems like half towel and half raincoat--it'll soak up a lot of water but it never seems to saturate down so her hair is still dryish underneath! I have a hard time getting any soap to sud--it's like I'm putting soap on dry fur, even if I had just wet that area. Any tips or tricks? Do you use a special type of shampoo?"
poodles,3ba1cx,seonadancing1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"One of my poodles has finer hair, which is much easier to get wet. The other one has coarse, thick hair and it is VERY hard to wet down to the skin.   I brush them first when their hair is longer. And, I use a nozzle like this one. Flooding the hair is a better approach than using a lot of water pressure.  For shampoo, lathering depends on the brand. Bio Groom is the brand I usually get. Econo Groom is what a groomer recommended - and that bottle lasted about 4 years and I shared it with some friends. Also, brushes like this one can help you get it lathered all the way to the skin."
poodles,3ba1cx,WhiskersTheCurious,2,Thu Jul 2 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"He should be professionally groomed once a month, with you giving him a good brushing at least once a week.   Poodles have hair, not fur. It's just like ours, but thicker and faster-growing. Could you imagine how uncomfortable it would be to be completely covered in your hair, but having it matted and dirty and overgrown?"
poodles,3ba1cx,walks_silently,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not a groomer, but keeping mats from forming is a constant battle for me.  I brush my dog at least every other day, and bathe her every 2-3 weeks.  Brushing her hair with the slicker brush while it is drying seems to be easier for her than letting the hair dry first. If there is a mat that forms that I can't brush out, I will cut it off.  I would rather she be a little asymmetric than to have painful mats.  Thank you for rescuing a poodle mix."
poodles,3ba1cx,PushcartPops,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:12:06 2015 UTC,"Metal comb, 2. Pin brush, and comb/brush at least 3-4x a week unless he's clipped very short, 3. Take him to the groomer every 4-6 weeks unless you want to clip him yourself in which case you need clippers, blades, shears, as well as oil and cleaner for the clippers, and time to research and learn how to do it yourself. Oh, and unless you want to bathe and dry him first before clipping too! You should also be trimming his nails, most dogs need that done every ~2 weeks but some more, some less depending on growth and activity level; I much prefer a rotary tool (Dremel) over clippers."

poodles,3ajdqs,cygnuswomyn,3,Sat Jun 20 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"He only scratches it after grooming, or you can only see the scratches after grooming?  I would wonder if an allergy might be the culprit. Hope you get it figured out soon, but our little terrier scratches herself often, so we give her half of a melt away children's Benadryl.  Sounds like you are already make steps to remedy clipper burn if that was the problem."
poodles,3ajdqs,PushcartPops,2,Sat Jun 20 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"This is a good question.  I have wondered this myself, and while he does scratch at his face from time to time, he does not have the hot spot, crust, moist heat when I leave his cheek fur long.  Don't know if the irritation is there and a longer coat keeps his nails from doing damage or if the clipping bothers him and he ups the scratching.    My trainer says the scratching is more of an anxiety thing like lip licking.  He is a nervous dog and we are working on that."
poodles,3ajdqs,amyblue13,2,Sat Jun 20 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"Are you using freshly sharpened or new clipper blades? Do cool them off but be sure to wipe all coolant off because this can also irritate skin.  What number blade are you using? Which direction, with the grain or against?"
poodles,3ajdqs,amyblue13,3,Sun Jun 21 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"First, thank you thank you thank you for taking the time to reply!  Yes new clipper blades, I bought new ones because I was afraid they many have been dull, then bought a second one new so that I could switch them in case it was a matter of overheating.  I have not been wiping off the coolant and will start doing that, but this was happening before coolant. It is the reason I bought coolant.  I use the WAHL 5 in 1 blade so usually clip his cheeks at a 10 with the grain.  I use a 15 when doing his muzzle area and a 30 around his nose and the tip of his chin.  I try not to go too tight because his skin is super sensitive and I am not confident.    Poor guy, he is the only dog I have ever groomed and he has really put up with me learning on him.  I have skinned his knuckles more than once.  I do cat feet on his back feet by try to get a cleaner look on his front paws."
poodles,3ajdqs,amyblue13,3,Sun Jun 21 04:15:15 2015 UTC,"Try the following next time:  Don't use anything shorter than a ten on the face, try just gently skimming, hold the blade at a 90° angle and sweep at the hair around the muzzle to catch where necessary.  Blades can heat up pretty fast, I'd suggest constantly touching the blade you're using against your cheek. If it's even warm, swap out for the cooler one.  Only clip his face after fully washing   and 100% drying him, use gentle dog shampoos on the muzzle, tear free, double wash to ensure it's completely clean.  Fluff dry if you can, use a warm blow dryer and gently brush the face area with either a baby brush or something with bristles like a toothbrush. This will ensure the hair is nice and fluffed so you can catch that hair in one pass, two if necessary.   Don't exceed three passes with your blade in the same area.  Always remember to put your thumb in the lip and stretch 'em out to ensure minimal risk to damage in the lip area.  Hope all this can help!! Good luck."
poodles,3aj4cf,PizzaPizazz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"I never could find any solid resource online differentiating a good or bad breeder.  What worked for me was to invest the time and money to drive out and visit the breeders.  Talk to them, look at their facilities, meet the parent dogs.  Any breeder that won't do this, you need to be wary of.  Pay close attention to the parent dogs, because it will be likely that the pups will follow their parents temperaments.  You can also get a good idea about how the dogs are treated, showing you indicators of a puppy mill.  Also, ask for papers on the parentage of the dogs.  They should be able to give you a dogs genealogy, with AKC registrations, for at least 3 or 4 generations.  Good luck!  I'd give you a recommendation, but I'm on the west coast and I doubt you want to come all the way over here.  If you do get desperate, PM me, I think my breeder might fly pups."

I feel like I got so lucky with my Wheaten breeder, she was the first breeder I visited, was very open about health testing, and I was around the parent dogs. Our first visit with her, she let us stay for nearly 4 hours, talking with her, asking questions and making sure my boyfriend wouldn't have an allergic reaction to her dogs/puppies.

poodles,3a90yj,2spoos,4,Thu Jun 18 04:38:56 2015 UTC,That looks like the same poodle that was freaking out at the Belmont Stakes a couple of weeks ago.

poodles,3a90yj,ShortTermMemoryLoss,2,Thu Jun 18 12:43:39 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, they're hilarious! Did you wind them up, or are they really into TV that much? Do they actually watch?"

poodles,3a8f99,LunaOfTheNight,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:16:55 2015 UTC,"Is that normal for phantoms? Was she a dark chocolate? We have a standard chocolate phantom who has been dark chocolate, but he's starting to get tons of light hair all along his back. He's 17 months old now."
poodles,3a8f99,ThisGirlsGoneCountry,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if it's normal. She was a lovely Hershey bar color with her puppy coat and her face was latte colored. Then the puppy coat went away and boom. Latte poodle all over. Though she does have black muddled on the tips of her ears and down her back. It's not a stripe, just mixed in. Coco is 12 years old now, but she became latte around...before a year old?"
poodles,3a8f99,LunaOfTheNight,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:12:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's on the darker end of the cream spectrum, or lighter end of the apricot spectrum. I'm not well versed in poodle-speak and someone else probably has a better answer!"
poodles,3a8f99,choochoobell,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:36:01 2015 UTC,"I think lots has to do a fading gene that causes pups that look chocolate to fad out into creams as they age, a true chocolate shouldn't fade and a true phantom should keep their colour with the lighter paws, face and and under coat"
poodles,3a8f99,disgustipated,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:36:26 2015 UTC,I call her my latte poodle. Dark cream sounds about right.

poodles,39j8mx,megatom0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:47:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure whether they're considered toy or miniature, but if I had to choose, I'd say they're miniature. Buddy, the white one, I suspect is part Bichon, which is why he's stockier, he weighs about 12 lbs. Max might be borderline toy, as he weighs about 9 lbs., he's on the daintier side."

poodles,39aq4p,TheLittleMexicanOne,3,Wed Jun 10 21:47:08 2015 UTC,"Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.   When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge.  There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together.  There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.   All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by.  The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.   They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.   You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.   Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together...."

poodles,39deh0,moostermoo,4,Thu Jun 11 00:38:38 2015 UTC,I use a slicker brush like this on Keke. She gets brushed every day. I work in small areas backwards to the grain (from butt to head) until the brush moves smoothly through the fur. I saw a video the other day (thanks to another member here) that detailed using a brush and comb and how to get all the mats out. Since I started brushing daily I haven't had any real issues with tangles or mats.
poodles,39deh0,disgustipated,3,Thu Jun 11 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"I second this. My Napoleon is more wavy haired, but gentle small strokes backwards from butt to head seem to work best."
poodles,39deh0,acmspirited,2,Thu Jun 11 14:21:16 2015 UTC,Oh she's a pretty girl! I'll have to try one of those brushes out. Thank you.
poodles,39deh0,headbean,3,Thu Jun 11 04:44:11 2015 UTC,"I use a slicker brush first all over and then go through with a comb. It's important to brush down to the skin so as to avoid matting, which is why I go over with a comb afterwards. There are a few videos on youtube on ""line brushing"" to make sure you get all over the coat. It's usually an evening activity while watching TV, but I don't brush every day - maybe twice a week, if that and haven't had any matting issues."
poodles,39deh0,philwalkerp,3,Sun Jun 14 03:42:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like to thank you for your practical, infromation-oriented post ( not just ""ooh look at my poodle doing x y z),  On the Internets, content is king. It's posts like yours that will help grow this subreddit."

poodles,37w66x,rabidrabbit06,4,Sat May 30 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"I get them trimmed, not plucked. Every three or so months I also clean them with apple cider vinegar and qtips. Haven't had any issues."
poodles,37w66x,headbean,2,Sat May 30 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"I let the groomer handle it. She has a liquid, not sure what, that she squirts in and cleans out."
poodles,37w66x,disgustipated,2,Sat May 30 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of issues with my dogs ear hair when I did not pluck; however, would recommend not doing it if you don't have issues. I do recommend cleaning them regularly (at least every couple of weeks) if they are outside much or swimming. I use Epi Otic to clean their ears after every bath."
poodles,37w66x,WhiskersTheCurious,2,Sat May 30 23:35:22 2015 UTC,We have the groomer pluck her ears. If she doesn't get her ears plucked she gets crazy bad ear infections. So I would say trim unless you are trying to prevent ear infections.
poodles,37w66x,BourbonPecan314,2,Sun May 31 01:45:56 2015 UTC,I'm a vet tech with two poodles and their ears stay plucked and cleaned regularly. I've seen some terrible nasty ear infections. They are very painful for the doggies and can take a while to clear up so to me it's not worth the risk of not plucking the ears. It honestly is not that painful and the get used to it after a while and don't mind you doing it.
poodles,37w66x,toshikisan,1 point,Sun May 31 19:00:02 2015 UTC,"I pluck the pup with less hair, but the one with more (and its deeper, too) gets trimmed.  They both get the vet-approved ear cleanser with every bath, and some q-tip time to get the dirt out."
poodles,37w66x,thornbaby,1 point,Sun May 31 04:16:50 2015 UTC,We used the powder to pluck our boys' ear hair.  They swam in the river almost every weekend so it was really important to keep their ears dry and clean.
poodles,37w66x,Megmca,1 point,Sun May 31 10:02:10 2015 UTC,"i pluck, I do a little at a time when we are relaxing and watching t.v.  it makes it a fairly simple process.  If you have no issues then I wouldn't change your routine."

poodles,37egvl,disgustipated,2,Wed May 27 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"My standard had soft puppy fur, up until about 10 months. She first started getting the curly hair around her neck. She's still about half soft fur and half curly at 15 months."
poodles,37egvl,iroll20s,2,Wed May 27 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Usually they go through a coat change by a year or so probably +/- 6 months. Its always possible that it'll stay, but at 10 months you're not past the change time. If she still has it at 2, its probably for good."
poodles,37egvl,ShowerWithATegu,2,Wed May 27 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"I would like to hijack this thread a bit to ask a question: What do people recommend when it comes to grooming the ""puppy coat""? My 14 week old standard poodle pup has some very long puppy fur going on, but I read that you shouldn't trim it until they get their adult fur, or else it'll come in all wiry/messed up. Does anyone have experience with this?"
poodles,37egvl,ShowerWithATegu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:28:42 2015 UTC,"I've gotten both of my poodle's coats fully groomed countless times, and a groomer has never warned me of this.

poodles,37egvl,piiinche,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on the poodle.  I've got two, and while they are both lovely soft when shorn close and cleaned, one is definitely softer.  In the genes, I suppose.  (Note - mine are 2 and 3 year old standards)"
poodles,37egvl,Brigittey,1 point,Wed May 27 03:08:21 2015 UTC,"She's so cute and tiny! Only time will tell if her hair will stay puppy soft. My mom's poodle is 4 yrs old and her hair is so kinky curly, it's no fun to brush. My gingy (she'll be 2 yrs old in a few months)and teddy (1 yrs old ) are so soft and fluffy. Gingy has big soft  curls while teddy's are starting to get tighter, even after combing and drying."

poodles,37drrz,arkaytee,3,Tue May 26 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"Not a poodle, but my old mutt had a similar issue.  We ended up kenneling him when we weren't home or couldn't supervise him.  Luckily he didn't mind his kennel at all. He stayed off the furniture on his own after the first time he hurt his back, but teaching him to stay off the furniture in order to stop him from jumping off would have been on the docket otherwise.  I also frequently carried him up and down steps, esp. on his bad days, lifting him in and out of the car, lifting him on and off the bed, etc. Basically just limit anything that could possibly strain/over extend the back.  My mutt had bad arthritis in his back and he was 10 the first time he hurt it badly."
poodles,37drrz,moostermoo,3,Tue May 26 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the response! I think we're going to need to put Oli in his kennel more often now, too. He loves it, but I always feel badly having him in there for the day while I'm at work, although he doesn't do much while we're out of the house anyway.  We've been lifting him up or down from furniture--we call it the Olivator--but sometimes he gets quick and jumps on his own. We got him some doggie steps, but I think he just thinks it's a trick he's supposed to do, like jumping through hoops or shaking paws. I don't think it's set in yet that jumping=pain. We're working on retraining him about that though.  Thanks for the input about your experience. It's so hard to see my little guy in pain when he moves the wrong way and tweaks his back, but hopefully we can reduce his incidents by adjusting our house and behavior for him."
poodles,37drrz,moostermoo,3,Tue May 26 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"Olivator! Love it! It's really difficult watching our fur babies in pain and getting old.  Still take him for walks as long as he's willing (it was heart breaking the first time my little guy didn't want a walk), but eliminate rough housing if you can and limit play to things that won't strain him too much.  My little guy made it to 16, even with his back issues.  Our little schnauzer just turned 10 and is starting to slow down too, no back issues tho, and so far, only a little limping when the weather is bad for her. Our standard poodle is only 16 months old, so he's got a long time yet for that stuff."
poodles,37drrz,moostermoo,3,Tue May 26 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is hard to see them slow down as they get older, but I try to just do whatever I can to make his life as good as possible :) Congrats on your little 16 month-old standard & 10 year-old Schnauzer!

poodles,3712y5,Crentist_the-Dentist,2,Sun May 24 04:35:34 2015 UTC,Thank you! :) He's the best dog I could ever ask for.
poodles,36ztdz,mnbookman,5,Sat May 23 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"Sit. Stay. Up (jump up and touch my hand with her nose). Turn around. Lay down. Shake. High five. Touch (touch my fist with her nose). She never learned to roll over, but that's a good one too. :-)"
poodles,36ztdz,Evenomiko,3,Sat May 23 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"I should mention that I used positive vocal reinforcement and treats to teach most of that. Clicker training was super useful for learning to come when I called her. I also taught her early on to ""leave it"" and ""out"" (don't eat something gross she is sniffing on the ground and if she has something in her mouth to drop it.) My girl loves to try to eat dried worms off of the sidewalk, so those last two are super helpful. Clicker training works wonders for those, and then eventually she did it without the clocker or any sort of food reinforcement."
poodles,36ztdz,Evenomiko,5,Sat May 23 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"Ooh! And I also never owned a dog before, so I didn't get the memo about poodle stereotypes, so right off the bat I taught her how to play fetch. It's her absolute favorite thing. She is on the large side for a toy poodle, but she fetches with a normal tennis ball and it's rather large for her mouth, but she loves them. I take her to a field by my house and use the Chuckit! toy to tire her out. It's a godsend. Even if I don't have time for a long walk, she will get tired out from only 5-10 minutes of hardcore fetching. And it taught her that coming back to me is always the right thing to do. I don't use a leash to walk her (not required in my town if the dog is under full verbal control, and since she is little and not vicious she usually doesn't scare people), so I guess you could also count that as training. She stays pretty close and will stop to sniff stuff and then catch up when she is ready. She does go tearing off after squirrels now and again, but if we are out for a jog she stays pretty focused on the task at hand. Luckily I take her out in a neighborhood with almost no car traffic and lots of kids that play in the street without adult supervision, so even if she runs into the street after a squirrel, there is almost no chance of her getting hurt."
poodles,36ztdz,Evenomiko,4,Sat May 23 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"I taught poppy to wait. It's the best command I ever taught her. It's not the same as a stay. A stay means I'm going somewhere and she isn't.   A wait I use for when putting her food down. When I grab a toy and throw it for her to fetch. When I want her to hold a position at the vets or when I'm examining her. It's so useful. And I also use wait to train the release command of ""OK go"".   Other tricks I taught poppy are. Touch, sit, down, say hello (give paw), speak, quiet, beg(sit on hind legs with front paws in a please pose).  If you can teach your puppy to play hide and seek. It's excellent brain stimulation too and helps your pup name toys so you can get it to bring the toy you ask for on command. I show poppy a ball and tell her to wait in a different room. Then I go hide the ball elsewhere. And give her the command to "" find the ball "". Poppy knows the names of 15 different toys and can bring the one I ask for out of her toy basket. Much to the amazement of guests."
poodles,36ztdz,rikkian,3,Sat May 23 21:09:11 2015 UTC,"If you can afford a beginner's class at a local doggie place, do it. This will teach you the basics of positive reinforcement training, what kind of treats to use (and different treat values), types of leashes and harnesses/collars, etc. From there, you can decide how far to go with the training for both of you.  Keke knows sit, down, stay, come, leave it, take it, drop it, lookatme, touch (nose to hand, either  normal or up high where she has to jump to touch), front (sit in front facing me), heel up (sit on my left in heel), and her new one, ""comfy"", which is like down, but gets her back end laying on its side instead of her up on her haunches like a normal down.  Next, we're working on UP, similar to touch but she stays up on her back legs, and BELLYRUBS where she rolls over on her back from a down position."
poodles,36ztdz,disgustipated,3,Sat May 23 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"We taught our boys to growl instead of bark.  I read somewhere that dogs bark partly because they feel it imitates the noises we make.  So we would hold a treat and talk in a very low, growly voice until they growled too and then they'd get a treat.  They'd still bark, just not usually right away.  They would growl until they saw the source of their irritation (a person walking by outside) then bark a few times and go back to growling when we admonished them."
poodles,36ztdz,Megmca,3,Sat May 23 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"My poodle used to know a lot of tricks! Now that she's older (13), her main ""tricks"" are to wipe her paws on the rug, give me a kiss, play hide and seek. Really her ""trick"" is knowing a lot of English words lol"
poodles,36ztdz,RigorMortia,2,Sat May 23 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"This lists other folks have put down are good ones - poodles are smart, and you'd be amazed how much they can learn!  I'd add ""say hi""  and ""check it out"" to that list - the first is a command that it's ok to go up to a person and be friendly, the second is used for when we hit new things (like balloons, umbrellas, etc) that I want them to look at and understand it won't hurt them."
poodles,36ztdz,thornbaby,2,Sat May 23 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"We've taught Gingy: come, stay, paw, other paw, hi 5, roll over, down, sit, talk, scratch her vittles vault if she wants food, dance, play piano, she knows what ""lizard"" means, what ""let's go to grandma's house"" means, what ""let's eat breakfast/lunch/dinner"" means, ""get in bed"", ""let's go pipi"", ""bring me the ball/toy"". When you talk to her she moves her head from side to side like she understands you :)  And my sweet little Teddy... he can sit, jump through two hula hoops at once,  jump through my arms if I make them into a hoop, when I hold Gingy's paw he jumps over our hands and paws, sit, stay, come, ""bring the ball,toy"", and when we go outside and I say ""go pipi/poops""; he does it pretty much on command. That's it for now, we're still working with him. He does listen when I call him; I can work outside without worrying about him running away, he always comes when I call him. They both know what the ""laser"" is, if I pat my lap to jump up on my lap, ""treats"" ""down"". Now that I think about it, they have a pretty good understanding of a lot of words.  Teaching these two, we just kept at it with positive reinforcement. Gingy knows a lot more because we had her for awhile before we got Teddy so she had all of our attention. When I talk to them I don't do that baby-cutesy talk I talk to them like I would a human."
poodles,36ztdz,piiinche,2,Sat May 23 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"Alfie knows sit, down, leave it (even works with his food) and “ok”, fetch, stay, turn around, dance (which is turning around with front legs up), high five, give paw (and give other paw), roll over, beg, walk on hind legs, stand on hind legs, jumping through arms, being shot, shake (very handy after being outside while it’s raining), bark (though he oftentimes just sneezes), wave, roll on back for belly rubs, waiting with a treat on his nose and/or legs, weaving through my legs while I walk and giving a fist bump. The last trick he learned was crawling which looks absolutely adorable.  I startet with the easier tricks like sit and down and roll over. There are some useful youtube videos where you can see how to train a lot of tricks. Alfie learned extremely quickly when I started to use his normal food as a reward. And it’s easier if you have distinctive hand signs for each trick."

poodles,35qgwc,socialpronk,10,Tue May 12 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"I’ll try to keep this short, but it won’t be! Amaze-Bobb was owned by homeless people who never groomed him or took care of him. His fur was never brushed or clipped, and as such became a pelt of matted grossness. What couldn’t be seen from the outside was that his fur had become so tight that it had amputated 2 of his legs. Yes, the fur had cut through skin, muscle, tendon, and bone, over the course of many unimaginably torturous years. Animal control took him and sedated him to shave him. His back left leg came completely off and was a closed wound; it had been held on only by his fur. His front right leg wasn’t quite to that point, it was on by a thread and there was no saving the swollen, necrotic paw so the vets amputated his foot just above the wrist. His teeth were blobs of yellow-green-gray and he has very few left. He has his canines, and a few on his left side. He is about 9-10 years old and was taken at the end of January. He spent a week with a rescue, I had him for a week, a week back with rescue director, with us for a week, then with my husband and I moving we were staying with a friend (with our 2 huskies, 2 cats, her 2 dogs, and her two special needs fosters) so we couldn’t keep fostering him. We met up with the rescue director for dinner a couple times and I mentioned how badly I wanted him. She said he was available (he had previously been going to someone else but it turned out to not be what the rescue wanted) so my husband and I talked about it and decided to adopt him (worth noting we've had nearly 20 fosters the last year and a half, we don't foster with intent to adopt!). We worked it out so that the director would fly him to us after our move. We will be getting him mid-June, and in the meantime he is visiting kids with special needs, kids at the oncology clinic, and there are hopeful plans for him to visit people who have experienced trauma, particularly amputations. He’s doing great with it so I plan to continue doing this once we adopt him. Bobb deserves a life of unconditional love, and not pity as pity does him no good and is not good for us either. Bobb is happy, active, alert, and well on his way to healthy despite arthritis, hip dysplasia, and multiple old fractures. He lives for now and the future, so we don’t dwell on his past. He’s in physical therapy, and we’ll be looking into wheels or prosthetic or maybe both. If you want to see the horrific state he was found in and just after being shaved, view at your own risk."

poodles,35qgwc,CivilNassar,3,Wed May 13 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, he has a bit of um, a ""red rocket"" issue because his abdominal muscles are always tight from how he has to hold himself to balance and hop. While with me I did belly rub time at least once a day, usually twice, to help him stretch out his back and loosen his tummy muscles. After ~10 minutes of that he'd be ""in"" for hours. But it's definitely his 3rd leg and when you pick him up under the chest it ALWAYS touches the back of your hand, unless it's shortly after a session of helping him loosen up his abs."
poodles,35qgwc,lollydot,2,Wed May 13 03:36:47 2015 UTC,It makes me so sad that he had to endure that. He must feel sooo much better.

Jett's teeth always get us compliments at the vet. It works really well, breaks down plaque nicely when used a couple times a week, although it can be used more frequently than that.   I would hesitate to put a senior under for something as mundane as a tooth cleaning."
poodles,31tluz,Arthur_Sword_Dent,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:20:55 2015 UTC,I'll look into that! I was also worried as well putting my old gal under anesthesia. Thank you for the insight!
poodles,31tluz,moostermoo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:30:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't ever had Banfield do it, but we have had our 10 year old schnauzer done three times at our vet and despite them having to pull teeth every time, she's done great with it.  I should add that our poodle is just over a year and we have been thinking maybe we should get him used to brushing so he doesn't have rotten teeth later."
poodles,31tluz,goodGirlgoneReddit,2,Wed Apr 8 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"I highly reccomend brushing ASAP! Its only going to benefit your dog (and you, unless you enjoy stinky dog breath lol)   Here's part of a paragraph I copied and pasted from the ASPCA website. (Too much to type!)   Over time, the plaque turns into rock-hard tartar. If tartar isn’t removed from your dog’s teeth, it will eventually inflame his gums. As the inflamed gums begin to separate from the teeth, pockets form in which more bacteria grow, causing periodontal disease to worsen. At this point, your dog can experience severe pain, lose teeth, form abscesses in his mouth and develop a bacterial infection that can spread through the bloodstream to the kidneys, liver, heart or brain. >    https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/brushing-your-dogs-teeth"
poodles,31tluz,moostermoo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"And that's why we need to get a routine going. Our schnauzer was a nightmare trying to get her teeth brushed when she was a pup so we gave up. I'm pretty sure our poodle would be open to it, though. He's very easy going for the most part."
poodles,31tluz,goodGirlgoneReddit,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:02:27 2015 UTC,"I use to work at Petsmart and there was a Banfeild located inside. They had all of the groomers watch a couple dentals (dogs were under anesthesia) so we could better educate our clients on the importance of regular teeth brushing and annual dentals from their vet. It seemed like a very routine procedure, and often they had multiple dentals a day. Its very similar to us getting out teeth cleaned at the dentist. I watched a 3(ish) golden and an 13 year old shih tzu get dentals with no complications. But, my co workers 12 year old schnauzer had a very bad reaction under anesthesia once she got older and was advised not to be sedated again. Thats a conversation you need to have with your vet to discuss the pros and con's of sedation and if they think it is safe for your dog.   If you're poodle is 11 and hasn't had regular dental care, brushing the teeth at home now isn't going to make much of a difference. Its kinda like if you went years without brushing your teeth and then one day picked up a tooth brush, the damage has already been done."
poodles,31tluz,Gileain,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:00:39 2015 UTC,"I've used Banfield for over a year now because of their wellness plan (yearly cleaning is included on that) with both of our old ladies (10 and 15). There's not been an issue with the procedure, and our poodle was a rescue, so she hasn't had good care taken with her teeth.   The doc here was very detailed in explaining the process, it was pretty much the same risks that people deal with when using anesthesia. Our girl has a slight murmur, and that was taken into consideration."
poodles,31tluz,Claytonias,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:28:58 2015 UTC,Just had pierre use the banfield method two days ago. I just hate how they have to shave his arm to put him to sleep. His breath really smells a lot better now.

Sure, he might not be as white as he can be all the time, but he still looks and feels clean. I try to use shampoo only every 3-4 weeks but in some cases (like poop) I wash him more often.

I would imagine that there is a point at which you could over-wash them, but I haven't hit it yet.  Si and Soph get hosed down regularly and bathed once every week or two with a sensitive skin oatmeal shampoo.  My advice would be to just pay attention to her - standards are plenty smart enough to tell you that something is wrong, and usually what.  If she's scratching and itching or licking herself, its probably time to back off."

For $240, in Houston, you should get a better job.   But more important, both dogs have nicks. I have used this groomer for years. She has developed a health problem now that is affecting her work. I stayed loyal despite the fact the cuts started looking bad. I feel sorry for her, but now, my dogs are suffering. It isn't just the nicks either. It took her six and a half hours last time and when I picked them up, both dogs obviously had not been taken to relieve themselves.

poodles,307jqe,SimonGn,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome pic. But can I just say, please stop watching Cesar Milan's shows. There is no evidence to suggest that ""dog whispering"" is real. The methods he uses are not only inhumane, but also scientifically baseless. Positive reinforcement is the only method for teaching dogs (or any other animal, including humans) anything. Any properly certified animal behaviorist will agree with me."
poodles,307jqe,disgustipated,5,Wed Mar 25 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"Lol! I agree so I will up vote this regardless. I know you are being helpful even though it comes across as a tad bit bossy and as un-asked for advice. Even with using ""please.""  As you can see, I have dogs who love TV. It is a lucky thing for me on days it is 100+ degrees out or during our many heavy rains here because they burn up energy and are mentally stimulated.   The only reason I have Netflix is the dogs. I have no cable. Cesar 911 is one of the handful of shows that have dogs from beginning to end. (We also watch all the Air Bud movies but I don't believe dogs can talk.) Poodles are smart, but I can promise you they don't understand his methods, and I don't agree with all of them. You just used negative reinforcement with me by pointing out something you assumed I was doing wrong on a public forum. It didn't work."

They will travel across country to rescue a poodle. I have had two of their puppy mill rescues - one from Tennessee and the other from Oklahoma.  They may be able to give you the words to freak the owners into surrendering or doing better with grooming. It probably needs to be addressed as a cruelty issue since mats hurt dogs (it is like having your hair constantly pulled on.) The best way to express this without angering the owner is the issue. If I was in your area, I would work as a ""plant"" to come in when they dropped off their dog. As a another poodle owner, I could unload on them (diplomatically,) without fear of it effecting your business. If they got offended at anyone it would be me.  If you have someone you know who is good with words and not fear of wrath, you might try it."

He's the sweetest, cutest, smartest little pup I know. A lot of friends and family are jealous of my dog and want one just like him. So, IMO, poodles are amazing. I also have pretty severe allergies and I cuddle and hug my poodle all the time with no problems. They don't shed so that's nice too. My boyfriend and I work full time so my poodle does pretty okay with the time alone. He is very independent but we make sure to take him to the park on weekends and lots of attention after work. Poodles are high maintenance dogs when it comes to grooming and it can get costly because you have to stay on top of it. Their fur can get very matted if they aren't brushed or groomed on a regular basis. I hope this helps and good luck!!"

poodles,2xhm5b,fr0gz0r,3,Wed Mar 4 19:15:02 2015 UTC,"Poodles are sometimes too smart for their own good. They can get spooked by something, and then will have phobias about it thereafter. They sometimes have separation anxiety which could be a problem if the dog will be left alone for long periods during the day. Make sure the dog is genetically tested so you don't have problems with blindness in later life. Barking can be a problem as they are fantastic watch-dogs - you may need a deterrent collar of some type.  Now, having acted as Devil's Advocate, poodles are wonderful. They are fantastic chick-magnets (so your gf mightn't like that <grin>). If you have one, you'll probably be never satisfied with any other breed in future. Our first one was with us for over 16 years, and after a 5-year mourning period we've just received a cute little red-head, who thinks the sun shines out of my nether-regions."
poodles,2xhm5b,SlowBillyBullies,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"Haha I appreciate both sides, thanks for your input! About how much would you estimate you spend a month on average for all of his/her needs? Can't imagine food would be a big issue"
poodles,2xhm5b,YoYo31415,2,Sat Feb 28 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"My standard poodle costs maybe $20/month for food and $60 every 6 weeks or so for his hair.  So if you include veterinary care amortized over the year, toys and so on, $50-100 would be a decent guess.  Also note that this is a standard poodle, who eats more food and may have more expensive hair cuts and so forth."
poodles,2xhm5b,fr0gz0r,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:01:22 2015 UTC,They can get spooked and have phobias??? Is this why when my text tone goes off on my phone it scares my standard out of the room??
poodles,2xhm5b,piiinche,3,Thu Mar 5 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"I have two toy poodles. The first one, luck of the draw, never barks. Literally never. The only noise she makes is a play growl. If we're in public she'll occasionally bark if she see another dog in the distance, but I'm not exaggerating when I say the dog barks less that 5 times per year probably. Our second poodle was semi-barky as a puppy, and we trained it out of her. Every time she'd bark we'd reprimand and when she'd communicated other ways, did other behaviors in place of barking, we'd praise the hell out of her. As far as self grooming, I have no advice, we get ours groomed. But some really valid advice I can give, they are GREAT dogs who pick up on training really well. Both of mine potty trained in less than a month. My husband and I both work all day and we crate both our girls, and it's the best thing we ever did. They love their cages and feel very safe/secure in them, and we don't have to worry when we are at work that they got into anything, hurt themselves, tore anything up, etc.   I hope things go well for yall and if you get her, please post to r/poodles!"
poodles,2xhm5b,melanie188,2,Sun Mar 1 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"Is your allergy to dogs (ie. you want a low dander breed), or to other things (ie. you want a poodle so you can groom/bathe it more frequently to get other allergens out of their coat)? If it's the second one, awesome.  If you have a dog allergy though, definitely spend some significant time around a poodle, put your face in their coat, etc. prior to getting one.  No dog is truly hypo-allergenic...many people are still allergic to poodles.    Look up common hereditary diseases for toys and make sure the puppy's parents were screened for them (and get proof).  Honestly, if you can afford it I'd get a puppy from a reputable breeder rather than craigslist, you're more likely to get a healthy/non-neurotic dog, which is cheaper in the long run.  But if that's not an option at least try to meet the parents and get a health guarantee so you can return it if the vet finds something wrong at the first visit.  Poodles are awesome.  I've never had a toy, but I've had a standard and miniature and they both did fine with us working during the day, although I'm sure they would have preferred we were home.  Barking can be trained out, but it takes a bit of work.  It's worth it though.  Biggest advice is GO TO OBEDIENCE with them, even though a toy is small and you'll probably be tempted to let them get away with more than a larger dog.  It is so much nicer to live with a well trained dog.  Takes some time on the front end, but totally worth it."

He gets excited like this when it is shows where there is running. This show was on cheetahs.   He is a very active dog and we do a lot of dog parks and walking paths. He has his CGC and is a very spoiled pup. You can check out his humor blog at 2spoos.com.

poodles,2x76ul,crazy_eric,3,Thu Feb 26 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"The Massachusetts/New England poodle rescues almost never have standards.  Since I began looking about five years ago, I've seen maybe four standards.  There are 53 available for adoption from shelters across the country listed on Petfinder.com right now, though, which is more than I've ever seen.    Standard poodles are hard to find in shelters because they're purebred dogs, and rarely available in pet stores.  Responsible breeders insist on a spay and neuter contract, so there aren't unspayed standard poodles wandering around getting pregnant for the most part.  They're also quite expensive, even as purebred dogs go, so people who get them from breeders are typically more committed to them than the average adopter of a purebred dog."

Shelters around here typically have a couple miniature poodles and poodle mixes, and they never really get the grooming they require while in jail."

poodles,2x76ul,2spoos,1 point,Sat Feb 28 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"I have had two rescue poodles from Poodle Rescue of Houston. I also have purchased a show quality dog from the breeder who runs the rescue.  It is an amazing facility with it's own on site vet to care for the rescues that come in and acres of room for the dogs.  Standards are going to go to the people who have showed long time interest and kept good contact with the workers.  If there is a close rescue, volunteer to walk the dogs or help in other ways. And be prepared to wait."

I think that since poodles are hypoallergenic and don't shed they're more welcomed in these parts of hospitals. We weren't even sure we'd be able to bring him even though he's allergic-friendly, just because my friend was in a reverse isolation ward for the risk of infection to her because her immune system was so low. We all had to wear gowns and gloves, but Mishka was welcomed with open arms.  Such a great story, thanks for sharing :)"

Been wonderful on all sides.    Edit:  I obviously didn't read Standard before.  So yeah, I know they are slightly out of your stated region, but Luminary is wonderful.

poodles,2uxthu,Revenge_Melon,3,Fri Feb 6 01:54:51 2015 UTC,"For a spay, we just used a t-shirt tied up so she couldn't get at it.  It also let her use the yard without having to worry about it.  For our guys we ended up making them wear doggie diapers, then taking them off for outside."
poodles,2uxthu,glStation,2,Fri Feb 6 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe get one of these instead?   http://trupanion.com/blog/2014/06/7-alternatives-cone-shame/  My vet did it with inside stitching so my toy poodle couldn't bite at the stitches. Maybe just put a sweater on her or something to cover the wound but keep her from licking it? Take off the cone if the poor baby can't sleep. If she can't access water or food, that's pretty dangerous I think."
poodles,2uxthu,Evenomiko,2,Fri Feb 6 03:01:00 2015 UTC,You might be able to cut it down
poodles,2uxthu,bblakney,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:29:50 2015 UTC,That's what I ended up doing. She's much happier now
poodles,2uxthu,rosekm,2,Sat Feb 7 01:25:14 2015 UTC,"Without seeing it, it is hard to say if it is too big, but the cone does need to extend past the head in order to keep them from getting at the stitches.  That being said, we never had much luck with the cones.  All four poodles found a way around them after about a day.  Our little girl was so tenacious she had to go back for more stitches and has a gnarly scar now.  We did much better with a t-shirt or diaper.  You have to monitor it more to make sure the wound isn't being covered too much and is healing properly, and I would still add a cone [in addition to the diaper] when your girl will be unattended, but overall everyone was much happier with the tshirt/diaper and no cone."
poodles,2uxthu,thornbaby,2,Fri Feb 6 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"We did something similar to glStation, combined with one of us taking the day off work to stay home and keep an eye on the munchkin.  Also, I was worried about her chewing on the stitches at night, so I took a good long towel, wrapped it around her middle, and then slept beside her on the floor with the ends of the towel underneath me.  If she moved, I felt it and was able to wake up and correct the problem."
poodles,2uxthu,PushcartPops,2,Fri Feb 6 21:08:45 2015 UTC,Get a baby onesie. As long as you are with her and watching her I don't see much reason to make the dog even more uncomfortable. The incisions heal quickly.
poodles,2uxthu,Brigittey,2,Sat Feb 7 00:43:51 2015 UTC,"We put a one of those elastic ""knee bandages for people"" things on our mini. We just slid it on her; it fit perfectly and she didn't mind it at all."

poodles,2urppc,PushcartPops,2,Wed Feb 4 17:06:58 2015 UTC,I really want to grow out his hair a bit - but it just won't happen until he starts letting me take care of his coat.
poodles,2urppc,PushcartPops,2,Wed Feb 4 17:13:46 2015 UTC,What kind of brush do you use?  Anything that pulls on the hair may be uncomfortable.  You want to use a slicker brush.  I would ask the groomer for some tips as well when you pick him up.
poodles,2urppc,WhiskersTheCurious,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:39:08 2015 UTC,I use a slicker and a greyhound comb.
poodles,2urppc,natlach,3,Wed Feb 4 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe use some de-tangler?  You can make your own by putting a small amount of conditioner in a spray bottle filled with water.   Other then making him more comfortable, just take it slowly like others said.  It takes me a full day to get through completely brushing my miniature after a bath."
poodles,2urppc,nmwjj,2,Wed Feb 4 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"It depends on what he does - is he squirmy? Afraid?   One of my poodles hates any sort of grooming. She's very squirmy. It requires being firm. It takes patience and doing it consistently. Let them get comfortable (i.e., lay down) before you start. Reward them with treats and love. Take breaks when they are getting tired of it."
poodles,2urppc,uber-blonde,1 point,Sat Feb 7 00:57:45 2015 UTC,"He's very squirmy AND afraid.   We're really making a concerted effort this round to do a little bit at least every day, so he can get over this."

poodles,2sicxb,atariboy,2,Thu Jan 15 12:40:11 2015 UTC,What a handsome dude! He looks SO soft!!!
poodles,2sicxb,pain_olympics,2,Thu Jan 15 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"He's still got some of that puppy fur, as soft as a cloud!"

poodles,2sicxb,SlowBillyBullies,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"How old is he?! My little one is 5 months and still has 100% soft, beautiful puppy fur. My older one always had coarser, curly fur, so I'm not sure what age it changes at!"
poodles,2sicxb,headbean,1 point,Fri Jan 16 01:25:33 2015 UTC,"My pup's started changing around 8 months. She's 10 months now and only her legs still have the soft fluff. The rest of her is curly. Still soft, but not the puppy fluff."
poodles,2rxiyw,RigorMortia,5,Sat Jan 10 03:44:52 2015 UTC,She's a cutie. How old is she?
poodles,2rxiyw,Alliance_Program,3,Sat Jan 10 04:28:56 2015 UTC,Precious little face!
poodles,2rxiyw,deauxpass,3,Sat Jan 10 04:30:35 2015 UTC,Ohhh! I love your sweet girl! She looks like such a sweetheart. How cute!
poodles,2rxiyw,uber-blonde,3,Sat Jan 10 04:03:39 2015 UTC,You are very welcome. What's her name?
poodles,2rxiyw,uber-blonde,3,Sat Jan 10 04:29:21 2015 UTC,"That's right, you told me her name yesterday. Sorry about that. Coco sure is cute. Coco doesn't look spoiled... she looks very sweet!  If it helps any, my FooFoo is spoiled too."
poodles,2rxiyw,uber-blonde,3,Sat Jan 10 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"So true. My baby stamps her little foot when she wants something. Makes me laugh every time! But my husband just says ""Stop spoiling that dog!"""
poodles,2rxiyw,uber-blonde,3,Sat Jan 10 04:39:15 2015 UTC,How funny! Mine does the same thing too it's like a hippity-hop.  My toy is the first dog I've had (I'm a military brat) and I love her very much. I didn't know dogs were so cute and loyal. We also have a weenie dog and a pomeranian but those 2 behave more like dogs. The poodle is more like a kid. I wish I had a houseful of toy poodles!
poodles,2rxiyw,uber-blonde,2,Sat Jan 10 04:44:59 2015 UTC,"I keep looking at Coco's picture, she looks so sweet and cute. I love her little eyes, she looks like a kewpie doll in the picture.  Thank you again for sharing the picture. :)"
poodles,2rxiyw,uber-blonde,2,Sat Jan 10 04:53:07 2015 UTC,she sends scratches to Foofoo   scratches back to Coco! too cute!

poodles,2rxe5i,uber-blonde,2,Sat Jan 10 02:56:01 2015 UTC,Thank you! She loves going to the beauty shop!
poodles,2rxe5i,SlowBillyBullies,2,Sat Jan 10 03:16:56 2015 UTC,Do you have a poodle? I can tell you my toy poodle does not like all the beauty shops. She will tremble if she isn't too keen on a shop. I've taken her to maybe 12 shops total and she's only really liked 3 shops. Maybe your dog would like another shop? Just a thought...
poodles,2rxe5i,SlowBillyBullies,2,Sat Jan 10 03:24:36 2015 UTC,Hope to see pix of your baby some time! I love my toy poodle. :)
poodles,2rxe5i,deauxpass,2,Sat Jan 10 03:28:00 2015 UTC,They are the absolute BEST! I agree with you. :)
poodles,2rxde7,uber-blonde,2,Sat Jan 10 02:48:10 2015 UTC,Love all her clothes! What's her name & how old is she?
poodles,2rxde7,deauxpass,1 point,Sat Jan 10 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Her name is FooFOo. She just turned 8 but still looks young. She weighs 6.9 lbs. I think you said you have a chocolate poodle, does she like clothing? When I hold up an outfit for my toy poodle she dances and jumps around until I put it on her."
poodles,2rxde7,deauxpass,2,Sat Jan 10 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"My chocolate girl, Sophie, is 8 too. She weighs 4lbs, and wears lots of sweaters, shirts and pajamas. I think she feels lost without something on every day! I'll have to post some pics of her. She's a former puppy mill mama."
poodles,2rxde7,deauxpass,1 point,Sat Jan 10 04:26:30 2015 UTC,Please do! I would love to see her. 4 lbs is really little. I bet she wears a size XS (extra-small). My toy wears a size S (small). Do you have any puppies of hers? My little girl never did have puppies.
poodles,2rxde7,deauxpass,2,Sat Jan 10 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"I was waiting on a puppy from her (via her breeder) and was informed that the baby was stillborn, and Sophie ended up having a hysterectomy. The breeder said she didn't want Sophie any longer, and I immediately said ""I'll come get her right now."" That was ten months ago and she is so much a part of my four-legged family, it feels like I've had her forever. And yes, she wears an XS!"
poodles,2rxde7,deauxpass,2,Sat Jan 10 04:54:40 2015 UTC,I understand. I'm so glad you went to get Sophie. You are my hero for today!

poodles,2rtfry,PushcartPops,2,Fri Jan 9 04:15:34 2015 UTC,I would take her everywhere.
poodles,2rtfry,piiinche,3,Fri Jan 9 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"I do take her almost everywhere. She sits in my purse sometimes, waiting on me to go!"
poodles,2rthch,headbean,2,Fri Jan 9 03:19:23 2015 UTC,Love those paws. How old is she?
poodles,2rthch,SlowBillyBullies,5,Fri Jan 9 03:28:31 2015 UTC,She just turned 10 months two days ago. We were at the dog park yesterday and she literally had a lineup of males waiting for a sniff. Figured something was up and brought her home. She's swollen but there's no sign of blood (maybe she's just doing a good job of keeping clean). She's also rather pathetic today... big sighs and flopping down rather dramatically.
poodles,2rthch,moostermoo,3,Fri Jan 9 03:44:43 2015 UTC,"Poodles are such drama queens!  I love it.  Poor girl tho, it does suck."
poodles,2rthch,SlowBillyBullies,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:35:32 2015 UTC,"Do you think you'll get her spayed? Our pup is 5 months right now, we are thinking we'll get her spayed around 7-8 months."
poodles,2rthch,jjakers88,1 point,Fri Jan 9 23:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, she will be spayed. She's been a slow grower (was only 2.5kg at 9 weeks) so I wanted to give her time to grow with all her hormones and letting her growth plates close before getting her spayed.   I'm actually not so sure today whether or not this really is heat because I still haven't seen any blood. She is acting 'off' though."
poodles,2rtfo8,uber-blonde,2,Fri Jan 9 03:04:28 2015 UTC,My little chocolate girl has the same sweater in purple with a black bone. Our girls have good taste in clothing!

poodles,2rtfo8,deauxpass,2,Fri Jan 9 04:22:06 2015 UTC,"Mine are black, but would be cuter if I'd get purple!"
poodles,2rtfo8,PushcartPops,2,Fri Jan 9 04:23:46 2015 UTC,The black gloves go with the black bone though so you're good!
poodles,2rtfo8,jacobhannah2011,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:25:53 2015 UTC,Phoebe has it in Pink and White with a pink bone.  Popular sweater for pups.
poodles,2rtfo8,smilesbot,2,Fri Jan 9 16:09:32 2015 UTC,That's an odd service dog outfit.
poodles,2rtfo8,jacobhannah2011,1 point,Fri Jan 9 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"That's an odd service dog outfit.   Well, yes... but she really does keep me calm. :/  I only take her in stores where they don't serve food. The only store that's ever asked me not to take her in was Target. Even Wal-Mart lets her in. I take her in because I'm scared someone might break the window of the car out and steal her!"

poodles,2rpkzt,deauxpass,2,Fri Jan 9 04:27:55 2015 UTC,"Plus, poodles are so so smart and inquisitive, which is probably why she wants to go everywhere with you...wants to see what's going on!"

poodles,2rfszd,bblakney,5,Mon Jan 5 21:03:58 2015 UTC,"Aww - What a little cutie! Your advice is totally sound. We love her dearly, but our Princess Leia has patella luxation, common in poodles. I wish we had researched the breeder better than we did."
poodles,2rfszd,WizardOfGramercy,6,Mon Jan 5 21:57:31 2015 UTC,"She is literally the perfect poodle. Perfect with my 2 small children, never barks, no tear stains, no joint issues, but she has seizures. I'm terrified that she won't wake out of one or her 3-drug cocktail will kill her."
poodles,2rfszd,WizardOfGramercy,4,Mon Jan 5 23:38:59 2015 UTC,"How very sad. I hope that she lives a good, long and healthy life. I know she has a great home and great family to watch after her. Peace and prayers ..."
poodles,2rfszd,tehbob,3,Tue Jan 6 02:46:57 2015 UTC,"My poodle also has seizures.  We give him Phenobarbital twice a day to keep his seizures at bay.  Since we started giving it to him two years ago, he has only had one seizure, and that was because we missed a dose."
poodles,2rfszd,WizardOfGramercy,2,Tue Jan 6 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"We give Dolly phenobarbital every 8 hours as well as potassium bromide twice a day and valium injections when she has cluster seizures (every 3 months typically). Occasionally, she will have a single seizure but more often she will have a seizure then another a few hours later, then 90 min later then 70 min later and more closer and closer together. Saturday night, she had 3 seizures so we gave her a shot of Valium. The trauma of getting the valium put her into a seizure. She then slept for an hour and seized again so more valium, but thankfully they stopped. Her record is 24 seizures in a night."
poodles,2rfszd,pparkaworks,2,Tue Jan 6 16:29:54 2015 UTC,Hearing this makes me so sad. You're a saint. Stay well Dolly!
poodles,2rfszd,WizardOfGramercy,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:41:31 2015 UTC,Ours is a poodle mix (puppy farm rescue) and she has luxation as well. Have you tried any supplements or anything like that to help?
poodles,2rfszd,pparkaworks,1 point,Tue Jan 6 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"No supplements yet. We've considered glucosamine/condroiton(?) but she's been doing pretty well and nor fussing or favoring it. I'm sure we'll have to at some point though. Have you found any treatment or supplement that you would recommend? We already give her an allergy pill, so I don't like giving her too many meds."
poodles,2rfszd,WizardOfGramercy,2,Wed Jan 7 04:47:47 2015 UTC,"We don't give ours any meds at the moment. Last time we were at the vet we were told hers was grade 2. Every once in a great while she'll 'throw it out' and hop around on it for a minute or two but she seems to be pretty well able to handle it herself, and like yours, no favoring or fussing otherwise. The one thing that our vet did recommend is Adequin shots, which I guess is just a more powerful version of a glucosamine-type supplement, and at our vet it's only $25 a shot and we'd start once monthly and increase if we noticed any discomfort on her part. Still on the fence on that one. Thanks for letting me pick your brain!"
poodles,2rfszd,arkaytee,1 point,Wed Jan 7 13:54:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info - I saved it for future reference.

All though I will only be able to get my first poodle this year, One day I hope to have the opportunity to have a litter of my own to get to enjoy their growing stages.  I hope you will be able to give us more posts and videos of these cuttie pies as I am thoroughly enjoying watching these little guys grow up"
poodles,2r7yul,nachopants,3,Sun Jan 4 08:56:16 2015 UTC,Certainly looks like you'll have your hands full in the coming weeks!
poodles,2r7yul,sandypeaches,3,Sat Jan 3 22:58:53 2015 UTC,"When my 8 week old came home I would play random sounds off Youtube on the surround sound (there are playlists of dog socialisation sounds). Rain, thunder, noisy trucks etc. don't bother her. I forgot to slam doors though and now whenever the wind happens to catch one she jumps and runs to sit by my legs."

poodles,2qblt3,Kalypso989,7,Wed Dec 24 23:46:29 2014 UTC,"Last week he was off his food, and ate a little bit only to not be able to keep it down. Thursday rolled around and we took him to the vet. They did a bunch of tests to show that he was jaundice, his liver was tiny for a dog his size, and they had no idea what the cause was (they still don't). After a biopsy two days ago, his body couldn't fight anymore and he slipped away peacefully last night. We buried him next to his favorite maple tree. Tanner, TeeTee, T-Pot, Happy Man, you are the greatest dog I have ever had in my life. I'll see you on the other side, Baby Boy.  I know some of you wanted updates on him, and for now, my heart can only do this update this well. I appreciate your thoughts, prayers, and your dog's tail wags and cold noses."
poodles,2qblt3,WizardOfGramercy,1 point,Wed Dec 24 23:47:34 2014 UTC,I'm still struggling with it everyday. He was the greatest dog I ever had and i will never forget him. I'm going to get a tattoo to memorialize him at the end of June. I would just give so much to have him back. I really would.
poodles,2qblt3,WizardOfGramercy,6,Fri Jun 5 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"I am so very sorry to learn of Tanner's passing. It's hard to up vote this, but I do so in his memory. May he rest in peace. He was such a handsome little guy."
poodles,2qblt3,disgustipated,4,Fri Jun 5 13:08:09 2015 UTC,"He was a very good boy; grumbled his Poodle grumble 'til the very end to show how displeased he was (a running joke in my family). I am at peace knowing he's not hurting and suffering, but my eyes are scratchy from crying and the ache in my chest hasn't faded."
poodles,2qblt3,bblakney,4,Wed Dec 24 23:59:36 2014 UTC,Peace be with you my friend. May your tears turn into those of joy at some point while fondly remembering him and all that he brought to you and your family.
poodles,2qblt3,piiinche,4,Thu Dec 25 00:17:00 2014 UTC,"Kalypso, I'm sitting here crying my eyes out for your boy. I lost my little guy Hayden in April to cancer. He was 9, almost 10.  If it helps, I can share that it hasn't gotten easier. I miss him and think of him every day. But I think it's made me stronger as a person. He was my little guy, my partner in everything. I'll never forget him. Every day I say my good morning and good night, that routine hasn't changed. I'll always miss his puppy kisses. He's here with me, always. In my heart, in my memories, and if there's anything after this life, I will find that rainbow bridge and it'll be the best doggie reunion in the history of ever.  God, I miss that little guy.  I do feel your loss, and hope that you too, are one day reunited with your buddy. Internet hug."

And he is absolutely her favorite dog in the world. Lol!  She's incredibly snobby. But she really has bonded with Onyx and they're both stressed when/if the other isn't around now. It's pretty remarkable."

poodles,2q0pys,echothree33,3,Mon Dec 22 01:10:00 2014 UTC,"He stopped eating last Friday when my dad left town for the weekend. We thought he was just depressed because he's stopped eating before when we left town. When my dad came back, Tanner still wasn't eating much, and what he would eat, he couldn't keep down. We took him to the vet on Thursday and they kept him overnight after drawing blood and seeing that it was a bit yellow. He's been there since and we have found that his liver is small for his size, that isn't working the way it's supposed to. Last night we found out that his blood wasn't coagulating like it was supposed to and had a plasma transfusion this morning in hopes it'd help. He was supposed to have a biopsy this afternoon but I haven't heard from the vet. He isn't eating anymore because it hurts his stomach, but is on an IV and has antibiotics pumping through his system. I worry I may have given him some food or something that got cooked in garlic bitter or had onions in it. I just don't know what to do other than sit by the phone and worry for my baby boy. :-/"
poodles,2q0pys,incandescance,2,Mon Dec 22 00:33:14 2014 UTC,"Hi OP, this is just a shot in the dark but the breeder we got our standards from said the father did something similar.  Wouldn't eat, liver problems, not really doing anything. Just for fun they tried putting him on a raw food diet and he entirely turned around and was doing great when we got our boys. It's something to try if you all are running out of options  Best wishes."
poodles,2q0pys,PushcartPops,2,Mon Dec 22 00:49:41 2014 UTC,"First, we need to get Tanner's blood to coagulate so we can get a biopsy. Then we can hope for his liver to recover. I will definitely bring this up should Tanner make it to that point! When you say raw diet you mean mean right? Or do you mean veggies like carrots and potatoes too? Thank you for your suggestion!!"
poodles,2q0pys,asiankim,3,Mon Dec 22 01:04:12 2014 UTC,"I can't speak for the other user, but when I hear ""raw food diet"" I assume they are referring to BARF. http://www.barfworld.com  I hope Tanner bounces back. He looks like a great friend."

poodles,2pp850,sewcute04,2,Thu Dec 18 18:00:59 2014 UTC,"How old are they? I've had my mini poodle, Spencer, for 9 years, alone, before my brother (we live together) got his chihuahua, Maggie. Spencer was used to being the lone wolf and we didn't socialize him much when he was younger. Maggie is scared of everything. Literally. But because of their age difference, it's kind of like a big brother/little sister relationship. He's the big protective dog, not aggressive, and tolerates her need for attention. He's very mellow, especially compared to her.  Usually, I've heard poodles are a bit more independent dogs, at least mine definitely is! It might be good to talk to your vet about if the dogs get aggressive with each other, if there are behavior things you can do. I'm more about reinforcing good behavior!! If they get along once, YAY! BE EXCITED AND HAVE TREAT TIME!!"

The little guy was about 20 lbs and a little stockier than a show poodle.  He was a ""Phantom"" marked poodle with white paws, muzzle, eyebrows and even a little marking on his chest.  He was so smart too; he wiped his paws at the door before he came in,  politely tapped his feet at the door if he wanted out and gave one single bark to be let back in.  He was with me from childhood into adulthood and was such a special little friend to me.  RIP Harvey Poodleman."

poodles,2n3lz6,Diremonster,2,Sat Nov 22 19:01:56 2014 UTC,"All of my pictures of my standard just look like a giant ball of fluff. Sometimes, with enough flash, you can find an eye!"
poodles,2n3lz6,harrymac55,2,Sat Nov 22 21:19:07 2014 UTC,"With my digital camera the instructions I found on a website were to use a dark background, put the exposure value to -2, and turn the flash off.  My black poodle pics have been coming out much better."
poodles,2n1v4p,RebelRoundeye,2,Sat Nov 22 03:39:13 2014 UTC,did you name him after the youtuber?
poodles,2n1v4p,bandgeekchic,2,Sat Nov 22 14:55:01 2014 UTC,He came with the name from the shelter.
poodles,2n1v4p,Cryderian,2,Sat Nov 22 21:44:13 2014 UTC,"My  standard Spencer loves to watch me play Destiny, I think Forza makes him a little woozy though!"
poodles,2mx3ls,asiankim,2,Thu Nov 20 22:06:21 2014 UTC,What a cutie! Love her name too. Hope her vet appt goes well.
poodles,2mx3ls,WizardOfGramercy,4,Thu Nov 20 22:27:02 2014 UTC,Thanks! Her full name is Ramona Flowers (from Scott Pilgrim vs the World). She just had to get her bordetella vaccine.

poodles,2mo0h0,PushcartPops,2,Wed Nov 19 05:28:39 2014 UTC,No problem ..glad you enjoyed the video :)

poodles,2mn218,TranMeister,1 point,Tue Nov 18 05:50:43 2014 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, how much does she weigh?"
poodles,2mn218,alinktothewindwaker,2,Tue Nov 18 20:12:23 2014 UTC,"8 lbs. She was really skinny when I rescued her from the shelter a month ago, but she's steadily gaining it back."
poodles,2mn218,alinktothewindwaker,1 point,Tue Nov 18 20:26:19 2014 UTC,"That's good to hear! I have a male miniature poodle that I rescued about two months ago. He was a skinny 14 lbs when I adopted him, but he's up to a healthy 17 now."
poodles,2mfp4p,SlowBillyBullies,5,Sun Nov 16 03:10:41 2014 UTC,"Got our 1st poodle a buddy, meet Sabrina. She got her first ""big girl"" haircut today and we cant get over how adorable she is!"

poodles,2md2lv,Cryderian,1 point,Sat Nov 15 07:19:17 2014 UTC,Hi little one!
poodles,2m0bbs,Kalypso989,3,Tue Nov 11 21:57:49 2014 UTC,"My problem is that my poodle likes to curl up in the bend of my knees, and then I'm stuck in bed because I don't want to disturb the cuddles."
poodles,2m0bbs,doubleplusfabulous,3,Wed Nov 12 17:51:41 2014 UTC,Helper dog is helping.
poodles,2m0bbs,raziphel,2,Wed Nov 12 22:18:10 2014 UTC,"Wait a tic - what sort of homework requires the bed, mom? =P"
poodles,2lxe27,bbsbb,2,Tue Nov 11 02:59:22 2014 UTC,I'm convinced that my older poodle is part human. Her personality is just so humanlike.
poodles,2lxe27,SlowBillyBullies,1 point,Sun Nov 16 03:12:27 2014 UTC,Too cute!
poodles,2lreex,PushcartPops,2,Sun Nov 9 13:50:41 2014 UTC,Such a sweet face!
poodles,2lreex,Butter_Butt,1 point,Sun Nov 9 14:31:15 2014 UTC,Thanks Butter_Butt!
poodles,2lreex,sailorJery,2,Sun Nov 9 15:26:24 2014 UTC,so cute! I refer to my mini as my little lady friend
poodles,2lreex,choochoobell,1 point,Sun Nov 9 16:13:24 2014 UTC,She's aka the White Shadow. She is with me wherever I go.
poodles,2lnyn3,mrychrstms,6,Sat Nov 8 10:42:36 2014 UTC,Happy birthday Alfie!!
poodles,2lnyn3,LuckyPrincess,3,Sat Nov 8 11:19:48 2014 UTC,"I showed him and he just licked my hand. I guess that means ""thank you""."
poodles,2lnyn3,LuckyPrincess,2,Sun Nov 9 09:58:59 2014 UTC,"Awwwww bless him, give him a kisses back! X"
poodles,2lnyn3,Megmca,5,Sun Nov 9 22:24:22 2014 UTC,I think my computer just exploded from the cuteness.
poodles,2lnyn3,BEgirl69,2,Sun Nov 9 07:56:33 2014 UTC,"Oh, that happens to computers as well? It usually only happens to my heart. :)"
poodles,2lnyn3,Cryderian,3,Sun Nov 9 09:57:46 2014 UTC,"Almost three years ago, I worked at a dog groomer's in California that had a semi-regular dog named ""Alfie"" that came in, and he looked just like this one. He was my favorite customer. =) That shop ended up closing due to landlord/rent complications."
poodles,2lnyn3,poodlefluff,3,Sun Nov 9 02:14:04 2014 UTC,It's sad they had to close due to those reasons. I hope they found another place.  Alfie has never been to a groomer. He's a rescue dog and when I got him he was afraid of almost everything. I didn't want to stress him out so I bought clippers and watched videos on youtube on how to do it. It's not a perfect clip but I think/hope I got better with time.
poodles,2llphs,Diremonster,2,Fri Nov 7 18:45:44 2014 UTC,I think every standard poodle owner feels the same way!
poodles,2lbod2,philwalkerp,5,Wed Nov 5 01:50:47 2014 UTC,More important question: why doesn't anyone care about health?
poodles,2lbod2,ExBroBob,3,Thu Nov 6 00:40:40 2014 UTC,"I really think this is the most important thing breeders should be concerned with, but sadly, it's all about appearance.  Genetic diversity among poodles is really a problem, and having such a narrow standard really hurts the breed I think."
poodles,2lbod2,ExBroBob,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:13:18 2014 UTC,"Clover has Addison's Disease and anxiety so severe she's on PRN meds. (Her sister from the same litter, who we ran into in some bizarre coincidence- the two were a year old, clipped the same way, and wearing red collars- was the same way.)  She's almost 13.5 now, and I swear it's just to spite this cunt"

poodles,2kx4ow,atariboy,2,Fri Oct 31 20:37:59 2014 UTC,I just want to snuggle with him!
poodles,2kw9fh,rozilla,1 point,Fri Oct 31 16:16:20 2014 UTC,Adorable!
poodles,2ksvb5,KaptajnKaffe,5,Thu Oct 30 17:50:14 2014 UTC,"I'm sure you'll notice that he is quite chubby! It's a result of him being alpha of the pack and therefor got to eat alot of food in his first weeks!  He was already almost ~+20% in mass compared to his brothers and sisters when we picked him up, and judging from his little chubby feet he's going to grow up to be a big, handsome guy :-)"
poodles,2ksvb5,moostermoo,2,Thu Oct 30 17:53:55 2014 UTC,So adorable!
poodles,2ksvb5,Diremonster,2,Thu Oct 30 22:45:21 2014 UTC,"Here he is again, showing off his chubbyness!"

poodles,2kqwyu,MosDon,5,Thu Oct 30 03:16:50 2014 UTC,"I love the green/hazel eyes brownies have as puppies.  She is super cute.  Has an ""I'm in charge"" face like my brownie Alastair."
poodles,2kqwyu,rosekm,3,Thu Oct 30 14:18:15 2014 UTC,Look at the size of those feet!  What a pretty girl.
poodles,2kqwyu,disgustipated,2,Thu Oct 30 15:35:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah she's a little cutie. :) Also really brave and adventurous, the opposite from our other poodle!"
poodles,2kjeul,WizardOfGramercy,3,Tue Oct 28 04:23:34 2014 UTC,"Look, I know they're cute and all, but you should warn everyone that they will grow up to be sock-attacking buttheads that like to put their butts on your pillow.  I'm waiting until my girl turns 2 before I get another... but damn, they are SO CUTE!"
poodles,2kjeul,disgustipated,2,Tue Oct 28 14:39:59 2014 UTC,"{Snicker} Spoken like a true poodle lover. We take the good with the bad I guess. Glad to hear you'll be getting a little sister or brother for your poo at some point. I think they are happier with playmates around. One of my girls stole socks all the time as a pup, but she hasn't done that in some time now. She has graduated to balls - she would play ball 24/7 if she could. She puts her heart and soul into it whenever she plays. It's just so cute. Thanks for your reply ..."
poodles,2kjeul,angryclouds,2,Tue Oct 28 14:58:49 2014 UTC,sock-attacking buttheads that like to put their butts on your pillow   That is... so unbelievably accurate.
