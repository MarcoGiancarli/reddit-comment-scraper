vintagejapaneseautos,3blnoo,tristinGrind,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:47:58 2015 UTC,"Since it's in Japan, it's between a 74 and a 78. Had it been in the US, I think they only made the 2+2 as a 260z in 1974, then as the 280z from 75 to 78."
vintagejapaneseautos,3blnoo,Gerka,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"Man, its weird but I do enjoy the 2+2. Id rather not own one, but I wouldnt be upset if I did. At one point there was this uber clean 2+2 (with a vinyl roof no less) on CL that I almost picked up. I would going to slam it with ZGs and turn it into a G-nose. It had something like 45k original miles or something.   It was a weird car that could have been way badass."
vintagejapaneseautos,3blnoo,Gerka,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:50:42 2015 UTC,Man no matter how nice the condition I can just never bring myself to like a 2+2 Z
vintagejapaneseautos,3blnoo,MRB0B0MB,3,Tue Jun 30 08:21:50 2015 UTC,I really like the 2+2. maybe even more than the 2 seater
vintagejapaneseautos,3blnoo,Gerka,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:48:15 2015 UTC,I think that is an insane opinion but I won't argue with you
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,JP147,11,Sat Jun 27 08:03:02 2015 UTC,That RX7 is nice... some people would be into those flares.
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,tristinGrind,4,Sat Jun 27 08:28:48 2015 UTC,They were fiberglass and not in bad condition. Someone will take them. The motor and all traces of interior were already gone.
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,tristinGrind,3,Sat Jun 27 08:38:06 2015 UTC,Yeah they looked nice from the photos. Too bad about the front bumper.
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,GenrlWashington,6,Sat Jun 27 08:44:36 2015 UTC,Stuff like this always makes me sad to see.
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,E_F_F_E_C_T,6,Sat Jun 27 08:48:09 2015 UTC,"I don't mind if they have 500,000km and are rusted out, but often cars there are in better condition than mine. The Supra has a good chance though, hopefully someone buys it."
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,cnuttin,2,Sat Jun 27 09:25:08 2015 UTC,"I want that supra, but I just read another one of your comments and you're too far from me."
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,cnuttin,3,Sat Jun 27 18:49:01 2015 UTC,where is this junkyard?  We never have cool stuff like that in the NY area.
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,Armageddon_shitfaced,3,Sat Jun 27 09:31:08 2015 UTC,South Australia. There are 3 of them around Adelaide. Pay $2 to get in and get the parts yourself. Usually a quarter of the price or less than at a dismantlers.
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,Armageddon_shitfaced,3,Sat Jun 27 09:34:43 2015 UTC,"ahh, that explains it.  We have those pick'n'pulls too, but finding one of those cars on a given day would be a jackpot.  Mostly its just old american cars, tons of hondas, the occasional 80s bmw, maybe a handful of DSMs (eclipse/talon/laser).  The rarest thing I saw last time I was in one was a Datsun 280z."
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,Armageddon_shitfaced,3,Sat Jun 27 09:43:59 2015 UTC,"The most interesting car I have seen there was a rotary engined, front wheel drive NSU Ro80. They were never sold in Australia and I had no idea anyone had ever imported one. They are also very impractical to own, needing an engine rebuild every second oil change or so. I also have seen an R32 GTR, a C110 Skyline, a 1st gen Mitsubishi lancer, lots of good stuff."
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,vazquezanator,2,Sat Jun 27 10:33:31 2015 UTC,C110 Skyline? Why oh why didn't you tow that home?
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,vazquezanator,2,Sun Jun 28 01:22:38 2015 UTC,"Once cars are put out in the yard, they have their VIN numbers and compliance plates punched, and cost a minimum of $900. And since c110 parts are expensive, this one got stripped pretty quickly. The GTR went even quicker, within a few days it was down to half a bare shell."
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,draws_your_car,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"It sucks that they are written off. There couldn't be many c110s in Australia to even use the parts. My dad drove one when they first came out here, but I've never seen one. What do you mean by a minimum cost of 900? For the car?"
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,DeMoCo81,2,Sun Jun 28 02:05:55 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing a few c110s and c210s around when I was a little kid, but I have hardly seen any recently. Buying a car from the yard costs at least $900, but probably more if it has parts still on it. Not worth it for a trashed old 4 door c110 that can't be registered."

Here in the states, they were also badged under Plymouth using the name Sapporo. We had some good times in that car.."
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,Fluffy_Waffles,2,Sat Jun 27 12:37:18 2015 UTC,"When cars are too good or rare to put in the yard, they sell them out the front. It didn't look like there was anything wrong with it, probably just sitting for a long time."
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,Fluffy_Waffles,2,Sat Jun 27 21:40:44 2015 UTC,"Fellow Aussie here, isn't that a rx5?  It was badged a rx5 here at least, maybe a 121 or Cosmo in Japan?"
vintagejapaneseautos,3bac44,DarthDillhole,2,Sat Jun 27 10:14:40 2015 UTC,"The original name in Japan is Cosmo. In Australia and some other countries, 121 is for pistons and Rx5 is for rotaries. This one was a 121 but still, it would have been a very good candidate for a rotary swap."

vintagejapaneseautos,37aolk,froggysclone,4,Tue May 26 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"It looks daft, and I suspect gets dragged all over the road because of the width of the things. A little sports car like that, elan/miata/any other small sports car wants to be fitted with a skinny tyre, and be driven sideways at every opportunity. imho  eta. Unsprung weight will be massive with those things, a R888 is a heavy tyre. I dread to think what all four wheels and tyres weigh, and what percentage of the total package that equals.  That said, it's a proper little car, BEC (Bike Engined Cars) are pretty common here in the UK, especially in the kit car community."
vintagejapaneseautos,37aolk,84TD,6,Tue May 26 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"and be driven sideways at every opportunity. imho   Yeah except that is the exact opposite of what the builder actually wants. He wants a canyon carver not a hoon machine, and with those tires I bet it handles like a go cart."

One that somewhat stands out, is an old school meet in Santa Clara every last Thursday of each month. Mostly Datsun 510 or 620 trucks, with only a small handful of ZCars, and other vintage Japanese cars.  Other than that, the largest gathering of vintage Japanese cars was Bayline in August of last year."

vintagejapaneseautos,361bpk,Gatorade21,1 point,Wed May 27 20:28:55 2015 UTC,Did you cut front springs or swap out with stiffer springs. Also how the heel did you get the front end apart to pull out the spring. I tried it a couple times and couldn't figure it out. I even have to repair manual.
vintagejapaneseautos,361bpk,Gatorade21,1 point,Wed May 27 23:23:02 2015 UTC,Actually I don't know how.. That's the one thing I've never messed with. My brother did the suspension work at his shop. I used cut springs because custom springs are too expensive haha. We have the same exact car? Rt83? I could ask him.
