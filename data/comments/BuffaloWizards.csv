BuffaloWizards,3e3af9,Tripleat,4,Tue Jul 21 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"I like this a bit more it kinda makes sense to the name, since I've always had the idea of a hob goblin being of like a more Chuckier or bulky goblin."

BuffaloWizards,3e3af9,viziroth,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"That sort of makes sense, he really only meditated because of Pat. If it wasn't for pat he might not even know the meaning of the word."

BuffaloWizards,3dznp2,Nihillo,4,Tue Jul 21 00:56:35 2015 UTC,My favorite is simply Wizard. Damage + Damage = Double Damage.
BuffaloWizards,3dznp2,Headcrabhat,12,Mon Jul 20 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"Wait... wait a second. Wait a second! I've got it! Look at that equation. Look at both sides. There is a Plus and an Equal sign in that equation. P is letter 16, and E is letter 5. The only arithmetic sign not included in that equation is the - (minus). 16 - 5 = 11. K is the 11th letter. Damage + Damage is also equal to 2 Damages. Double Damage is also 2 Damages. 2 + 2 = 4 Damages.  K4 Damages (the team). The curse is real."
BuffaloWizards,3dznp2,Headcrabhat,3,Mon Jul 20 22:10:52 2015 UTC,I'd have to go with Theurgist.  I like Elementals.

I love their inherent double damage PLUS the ability to give someone else double damage. Besides that they have Divine Intervention which is really good for those important rolls. While I think the healing ability is middling, Honor Chains and Unholy Water both give some good battlefield control. Maybe it's just me, but Paladins are up there in terms of utility class with some decent basic weapon damage all the time."
BuffaloWizards,3e11a7,sadlala64,0,Tue Jul 21 03:18:34 2015 UTC,from what i remember they are the early stage of Kobold like the infant/toddler form. so i guess not.

BuffaloWizards,3dz870,Skipper2399,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:37 2015 UTC,Lol yes
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,Domo117,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:10 2015 UTC,I don't really care for this idea. The way it was in the BTS video was perfect. A few bounces with random numbers on each. Your suggestion overcomplicates things for the same result.
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,famguy07,3,Mon Jul 20 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry my other comment wasn't clear. The final result will look the same as the bts, but the numbers would not do silly things and would actually Carry suspense to them. (The main reason people want physical dice.)"
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,famguy07,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:57 2015 UTC,"I was trying to reply with my phone then it died.  I was going to say that IIRC the die in the BTS video already changes number with each bounce. If it does not, I agree that it should, However, your main post suggests that you want the numbers not to be perfectly random, but instead weighted based on a real D20. This over complicates things for the same result, and for most people, wouldn't add anything. I think the virtual roll as it is works just fine; it doesn't need to be fancy in any way."
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,famguy07,2,Mon Jul 20 22:04:08 2015 UTC,"The current one does change with each bounce but not weighed. This would add suspense for things like 17, which could easily become a 1.    The main reason I saw that people wanted physical dice is because of the suspense rolls, this aims to fix that."
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,The_Raven81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I don't think most players are going to know that a 17 is next to a 1. What you are suggesting adds a lot of complication to something that is achieved just as easily as it is now (any number could turn into a 1)  Think of the viewer who does not know about dice, and doesn't watch anything but the Saturday stream. When he starts to notice that 17s often turn into 1s, he's not going to think oh that's because they are close together. He's going to think that Rob is not being fair/random. This really isn't a good idea for the show; the virtual dice are fine as they are now."
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,zzCratoszz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:59 2015 UTC,"True, I think in order for it to work each number would have to correspond to a separate image. While this would basically make it physical, yet digital dice, it would complicate things more. Doing it this way would basically eliminate all negative aspects of digital dice, but it would take some work in coding and art."
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,The_Raven81,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"Mine would be the same animation, the numbers shown would just have reason and not a 2 a 2 and a 3 bounce."
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,zzCratoszz,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"I would personally trust the pseudo-physical dice more than the one that just appears bouncing on the screen...  plus, like many have said, a lot of the suspense would be gone if they went digital."
BuffaloWizards,3dz870,zzCratoszz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:37 2015 UTC,Just need some imagination. There are many more things you can do with digital.

BuffaloWizards,3dy69e,kupomaro,4,Mon Jul 20 14:42:49 2015 UTC,I think yes?

BuffaloWizards,3dy69e,Upstagebuffalo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"They do that to a lot of show dogs, too. Personally not a fan of that practice, maybe it's like two sub-races of Kobolds? The ones with tails triple wield with their tail instead of their mouth. EDIT: this would make sense canon-wise. It wouldn't break lore, but would allow some things similar to the goblin subraces hatred. Those without tails dislike those that do."

BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,TheYellingMute,26,Mon Jul 20 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"I support the digital dice in pretty much every way except 1: I have a slight suspicion that there won't be any more of those ""emotional rollercoaster"" rolls where it goes from a 6 to an 11 to a 1 to a 17 to a 5, plus all the added emotions of seeing what numbers are directly next to the number the die is currently on. I found it particularly thrilling every time a 17 was about to be a 1, but then stopped right before, or when it was about to be a 1 but had just enough momentum to hit a 16."
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,Headcrabhat,4,Mon Jul 20 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"yeah thats what i love too, and i think thats a really amazing thing but sadly, and deadbones is a strong support of this i think, theres just too much bs when it hits a tile and ruins a role. sure its funny when theres low rolls that barely happen but when a piece just stops it dead it takes it away.   the only middle ground MAYBE is if the dice tower kept enough momentum to where the dice could still roll around once leaving the tower but not to far as to run into anything, but that would require it to be placed in an area where it wont obstruct the playingfield or view of the table."
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,Headcrabhat,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:29 2015 UTC,Those tiles have also made good rolls and even 20s that wouldn't have happened otherwise.
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,raidergreymoon,14,Mon Jul 20 01:12:26 2015 UTC,"I understand why they want to change it. I just think its a bad idea for so many reasons. The look, the feeling of a tabletop experience, the suspense, having an actual object to vent frustration at, ect...   To me the only way I'll accept the digital dice is it opens the way for better things. More time to RP, less time spent in combat dealing with dice, ect..  I think they should certainly try it out for a couple shows though and see how people feel about it."
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,Skipper2399,8,Mon Jul 20 01:31:29 2015 UTC,"I have mixed opinions on the matter of the digital die.  I kind of like the fact that there will no longer be the issue of it hits tiles or it gets stuck on an edge. However, there are downsides. As Headcrab said, we won't have the emotional sensation of seeing the die be rolling and almost land on one thing the teeter over to another. Now we just get boom boom boom *insert roll here. Yes, this creates a nice and easy way to see what they rolled and fixes the issue of Rob often doing other things off screen and not catching the roll or trying to find the dice, but it does kind of take away from the feel. And I think that dice towers just take away from the feel of rolling like the digital but without making a difference on the difficulty of viewing.  No matter what though, if Rob thinks it's a good idea that will help make the show better, than I am all for it. I trust they aren't cheating the system.  Edit: Talking about dice towers"
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,lysate,3,Mon Jul 20 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"I support digital dice all the way. No more bullshit rolls where the die gets stuck on a tile, no more having to re-roll when someone rolls the die off the table, no more searching around for the die and making sure it's visible to the stream. It'll be much easier and more convenient for everyone.  plus: custom dice! That sounds awesome!"
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,O_xD,3,Mon Jul 20 01:56:46 2015 UTC,My 2 cents: for most things roll the digital die but when deciding something important roll the physical die.  Also use random.org for the digital die if possible.
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,wilwarland,3,Mon Jul 20 02:45:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is, even ""physical"" dice aren't real. They're just digital dice, but more complicated looking and difficult to read."
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,charred_one,2,Mon Jul 20 10:32:12 2015 UTC,im actually kinda surprised the game doesn't have an option to have the dice ghost thru tiles or other things to avoid them interfering with the dice
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,MrStaanNatas,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"If it was just a person game between friends then I would totally use a number generator or ""digital dice"" but as it is a show I think that the audience interaction with the dice add to the excitement to the show. Each roll of the ""physical dice"" feels impactful and gives rolls more power, especially during critical moments. ""Digital dice"" would remove that tension and enticement.  I'm reminded of that building where Rob was talking about hex vs squares and something to the effect of 'We use squares because the audience can see them better then hexagons.' (paraphrasing of course) So I feel that having ""physical dice"" would be better in terms of a show."
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,MrStaanNatas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"Also, as stated before, dice towers/trays would remove most issues of running into tiles and such. Several of which have already been made for tabletop"
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,JT70900,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:47 2015 UTC,While I will miss the Table Top dice I am gonna trust Rawb on this one. He has a good idea of where he wants the show to go and how it should feel. I am sure he knows what he is doing.
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,angelhng,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"I am holding off on picking a side between digital vs physical because I haven't seen the digital dice being used. It could be the best thing that ever happened to urealms live or it could be a bust. Either way, I trust that Rob will react accordingly and within reason in a way that he thinks will be beneficial to urealms in the long run. Also as the showrunner and GM, Rob can easily scrap the digital dice and go back to the physical dice if need be. (It's not like it would be the first thing that doesn't pan out in urealms) Honestly, there's pros and cons to both so in the long run it probably will not be too detrimental in the feel and tone of the show."
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,Petertwnsnd,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:41 2015 UTC,Honest question: Have you watched The Sunswords Behind the Scenes? Rob showed the digital dice he's working on and how they look right now.
BuffaloWizards,3dw41x,Mobius1B,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"Either way will be good but I feel like going to digital dice shouldn't be rushed. If the switch happens it should be after the month break if not later. Doing the switch mid season feels wrong to me. I also don't know if the community is ready yet both in terms of trusting it isn't going to be faked, as well as in terms of being ready to give up the tabletop sim dice. The community can be really toxic at times especially to change and I don't want to see toxcity happen over something as silly as dice. That said its the guys show so it is there choice I just feel like sticking with the current dice is the best for now."

BuffaloWizards,3dtsd2,rossthebossuk,3,Sun Jul 19 19:59:16 2015 UTC,What you could do is give each treasure card a number and then use a random number generator between 1 and whatever the highest number will be? Just  a thought
BuffaloWizards,3dtsd2,Nightkyle,2,Sun Jul 19 12:28:51 2015 UTC,"Problem is, that is hard and tedious. If I want to get a random treasure quickly, using that method, I would have to input it into the random number generator, look up what that number means and then give it to them. It would be far easier to have a single button to press to get it.  This is most likely what I will do, but it's a more tedious method to do it..."

I really can't imagine teaching someone how to use the puppet program taking all that long.. so I'm not sure that's a good excuse to not have guests on the show. I mean it consists of moving the puppets on-and-off screen, having them start and stop talking, and changing facial expressions. Even if the program isn't intuitive to use; I can't see it taking all that long to master."

Having the same guys every week while the show is still in massive development is key.

BuffaloWizards,3dsz9j,O_xD,2,Mon Jul 20 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"I heard Rob talking about guests and i agree with him. People seem like they want Millbee on the show, and i haven't watched him enough to know if it will fit in. Personally i think the show isn't for everyone, introducing a guest can and will be awkward for both the crew and the guest during the RP bits, and also add more stress on Rob as DM, making him preform worse and ultimately lead into a worse show.  Rob also made a point of a guest coming in and bringing viewers who aren't familiar with the URealms world, and while definitely a great way to bring in new fans its also an amazing way to bring in haters, who will just point out the flaws and frustrate the crew.  On the other side, if they were going to bring in a guest I would really like to see Zisteau. He is the kind of guy who (imo) can jump into a show with just a short briefing on the story/situation, and will do good RP if he is comfortable enough with the rest of the crew/the crew with him. And this is my main point, a guest would throw the regular cast off their game and potentially result in a worse show, but it will bring more viewers for the week, and some will stick for the weeks to come.  Just not gonna go into how they handle money because i don't know how they handle money."

I want the main cast and Rob to grow in their skills, and if Rob ever decides to have a guest, have the campaign be a book in the Tambok show, or even future Tamboks.  I'm just 100% with Rob on this one. But if he ever did agree to guests, I would like it to be BWs or even Pause. Possibly even Vanks or Steve (Electricity Man) if Rob feels like it.

BuffaloWizards,3dsz9j,EveryCarpet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:33 2015 UTC,I wasn't necessarily saying Rob should have guests on right this moment. I agree that it's probably better to perfect the show format and get the game to as stable a state as possible.

That being said, I don't recall her ever being referred to as ""mother""; only as ""Mombo"".  ""Mombo"" may have just been what everyone called her, just like how everyone called Porbo ""Porbo"".  Another possibility is that, just like how the grandfather in the book was a grandfather-like figure to McCoy, Mombo was a mother-like figure to Porbo."
BuffaloWizards,3dqu97,DanelerH,16,Sat Jul 18 17:01:52 2015 UTC,Pigs have mothers.  You dip a pig into the purple goo to create a porc.  Porbo clearly killed a pig.
BuffaloWizards,3dqu97,Rurikar,2,Sun Jul 19 01:17:47 2015 UTC,Purple goo? So like when I dip sticks into purple goo I get torches!
BuffaloWizards,3dqu97,Overhighlord,10,Sun Jul 19 09:12:11 2015 UTC,"Well, porks don't sexually reproduce, so from a biological standpoint they would not have different sexes.    Now from a social standpoint, the asexual porks could see that pretty much every other race has 2 genders and try to imitate that. In the pork army we are shown that they most likely don't have any identity, but porks free from that could choose themselves what gender they would prefer.    Basically just remember this: Sex is about you have between your legs, it's the physical part of being a man or woman. In the case of the porks that's likely nothing or very little. Gender is the mental part of being a man or a woman, if a pork thinks of herself as a female, then she technically is a female."
BuffaloWizards,3dqu97,spiritbx,3,Sat Jul 18 18:37:22 2015 UTC,"Whatever the characters say is not canon. Porbo could be misinformed, not understand what happened, or just too stupid. It is made canon once there is 'physical presence' in the world that it happen, or if the GM (Rob) specifically states that it is the case.  Watch behind the scenes of Sunswords, regarding the bridge ogre and Gweneth's understanding that ogres are magic immune, to have Rob's comment on character's understanding of the world and what is rules in the game.  /  With that said. Porcs do not need gender or genetalia to make fanfiction with a 'gender indendified(?)' race."
BuffaloWizards,3dqu97,OpinionDonkey,3,Sat Jul 18 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"The term ""mother"" could just be referring to how Porc's are made. Or it could just be that all Porcs see the strongest one as the mother/father. It doesn't have to be strictly biological."
BuffaloWizards,3dqu97,XxDuelistGuyxX,2,Sat Jul 18 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"McCoy didn't have a Grandpa either, he read about one. Porcs try to emulate the behavior of other species, so that's probably what was happening there.  Kallark x Kinnie OTP."

BuffaloWizards,3dpjyv,Mobius1B,8,Sat Jul 18 05:17:31 2015 UTC,"I have nothing to base this on, but I get this creepy feeling that the Silvermine Mountain is probably not an actual mine, or at least they are not taking prisoners there to do slave labor mining rocks.   A common theme in this show is mind control, there are many creatures who can posess or otherwise control others (the best example of this was in The Many Gobos of Pat), so perhaps someone or something could be influencing the Elves, and amassing prisoners in the mountain for some reason. But this is just speculation on my part, I don't really know what I'm talking about.  What I do know, is that the sides are becoming more clear: we have the Elves, who have been gathering prisoners to be taken to the mine, they don't seem to really care about their prisoners' crimes, they just want to throw non-Elven people in the wagon and send them to the mountain; then we also have the Porcs, who clearly are opposed to the Elves and have formed some sort of resistance movement, they were trying to break into the mines, probably to free their comrades inside; and then we got Nisovin, whose motivations are unclear, we don't even know if he actually cares about all of this, maybe he just needs all of these artifacts for his experiments, but I'm assuming that he is not associated with the Porcs, because Coober fought them in the Sunswords, and Coober supposedly works for Nisovin. Coober himself could be yet another rogue element, it's no wonder he was disguised as a Kobold, lying is his specialty.  At any rate, I'm excited for the Silvermine Mountains campaign, I'm sure it will be big."

People notice an inconsistency in the show, point out that inconsistency in the chat, and somehow this makes the show unenjoyable to you? Somehow this is considered ""arguing with the game master""? The point of that ""golden rule"" seems to have flown right over your head. It's not ""don't argue with the GM"", it's ""what the GM says, goes"". You're supposed to correct the GM on consistency issues, because it ruins immersion when that frozen elf has suddenly been deemed unconscious. It's after they've been corrected that they make a ruling, and that's where you have to follow the golden rule and accept their judgement. In this case, since the corrections always come way too late to be useful, Rob decides that whatever happened happened, and the world will have to live with the tiny consistency issue.   I'd also like to point out that chat is literally incapable of interrupting the game. It's Rob that breaks the flow of the show by launching into a mini-rant whenever this happens instead of just saying ""okay, you're not wrong, but that happened a long time ago so we're stuck with it now"" and moving on. It kind of weirds me out how much this seems to bug him, actually, considering how relaxed he normally seems.  I've fallen very far behind on UR Live content, so I'm not sure if any of this has already been addressed."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,Trace500,6,Fri Jul 17 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"It kind of weirds me out how much this seems to bug him, actually, considering how relaxed he normally seems.   In all fairness, it's Rob running the game he wants to run it. He takes it seriously, but I wouldn't want people hounding on me for every little mistake, miscalculation, or technicality I miss. Nothing Rob's missed has been game-breaking, and I expect that to remain par to the course, as the large things that usually affect the outcome he has a perfect handle on.  There are people who sit in chat and do damage calculations themselves, and will go out of their way to bring it up to Rob in the chat if he's ever off by a certain amount or whatever, when Rob has said on multiple occasioans that sometimes he fudges it (or just misses it, again it's not that serious) to make it the way he sees fit.   If Rob ever did something on purpose, say typically for the last big boss fights when many enemies share the same health pool, he's going to fudge when those guys get knocked out, because in the end, it is his game, and he's running it the way that he feels would be best for an enjoyable stream."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,KyKobra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"Rob, like me, likes to call out idiots. Don't you like calling out idiots?  Regardless, people who point out details like that are fundamentally naive. A tabletop RPG isn't like a computer RPG, where the story is predetermined and you win/lose based on how you leverage your stats and items. In a tabletop game, and especially URL, the stats, items etc serve as secondary gameplay elements, as tools to make the game seem ""challenging"". Ultimately, whatever happens will be what Rob wants to happen.  So if Rob is going to get his way no matter what, there is REALLY no point contradicting him. Not that this is going to hinder chat.   People like to argue.  It's cool."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,TPHRyan,0,Sat Jul 18 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right. ""What the GM says goes."" So if what he says goes, then don't argue with the GM about it. especially if it was A)irrelevant, or B) like you said, ""that happened so long ago so we have to deal with it.""  I mean, he even said out loud during Porc Hunters, in the prisoner carriage encounter, ""OK Chat, stop backseat DM'ing or i'll go after them instead."" He like, had to threaten the chatroom to get them to stop.  I'm just sayin, just sit back, watch the show, chat with the room, and don't let something so minor bug you. Kuz it shouldn't."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,Toadslayer,3,Sat Jul 18 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"You're overreacting. It doesn't really matter, man. I've caught two shows live, Porc Hunters (I was really tired though so I was asleep for half of it) and The Sunswords. Both times it had been so much more fun to watch it live than to watch it on YouTube. I highly recommend watching live, the atmosphere is so much better it's just awesome. You can play urlbingo and join in the K4 spam when someone rolls a four. Don't let such a small thing like that bug you so much that you won't watch the streams live."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,SabrielandOJ,3,Fri Jul 17 23:38:00 2015 UTC,"If you ever did want to watch a show live I recommend doing so from one of the other guys channels.  Deadbones and Justin both host the show but they have their own chat room with a lot fewer people in.  I personally watch on Deadbones channel, partly cause that's where most of my friends are, but also because I can't deal with the main chat."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,Quilrond,2,Sat Jul 18 01:03:42 2015 UTC,"This. I like having a slower chat where I can talk to people, so I stay in Justin's and just watch Coe's. Also, I think it's fine for people to correct small mistakes as long as they don't get too irritating about it. The only time that I can think of where they got really spammy was during the meta ytt encounter and that's probably only because Episode 0 of Sunswords put the possibility of retcon and paradoxes on everyone's minds."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,Quilrond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:08:37 2015 UTC,"well I haven't gotten that far yet. it's late now and watching these are like all day events being so damn long. Gunna go sleep and then watch ""The Many Gobos of Pat"" tomorrow, and then if it's not TOO long, and I'm not dead tired afterwards, I'll watch The Sunswords afterwards.  But I'll take this into consideration, and probably do it next week.  Do they ALL stream the game? or does it only come from Coestar's channel?"
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,Quilrond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:26:46 2015 UTC,"I think Twitch has a system of hosting, so Coe's channel streams, but it lists others as hosts if they choose. That way, they have their own chat rooms, but the video that's streamed is the same for everyone."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,Quilrond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:30:51 2015 UTC,"ahh ok cool.  well we'll see what happens then.  I actually just realized that today was Saturday now, so I may hold off on watching The Many Gobos of Pat, and The Sunswords, and just try to catch this week's campaign when it airs - even though in terms of the game's progression, I'm STILL kind of behind concerning the Stamina system.  I've heard it's changed drastically, but I've not seen the new system used yet in the campaigns I've seen so far."
BuffaloWizards,3do8k2,MoreOne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"This Saturday's stream is being held off until next week, so no worries there.

BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,PrinceGnoff,22,Fri Jul 17 19:48:02 2015 UTC,He just outright says it later in the video anyway...
BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,Emperor_PPP,8,Fri Jul 17 20:25:29 2015 UTC,It's not canon yet. It needs to be confirmed on a URL stream. Then it will be canon.
BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,Toadslayer,-4,Fri Jul 17 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"I think a sheet that was used during the show along with Rob confirming it as 100% true is ""on the board"" enough to call it canon."
BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,Alklaine,7,Sat Jul 18 03:29:24 2015 UTC,"It wasn't explicitly shown during the campaign show. We never saw Rebooc turning back into Coober or doing anything that shows that he was Coober (although ""only saying Kobold to keep up the disguise"" does point pretty strongly towards it).  ""Being in the notes"" doesn't mean anything. Elephelks only turning 90 degrees for example was more than likely in the notes, but that's definitely not canon."
BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,Boolderdash,-2,Sat Jul 18 04:00:39 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true, I guess it's just so obvious it should be canon, not being on the board seems like a technicality."
BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,Alklaine,4,Sat Jul 18 15:46:36 2015 UTC,It's not canon. It needs to happen during a URL stream. Rob made that really clear. I honestly wouldn't be all too surprised if Rob throws a curve ball and Rebooc turns out not to be Coober.
BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,Toadslayer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"Okay? I realize that, I just said it seemed logical enough through use, and Rob saying so, that the board being a technicality seemed a little trivial. Rob can RetCon whatever he wants to, its no big deal. I don't really care enough to argue with Rob if he changes if it's Coober or not, so why does it matter that much?"
BuffaloWizards,3dmrdk,Alklaine,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"Nah, just because a couple people were arguing about it not being on the board makes it not canon doesn't mean he won't do it, he's said it literally 5 times now. He might do it, but I highly doubt it. And anyways, Coober not showing himself was apart of his plan anyways. He is Coober, and it will be revealed in the Silvermine Mountains Campaign."

BuffaloWizards,3dnuik,Chilly_Wizzy,3,Sat Jul 18 01:58:35 2015 UTC,No money also means that you are expecting the regular cast of the show to put on a several hour long show with no compensation. Ya redoing a campaign would lighten the load but you are stilling asking the guys to make a commitment of time that they could be spending in other ways. Not saying the idea is necessarily bad it just doesn't account for the time to train a guest and all the other issues Rob had mentioned.

BuffaloWizards,3do56x,Unseeingmocey,5,Fri Jul 17 23:42:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like if it's 20 characters from campaigns it's going to end up with some of them fighting the group. I like the randoms that no one really cares about so I don't have to listen to Rob talk about people complaining.  Although it would be funny Philipe to show up and just rolls 20s and wipe the group.

You don't blow your proverbial load on the fan favourite with the first character, you've gotta keep the suspense up that maybe they won't pick him.  I'm really happy he picked Fenris, to be honest.

BuffaloWizards,3dmblv,Zylo003,5,Fri Jul 17 13:35:34 2015 UTC,"Rob went into it more in depth on Justin's latest Tuesday Talk Stuff about guests. It's not just that he'd have to teach them puppet pals, but if a guest comes on suddenly it becomes all about the guest. there'll be a lot of hype and it'll take away from the main cast (Coestar, Justin, Roamin, and Deadbones). Not JUST that but they'd have to talk money of some kind. He can't expect a guest to do it for free when the rest of the cast is getting paid, but if he pays the guest then that also takes away pay from the cast. I'm just paraphrasing so I could be wrong on a couple of things, but basically, there's several reasons to not have a guest on the show. However, I would LOVE to see a guest come in to play as like a boss character, or as the NPC who gives the gang their quest. We get the coolness and gimick of having a guest, but because they aren't there for the whole show and just part of it, it doesn't really take away from the main cast. I wonder how /u/Rurikar would feel about something like that, but he knows more than I do, so there are probably reasons that wouldn't work either."

He has some issues with understanding (or carrying to learn, hard to say) game mechanics of more complicated games. Best example would be the one time where they play Battlestar Galactica and Admiral President Crendor votes himself into the brick. It was hilarious though :D"

I remember that being a big thing for them, it makes a top down view much better. Does it have square tile abilities? I also remember something about using it ""for now"" because it's easier on the audience's eyes, has an exact straight line, and doesn't get messed up upon compression.  Turns? List of characters? Custom Maps (not just floor tile textures, like coat all the floor tiles with a map that Megan makes)? I think a more detailed argument might have given a larger sway in my mind.

BuffaloWizards,3dldmj,graymorality,4,Fri Jul 17 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"I actually really disliked the ""fanfiction"" staff.  While, I did find it a little humorous, to me it hurt the story how much Coe was using it to slow down the party and change what they wanted to do.  Why would Dave, a somewhat weird but still nice elf, want Gweneth to ignore the Kobold Children?  And it also felt weird and artificial how much the ""leadership"" was being passed around.  There's no reason anyone would make Phineaus leader and if Rob didn't give Coe the staff, Gweneth likely would have never given up leadership unless she was unable to continue the campaign."
BuffaloWizards,3dldmj,pyrotrap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:18:02 2015 UTC,"They explained the leadership passing by Dave making the current leader so insurmountable in love with the to-be leader that they couldn't refuse. Except for certain cases, Gwyneth could not make Rufio the leader, but Dave circumvented that by becoming the leader himself (which was actually kinda logical for Gwyn to do, Dave was the least strange and most trustworthy of like, their ENTIRE party)."
BuffaloWizards,3dldmj,Headcrabhat,2,Sat Jul 18 04:21:00 2015 UTC,I think only one death was intentional as shown by the animation in the Fire Spooky encounter that turned an elf to bones.   I think the amount if Role Play was perfect this weak

BuffaloWizards,3dldmj,lindeloef,2,Fri Jul 17 22:32:48 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it, it had the right ratio of roleplay to combat for me. Best moment was the whole bridge Troll moment including the broken Program that ended the ticket problem :D  negative point for me was the death of Gwenneth's unborn child. I don't think there was a need for a dark, tragic and sad point. At least not in an UR Live campaign which are more on the silly side.  I hope the show becomes bi-weekly cause I think that extra week helps the preparations enormously for making it a better show."
BuffaloWizards,3dldmj,Skipper2399,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:22 2015 UTC,"I have mixed opinions on this campaign. First off I would like to say that this was my favorite show yet. However, I do have some nitpicking.  Justin: I agree that Justin was the weakest character. I was not the biggest fan of the voice switching between his intimidation and regular gnome voice. The one positive thing I can say about Justin's performance and character was the times at which he did the hand gesture of sex. I died laughing every time.  Roamin: I feel like Roamin's character was okay. When it was revealed that he is the cousin of Phineas, I began to really enjoy his role. He was a more calm and open version of Templeton. The Spell of Bearding stuff was fun and Roamin played combat fairly well I believe.  Coestar: So I first loved the idea of Coe playing Dave, but I feel like the focus on the fan fiction was a weird and almost unneeded part of the character. (However, the staff I did enjoy.) Coe usually is my favorite, but I feel like him playing Dave took away from some of the fun stuff we normally get to see him do.  Deadbones: Deadbones had the best performance this week in my book. His interactions with Gwyneth, the funk, the ogre, and the kobuld children were all spectacular. I found the most entertainment from him this week  Overall, I think this was a great week just because of many reasons that Rob explained in the behind the scenes video with it being a good mixture of role play and combat. I, myself, cannot wait to see what s next to come for URealms Live."
BuffaloWizards,3dlcpe,The_Raven81,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:10:24 2015 UTC,Rob mentioned in one of the behind the scenes videos that he wants to switch to digital dice.

BuffaloWizards,3dlbnl,Danke4President,4,Fri Jul 17 04:58:52 2015 UTC,The only problem with Rob being is costume is what if there is more than one NPC. Like in the last campaign with Phineas and the Ogre.

BuffaloWizards,3djjvx,BrineOfEmeralds,3,Thu Jul 16 20:16:49 2015 UTC,They were throwing around the idea of a Funk campaign in Justin's stream where everyone is a character that has been touched by the Funk.
BuffaloWizards,3djjvx,Railith,6,Fri Jul 17 06:48:28 2015 UTC,This campaign was fantastic! I loved how Deadbones was basically completely insane and no one in the party ever found out. Honestly carlos was my favorite part!
BuffaloWizards,3djjvx,Gnattman,7,Thu Jul 16 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"I think this campaign was my favorite so far. They had a good mix of challenging, but not I am going to wreck you combat. As well as a awesome amount of Roleplaying."
BuffaloWizards,3djjvx,CryWolf13,2,Thu Jul 16 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone else, this's been my favorite so far. At the end I was kind of hoping that Rebooc would go with Bob (since Rebooc was following him) and they'd have a ""Han and Chewie"" sort of relationship. It'd be great to see a gnome and kobold bust out of some bushes spewing fire and whatnot at some future protagonists.

BuffaloWizards,3djjvx,Bakkidza,2,Fri Jul 17 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"So near the end while they were talking about the Tambok's special friend show, Rob referred to it as a 'campaign'.

BuffaloWizards,3dkpp0,dokoattack5,13,Fri Jul 17 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"To separate reality and fantasy a bit more. When people RP as humans they tend to make power fantasy characters of themselves. While you can still do that as a dwarf or elf, it's still different because you know that being a dwarf or being an elf is not the same as being a human.  This isn't too important to URLive, but it is important if this is a world I want to build games in. In a game like LoM, it's very important for people to build characters and not just build themselves. You need to detach yourself from the character and so avoiding races like humans is a good start and one of the reasons I avoid having them in everything I create. If I'm doing a project based around RP, it's better if the user makes a character and not just play themself."
BuffaloWizards,3dkpp0,Rurikar,3,Fri Jul 17 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"More than anything, I was just pondering on the fact that most people call those (Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, etc.) the ""human"" races. It makes sense to not use the word at all, as people tend to feel more empathy for characters that are distinctly human, and not applying that name probably helps to make things like Porcs just as likable as Elves or Gnomes."
BuffaloWizards,3dkpp0,Skipper2399,5,Fri Jul 17 03:53:55 2015 UTC,Honestly I think that Kobulds are the most likable race in URealms Live so far
BuffaloWizards,3dkpp0,Nihillo,5,Fri Jul 17 05:56:49 2015 UTC,My favourite race so far is probably Porcs. I always love the fantasy races that have a culture where they follow the most physically strong person. That and the fact that their smile emote is one of the greatest things ever.
BuffaloWizards,3dkpp0,Headcrabhat,6,Fri Jul 17 08:16:53 2015 UTC,"You could say that Tall Dwarves and Dwelves are essentially human, it's just that they are a subculture, instead of a major species. Also, Rob prefers to keep players out of their comfort zone (e.g.: being human) in order to encourage them to actually roleplay as a character, so we may never see them use the word ""human"" in the show, but like I said, there are hybrids that are practically human."

BuffaloWizards,3dhz4y,warrantica,23,Thu Jul 16 12:43:51 2015 UTC,That's our Rufio!
BuffaloWizards,3dhz4y,Rurikar,14,Thu Jul 16 12:52:45 2015 UTC,"Warning: spoilers ahead!  I like that Rufio is not insane (only) for insanity's sake. Sure, he might not be of average mental stability, but should he himself take all the blame for his psychotic delusional actions? I don't think so, and here's why.  It started with Gwyneth. The strong, lawful leader, the Sun to his sky, the love of his life. Hoping to make Gwyneth notice him, or at the very least see more of her, he decided to join her squad.  Speaking of squad, you know what the squad is to him? The leader Gwyneth, whom he's madly in love with, her bearded (ex-) boyfriend, her incapable ex-boyfriend, her other ex-boyfriend - who, by the way, is a freaking gnome. Then there's Fizzy and Ian, which will later be dead, one died in a horrible fire, another by their own teammates.  And what did they do to honour Ian's death? No funeral. Not cremated. Not even buried. Just a half-assed boulder over his crushed body, with Bob's arrow still protruding from his chest. And nobody was there except for himself, Xavius and Dave.  Dave, of course, Dave, the seed of all his fantasy. While there's a million reasons why Gwyneth can't end up with him, there's Dave, always giving him this little shimmering hope that he is the boyfriend in Boyfriend's Quest. When asked if he could write Rufio as Gwyneth's boyfriend, Dave answered ""Oh, man, I am psyched - so into that right now!"". You can just picture Rufio reading fanfics over on the Magic Forum, dreaming about fighting side by side with Gwyneth in battle, then come home to his happy family - their happy family.  And then everything came crashing down for poor Rufio in front of the Silver Mine Mountains. Prior to this, he just learnt from Dave that, in Boyfriend's Quest, he's not the boyfriend. He's merely one of many disposable boyfriends with no emotional connection whatsoever. At that moment the foundation upon which his delusions were leaning on was broken down. Dave is no longer giving him hope. What does NOT help the situation is the fact that Gwyneth kept going on and on about her past string of lovers. A gnome, an elf, a half-elf-half-dwarf, an elf with a winter coat complex, and so on. It must seemed to him that Gwyneth will date anyone - anyone but him. To him, it must mean that Gwyneth is purposefully, constantly rubbing it in his face - in a ""I would prefer to date a GOBLIN over you!"" kind of way. Now, Gwyneth is intentionally making him feel pain - why not make her feel the same! He pulled out a knife and stabbed Gwyneth - you know the story.  But, even then! Instead of being in pain like he expected, Gwyneth got up and didn't even freak out! Hell, she stopped Kallark from killing him on the spot! Even when he stabbed her right in the damn stomach, she didn't give him the attention! Not to mention the heart-changing staff Dave was carrying around messing with his head.  So who's to say that his actions are without motives?  Note: just realised that I spent the whole morning drawing and writing this. Worth it!"

Based on the last show, having that extra week really helped improve the show's quality. If this continues to be true, then I think it would be best to continue this way. And who knows? Maybe after a few months of experience, we can return to a weekly show and have the same quality that we saw from the Sunswords."
BuffaloWizards,3djt6h,reaperlord14,28,Thu Jul 16 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"If Rob could go a day without mispronouncing something, it would be a sign of the coming of the apocalypse."

BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,ILoveURLKeepItUp,18,Thu Jul 16 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with 1. It's so much extra time consuming to create and adds nothing to the game. If they go left instead of right, what changes? The viewer at home doesn't get to know what was left or right and there is no chance we will ever return. How does the illusion of choice make real choice? I don't feel this is important in any way other than tricking the audience into thinking the campaign is bigger/longer then it was. How is week 1/2 better than week 5 because of choice? Week 5 was suppose to have choice, but because of time constraints, we redid the map to remove a cross road part. There is no advantage to choice in my mind for the players as they have limited information and make the choice in 60 seconds and move on. If anything, it makes for weaker campaigns because then I really have to find homes for the assets that get created rather than always making new assets.  I can't do 2. Fog of war is too painful to do in tabletop simulator and is just clunky. Again it adds almost NOTHING of value since it didn't even hide the map. You can still CLEARLY see the map, it just hides the tiles. Not something I plan on spending extra time and resources on when it can't be done properly in tabletop simulator.  I won't do 3. URLive is building the game while you guys watch it. It's also a principal key to keep things fresh. Sorry, but if every week we have a Sorcerer using Fog of War, the campaigns going to get samey. I plan on actively creating classes/races/changing things up until I have a good pool that won't get stale.   I won't do 4. I don't want the Knock Knock event to start instantly. I want it to happen over time. Week 1 we had the problem where donation events all triggered at once. Also I can't fundamentally lower the costs of events without doing more events and I can't do more events in the time frame we have without making them less impactful or rushing through the campaign. The first campaign was 2 boards and the guys barely did 1. Every event is optional, so this is kinda a moot point. We didn't fight the ogre and the donation goal was there and clearly that was one of peoples most favorite parts of the stream. I disagree with your sentiments about free to play entirely, you are comparing this show to free to play games. People donate to events to support the show, they BUY things in free to play games because they want said things. We aren't ""playing a game"" as much we are very much performing a show and in the middle of the show we provide the audience with things they can donate towards that will cause a shift in what happens in the show.  There wasn't a single donation goal in the last campaign that was important to the flow of the show and if you feel otherwise then you should realize that's the purpose of the donation goals, to add impactful and fun elements that wouldn't of been there. Any single goal that you felt was ""mandatory"" is your perspective of not knowing what could have been. You are underestimating how much is planned and how much gets played out.   The Meta Ytts weren't needed they were a cool battle change.  Phineas didn't need to be in the campaign, there were plenty of other NPC characters and storylines that could happen.  Deadbones didn't need to be sprayed by a funk, he was just an interesting problem for him .  The flame spooky wasn't important to the arch of the story, he was an optional boss.  The puppies didn't need to be there, the children were already in the maze.  The ogre didn't need to be battled, you don't even know what that encounter would of been because of it.  Gwyneth didn't need to be stabbed.  Finally. This show needs money.   What I ask of everyone involved is so great, that I need to be able to pay them to do it. If you want to argue that donation events are not the way to go, I would slightly agree with you, but they are clearly a great way to fund the show right now and I have tried many different things in the past to support a project. A live show has a lot of hype and excitement to it and that drives people to support more. We have almost a dozen people that are needed to make this happen and I have never done a project this physically and mentally draining. I'm having trouble organizing it to be every week like I wanted to and not every other week. I do not want to ever have to sell the show or bring in sponsors because that gives them the ability to dictate things with it in the future. So many good creative works get ruined by corporations. So far the fanbase is on the same page of me and if they do dry up like you predict, then the show is doomed to fail regardless of what I do because it needs the support of fans. The biggest thing we need to do now is work towards just improving the overall quality and production, working on building up a better community hub and ways to introduce it to new people, I don't plan to overhaul how we do donations though because so far they have been working great."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Rurikar,5,Fri Jul 17 03:47:19 2015 UTC,This may be a far off idea. And you may have already done it. But have you tried suggesting the features you want/need to the devs directly or on their forums?
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,zzCratoszz,2,Fri Jul 17 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"No, I do not want to suggest things that are for a show I'm building rather than improving the game. Long Term, Tabletop simulator feels like it's a good starting place for UR Live, but down the road I should build our own platform to better improve the show."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Rurikar,3,Fri Jul 17 05:19:14 2015 UTC,"I would like to see some donation events that aren't necessarily good or bad, but can go either way depending on the dice. Some of the best things that have happened are because of the dice, so it would be fun to see some events that are the same way.   The downside is it could feel like it would be forcing the randomness to much and not letting it happen like it is now naturally.  This is why I just watch and not create."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Danke4President,4,Fri Jul 17 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"I would like to see some donation events that aren't necessarily good or bad, but can go either way depending on the dice.   That's an interesting idea, I mean some already work like that in the sense that how impactful they are, are in fact based on dice rolls. It would be hard to implement them in a good impactful way if there design has to be purely die based."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Rurikar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:18:01 2015 UTC,"Could try small events that are based on the dice, like for one turn the guys do double damage or take double damage, if it's a 20 they can kill in one hit or something, or if it's a 1, Justin dies. (Sorry Justin, just an example)"
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Danke4President,3,Fri Jul 17 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"Whether or not the choice actually occurs is inconsequential. The value resides in the audience's belief that a meaningful choice was made. It supplies a sense of realism, irrespective of whether or not both roads lead to the same outcome. I suppose a good example of this would be one of those old choose-your-path books, that has the reader flipping to different pages to check the outcome of decisions. Even though many of the choices scattered throughout the book end up sending them to a single page, the reader still feels the gravity that comes with an actual choice. I completely understand if it takes too many resources from more meaningful content creation, and can appreciate it if you disagree entirely. Just wanted to share one element that I really appreciated about the first couple maps that I missed.  Yep. Pretty much thought as much. It's too bad the fog of war isn't easier to cope with.  Understandable directional choice. It only occurred to me as something to comment on because it appears apparent at times that the constant switching of assets becomes taxing in terms of keeping track of mechanics. I want to apologize for my poor comparison to freemium games, upon reflection, it really wasn't a very strong one to make. I appreciate that the show needs money. Hell, I am honestly ECSTATIC that you have found a way to play a table-top-game and get payed for it. It is amazing to witness, and brings a smile to my face to think about it. I understand you don't want events to occur instantly, I was thinking more along the lines of the goal that activating the Crystal Boss had in the dwarf campaign - it still allowed enough time for some humorous RP before it was activating (licking it and such) but it did not seem to drag on in a way that some of the other goals have. I understand that none of the events are essential to the continuation of the campaign, the show must go on, after all. I just wanted to express my opinion that the massive non-combat donation goals are often paired with RP that leaves time for the donation goal to be met, and that sometimes this gives the impression that, until it is met, we'll be staying riiiight where we are. The freshest example of this was the $1500 stabby donation at the end of the sunsword campaign, in which Deadbones then RP'd with each individual prisoner. Some of the donations were made with names like ""Just Do It Already"" (or something similar). These were the bits that I ended up fast-forwarding through, and so I wanted to share with you why I thought that was.    All in all, I think you guys are doing an amazing job. I hope what I wrote originally did not pluck any nerves.   I'd like to conclude by saying thank you, guys. Really love the show, and thank you Rob for taking the time to both read my post, and respond to it. Cheers."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Rurikar,9,Fri Jul 17 05:30:17 2015 UTC,"I just fundamentally disagree with the illusion of choice. If the choice has no meaning, I don't want to offer it. I hate games that tell me to choose things that don't matter, it's insulting. For players it's the same thing, I'd rather spend more time building a better linear story then splitting my time to build multiple choices of lesser stories. Nothing is gained from me making choices that don't matter, but a lot is lost. It will also make it so in the future when players do have a choice of going left or right, there must be a real reason for it.  Thanks for all the kind words!"
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Nihillo,2,Fri Jul 17 05:46:06 2015 UTC,"There wasn't a single donation goal in the last campaign that was important to the flow of the show (...)  Gwyneth didn't need to be stabbed.   On that topic, I was wondering, what would have happened if we didn't have that event? I imagine Rufio would need to find some other outlet for his pent up anxiety and frustration."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Rurikar,8,Fri Jul 17 08:34:24 2015 UTC,"No. Nothing happens. That event didn't need to happen, it was just there as a story element."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Nihillo,2,Fri Jul 17 09:11:44 2015 UTC,"Ahh, so it wasn't like, a secret character trait that only came to light because we had him stab Gwyneth, he was just a guy who liked Dave's novels, but then he retroactively became crazy when we got the event to happen. That's interesting."
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Rurikar,3,Fri Jul 17 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"Right. If the event didn't occur, you wouldn't have known as it wouldn't have mattered."

BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,firebolt8900,4,Fri Jul 17 11:28:54 2015 UTC,Sometimes unmet donation events make everything much more fun. Remember the gems we got from chat not doing the me smash now event?
BuffaloWizards,3dkdli,Makydog,3,Fri Jul 17 03:08:34 2015 UTC,"About number 4, whether or not that goal was met wouldn't have mattered either way. Rob mentioned in the BTS for that campaign that if chat didn't get that goal then Pat would've taken the gang on a walk and they all would've gotten ambushed by the dwarves. This also applies to many other moments in other campaigns both past and future. No donation events have ever been required to progress the story, and unless there are dramatic changes to the formula they never will be. If a goal isn't met, it doesn't really matter, the story will just go slightly differently."

BuffaloWizards,3dh4bv,FungiCharizard,8,Mon Jul 20 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends if he wants to do a lot of grinding but still get the full enjoyment of the game or just straight up wants to play any game no matter what it is.   I also think it depends on if he wants to play a game with Fakemons or not so he know what's actually a Pokemon and what is fan made.   Personally I think for a regular play through I'd recommend Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver (the rom since it's hard and expensive to get)  or play a newer Pokemon game like b/w 1/or2 or X/Y because they are less grinding in my opinion and easier to play.  Also I don't think a rom hack would be necessarily good because they are usually more difficult to learn especially for a first Pokemon game, but they are definitely fun to play no doubt.  I don't know for sure what he's like to play but that's my advice for a game."
BuffaloWizards,3dh4bv,lindeloef,9,Thu Jul 16 08:11:46 2015 UTC,"For first timers I would second HeartGold/SoulSilver.

Rob always has a plan to trigger events, but having Deadbones in the wagon made setting up the encounter much much easier.  There is no doubt in my mind if worst came to worst, Rob would randomly interrupt RP by yelling ""all hail Colin the Behemoth"" and combat would have started. Jakelad would have probably lullabied a prisoner and thrown him in the river, and ran off, since he has to live for the Dingo Isles."

BuffaloWizards,3dekvq,ChillyWizzy,8,Wed Jul 15 17:40:49 2015 UTC,Sorry going to set tdis as temp admin. My dad is in hospital and I will not be able to moderate the wiki for the next few days. Not sure whats going on there but hopefully its fixable by an admin and doesnt require server access
BuffaloWizards,3dekvq,Plorntus,2,Wed Jul 15 22:29:24 2015 UTC,I hope everything goes well Plornt. We promise not to completely ruin the wiki!
BuffaloWizards,3dekvq,Clarkmeister,6,Thu Jul 16 01:54:18 2015 UTC,"For the wiki admins/mods  If it continues to happen you may have to make it so only approved users may edit.  Really shitty thing for anyone to do, but you can revert the pages back from their history, it's just super tedious. (unless there is a mass revert option)"
BuffaloWizards,3dekvq,Aqueous_BlackFire,5,Wed Jul 15 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"I can easily revert most of the edits, but /u/Plorntus is the only one who can ban. I understand the reasoning behind not giving mods full access, but there should be a tiered system (sysop/opadmin, for example) on the off chance that he isn't around.  EDIT: It seems he is doing this on an interval. First attacks started at 23:40, and the current was around 13:00"
BuffaloWizards,3de6rw,unpluggedriot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:59:58 2015 UTC,Totally missed opportunity for /u/deadbones5 to name the puppy Fenris.

BuffaloWizards,3ddl6q,texascsm,10,Wed Jul 15 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"Dankie was kinda like that, he had a Windu Morning Star, which deals damage equal to half the number the player rolls, and Plunder The Booty which allows the player to deal double damage, they cancel out, so Dankie was able to consistently deal 4 damage.  In all seriousness though, he had the potential of dishing out 20 damage every turn, plus critical effects, this was balanced out by the fact that he was a retard, and got himself killed due to his single mindedness."

BuffaloWizards,3dbqgq,HBKKurt,2,Wed Jul 15 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"Lieutenant Surge is not a hammer though, it's a mace or a morning star. Thanes must use two hammers."
BuffaloWizards,3dbqgq,Nihillo,11,Wed Jul 15 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"I thought Rob said Thanes could use maces? maybe that's incorrect. But it also hasn't happened yet so even if Rob said it during the last character creation, he could change that. But the idea of there being two makes perfect sense. Maybe they were the weapons of the original Thane or something similar."
BuffaloWizards,3dbqgq,dokoattack5,2,Wed Jul 15 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"yes yes yes, you are correct!"
BuffaloWizards,3dbqgq,mateymitch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:36:06 2015 UTC,According to the official art by /u/Radioactive_K it's a mace. Also I think it's really cool that they both have it. It helps with the timeline too (when we get a bit more information).
BuffaloWizards,3dbqgq,Toadslayer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"The weapons give to Thanes are actually maces. They're refered to as hammers on the cards, but the weapons given to the race itself are maces"
BuffaloWizards,3dbqgq,Nihillo,3,Wed Jul 15 02:25:51 2015 UTC,"I went back and checked the character creation for this campaign, the Windu Morning Star comes up, and Rob says Roamin can't use it with Draggin Lightning, so that means it's not categorized as a ""hammer"".   See, the problem is that Rob keeps using the words ""hammer"" and ""mace"" interchangeably throughout the whole video, it's very confusing, but I guess that's just him being ""bad with words"". The cards say ""hammer"",  Windu Morning Star isn't compatible, so I'm still going with my statement that Lieutenant Surge is not a hammer."
BuffaloWizards,3dc1cc,Imagine_Baggins,9,Wed Jul 15 02:30:53 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see this, but I don't think we would be able to at all for a while. It seems like everyone is too busy with URealms Live to do much outside of that"

Rocket League is a good game, and i'm sure some of the Buffalo Wizards will play it, but they would not make videos of it, simply because it's a competitive, serious, need to focus on game."

BuffaloWizards,3dcp7t,The_Raven81,3,Wed Jul 15 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"Well, concerning ""Canon"" stuff, I'd like to quote the URL Wiki, if I could.     If something said or done seems to conflict with pre-established canon, please do not bother the players or Rob, about it. Due to the very nature of Unforgotten Realms Live things can change quickly and are often made up on the spot. As Rob has pointed out, basically any continuity can be explained away with ""A Wizard did it"". Please keep this in mind and don't argue with the Game Master.     With that, I don't really take anything that they say in terms of lore or the nature of things like ""he said this once, it must be solidly true."" Because the next week it could easily no longer be true for whatever reason."
BuffaloWizards,3dad14,unpluggedriot,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:14 2015 UTC,Just want to say that I love how the show is evolving. Seems like every week gets better than the previous!
BuffaloWizards,3dad14,Absynthexx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"I still think the 1st week was the best. Hugging a cobolt until it befriends you and it follows you on the journey, going to a cave of fish monkeys, having Deadbones betray his teamates and having the sun cleric that was supposed to protect him lock him up in the cell, Roamin abandoning his party when their dead was certain, Coe trying to stop him with a rolling fog, Roamin surrendering and then Philipe exploding the fog, letting Deadbones out and he escapes with Roaming. it was like out of a movie!"
BuffaloWizards,3db6pq,onefinegent,6,Tue Jul 14 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"What if the cave in the Nuren campaign is just Silvermine Mountains in the far, far future, and all the skeletons are just old prisoners."

BuffaloWizards,3db6pq,Overhighlord,4,Tue Jul 14 23:46:20 2015 UTC,I just assumed the Porcs in the bushes had killed them or driven them into the mine (and they closed the door after them).
BuffaloWizards,3db6pq,TheNamlessGuy,3,Wed Jul 15 00:26:38 2015 UTC,It was a rarely used side entrance.
BuffaloWizards,3db6pq,Makydog,2,Wed Jul 15 00:12:37 2015 UTC,Gwyneath still seemed surprised that no elves were there and leaving a gate that lead straight to silver mine mountain with zero guards seems quite stupid on the elves part. It's a plot hole that won't bother me too much.

BuffaloWizards,3d6zax,btg99,19,Tue Jul 14 00:52:04 2015 UTC,This makes me a lot sadder than it probably should.

He was the most competent character of the entire campaign and he lost everything except for the puppy, which he would have lost if not for that 20.

Good job for you making amazing art that can convey such emotion, and damn you Rob for making such an emotionally scarring ending. Btw I'm still crying what have you done to me.

BuffaloWizards,3d7pf0,Vongeo,10,Thu Jul 16 05:16:44 2015 UTC,I definitely saw the connection this campaign... It seems to me that when he became party leader that Rob was channelling his inner Timmy... Maybe that's why he reappeared in this campaign. This campaign appears to be setting up the storylines for the futures (with this Phineas=Timmy the Evil as well as the Rebooc=Coober theory)
BuffaloWizards,3d7pf0,DwightSchrute47,9,Tue Jul 14 04:30:07 2015 UTC,Phineas is obviously Timmy the Super Nice Guy. :P

BuffaloWizards,3d7pf0,Kylesmomabigfatbtch,4,Wed Jul 15 23:30:46 2015 UTC,I think Phineas is just Rob's way of playing the game while also DMing it.
BuffaloWizards,3d7pf0,Lovelandmonkey,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:22 2015 UTC,I think NPC's from both series really reflect each other because they have the same sort of roles as far as the roleplay goes. Like whenever a NPC points out the player's absurd actions it's the same dynamic as Eluamous freaking out at Schmoopy.
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,HCJustin,36,Mon Jul 13 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"I had an idea for a magic spell, a bit hard to explain, but here it is.  You pick an amount of damage, from 1-20. Whatever number you pick, you have to roll above that on the dice to hit.  For example, if Romain used this spell for 10 damage, he would have to roll a 10-20 on the dice, and if he doesn't, the spell fails.  EDIT: I made a card for it if anyone is interested. https://i.imgur.com/bCQziQM.png"
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,firemaster,7,Mon Jul 13 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"That's a very cool and versatile ability to have, and it has a very cool risk/reward aspect to it!  If you haven't already, post it in the card idea thread!"
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,Tscenzurra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:08:41 2015 UTC,Very OP.
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,BatmanInMC,5,Tue Jul 14 05:44:44 2015 UTC,"It really is not, because if you pick a high numbers like 18-20, you would have to roll those to cast the spell, and if you get lower, you completely miss."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,v12a12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"You can choose a lower number and roll to get a very high chance of a hit, which breaks the typical RPG combat style they're using.  It lets you choose, for example, a five. At six or nigher, it's half as likely to fail, and does a good amount of damage.  I do like the idea, but the scaling might need some tweaking."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,JaingStarkiller,2,Wed Jul 15 05:19:26 2015 UTC,Maybe you have to roll double the damage to make it? I also think it should be once per combat. That's not a spell you want spammed.
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,Hi_mynameis_Matt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:34:23 2015 UTC,"Now this I can get behind.  I also think we could add a higher stamina cost (like the spell backfires or something) the further away from the targeted number the roll is. i.e. a 2 is rolled when they were rolling for a 14 or something, and they take an extra 5 or so stamina damage in addition to whatever other negative effect Rob might give them. Just my thoughts."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,JaingStarkiller,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:38:09 2015 UTC,"Considering it is a spell, it could be changed to once per combat (and have an added buff), or making it so that it is can be the only action you can do on your turn."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,v12a12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:35:05 2015 UTC,Please explain?
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,firemaster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:43:05 2015 UTC,"10 damage is a lot of damage. This spell basically gives you a 50/50 chance of doing that. 5 damage is pretty significant, it's more than most of the basic weapons that miss pretty often. 75% chance of doing that."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,Hi_mynameis_Matt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:33:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of spells already do 7-10 damage though. Sure, some are short range, and some are once per turn or per combat, but generally spells are pretty strong. It'd only be really overpowered when combined with a spell or treasure that lets you reroll, and even then, it'd be pretty easy to balance."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,Amaranthyne,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:53:27 2015 UTC,"x*(20-x)/20, the best choice is 10 to deal an average of 5 damage. But this spell is more than average damage, you can choose 8 on an 8 health enemy to have higher chance to hit, or a 15 on a 15 health enemy in very urgent situation. Good spell idea."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,RedstoneGate,13,Wed Jul 15 04:11:08 2015 UTC,What made you decide to have a more articulate voice for Bob when he is not around the prisoners?
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,Clarkmeister,14,Mon Jul 13 21:35:42 2015 UTC,Probably because that voice would've killed his throat by the end.
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,Lovelandmonkey,3,Mon Jul 13 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"I think that's what it was, cause in the early bits of the campaign he keeps it up even when he's not around prisoners."
BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,QuiteAwareWereDying,12,Tue Jul 14 04:19:14 2015 UTC,"This question is for Justin specifically.  If you were able to write Dexter into the campaign, what type of character role do you think he would best fill? Ally, enemy, or boss?"

BuffaloWizards,3d69mq,Kylesmomabigfatbtch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"IIRC Rob accidentally showed it off in one of the URLs. The bottom of the puppet window has a numeric listing for their Stamina, nothing too fancy."

The Tambok stuff comes to mind as an example of this.  Another. How many characters do you have currently locked away, no need to discuss them, I am more wondering how often a new character idea comes up and how long you might sit on one before using it.

BuffaloWizards,3d32r8,cellojake,13,Mon Jul 13 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this theory.   (Spoilers for YouTube audience)  My idea is that Coober was pretending to be a Kobold Prisoner to get access into the Silvermine Prison. Of course it's impossible to know why he would want to do this, but Coober is an enigma and is always up to shady stuff. This is also explained when Rebooc refuses to escape and insists on staying with the jail carriage. Clearly he wants to get inside the prison.  It can also be the explanation for why Rebooc can only say ""kobold"" even though most Kobolds know that it is just a giant inside joke. It's believed by most non-kobolds that the only thing they can say is ""kobold,"" and it's possible that Coober could believe it as well. Thus, the only thing that he thinks he can say is ""Kobold.""  The other reason would be that if Coober would say anything other than ""kobold,"" then his disguise would break, and others would recognize him.  Coober will probably appear when the party does a campaign inside the Silvermine Prison"
BuffaloWizards,3d32r8,Tudd,5,Mon Jul 13 04:11:35 2015 UTC,The disguise part (kobold) makes so much sense! Also I think the party will kill him inside the prison but he will return later because of a horocrux.
BuffaloWizards,3d32r8,Tudd,4,Mon Jul 13 04:13:30 2015 UTC,"That's where I disagree with you.  I highly doubt that the party will ever be able to kill him, let alone even get a chance to. And even if the guys do get the chance to fight with Coober, there's no way they would be able to kill him. Coober would be too powerful and too smart to be defeated. He would most definitely escape in some way.  However... If they do kill him, I would love to see him die and become a book. It's been proven that there are many books about this mystical wizard, so there is a good chance that they may run into a book version of him."
BuffaloWizards,3d32r8,Mobius1B,5,Mon Jul 13 04:21:19 2015 UTC,In nuren BTS Rawb said he is virtually unkillable but even if they did somehow kill him he has 8 billion horcruxes and would just respawn.
BuffaloWizards,3d32r8,Tudd,2,Mon Jul 13 04:26:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. But instead of horcruxes, the guys could use the book excuse route too. They have tons of options, especially with this ""book race"" idea."

Another possibility is that Gwyneth's baby was destined to become her boyfriend in the timeline as he killed her baby...     Last possibility is that is important for his book person, because his book person will now want to kill all of Gwyneth's other boyfriends, and if Tambok's special friend show is indeed the land of the book people if Rufio gets invited he'll try to kill her Boyfriends."

BuffaloWizards,3d0xjq,Caprikel,3,Sun Jul 12 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"The second one is plausible. As was mentioned on the brainstorming stream, they would probably be immune to magic but not be able to cast it. If they kept those facts, then they could be magic immune from the outside, but they can't cast magic because they react violently to magic on the inside."
BuffaloWizards,3d0xjq,Cat656,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:25:11 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought about the cookies. I thought it might be that once he was made the leader the staff started to infiltrate his brain to allow Coe to persuade him when he's ready and because the orge's magic resistance his brain tried fighting it off causing him to have a seizure.   Or perhaps the staff effected one of the heads but not the other causing the brains to desynchronize with each other.

BuffaloWizards,3d0wcz,Railith,4,Mon Jul 13 03:46:34 2015 UTC,"Not only is Rebooc Coober backwards, but Rebooc the Kobold also wears a similar hat to Coober. My idea is that Coober pretended to be a kobold so he could get into the prison. Who knows for what reason, Coober is an enigma. But it also explains why Rebooc could only say ""Kobold."" It's a common rumor that ""kobold"" is the language of the Kobold, so maybe Coober thinks he is actually saying stuff in that language. Either that, or if he says anything else, his disguise would break because he would have to keep up the voice."

Jake is less than a day from Theta Squad lands.  He could easily have ended up with Lt. Surge somehow and gave it to Kinney for some plot reason.  A gift, a bribe, she stole it from him, etc.    JDI -> PH has the potential for a narrative snarl.  Jake is in these lands, he leaves, the group he joins (Bocoe Pirates) then decide to come to these Elven Lands for... reasons... and Kinney either dies or loses Lt. Surge.  As I was writing up up PH -> JDI is the obvious solution for narrative reasons I recalled Roamin's Band of Thieves.    Doesn't it seem odd to anyone else so many campaigns feature this corner of the world?  Two campaigns about the defenders.  One campaign about thieves sent by Nisovin to steal from the Elves.  The Bocoe Pirates are working for Nisovin.  So it is entirely possible the Bocoes were sent by Nisovin to the Elven lands either before RBoT or after them once they returned from JDI."

RBT(Roamin Band of Theives) i cannot exactly say it is completly after Sunswords but its close since we see Gwyneth and Dave.  As for MGP(The Many Gobos of Pat) is after RBT but there is no exact placement in the time space since it showed K4 on a magical telivision that can possibly be a re-run of that event or if anything MGP is another whole universe and because of magic reasons.  Porc Hunters and JDI(The Jewel of the Dingo Isles); Porc hunters is close after RBT since Dave shows up and he mentions Gwyneth's well being and how they are attacked by bandits, even though it was not the orignal bandits from RBT but, it could mean that there defenses have been weakened from the RBT group, enough that they have been dealing with constant bandit issues. JDI has a conflicting time placement of being before or after Porc Hunters since it has not been established whom has the Lieutenant Surge First.  and finally the Nuren Campaign, cant be placed on the timeline other then being somewhere during Nisovin's Lifespan and who knows what that is since Rob hasn't establish that or any details about Nisovin   and i hope that make sense to everyone XD"
BuffaloWizards,3d0wcz,bobruffains,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"RBoT must have taken place atleast 2-4 years after Sunswords as Dave would have need a lot of time to train in the art of Sun Clerics.  Porc Hunters would have had to be a year or two after RBoT as Dave would have need a while to reach the Captain rank and become a better Sun Cleric.   Jake would have not taken long to get out to sea, so he would have taken his first opportunity to please Colin by sacrificing the Bocoe crew. So I feel JoDI happening shortly after Sunswords.  I also would say MGoP would have not been long after RBoT as K4 has not gone completely crazy.  My timeline: Sunswords > JoDI > RBoT > MGoP > Porc Hunters.  Nuren? I have no clue where that fits."

BuffaloWizards,3d18qu,Clarkmeister,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:06:07 2015 UTC,You have to get rid of the break donations because they don't exist anymore.
BuffaloWizards,3d1og0,HItlers_Mate,21,Sun Jul 12 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"Meta Ytts (no i guys) transform into all sorts of things, not characters themselves. This means that while they may look and have properties of characters that do exist (because they are meta) the in game characters do not know this nor do they notice similarities, this is purely for the guys at the table and audiences. The timeline doesn't matter."
BuffaloWizards,3d1og0,Rurikar,17,Sun Jul 12 23:41:55 2015 UTC,No meta is literally in their name. It was just a cool fan donation event that didn't pertain to the canon of the show.
BuffaloWizards,3d1og0,Domokl2,9,Sun Jul 12 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"In my head the Meta Yits only looked like the campaign characters to us the viewers, but to the in-game characters they just looked like random people."

BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Imadoc91,16,Sun Jul 12 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"It amazes me how many people are so upset that Rufio wasn't killed on the spot.  Gwyneth is my super lawful power champion female character right now. She had her heart and mind being thrown all over the place unknowingly by Dave and she relied on the only thing she know to be true, the Law."
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Rurikar,19,Sun Jul 12 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"I think it goes to show you how well you made people truly care for these characters.  When we first met Gwenyth with the Band of Thieves, she was just this unstoppable tank that killed everything in sight, and the audience hated her because, if nothing else got changed, she would go on to kill Felipe. Now in this campaign, you showed her softer side. She was dating Deadbones' character, seemed like a pretty nice person when compared to her past interpretation and considering the idiots she was dealing with. She was even pregnant, and it's kinda difficult to hate a pregnant woman. Then this asshole comes along kills her baby. No, he came along and took the amazing, unstoppable Gwenyth Sunsword and made her weak, and just like how Deabones' character felt, the audience wasn't going to take any of that shit, nobody hurts Gwenyth!  So yeah, that's at least how I think people were feeling."
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Makydog,6,Sun Jul 12 20:30:34 2015 UTC,No I agree with you. I also liked that deadbones had a complete and total mental breakdown and just walked off into the woods.
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Koltiin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:53:36 2015 UTC,That was well written. I'd like to see more classic D&D alignments-- and maybe some new unique urealms live ones.
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,TinyLongwing,2,Sun Jul 12 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't think the classic alignments would work well here. 'Good' and 'evil' really are too restrictive for these characters and stories in most cases."
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Koltiin,2,Sun Jul 12 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"So make new ones! Lawful good could be revamped into ""tryhard niceguy"" and chaotic neutral could be called ""stupid idiot mode""  I picture this sort of thing being more for documentation than anything, though. And they needn't be set in stone. They're best as a starting point that can be sought after for guidance than a strict rulebook, just as Rob displayed above."
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,cellojake,6,Sun Jul 12 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"Book race is not canon yet, but there is always a first."
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,cellojake,2,Sun Jul 12 16:37:38 2015 UTC,Also with Rob bringing the special friend show up it seems like a really tongue in cheek relation that he would do.
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Domokl2,2,Sun Jul 12 17:06:02 2015 UTC,I think the special friend show is in no way related to the conceived book race. (according to another post) it seems like it is a mortal kombat esque type special episode. Kombat = tambok but jumbled
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,cellojake,8,Sun Jul 12 17:34:01 2015 UTC,Uh did you hear his end of stream spiel. He said Tamboks friend show is in a place when you can exist as long as there's a story about you. Pretty strongly points to the book race.
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Domokl2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"Because it needs to be ""actual"" people, but does not have to be a PC. It cannot just be a random harpy or skelephelk. While the book race is a good point, i think it points more towards a fight arena with the whole kombat-tambok thing, and the fact its a friendship show."
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,cellojake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:35:24 2015 UTC,It's probably a fight arena where tambok puts mutilple story charachters(people from all the previous campaigns) and makes them real using those wisps they mentioned in the lore stream.
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Azurillkirby,2,Sun Jul 12 18:38:53 2015 UTC,I took it as a book race thing because he said it could be any character as long as they could have a story written about them towards the end of the stream.
BuffaloWizards,3d0t6t,Zenn_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think you could argue that its like mortal kombat but with the books, and when you win they go back into book form. That way you can fight to the death without death."

BuffaloWizards,3czjde,RealPieIsAwesomeful,10,Sun Jul 12 05:26:48 2015 UTC,I think you are exactly on point with this.
BuffaloWizards,3czjde,dragonsblood912,9,Sun Jul 12 05:27:34 2015 UTC,"Friendship is also a special finisher you could do in Mortal Kombat II and 3, with a reference to it appearing in Mortal Kombat X.  Plus death is irrelevant in the MK universe since story-wise they keep pulling people out of the grave (sometimes literally) and they do magic or other stuff to bring people back.  Not to mention several people canonically die each game (due to the nature of the MK tournaments) only to come back fine in the next.  Also wouldn't be surprised if the full name is ""Latrom Tambok"", lol.  But if it were an actual tournament, 20 contestants would create an odd number of brackets.  First round would be 10 matches, second round would be 5... only way to even that out is if 4 more contestants were added.  Assuming it's even a tournament that would go in-depth to begin with."
BuffaloWizards,3czjde,Sorenthaz,3,Sun Jul 12 12:51:39 2015 UTC,"only way to even that out is if 4 more contestants were added.    Like for example, Roamin, Deadbones, Coestar and Justin?"
BuffaloWizards,3czjde,thenewdreamer,3,Mon Jul 13 01:39:24 2015 UTC,Good point.  Though they could have multiple versions of themselves in it.  But I guess for the campaign they'd be new characters maybe?
BuffaloWizards,3czjde,Sorenthaz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"Annnd they may get to choose which 4 characters are dragged into the show, while also being able to choose any character they originally played from the pool."

BuffaloWizards,3czjde,wilwarland,3,Sun Jul 12 23:18:58 2015 UTC,"I thought the gobbos stream was great, but thats just my opinion. It had some really amazing moments."
BuffaloWizards,3cyurd,OneManArmy77,29,Sun Jul 12 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"I love how Deadbones character went from a confident, cocky dwelf to a shell of a man after multiple heavy, emotional moments (his pot puppy becoming a hell hound after a fireball buuuurned HIS MANLY BEARD, his ex/ gf/ its complicated love interest gets STABBED by a teammate after leaving her side to attack a porc, losing his future child, having delusions of a funk whose fucking with his head, his adopted (yits?) kobold children leaving with the other kobolds after his paternal feelings started to surface. By the end, Karllark was just tired, sad, and done. It totally makes sense for him to just go on a solo journey to reflect about his feelings as a man, an elf, a dwarf, and a father.  Totally want to see what happens to him in future campaigns. Will he mentally deteriorate because of the funk or will he return to being the confident lady killer that loves all women (dwarven, elven, and kobold)? Overall awesome campaign. 10/10"
BuffaloWizards,3cyurd,angelhng,8,Sun Jul 12 04:26:01 2015 UTC,"I think Deadbones just generally makes and RPs characters who end up having a lot of development! (or at least ""increase the suspense"" of the show.)   Blinky sacrificed his body to make it easier for the others to escape. (Also his whole dad drama) Squinks got pissed at Yumi and betrayed everyone, only to come back and break out at the last second. He was also partially responsible for Phillipe's great sacrifice, which definitely added a lot of drama to RBoT's climax. Ca-Rell gave up any chance of having a normal life AND being a leader of the redeemed Theta Squad to lead and pacify Porbo's Porcs. Kinny was hugely responsible for getting rid of Jakelad - which ultimately led to the huge mess with the fancy bottle... only to get it back. Fucking hilarious. (Justin definitely helped make this part amazing though). Madelyne lost a surrogate parent, 2 Scotts and a Summer and ultimately grew to BARELY tolerate Terrance. I can't think of any major development for Pryor but he was generally kick-ass and kept everyone informed. And Kallark was explained above.   Not trying to say he's better than the others/the others are worse, but I REALLY like what Deadbones adds to the shows. :)"

BuffaloWizards,3cyurd,artisanpartisan,14,Sun Jul 12 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking this campaign is the prequel to all the summer ones. No recurring characters die, so while regardless of that it could be the future, it could be the past. Gwenyth goes back to the town for a while after the loss of her baby, where the gnomes/dwarf attack in Band of Thieves. Dave re-practices his magical skills. Hell, for all we know, in a future campaign, Dave could have wizard AND sun cleric abilities."

BuffaloWizards,3cyurd,pure7777,2,Sun Jul 12 12:56:00 2015 UTC,"Now, a more in-depth message; I started watching an hour late, but in the second hour, the stream already had me in the state of ""holy crap this is great"".  Every encounter had good times, nothing was too long or too short, and the encounters made me laugh. Everything from the roleplay to the actual fighting was fun, and nothing got too stale. This is the speed of the game I like, not to fast, not to slow. (And if it was to slow, I was having too much fun to notice).  Now, another thing that got me was the paradox. I was super scared of Phineus or Gwenth dying. Especially during that last enounter, I was just like ""oh shit, oh fucking shit"" as everything happened. I really liked everything introduced in that stream, and didn't want it to be non canon because of a silly mistake. Luckily, everything went fine and was amazing.  Now, the one thing I would have done different, directed at Roamin.  You chose Fenris, I would have chosen Dankey. But, that's just me enjoying watching an idiot bang his head on a wall. I accept your decision ;D."

BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,Toadslayer,5,Sun Jul 12 08:12:48 2015 UTC,If I had to take a guess the Nuren Campaign is at the very least after Roamin's Band of Thieves because we meet a pivotal character in that campaign. Coober. Rob said that Coober has thousands of Horcruxes (or some other magic bullshit) that makes him immortal. Why is Coober important to this? Because in this weeks campaign we meet a nice little Kobald named Rebooc.  Rebooc backwards is Coober. Rebooc went into the silvermine mountains with a group of pissed off porcs. Rob has said the Silver Mine Mountains are going to be the last campaign of the summer season.
BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,ShepardCom,2,Sun Jul 12 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"Wait, so Coober is Rebooc? Does he escape and turn into human-like form? I did not see that. That is some creepy shit going on."
BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,pyrotrap,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:28:03 2015 UTC,There is nothing canon yet that makes Coober and Rebooc the same person but it seems likely
BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,Marshy301,2,Sun Jul 12 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason as to why Porc Hunters can't be before Sunswords? I'm thinking Porc Hunters could be before because of the fact that Gwyneth mentions wishing Chilly Whizzy was there in Sunswords but Chilly Whizzy wouldn't have ever proven himself to be useful (being just in lousy old Pheta Squad, who never accomplished anything prior to Porc Hunters) so I doubt Gwyneth would both remember who he is and want him with her."
BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,Makydog,2,Sun Jul 12 15:26:45 2015 UTC,Porc Hunters is after Sunswords because in Sunswords Phineas hasn't started his Cabalist training yet.
BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,Marshy301,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, forgot about Phineas completely"
BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,Mega_muncher,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:12:56 2015 UTC,Also gwenyth had to get Fenris the dog
BuffaloWizards,3czwd0,Zenn_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:03:46 2015 UTC,didnt rob confirmed that it was after Roamin band of thieves? i have my smaller theory of after the Roamin band of thieves campaign the town they were at was in bad shape left open for attacks by bandits hence why dave was transferring prisoners but idk  Edit: and i think coe said as david that he is not interested in her he is way to invested in his fan fics
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,NeoFire99,15,Sun Jul 12 03:16:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's really awesome. Plus with Rob saying that it's a place where you live as long as you have a story about you is really cool. I honestly believe that if we can get 20 of those tickets, it means we can finally see the book people from the lore stream we had 2 weeks back."
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,iBread3,6,Sun Jul 12 03:22:19 2015 UTC,"Almost definitely, but Rob could easily trick us into thinking that- oh wait, no tricks! I really wish Roamin chose ""Roamin the rank 11 Paladin"" as his choice. But Fenrir is actually a really smart first choice."
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,RandumbDude,9,Sun Jul 12 03:44:24 2015 UTC,Rob said anyone with a story about them can exist in that campaign.   Book people confirmed
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,wilwarland,6,Sun Jul 12 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's going to be the books. I wonder if the Yits or whatever they are called have some relation to them, like they are their ""raw"" form or something like that, their ability to turn into other people, (even people who are not there!) reminds me a lot of the books."
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,Nihillo,3,Sun Jul 12 03:55:32 2015 UTC,One question I have about it is: will the characters who make it through with a ticket be in the campaign as audience members?
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,dokoattack5,3,Sun Jul 12 03:40:26 2015 UTC,That would be awesome if it happens.
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,pexium128,2,Sun Jul 12 07:07:08 2015 UTC,"I wonder what would happen if you picked one of roamins characters from the many gobos of pat campaign, Would you do both of them because conjoined twins or just cut them in half?"
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,TeamAquaAdminMatt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:36:08 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a campaign that has 40 characters from the previous shows. I think it's going to be the ""big campaign"" before the 1 month break"
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,tak4n,2,Sun Jul 12 09:46:09 2015 UTC,"No, Rob is making the campaign before break the Silver Mountains campaign. He said so in one of Behind The Scenes videos."
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,AStar_,2,Sun Jul 12 13:34:26 2015 UTC,Probably not as it is nearly impossible to get 19 tickets by the end of summer. The silvermine mountains will be last with 1 group battling their former selves
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,Mega_muncher,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"They can get multiple tickets per character, it just so happened that only Roamin was the only one with one"
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,vagabond01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:00:33 2015 UTC,the only way for that to even possibly happen is if they all (meaning each pary member) made it through each campaign with a tambok ticket if they did that they could do it in 5 more campaigns more likely they will only get 1-2 a campaign in which case it might take which means somewhere between 10-19 more campaigns which puts it late this year early next year. Also rawb said he wants silvermine mountain to be the climax of the summer season.
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,Mobius1B,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"If Rob wanted to speed up the tickets, it could be  donation event at the end of the stream."
BuffaloWizards,3cz8xg,Poundsmiley,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:30:05 2015 UTC,"I'm almost sure the ""guests"" will get slaughtered. Or something along those lines."
BuffaloWizards,3cyj4b,Bjorty,12,Sat Jul 11 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying the greater emphasis on role-play. The show right before the break had so much combat, while the comedy really shines most in the RP."
BuffaloWizards,3cyj4b,Ningamer,6,Sun Jul 12 00:45:37 2015 UTC,They have really grasped combat and understand how to fully utilize spells etc so combat does not last as long. The RP in this campaign was just astonishing and funny the whole way through.
BuffaloWizards,3cyj4b,CapybaraMadness,2,Sun Jul 12 00:57:19 2015 UTC,I'd be fine with the stream being every two weeks for this quality.
BuffaloWizards,3d0e1e,Viziter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:04:11 2015 UTC,"You could do this now, re watch the campaigns and write down all the stats"
BuffaloWizards,3d0e1e,JeffreyIndy,2,Sun Jul 12 13:44:39 2015 UTC,"Possibly on the next campaign I will, though I was more hoping there could be an automated way with the program rob is using"
BuffaloWizards,3d0e1e,MoreOne,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, giving Rob even more things to control during the campaign is a mistake. Not because he can't do it, but because his attention is better placed elsewhere in the game.  It's definitely something anyone working on the wiki can use."
BuffaloWizards,3czijm,TruthInContext,5,Sun Jul 12 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"It obviously has to happen before Jewels of the Dingo Isles because Jakelad learns the Kobolds song. That's just given off the bat.  I'd say PROBABLY before Porc Hunters, because I would say that Roamin's character from then probably wouldn't have been as reluctant to have Phinneus go on an adventure after his badassery in that campaign. (Also him not knowing any spells or anything)  I don't think there's anything though that overtly ties it to Nuren, Band of Thieves, or Gobos of Pat, at least in terms of placement in respect to those campaigns. (I don't remember enough about Gwenneth and Dave in Band of Thieves to make an argument about that)"
BuffaloWizards,3czijm,Azurillkirby,3,Sun Jul 12 06:12:27 2015 UTC,Or it could be before Dingo Isles because Jake... you know... dies in that show. Also it is definitely before Porc Hunters because they said Phinneus hadn't started training to be a Cabalist yet.
BuffaloWizards,3czijm,pyrotrap,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:24:44 2015 UTC,Do we know that he died? I thought all we knew is that he was dragged underwater.
BuffaloWizards,3czijm,Azurillkirby,3,Sun Jul 12 19:41:10 2015 UTC,He was never dragged underwater... Deadbones killed him then he fell off the boat when it was shaken and his body sunk.
BuffaloWizards,3czijm,pyrotrap,4,Sun Jul 12 20:30:46 2015 UTC,right right I'm just a fucking idiot. How did I forget that?  My brain somehow told me that Jake sacrificed himself to the Behemoth... yet nothing of the sort happened. What the fuck is wrong with me?
BuffaloWizards,3czijm,Azurillkirby,2,Mon Jul 13 07:59:59 2015 UTC,"It's either before Roamins Band Of Thieves, or before The Dingo Isles. I'd say before Roamins Band Of Thieves for a few reasons.  First, a few characters have different abilities, such as Dave. Now, this doesn't mean they couldn't have learned them by the point The Dingo Isles happened, but that campaign (the third one), seemed to happen shortly after the second and first.  Second, Jakelad seemed to be in a pirate crew a while, but he wasn't in this campaign. Joining right before the third campaign is again, a very short time to be a pirate.   And reason it can't be any further than the third campaign, Jakelad dies then. Unless a magical shark resurrected him, I'm pretty sure he's dead dead."
BuffaloWizards,3czijm,pure7777,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:06:23 2015 UTC,I'd say Sunswords is probably the first campaign in the timeline.
BuffaloWizards,3cz27i,brawl0,9,Sun Jul 12 02:08:54 2015 UTC,This week's by far. I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
BuffaloWizards,3cz27i,Cheakz,7,Sun Jul 12 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"Easily this week's show. That is not to say that the others have been bad; but none of them came close to the breadth of entertainment genres that this show did (action, comedy, romantic-comedy, tragedy, weird LSD trip).  In particular, Deadbones's story arc, character development and role-play were top-notch.   I suspect I will remember this session fondly for a long time to come, and I will probably go back and rewatch it."
BuffaloWizards,3cz27i,fealos,2,Sun Jul 12 03:31:49 2015 UTC,I couldn't get to this weeks show so I am answering when I am behind one campaign. However within the campaigns I have seen Porc Hunters. I loved deadlines story ark and the ambiguous ending 20.

BuffaloWizards,3cyc6w,Godheadweasel,2,Sun Jul 12 04:22:17 2015 UTC,There could be that too.  But I think it'd be a fun addition to the Lumberjack class to make it more fun/interesting since classes all get passive traits now.

BuffaloWizards,3cwqzj,SML6,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:32:26 2015 UTC,No* Tricks  *subject to change on whim
BuffaloWizards,3cvj5i,DeltaDaedalus,2,Sat Jul 11 03:12:30 2015 UTC,"I hope these get utilized! However, I fear they likely wont without a way to have compact coin values. Perhaps including a 1k gold bar in the future would be helpful.  These would fit well in the treasure-sack container in the Tabletop Sim program."
BuffaloWizards,3cvj5i,Koltiin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:13:46 2015 UTC,"I thought about doing the 1k, but really in practice it would exist for a few seconds and then be traded for smaller coins, so I decided screw it.  I don't really expect Rob to use this, but I certainly will, and I'm happy to share!"
BuffaloWizards,3cvj5i,Diftor,2,Sat Jul 11 07:28:53 2015 UTC,"nice work. I guess a 500 gold coin would be helpfull, cause most items cost around 500 or 1k gold so this would reduce the amount of coins you would need for transactions and it seem that Rob is constructing the shop-items arount 500 gold steps."
BuffaloWizards,3cvj5i,Nihillo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:21:19 2015 UTC,But then there's also the potions and basic items that cost less than 500 as well.
BuffaloWizards,3cvj5i,Cat656,2,Sat Jul 11 16:25:39 2015 UTC,That's why you can have both 500 and 100 gold pieces.
BuffaloWizards,3cvj5i,Koltiin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:16:18 2015 UTC,Congrats!! These got used in stream like 5m ago!  Rob used it like a coin flip. That's a function you could totally add if you were to reskin the quarter mechanic.  --EDIT--  I was wrong. They DO coin flip. This became obvious when Rob was attempting to stack them and they flailed and went crazy. They were promptly replaced with poker chips or something for ease. I was sad to see them go :c   I guess no I should change my recommendation to make a non-flippy version xD and reskin a flippy version to have a butt for tails
BuffaloWizards,3cvjf5,Railith,17,Sat Jul 11 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"I can't get over ""Gnome Mercy."" That is absolutely hilarious."

BuffaloWizards,3ctu0g,wilwarland,3,Fri Jul 10 19:15:27 2015 UTC,Post it anyways. I wanna see.
BuffaloWizards,3ctu0g,Koltiin,5,Fri Jul 10 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"Alright I'll give it a go, but I'll probably still miss stuff.  I like how Pat and Desnuttes have the same expression on their face. I really don't have much to say about Pat as he was the least rounded character in the group so there's not as much to work with. Moving on.  Scott is a big angry wolf with red eyes, who still looks cute as hell next to Maddie.  Maddie is exactly as I had imagined her in my head. Totally got that rebellious teenager with daddy issues thing going. I like the studded leather jacked and glamourshark gloves. She's also doing that casual lean back with a disgusted look on your face thing, but is patting Scott at the same time.   Looking at their clothing and hairstyles, they all more closely resemble traditional depictions of elves than goblins. Of course, as the only one not actually raised by elves, Pryor is the exception to this. Even his posture: the rest of them stand upright, but he's kind of bent over (I know he has a bad back, but it just makes him even more goblin-like). Of course, I love his kobold slippers too.  I like that Terrence and Warren are wearing the same belt. That dammed leaf that he kept refusing to part with is stuffed into it. Grapple gun at the ready to take Warren exactly where he didn't want to go. I also like how Terrence is leaning on Warren, letting him take the weight, and that Warren doesn't seem to even notice or care. I also imagined Terrence with that exact expression on his face ~90% of the time. The cracked goggles are a nice touch.  I had imagined Desnuttes carrying the swammies in a jar in his pocket, but it is so much funnier to imagine that he wore them around his neck the whole time, proudly for all to see.   I like that Dankie has a comb on a leash. ""Map"" in hand, he looks like he's about to set out on an adventure, but you just know he's probably going on a great expedition to the tree in the backyard.  I think that's it for now, but if I notice more I may post again later."

He is definitely a handsome fae elf and Madelyne got that angsty, teenage GAWD, look down and i love Pryors dead beat dad with slippers look (its hilarious to imagine him doing shift style punch and moving like the wind in those slippers).  altho..I did imagine the hob goblins to be more round and pudgy lol and I'm a little surprised tht you didn't include the donkey :DD  as wonderful as always"
BuffaloWizards,3ctu0g,angelhng,2,Fri Jul 10 21:14:05 2015 UTC,"altho..I did imagine the hob goblins to be more round and pudgy   Yeah, but you have to assume that Pat is controlling their diet, which would bring them to more elven proportions"

Madelyne has teenage attire and a sneer with some overdone makeup.  Prior clearly has a bad back and some ""juice"".  Terrence is missing and eye and has his staff and warren has a somewhat positive demeanor and grapple gun-- especially love how they're placed so that each twin can draw their weapon from the other's side.  I love how Desnuttes is sitting as if he were meditating, along with his special necklace and swammie bottle.  Danke has his map, pet comb, stache, and looks like the perfect manchild goblin.

After the campaign was over, Rob told the guys that the puppies were fire immune, and wouldn't have died in the fire (instead they would have turned into Fire Puppies and become enemies).

BuffaloWizards,3cub6s,ShepardCom,19,Fri Jul 10 22:30:06 2015 UTC,He would be a fool to use his sword with the coin when he has a bow that's absurd. The bow basically lets him do a 50/50 chance attack that deals 30 damage.

DAVE IS THE PROBLEM BUT ALSO THE SOLUTION.  Holy shit. My mind is broken.     EDIT: Inb4 Dave often switches places with book Dave unknowingly and drama ensues. I feel Coe would pull that off perfectly.
BuffaloWizards,3cub6s,noac,6,Sat Jul 11 18:07:34 2015 UTC,I guess paradoxes could also be explained away with an unreliable narrator. So if Dave dies it could actually just be that the narrator telling the story is misinformed.

BuffaloWizards,3cx8hy,ImFromCanadaSorry,6,Sat Jul 11 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"There could be multiple races of ogres and whatever race Grungor is only has one head. Perhaps jungle/desert/snow ogres (Jogre/Dogre/Snowgre perhaps) and/or some other variety could have 2 heads.  It could also be like the inverse of conjoined twins. So most ogres have 2 heads but Grungor only had 1. Nisovin never did choose the most uhh, conventional... friends and followers.  Maybe Ogres all have multiple heads in the womb but Grungor ate his other head in the womb and only one developed.  You'll never have to worry about something not being possible. Life finds a way."
BuffaloWizards,3cx8hy,VectorGambiteer,2,Sat Jul 11 16:22:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Ogre was actually a Troll ;)... Or Two headed Trolls.

BuffaloWizards,3cvdv0,graymorality,2,Sat Jul 11 03:09:08 2015 UTC,"well, it might  It's still not set in stone m80.  Rawb said in the character setup video that it will happen after the first campaign, unless there's some plot point that he really likes, in which case he establishes that it's before the other campaign. So it could really go either way."
BuffaloWizards,3cvdv0,acwarren492,2,Sat Jul 11 09:45:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure sure he said it was going to happen before the first campaign, not after. That's why Coe's character is ""immortal"" in this campaign unless something really bad happens, in which case this campaign is a fiction or a paradox. He's playing an NPC that was in the first campaign, so he can't die this time and still be in that campaign."
BuffaloWizards,3cvdv0,drgnmstr128,5,Sat Jul 11 16:16:08 2015 UTC,Rob is going to try to make it before. To have Phillipe he would be actively making it after.
BuffaloWizards,3cvh8c,Nessrocker,12,Sat Jul 11 02:53:53 2015 UTC,I don't know why you think anyone wants to be the leader? None of these guys want to be the leader.

It was clever on your guys' part to make him the most important character, yet not the leader."
BuffaloWizards,3cvh8c,baronale,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:12:20 2015 UTC,I'd say give it to an NPC and then kill off the NPC in the first combat and make whoever closest leader. Just to throw some things in the air.
BuffaloWizards,3cvh8c,TimetravelingGuide,5,Mon Jul 13 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"Dude they choose which ones they feel like leading, so really this doesn't matter lol"
BuffaloWizards,3cvh8c,SkullytheKitty,4,Sat Jul 11 02:55:19 2015 UTC,It's not like they're all clamoring to be leader. Justin in particular has stated he's almost scared of being the leader which is why he hasn't done it yet. Plus there would be a chance someone could be leader two weeks in a row. There's really no upside to this.

Even as someone who doesn't play on the LoM server I'm hyped about the Bandit and Templars update. I can't wait to see what else is coming up.

In the hypothetical scenario of choosing UR Live or any of our other series, URL wins by a long shot   (this was taken from his ask.fm page)  I imagine he's interested in it, but if he's short on time, then we probably won't be seeing it for a while."

BuffaloWizards,3cgypg,5ilver42,11,Tue Jul 7 20:51:49 2015 UTC,Some of the notes of the melody feel a bit off. Super cool though silver!
BuffaloWizards,3cgypg,Rurikar,4,Tue Jul 7 21:43:47 2015 UTC,Do you mean the pitches of the notes or the rhythm of the melody?
BuffaloWizards,3cgypg,Rurikar,7,Tue Jul 7 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Couldn't answer that if I wanted too (I'm not familiar with music terms that well), I just mean the notes sound ""off"" ."
BuffaloWizards,3cgypg,Makydog,3,Tue Jul 7 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"haha okay. It's likely not exact to the official theme and I don't think there is any sheet music or midi of it out there to reference. So, I'm just going off my ear and aligning what I think is close to older medieval modes.  I think its ""off-ness"" might actually come to sound more ""on"" once I continue with the track the way I intend to. I've been experimenting more and more with cinematic style scoring where they play themes and do variations on them where they are identifiable as the same melody but play different notes at points.  Thanks for listening though and thanks for the feedback!  Edited for Spelling"
BuffaloWizards,3cgypg,Alderdash,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:08:43 2015 UTC,"I think what you're hearing is him jazzing up the rhythm a little bit. Could also be that he used a different instrument to play the melody, which always messes with things a bit.  Edit: Just listened again couple more times, it's definitely the rhythm."
BuffaloWizards,3cgypg,Makydog,4,Tue Jul 7 22:07:30 2015 UTC,"Aye, it's the rhythm, but if anything it's the opposite of jazzing it up: the original uses a rhythm which is something like a crotchet tied to the first note of a group of triplets (I say something like because it's nearly half 11 and I'd need to sit down and use more brain to be 100% certain), where the remix is using something closer to a quaver-semiquaver rhythm instead of the triplets.  It gives you a much crisper, formal sounding pattern, instead of the broad, relaxed triplets.  (I'd be curious as to what 5ilver42 was using to input the music, it's not unusual for software to smooth out the pulse to what it assumes you mean instead of what you're actually doing...)  ...and with that I'll put my work hat off and go mess around on LoM or something!"
BuffaloWizards,3cgypg,_Han,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see that. I just tend to use ""jazzing it up"" as a general term for remixing it as opposed to swinging it, which is a very bad thing for me to be doing!"

BuffaloWizards,3cfoiw,Crag_Mire,8,Tue Jul 7 17:33:12 2015 UTC,I feel that DvZ and LoM don't necessarily need to be apart of the URLive wiki Forums (I was under the impression that it would be just URL) but I'll run with it being for everything Buffalo Wizards Related.  Subject to change:  DvZ   Jimmy Chatter (generic forum section) Tactics and Tutorials Mason's Guild - Map Building (sticky for submissions)   URLive   URLive Discussion Card Submission Fan Game Nights   LoM   The Kingdom of Dong Dank (main LoM stuff) Forum For Each of the Districts   Buffalo Wizards   General Discussion I don't know if the community could handle a issues/feedback forum but it's common in other communities I'm in

The new forums will have subforums for old content I have done and become the new officially places we talk about those projects, but again I wouldn't expect this new forum until next summer.

BuffaloWizards,3cfoiw,final_Crucible,3,Tue Jul 7 18:06:09 2015 UTC,"I was a general mod on a few different runescape forums back in the day, we had 3 main sections: Announcements (official news, updates, upcoming content etc and discussions) On Topic (this is where people would post questions, fan art, etc.) and Off topic (This was where people could post whatever they wanted, such as playing other games together and general off topic conversations). Each of these were divided into subforums for each specific topic under the main header.  Under on topic one of the subforums was 'Rants' this was where people could complain about the game and just generally bitched at each other in regards to game content, forum design, moderators, whatever. We had three mods with fairly thick skin who could take insults on that board and they relayed any complaints they deemed worthy to the general mod team.  The off topic section had a sub forum called 'forum games' this was where people could shit post, spam and do whatever they want with no banning repercussions unless they were being offensive, i think this is a very important part as it decreased a lot of the spam and flaming on other boards and if someone did spam outside of there, they would be referred to the board with a warning, but if they continued they would be banned from that specific board.  We also had a form of upvote system, each user would get 20 'upvotes' per 24 hours on each board, the fact that the upvotes were limited meant that generally only quality posts stayed on top for an extended period of time and having no downvotes gave each post a fair chance at being seen."

BuffaloWizards,3cag7p,TheSilverRaven,10,Mon Jul 6 11:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'm reminded of the Dwemer from Skyrim/Elder Scrolls, how they had this steampunk esqe technology in a time period where the rest of the world had not advanced that far. It would be kinda cliche but it could work with some forgotten/extinct race in URlive in the same way. From the lore building stream we know Deadbones was thinking something similar with the ""Skygyptians"", and I think it would definitely need to be a new race to use this tech. Dwarves and gnomes using this tech has been done to death in other games and literary works. Maybe a race of mole people, deep underground. Their advanced tech and weapons could be countered by their limited vision, it could be quite fun if rob uses the fog to hide a lot of the game from the guys."
BuffaloWizards,3cag7p,Avacrux,9,Mon Jul 6 12:21:32 2015 UTC,"Gnomes are supposed to be steampunk, so it's not impossible that it won't happen at some point."
BuffaloWizards,3cag7p,NickGraves,4,Mon Jul 6 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"First, this could be an interesting idea, although as a community member, you could also help the Urlive team by giving them some major ideas :P   like what type of classes would they have? Races?  i don't think we should jump into the Future, more of have like a Dwarf/elf/human city/village that's really great at inventing and they are sent on a quest to do something for this village."
BuffaloWizards,3cag7p,Blake_852,2,Mon Jul 6 11:18:22 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much exactly what I was thinking. Maybe not even restricted to Dwarfs elfs and humans. Infact, you'd think it would be the gnomes."
BuffaloWizards,3cag7p,Blake_852,2,Mon Jul 6 11:55:04 2015 UTC,well i was just saying some races off the top of my head
BuffaloWizards,3cag7p,greduan,2,Mon Jul 6 12:21:12 2015 UTC,"IMO, you could have like a super advanced race that is hidden and their technology starts getting spread like 200 years later or whatever.  So the steampunk race would be super hidden and the guys would play using their abilities in pure secrecy, or they'd find remains of an old establishment of this civilization. Something like Atlantis for example."
BuffaloWizards,3cag7p,graymorality,2,Mon Jul 6 18:04:25 2015 UTC,I came up with a Steampunk-ish idea that works. But less steampunk and more inventor type thing. https://www.reddit.com/r/BuffaloWizards/comments/3ag201/card_submissions_the_many_gobos_of_pat/csh1yzj

Just to clarify, I wasn't trying to dismiss your idea altogether, just pointing out the major time gap between the two periods.  I think it could still be done, it'd just have to be a with a very advanced civilization and there'd need to be specific lore around it to explain it. It'd have to be a unique and rare occurrence like one specific secluded town or village that has almost no contact with the outside world, otherwise this advanced technology would be more common place."
BuffaloWizards,3caglc,doubleupomega,7,Mon Jul 6 11:08:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think that really has to do with lieing, but more has to do with wanting to have a tough persona. IMHO Jo Krisstal just didn't like pot puppies."

BuffaloWizards,3c8r09,Mercury321,13,Mon Jul 6 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"He unconfirmed it, as it would be limiting and forced if they all had to agree with each other. He said URealms (live and original) is totally out of that timeline, but you can still choose to think of DvZ as the aftermath of Dong Dank.  Of course I might have missed him re-confirm it."
BuffaloWizards,3c8r09,Adiosa,3,Mon Jul 6 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense to me that DvZ is after dong dank and dwarvern civilization of the realm all get overrun by zombies, and that the former rulers of a powerful-ish city escaped with there peasents, stopped calling them peasnts, then ran out of blood and with no kingdom where no longer dwarfs. They then all die even with the Lord's above average combat ability and the cunning use of flamethrowers and rainbow staffs.  As for Urealms live I always thought of it as something going on during the prosperity* of dong dank. Its also fun for roleplay, as you could say my great great half porc half elf grandfather was a swashbuckling cabalist who once sailed the Drink with some dwarfs and found treasure, or that the real not illusion Nisovin is sending out these illusions to contract people to get him shinies."

BuffaloWizards,3c8r09,Makydog,11,Mon Jul 6 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"UR Live/Lom/DvZ/and UR are just all separate universes. While I pretend like they are connected, they aren't.  If we revisit games like LoM/DvZ in the future, they will most likely be in UR Live Universe, but all the existing lore/characters will not be canon.  The reason Roamin is in a bunch of my shows is simply because I have included Roamin in all of these projects at some point."
BuffaloWizards,3c8r09,Rurikar,2,Tue Jul 7 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"I realized that was why roamin pops up so much. I also never claimed that there was any connections between the various iteration. I even tried to make it clear in my responses that they are all different Roamin the Paladins. The point of this post was to note that after Heatherfol mentioned the stories about Roamin the Paladin, your four big universes all had a Roamin the Paladin, even if he is fictitious in the URL universe. I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear."

BuffaloWizards,3c8r09,brogus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:03:50 2015 UTC,"By themes do you mean like there could be something in the style of LoM, i.e. there's a city that's ruled by a group of lords that like messing with its citizens, even when it means breaking their own laws, or do you mean more the lore side, i.e drinking dragon blood gives you immortality, or the existence of the popular hallucinogenic drug known as swammies as we've already seen?

Especially if the players can temporarily disable it via silver (were-creatures) or fire/acid (d&d trolls).  Easier would be to just make it so, that they have to kill one in one turn or else he is back to full health (ofc adjust max hp to the damage the group can put out, so it is actually possible)"

BuffaloWizards,3c78u1,final_Crucible,2,Sun Jul 5 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"Well, judging by what we saw in the behind the scenes stream from a while ago, they are planning waaay ahead, but the actual preparations for the streams, including the creation of the art assets, the encounters and other adjustments, are done in less than a week.  Rob mentioned that, in the future, he would like to be one campaign or two ahead, in terms of preparation, just so that they don't have to worry about not getting it done in time. That is something they can do during their breaks, prep work.  Anyway, I think the show will be back next week."
BuffaloWizards,3c78u1,Nihillo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think you are analysing the situation enough. The amount of work that goes into URL vs another game is a a great margin. For URL they need to make sure that the stamina overlay, the puppet pals, the card overlay(shows what the card is) ,the donation events and many other things need to all be set up before hand. Also, Saturday, the day they normally stream was the 4th of July, which is a holiday in the U.S, so the normal crew probably wanted to spend time with their families or just have a break. All in all, I think streaming most other games compared to URL is a day off because there is a lot less stress involved."

BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,Tuskinton,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"Short, pointy ears and loves to build things sounds awfully like a gnome."
BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,ZombiDog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but lore-wise they're completely dfferent. My issue has been making them different in the ways you mentioned."
BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,ZombiDog,2,Tue Jul 7 13:18:27 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting idea, I've never really heard of the shorter elves ever being in a role play setting. But the ability that you described sounded pretty similar to the Okagnoma Gnomes ability, so it'd probably need to be changed."
BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,GuysnDolls,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:01:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a problem I've been having is making them differ a lot from gnomes. What if they had the ability to turn accessories into weapons for a limited time?"
BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,ZombiDog,2,Mon Jul 6 00:04:21 2015 UTC,That would make them a lot more interesting to play. Hitting things with weaponized accessories would be really funny.
BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,InfelixTurnus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:07:23 2015 UTC,But maybe a pain to keep track of?
BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,RandumbDude,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:26:02 2015 UTC,It would be hard to keep track of which accessories have been weaponized. Maybe the little elves could have an ability that is centered around consumable items?
BuffaloWizards,3c8q8l,Skipper2399,2,Mon Jul 6 19:54:59 2015 UTC,"This sort of category is kind of taken up by Gnomes. It could work though, perhaps if you span it towards House Elves like in Harry Potter? Less technical, more 'Wild Magic' types but still servants and definitely memorable. Plus they are an 'ugly' race which Rob has said he finds more interesting from a roleplay standpoint."
BuffaloWizards,3c7pmn,Dishcat3,5,Sun Jul 5 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool idea! Rob said on the behind the scenes video that the giant skeleton was just something he improvised to end the campaign with, but there were hints that the giant skeleton guarding the treasure could be revisited!"
BuffaloWizards,3c7pmn,Avacrux,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"I know it was improvised but Rob has said many times, Everything that happens in the show is canon. I think rob should revisit  the Skeleton."
BuffaloWizards,3c7pmn,Toadslayer,6,Sun Jul 5 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but this makes no sense. Firstly Bopen isn't a giant skeleton, he is normal humanish size. Secondly Bopen is hostile and evil. He would never let someone of good heart just walk in and take his gem. Finally the Dingo Isles and Bopen's Lair are in completely different places. Bopen keeps his treasure in his Lair which is in a cave on a large body of land. Whilst the treasure of the Dingo Isles is in a temple on an island.  Any link we can make between campaigns is very helpful in figuring out the campaign, but this theory has too many things that don't keep with the confirmed law to make sense. I'd say it's back to the drawing board for linking Nuren and Dingo Isles :/"
BuffaloWizards,3c7pmn,Toadslayer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:54:31 2015 UTC,He could of been enlarged at the time of Dingo Isles campaign or small at the time of Nuren. A Wizard did it! He could of turned Evil with Magic or the treasure could of changed him. He could have multiple bases or he could of moved.
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,ScottishNutcase,16,Sat Jul 4 22:43:34 2015 UTC,"HALF-LIFE K4 CNFRMD!!!1!1!!1! /s    seriously though, how did rob find all of this? I know he asked for a timestamp for all the 4s rolled on the sub, did he also make one for conspiracies"
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,Mranth0ny62,25,Sat Jul 4 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"It's really not that hard I think. Took me maybe an hour to write, you just look for a bunch of things similar together and make them fit nicely. You watch enough of these types of silly movies and it's easy to parody it yourself.  Also I'm pretty sure this thing is riddled with mistakes because of how terrible I am haha."
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,Rurikar,26,Sat Jul 4 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"I've just noticed that 3+3+7 is not 11, after watching it 4 times lol...  your voice is really hypnotizing rob"
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,Maquatagi,32,Sat Jul 4 23:00:19 2015 UTC,Yes but 3+3+7 = 13   13  1 + 3 = 4  4  K4. The Kurse is real.
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,josh__ab,25,Sat Jul 4 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"Its in a video, and Rob said it is 11, then, 3+3+7 is 11 in the URealms World. This lore is Official!"
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,MNick,7,Sun Jul 5 01:20:50 2015 UTC,This video gaslighted me.
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,NickGraves,3,Sat Jul 4 23:06:19 2015 UTC,"after watching it 4 times   4... K4... 3+3+7 = 11 is false. You know what else is false, the fact that Hitler had a buttstache (a mustache on his butt). Butt starts with B. B is the first letter of bones. You know who has that world in their name? Deadbones! And Deadbones is the lord of the undead. Is K4 a zombie?  The Curse of K4 is inflicted upon any who mention his name. Names are used by us humans, and we have brains. You know what dyslexic zombies eat? That's right! Brians! Bad Luck Brian is a popular meme, just like Good Guy Greg. Greg can be an anagram for Good Rain Eat Garbage. Garbage is found in trash cans. Trash cans are the graves for junk... Guess where zombies rise out of. That's right, their graves. You know who's last name is Graves? Nick Graves.  In conclusion, we can tell that not only is K4 a zombie, but he is controlled by the Lord of The Undead, Deadbones, and Deadbones also has control over Nick Graves. But why them? K4 is a powerful attacker, which explains him, and Nick Graves may have figured out how to turn people undead. Deadbones wants this knowledge for himself, so he has killed and re-risen Nick Graves so he would keep it under wraps. But how did he figure this out? And why did Deadbones leave these small tracks?!? Well... If you don't believe me, just watch!  ((I don't know where I was going with this. At first, I just wanted to poke fun at how it took you four tries to notice, then I discovered K4 is a zombie, set out to make sure, and figured out Nick Graves is one too! Then I made a reference to some strange song...))"
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,SML6,2,Sun Jul 5 00:58:10 2015 UTC,it is... in hexadecimal
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,dkurniawan,2,Sun Jul 5 10:08:24 2015 UTC,It works in base 12. So maybe Rob just likes to use lots of different number systems whenever he feels like it.
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,TheLastSparten,7,Sun Jul 5 12:01:35 2015 UTC,There Is a slight design flaw in that one of the options is a red shirt. Combining the unlucky nature of K4 and the Redshirts from star trek only chaos can come from this!
BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,Bjorty,8,Sat Jul 4 23:15:47 2015 UTC,"I think the best part is because of the way rob said it, I actually thought 3+3+7=11 until i re-watched the video! XD"

BuffaloWizards,3c59rd,psaepf2009,4,Sat Jul 4 23:34:57 2015 UTC,The shape of the D20 face? A triangle. 3 sides. 3 corners. 3+3+1 = 7. Lucky number 7. What does a 7 look like? Like another triangle. 7+7=14. The 14th letter of the alphabet is the letter I. Illuminatti confirmed.

BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,tamashinoerufu,23,Sun Jul 5 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"That... would make sense.  Just having a talking donkey out of nowhere did kind of bother me but this would explain it. These books man... they have too much power over the game. Anything doesn't make sense? It's a book. Literally an in-game version of ""A wizard did it"". XD"
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,sdcSpade,2,Sun Jul 5 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"Didn't it say that most books wouldn't be sentient? Don literally says that ""he just came into existence a few minutes ago"". So he's either something else, or an intelligent book about a talking donkey."
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Godheadweasel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:55:07 2015 UTC,what if in the book Don came into existence at the start of it and said those very same words?
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,TitaniumForce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:42:21 2015 UTC,"Don knows that he came in to existence just then, but to quote cooster: ""He doesn't know he's Mien Kampf"""
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,TheSilverRaven,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:58:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if he knew he was a book or not. He's not sentient. He wouldn't say that he just came into existence. Unless the book is about a talking, telekinetic donkey going through an existential crisis, the character in the book would not say that he just came into existence."
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Godheadweasel,9,Tue Jul 7 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"There's no way Rob ever intended it, but perhaps. I reckon the answer is just ""a wizard did it"" though. I'd be interested to hear what Rob has to say though, as there were no wizards that interacted with Don as far as we know."
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Toadslayer,4,Sun Jul 5 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"The book race itself is an example of a wizard did it, there was a library of books, and then it was enchanted."
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Zephyr300,3,Sun Jul 5 06:16:51 2015 UTC,In the end to be honnest I hope Don is not a book and is just an awesome donkey. That would be cool :)
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Toadslayer,5,Sun Jul 5 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"What if the donkey crushing Dankie caused Dankie's departing soul to be infused into the Donkey. It would explain his comment's about his ""new existence"" since it seems like the Donkey couldn't talk until after it killed Dankie. Desnuttes showed that Hobgoblins can have their soles fused with others even if they're a different race, so isn't it possible Dankie, who is also a hobgoblin, did the same?   EDIT:  If the soul fusing is a hobgoblin trait it would also explain why Pat chose Justin for special training instead of the other goblins, he was a hobgoblin and a prefect choice for a "" vessel"". The only other hobgoblin was Dankie who wouldn't have been a great choice."
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Petertwnsnd,5,Sun Jul 5 22:13:04 2015 UTC,It could be? It all depends. We haven't even established the book people actually existing so yea
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Tripleat,5,Sun Jul 5 02:53:45 2015 UTC,Theres nothing that says donkeys dont talk in this realm
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Nathiex,7,Sun Jul 5 08:52:25 2015 UTC,"That's wrong. Many characters were surprised to see a talking donkey (Heatherfol, Willus). This implies that talking donkeys aren't common."
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,baronale,11,Sun Jul 5 13:38:04 2015 UTC,"maybe they're very shy by nature, Don was just an outgoing donkey."
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,Taters_McShit,3,Sun Jul 5 14:19:25 2015 UTC,"What if its just the fact that donkeys aren't common? For example, they see the donkey and they're like ""Holy shit man, its a donkey! Dude I wonder what its saying!"""
BuffaloWizards,3c5v3j,cj_the_magic_man,5,Sun Jul 5 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"Nope, they explicitly comment on the fact that it was talking, not that it was a donkey."

BuffaloWizards,3c663u,dokoattack5,6,Sun Jul 5 05:07:21 2015 UTC,"I do think the Dwarves and Gnomes need new racial traits, there has been a bit of power creeping with the introduction of the Kobolds, Porcs and Goblins, and the Dwarves and Gnomes are not as interesting as the new races.  At any rate, keep in mind that this is not a video-game, balance and efficiency are not the focus of the show, so it's okay if something is overpowered, Rob can just adjust the difficulty of the campaign to suit the characters."
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,Nihillo,2,Sun Jul 5 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"At any rate, keep in mind that this is not a video-game, balance and efficiency are not the focus of the show   I very much agree with this. This is my opinion. Duel wielding and triple wielding do not have to be balanced at all! Because in the set up Rob could just not put out triple wielding or duel wielding if there are both dwarfs and kobolds. Every card doesn't have to be balanced or work or be fair with every other card, that isn't the point of this game, roleplaying is the balancing force and the DM determines the power of the characters actions during play. Set up min maxing doesn't matter at all since if the players find an OP combo the DM just says no, that doesn't work. Its not like there is a giant rule book detailing every interaction, and I think that is this games main strength!"
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,brogus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:16:05 2015 UTC,Isn't it just natural for some characters / races to be more powerful than others?
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,Taters_McShit,5,Sun Jul 5 14:13:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess. But the problem for me with this is that Triple Wield seems to be literally just a more powerful version of Duel Wield at the moment. Most other racials/subracials can't really be compared to others too well, making it feel more like a matter of preference than one thing being just being flat out better than another.  This was just a slight worry from a potential player of URL."
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,ToriBoshi,5,Sun Jul 5 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"combine that with the kobold 2 dice rolls, and it's way more powerful than tall dwarf"
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,Mobius1B,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:53:32 2015 UTC,Yeah but the chance for a 1 is insane. If I did the math right 30% of a triple wield Kobolds turns will have crit fails which is insane of course there is also a 28.5% chance for a 20 I believe.
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,Avacrux,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:54:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think we will see Triple Wield used on a playable character, it feels to me it was mainly a way for Rob to kill the green skins with the sheer amount of chances to get a crit. It raises too many questions to be used by a player, such as can you only triple wield, or can you just choose to duel wield? How does it stack with treasures or special weapons? If you are playing a kobold with 3 different weapons each with their own effect, its gonna cause a headache working out whats going on with damage, and we know rob would rather that be simplified"
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,Domokl2,3,Sun Jul 5 19:01:57 2015 UTC,Rob already said he is going to give them a racial ability with triple wield
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,awsomeMrlink,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"There is about a 30% chance of a Critical failure on a triple wield due to the way Kobolds work. So about every 3 times you triple wield you critically fail. That seems pretty balanced to me, considering Tall Dwarfs have only a 10% chance to Critically fail if they attack twice. Triple Wield is really risky considering you need 3 weapons and have about a 29.25% chance to critically fail, though if you have 3 weapons that deal 5 damage you can do 15 damage a turn through it which in my opinion makes it balanced."
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,cools8,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:01:05 2015 UTC,well i mean its the same chance to critical too
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,sdcSpade,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:37:33 2015 UTC,"For Kobolds, the chance to roll a 1 is slightly higher than the chance to roll a 20 because you have to take it when it comes. Here's a chart someone made."
BuffaloWizards,3c663u,cools8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"well Kobolds only have a .5 greater chance to roll a 1 than a 20. The same thing goes for non crits they have a larger chance to hit than miss due to them having to take the higher roll. The chance to get a 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 is greater than the chance to get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9."
BuffaloWizards,3c5mnv,Ace8280,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:04:50 2015 UTC,This is all I could think about when rob made the kobolds use swords in their mouths.

The game however, is in Tabletop Simulator, but they use their custom textures for pretty much everything you see. I think that the only thing that isn't custom is the dice."
BuffaloWizards,3c64e5,dokoattack5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:47:44 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the stamina tracker, has Rob ever mentioned that getting released with the website and stuff?

BuffaloWizards,3c5nfq,TheSilverRaven,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:14:03 2015 UTC,Hrrm. I figured I'd mess up somewhere.
BuffaloWizards,3c5nfq,baronale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:26:30 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:  1)I really like these ideas, they make a class that seems weird for this type of game seem like a good idea.  2)Nine Live's Stealer. The bottom has a typo. 'Di' should be 'Do'. Also, I think it would have to be a 3 stamina and not a 1 stamina, since that seems a little OP [If you have a weapon that deals 4 damage, and it costs 1 stamina, you essentially gain 3 stamina/hit]  3)Rogue n' Roll seems a little OP. I think it'd need to be a once per combat ability. Once per round if made so that it can't roll out of crits.   3)Rob doesn't do 2 stamina, only 1 and 3"
BuffaloWizards,3c5nfq,baronale,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:13:46 2015 UTC,"Like I said! Without benefit of playtesting. And I'm usually spot-on with typoes, so that one in #2 actually made me sad.  Why not a 2 stam ability though? Is it something to do with the mechanics of how Rob's behind-the-scenes machinery works, or is it just a ""this is what's been done so far"" kind of thing? I actually intended for Nine Lives Stealer to be a really really good ability, although it does suffer from limitations. The other two major heals in URL (Holy Light and Scurvy Dogs) potentially heal for significantly more per use (Holy Light can heal for up to 20, and Scurvy Dogs heals 5 to all allies). Nine Lives Stealer is limited by weapon damage (most weapons in URL hit for 3) and uses per combat. When I initially wrote it I didn't think nine uses was that unreasonable (since the combats in URL tend to go a LONG time), but on reflection maybe this could become Six Lives Stealer or Three Lives Stealer."
BuffaloWizards,3c5nfq,Petertwnsnd,2,Sun Jul 5 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"You'd be right in stating that's the 1 and 3 stamina only is ""that's just the way we do things""."

BuffaloWizards,3c53cv,DarkenedDestruction,5,Sat Jul 4 21:37:44 2015 UTC,"This sounds like great idea but it would be a huge time and money investment to even think about getting this started, rob has enough on his plate creating full campaigns each week and a job like that would require a whole team, I mean this idea is similar to DnD and they've only recently released their boardgame. Non the less interesting concept!"
BuffaloWizards,3c53cv,Nathiex,3,Sat Jul 4 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"I know Rob has mentioned doing something like that in the far future before. I think he first wants to get all the URLive resources in the same place first, which in itself could take quite a while."
BuffaloWizards,3c53cv,Gnattman,2,Sat Jul 4 22:06:07 2015 UTC,Well there is the URLive wiki which is kept pretty up to date .

BuffaloWizards,3c53cv,The_Raven81,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:43:07 2015 UTC,"not really that big of a problem, especially if you think about how big maps are now in RPGs that actually sell - and they are sold with the campaign adventure's map printed on a huge poster sized piece of paper, and then folded up into the box. Adventure related notes are usually made into a 30 or so page paperback, concerning specific events, monsters, suggested classes and races for the campaign, all that good stuff.

BuffaloWizards,3c4lpn,Petertwnsnd,2,Sat Jul 4 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea, think it is great with even greater potential.  Don't really understand what Insult to Injury does, I mean what is the gameplay effect, yes?  I love the Mock skill, think it's perfect, just great, so many uses.  Might want to fiddle with the whole unconscious thing though.  Make it probable but not guaranteed.  Don't really like Punchline, I would actually replace it with the Jack-in-the-Box you mentioned, maybe have it be an explosion after so much that lures in?  I like Laugh it Off as a CC clear, but as you said, with the state of healing right now, it's hard to pull off, and I don't like the whole max stam reduction.  Killer joke is a very interesting move, but you would have to tweak it to make it balanced.  Maybe make it percentage based instead of number based?  Don't really like Slapstick, it goes too much in theme with the Seaswagger, and I didn't even really like Seaswagger.  Plus that would make 6 abilities.  I would just scrap it.  Just my 2 cents on your idea.  I think it's really very good."
BuffaloWizards,3c4lpn,Entrox_Licher,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:10:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe this:-  Laughing stock: 3 stam, 5 range, 1 per combat  You humorously insult a creature making all enemies laugh at its dismay, on this creatures next turn it will turn attack its own party out of anger then must roll to see if it has calmed down. If the roll fails it will stay anti-party."

BuffaloWizards,3c3kiv,Railith,4,Sat Jul 4 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"I understand that when/if we get a forum it will be a long time from now and I don't expect any actual answers about any of these from the Buffalo Wizard guys, but I want to know what the communities input is on these thoughts and ideas about a forum:   Since it's purpose is basically to replace the subreddit, would all the mods transfer over to the forum or would we find new ones or would it be a combination of both? Would it have a voting system for comments like Reddit. I understand Rob doesn't like the idea of downvotes, so would we have a way to basically upvote or like other comments that are particularly good? I'm assuming it would be split into categories/sub-forums like DvZ, LoM, URL, and Coe's Quest. Would we also have categories for each of the Buffalo Wizards where we can talk about their individual series? Maybe we should have one for old series were we can talk about TTT and other stuff. Would it be its own entity like the URL Wiki or part of the Buffalo Wizard's website? Aesthetically, what would you want it to look like? Should it look like the Buffalo Wizards website? Should it look more like the subreddit? Both are bright and use whites and light blues. Should it be a bit darker with more earthy tones like the URL wiki?   Like I said, I'd like to hear the community's feedback about these ideas."
BuffaloWizards,3c3kiv,Petertwnsnd,2,Sat Jul 4 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"I think that the Bw Website looks good and stepping into Lom should feel like stepping into DvZ. (What I mean is that LoM shouldn't be all parchment ,kinda llike Oblivion's inventory system, and that DvZ shouldn't be all stone. If an aesthetic is chosen it should remain the same at it's core but tweaked for different subjects)"

I think he'll be fine. If it comes to it though, I would like to think everyone would understand a desire for a break or a rework of schedule to get things back on track. We're all human, and the second everyone realizes that, the easier it'll be, I imagine, for everything to feel much more at ease. The BW are human and flawed, but in an awesome way that makes them pretty personable. They're just a bunch of guys, ya know, even if we don't know them as close friends might."

Philhipé's Escape   Dave's Journal Another day trying to bring the shambles of what used to be a prosperous town of elves back from the brink of destruction had come to end. The town had sustained relatively little damage from the attack but as luck would have it the portion that was destroyed contained the town’s only water source. Negotiations with the Great Monkey Fish for some of his spring’s water have been fruitless thus far. Apparently he didn’t take too kindly to having his child split in two. However, Gwyneth seems to have the situation under control. The jail’s been reconstructed and most of the rubble has been pulled from what used to be the well. With luck it’ll be operational before long.  The only true issue that remains is the Kobold. “Philhipé”, he calls himself. Not that it matters. He’ll be rotting in a cell soon enough. There was brief discussion of executing the poor bastard but… he didn’t actually kill anyone. Gwyneth thinks life in the Silver Mine Mountains will be more than enough punishment to act as a deterrent for future thieves. Sounds like a fate worse than death if you ask me. We’ll be transporting him alongside Chimera within the week.  It’s been my job to make sure he doesn’t do something stupid and thus far he’s shown a fair amount of common sense. He doesn’t comply when we ask him questions but he doesn’t try to cause trouble either. He just sits there all day doing nothing. Gwyneth wants me to check one last time to see if he feels like talking in exchange for a reduced sentence. I already know how it’s going to end but questioning Gwyneth, especially after what has happened, is not something someone who wishes to live a long life should do.  With a sigh I set the leather bound book to the side, placing the quill into the ink well, and picking up the lantern whose light I used to write by. The town was eerily quiet. Not that that was unusual around this time of night. All the children getting their rest and all the parents arguing over whether they actually needed said rest or not.   I made the short journey to the well, my sword at my hip. A small thunk echoed through the room as the lantern made contact with the wooden table.  Now illuminated, it was fairly easy to locate the singular key hanging from a hook across the room from the singular cell’s door. I looked through the bars and immediately noticed something was wrong. There was no one inside.   With one hand on my horn and the other grasping the cell’s key I approached the door. The iron door squeaked as it swung open. My eyes ran along the walls, looking for anything that might have explained the Kobold’s sudden disappearance.  Nothing. It was only when I looked up that I realized what had happened. A noose consisting of what appeared to be a red scarf and a blood snake twined together hung from the rafters, ending in the swaying rocky corpse of the vermin that used to be Philhipé. An annoyed sigh slipped into the cold night air as I exited the cell. I’d been worried for a second there. At least Fenris would eat well tonight.He's been needing more minerals in his diet."

Think of it as a contest. Either you need to work with a character, or a concept that references the source material. (Ex. A Gnome that was on the ship Nisovin sent to betray Captain Merci. It didn't happen in stream, but the idea is there and you can write about the what ifs.) the point is to try to ""win"" with an interesting idea or concept that'll gain the attention of the community."

BuffaloWizards,3c1c33,istisp,3,Sat Jul 4 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, but maybe making URL a bi-weekly series would make it easier for you then? You and your guys would have more time to prepare your campains, you would be able to make sure that everything is ok so you can put the highest quality stream and you'd have more time to work on other projects like dvz and lords. I know you wanted URL to be a weekly series but it seems to take more time to prepare than you expected.  Also, having one episode of URL per day would let more time to your fans to catch up and make them more likely to watch your content. Currently you release 100 mins of content per day, which is huge and not everyone has that much time to give every day. I personally just finished watching the pirate campain, and I know at this rate I won't be able to catch up with URL during the summer, even more so when you'll start making lords videos. Of course this is just a wild guess from my own perspective and it probably doesn't represent your whole viewer base, so if you know your viewers can take that much time to watch your content, please diregard what I said and keep growing your channel dude. ;)"

BuffaloWizards,3c1c33,Imagine_Baggins,16,Sat Jul 4 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"You certainly have a point, but just remember, Rob can't please everyone. He puts unbelievable amounts of effort into all the things he does, and between the start of an exciting new genre of entertainment, flushing out the latest large DvZ revamp, working on the Paladins vs Bandits (or whatever its name is) update for LoM, and the Sailor Moon thing with his sister, there's little time to put into other stuff like normal LoM vids, PIFTP, etc. Btw, I don't know if you got the memo, but the Buffalo Wizzers were getting kinda tired of TTT and had planned to phase it out soonish. I don't know if that time has officially come yet, but I think it's safe to assume that TTT is gone for good.  You may find too much URL boring, but someone else might think that TTT was getting stale, as some did. Others might want the BWs to play a different game entirely, while others might want to see a lot more unedited fan suggestions in URL as opposed to Rob previewing and tweaking them. Some might want him to start doing DvZ streams again, others want more activities with non-BWs, while others still want Pokemon or Tomodachi Life to return. Some peeps want Rob to focus more on the Unforgotten Quest game but others want the old video comic to make a comeback. I know I'm beating a dead horse at this point, but I hope you get the idea; Rob does not have boatloads of free time to cater to whoever wants something else (not trying to be sarcastic btw).  Of course, if I've said something incorrect, I assume someone will correct me. I don't want to be this keyboard warrior defending Rob and the gang from anyone who would dare to question them, but this is how I see it.  If you're looking for some variety, consider checking out the doods' streams. I don't have any exact times/schedules, but I know Cooster McBooster streams every night @ 11:00 pm CDT, and Justin and DB frequently stream also.

BuffaloWizards,3c2gha,TimetravelingGuide,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:13:54 2015 UTC,"While we've yet to see a canon answer and we might not evidence is starting to stack up that elves do sleep. Kobolds are becoming more and more notorious about being wrong/lying where as the Monkeyfish seemed fine with the idea that elves sleep. Deadbones established he was sleeping or intended to be sleeping, and Romain and Coe pretty much made it seem like the ""we don't sleep we meditate"" thing is a noble elf joke that probably caught on outside of the elf camps and was proliferated by people who didn't know better."

BuffaloWizards,3c2gha,vidokou,2,Sat Jul 4 17:33:10 2015 UTC,My hope is that it involves hunting down the Porc hunters because Ca'rell basically went AWOL to lead a porc army which can't have made Gwyn happy. But I am not sure if Rawb is ready to bring back old characters.
BuffaloWizards,3c2gha,Mobius1B,5,Sat Jul 4 04:09:44 2015 UTC,"I figured the reason behind Ca'rell taking command of the porcs was so that she could command them to stop attacking the elves.

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Absynthexx,21,Fri Jul 3 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"Love the house party analogy.   Edit: Had some time to think and come up with a worth while comment.  Each campaign has had a nice blend of content and I like how its arranged differentially so it's not predicable or stale. The combat was solid and I think this week had the best story.  Though I liked the story it could maybe have been told/shown better. It sounds like Rob was relying on a info dump to get the story out. I think a bit more narration from the GM side would work. It makes more sense If the people in the game knew more about the situation, from a role play aspect they have lived with the guy for years and would know more.  Some weeks don't need much of a story but this one did. We would have felt a bigger pain when Pat died if we knew him better. All we saw was that he can't cook and he meditates with Justin.  Rob did make some story aspects known but some kind of evolved out of the actions the guys did. Its not a bad thing but I would like to see returning charters or more fleshed out charters to start with. It would give the players more to start with than a mostly blank state.  Loved the twists that came at the end and I felt the final battle was awesome, would have like a bit more RP at the end but I understand it was late.  A quick word on the Kobolds, I think on the lieing aspect it should be more like they don't lie out of malice, but that they want to help but can't so make shit up. They seem for the most part chill dudes who spout seemingly logical shit to get rewards.  Thanks for doing these videos Rob I love the behind the scenes stuff."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,lindeloef,3,Fri Jul 3 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"Regarding the ""fleshing Pat out"" part:   As a DM myself, I can't tell you how often I planned to mention background information before a session, only to forget it during play. Mostly because there are other people (players) involved in telling the story to whom you have to react and adapt."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,wilwarland,19,Sat Jul 4 06:44:22 2015 UTC,I'm in favour of a countdown clock/Round Limit for Chat events.
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,TimetravelingGuide,3,Fri Jul 3 16:30:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not. It seems like it'd really limit how the viewers could impact the encounters and even stifle the pacing of the battles. With the higher donation goals for each event, it is going to take a while for the money to pour in, and if you set a time limit to that, then it turns it from a ""Chat can help or hinder the encounter any time they want"" which makes it feel like an actual battle with unexpected problems or help coming in as battle unfolds to more of a ""Key in the events before you see how the normal battle goes and sit back and watch the rest without participating."" which would make it less of an interaction between the game and viewers and would have most or all the events happening at the beginning. The events make the middle entertaining and fun. If we had a countdown clock, stuff like Donkey for Dankey would never have happened. Maybe take it away when its apparent that donations have stopped, or if the event wouldn't work with the current situation (ie. Give the Kolbalds tipple wield when all the Kolbalds are dead)  I think we do need a system so a Chat event doesn't throw everything out of wack or something, but the idea of a countdown clock seems counterproductive."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,cmcdonald22,2,Fri Jul 3 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"I like the idea as long as its staggered times for individual goals and not just like ""you got 10 minutes all of nothing"". In an hour long encounter (which is pretty standard for these guys) if Rob timed unit buffs so that he wasn't waiting on things (we see Rob say things like "" I'm gonna lose if chat doesn't give me this"" a lot because he balances encounters with some of the stuff in mind) then it would still allow him to change strategies early enough to not be behind the d8 as it were."

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,fealos,15,Fri Jul 3 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"I'm only 13 minutes in, but I would like to apologize to Rob for something I said in chat during ""The Jewel of the Dingo Isles"" campaign.  I said that he (Rob) was a bad GM (Game Master) for being too anti-party. However, I have come to see that the his style of GMing, or at least the style he is using, fits UR Live very well: * Character deaths don't matter as much as a normal RP campaign, since the players have only had a week or less to become attached to their characters. Whereas, in an extended campaign, players will have become attached to their character over months or years. * Playing up the adversarial relationship between him and the players appeals to a much larger portion of chat than I initially expected, and I think a decent portion of the viewership enjoys Rob acting as the heel.  I, personally, wouldn't enjoy playing in an extended campaign with a GM that used the style that Rob is using. I still stand by my belief that being adversarial as a GM is one of the most common follies of GMs. That said, it is a mistake that I and many others have made, among many other mistakes, and I should not have been so critical of Rob for it. Yet, that does not excuse the rudeness of my comments, or make my comments any less rude. I am sorry Rob, for what I said and where I said it. Thanks for creating a truly entertaining show, and best of luck with the rest of the series."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,cmcdonald22,5,Fri Jul 3 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"The Dingo Isles campaign infuriated me and I was definitely on here posting play by play edits while I was upset. I'm old enough to know better and thankfully I did catch myself before the end of it and deleted the post for exactly the reasons Rob said, I knew it was important to take a step back and compose myself better.   I STILL think I have the same problems with the Dingo Isles campaign, I think Rob let his on the fly bug fixes and nerfs be affected by the fact that the players were rolling really well that week when they needed to and started ""punishing"" people for rolling 20s or using the abilities which their characters were built to use.  That said I don't think Rob was anti party, I think he went into game balance mode off of a very limited source of data and should in the future consider waiting until a campaign is over. I know he's incredibly experienced at game design and balance, and I don't even necessarily think the skills he was trying to nerf weren't in fact in need of a nerf. I just know as a player and a GM when someone rolls a 20 and you still fuck them over there's something a little off and not cool. Even if they are rolling hot and rolling big all night. Sometimes the story just ends up being about one Kobolds lucky day.   But even though I stand by that point and can post it now its far more composed and intelligently made than the posts I was making during the show. And in that sense Rob is 100% right and I really respect him not only for that but for knowing the best way to build a community is by encouraging people to be better."

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,ploshy,11,Fri Jul 3 23:29:57 2015 UTC,"I've watched the first 25 minutes, seems like the community rant is over. I had a couple thoughts and just wanted to share them, in case they provided another side.  Rob mentioned that people will say things online that they would NEVER say to him to his face. But sometimes the community just wants to talk to each other, as fans. People like to say what they loved and what they didn't, without meaning for that to constitute actual FEEDBACK. Feedback implies a level of thought and belief that they have a contribution to the product. There's a difference between what someone wants to say to other fans (""Oh man, it kinda sucked about sub mode"" or whatever) and what people would want to say to the actual content creators.  An easy example of this is the game of thrones subreddit. To other fans you can be like ""Fuck olly"" and ""Man, this Dorne plot line seems kinda shitty"", but you wouldn't actually say that to the writers! No one would! There's an implied dedication to the content which makes it so that any toxicity about the content isn't actually harmful to the viewership (and the disconnect of the subreddit from the writers makes it so that there isn't harm to the product). And like Rob said, a problem with this internet content is that the providers are in closer contact to the community than any other medium. This random fan flaming CAN have a negative impact on the product if the creators see it and take it to heart.  So really, in my mind, the issue is that as great as it is to have the Buffalo Wizards involved in the community, that makes it so that there's no place for the community to be itself without the fear of direct contact with the Buffalo Wizards. Maybe that's for the better, because if people are aware that the BWs will read everything they say there might be less toxicity. But there will always be people who want to talk and rave and be toxic about some of the content without ever actually having the desire to hurt the content. A place for fans to talk to other fans, without the BWs seeing it and taking it as real feedback, could be worth considering. Maybe as a community moderated part of the future forum? Or maybe we as fans need to learn to adjust to this new medium and moderate our discussions appropriately. It's new territory."

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,RandumbDude,6,Fri Jul 3 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I noticed a few posts on here during the stream that complained about a brief sub mode, and they were really upset with Coe (his mods really) for trying to keep a civilized chat. Coe had replied to some of them, and I think it really discouraged him during towards the end."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Bakkidza,5,Fri Jul 3 15:46:41 2015 UTC,"There were a few Donation Names that said things to the effect of ""Fuck Sub Mode"", so that would make sense."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,RandumbDude,4,Fri Jul 3 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm personally against it but it is entirely up to the moderators and streamers if they want to keep their own chat civil instead of spamming ""F"". A lot of people said some hateful things about Coe during it, but they need to understand that some chats enjoy having real discussion instead of dank memes and copypastas."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,blckspottdzebra,7,Fri Jul 3 17:28:10 2015 UTC,I have gotten to the point of just watching the stream fullscreen because chat is obnoxious most of the time.
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,RandumbDude,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:05:05 2015 UTC,"Which is perfectly reasonable. I just don't understand why non-subs ask for submode when they could just fullscreen. Subs asking for sub mode makes sense because they can converse together, but non-subs won't be able to anyway. There's nothing wrong with sub mode (which Coe's mods only use for brief periods of times) but non-subs asking for it boggles my mind."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,TimetravelingGuide,3,Fri Jul 3 19:52:33 2015 UTC,That was kind of the ironic part. Others had recognized how toxic chat was and they all requested Sub Mode to end it. Coe and the other subs even laughed about it because it was mainly the nonsubs asking for sub mode.
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,RandumbDude,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"It happened during other campaigns too. I'm not complaining, I just don't actually understand why they would want sub mode, unless it was to be funny."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Petertwnsnd,3,Sat Jul 4 00:20:27 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of arguing in the chat. Rob had messed up a bunch of numbers and people were correcting him, the fights were dragging on, it was getting late, and people were getting bored. At one point the chat was basically just arguing with one another and complaining so everyone, including non-subs, requested the chat be put in Sub mode till things calmed down. This caused a vocal few to complain and with some people going as far to create an entire thread midstream on the Reddit just to complain about it even after complaining about it in the main thread, multiple comments, and the chat. Submode only lasted for a few minutes and the people that were so heavily complaining were responded to directly by Coe during the stream and even Rob replied to a few afterwards.   Most of this was addressed in the video so I don't think talking about it is ""adding fuel to the fire"" or anything."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,RadioactiveHam,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:55:05 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot mate.

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Petertwnsnd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:38:52 2015 UTC,I responded to him talking about what the drama in chat was. Because basically everything that was the source of the drama was addressed in the video I don't think discussing it is bringing any more attention than is already there.
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Impuredeath,4,Sat Jul 4 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"Rob is being very unspecific to what is really touching him and the guys. I didn't personally even notice there was any negative feedback. So could someone lay that out a bit?   I guess I might look too much as the average of the chat. Then again I imagine twitch chat as a little garden gnome, very cute and adorable but it has a mixed personality disorder, ocd, add, adhd and everything else. It tries to give its opinion but that one time they are straight forward the other time it sounds like anger.  Also since it is chat, text is very subjectively interpreted where you fill in the lines. Sentences can have multiple meanings depending on how you interpret it. If someone for example shouts that they want you to do something. They might do that to become noticed between all the other comments. Also something I personally noticed was, if you interpret feedback as positive, feedback gets more positive. If people cry and shout and want you to do something, the core is they still have an opinion and you can always learn something from them. You of course don't have to do what they say though. But personally I am interested in what robs plans are. Since he was talking about explaining more to resolve the issue, I wouldn't mind seeing an explanation what he is planning."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Patriot_Brother,4,Fri Jul 3 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that Roamin always used Terrance's voice when he had to throughout the whole campaign. That was a long stream, and it doesn't sound pleasent to make."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Nienhaus,3,Sat Jul 4 03:23:53 2015 UTC,"Quoting myself from YT ""You're my favorite person on YT. I would like to try to be part of the community but it can be hard sometimes."""
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Number333,3,Fri Jul 3 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"Personally one of those people who don't really comment a whole lot in twitch/youtube and really just like the video at the end. Also can't attend the twitch stream so I just end up watching it on YouTube as each new episode is released.  I also was one of those people in the very beginning who didn't quite get the concept that Rob could never be wrong but I pretty much had an epiphany during the Theeta Squad run. There is basically no error since it's pure cannon. There isn't a set number of damage that a player actually has because it's a mere character in roleplay. Yea, you can roughly estimate how much you'd hurt if you repeatedly got punched in the stomach but you may give out and have it ""fudged"" as Rob says to make it so it doesn't have to be perfect. Really glad Rob fleshed it out this episode as well because it seriously isn't like a game where the health points are definitive.   In terms of the campaign, I really do love how we get these behind the scenes because it really goes to show how fluid the they are. Whether it be the Nisovin battle at the end vs Coe's Crew or the story Pat was never able to tell, it's funny how much of an alternate universe inside of this universe that could have happened if Rob forced the characters down each path.  Anyway, finally just wanted to say keep up the awesome work Rob as well as the rest of the guys."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,5ilver42,2,Fri Jul 3 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"Community:  I'm fine with having a move to a dedicated forum. I've been in several different communities throughout my internet existence and there are a lot of php stuff that would suit URLive well. I could see the transition being a little rough at first, but that's to be expected.  Regarding the thoughts on criticism, I think that it is possible to have constructive criticism on the internet, but would agree that mutual respect is needed and that 99% of it isn't given or taken that way. And even part of that 1% that is doesn't have always have the full picture. I can't say where I fall, but I've definitely been guilty of sharing my thoughts on reddit without having the full picture and have been unintentionally toxic - even though it came from a place of good intentions.  I suppose a short version of my thoughts on this really is, that: It can be exhausting at times but I think Rob is taking a very noble and respectable position on a lot of this stuff.  Campaign:  On the whole I really enjoyed it. Rob said he wasn't 100% himself and maybe it did suffer a little from that, but regardless I still found it really really enjoyable.  Regarding characters winning or losing, some people do have the must win this game sense rather than a story, but even still, we will still root for the characters we like and will want them to succeed. My thoughts on this matter are a little jumbled, but even if my favorite characters die, sure I'll have that first hit of sadness, but I will still enjoy this show! I really wanted Dankie to do awesome and have more RP moments with Maddie, but hey, we got a hilarious death by being crushed by a fucking donkey!  The story is the story. I've been writing fiction regularly for over three years, that is a kind of a short time, but there are a lot of philosophies people can have toward how to go about it. The way I view it is that once the ground work has been set, you aren't writing a story so much as you are discovering a story; a documenting observer. For table top RP it's a little different, but the essence of the story and of being true to characters are the priority above all. And going through this enough times you will hit every spectrum of emotions and something beautiful can come from that.  All of these campaigns would just be really awesome to see as an animated show or film or comic series.  Regarding the first combat encounter, Rob said he thought sending the kids upstairs might no have been the best idea, I do think that it was very much in character for Pat as a dad character for him to do that. Out of everything, I felt that as the most defining moments for Pat.  Anyway, these are my thoughts for those who wanted to read. :P Excited for the next campaign."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Absynthexx,2,Fri Jul 3 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the campaign and the role play. I'd like to see Justin come out of his shell a little more and take some chances with his characters, but that is a very minor thing. I'm sure he is still getting used the game/format.  I enjoyed watching Coe role play in such a way that was both true to his character, but also a tad frustrating to Rob who wanted everyone upstairs so he could continue the story along. I think the fact that everyone knew that Coe knew this made it funnier. Then when Rob finally got everyone upstairs and rolled a 1 on the Pat death was hillarious! Poor Rob! xD  As far as donation events, I only watch the YT videos and a shirt doesn't really interest me but I'm planning to try and drop in briefly on occasional saturdays to kick in a couple bucks to an event. I'm also supporting through Patreon currently."

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,TimetravelingGuide,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:00:03 2015 UTC,"I think what would have been helpful and might be helpful in the future is to try and have three specific types of events.   Anti-party- the event hurts the party/benefits the NPCs.  Robs Choice-Something that Rob thinks would make the encounter funny/ really entertaining. Either pro-party/anti-party.  Pro-party- Its pro-party.  Just to have some defined slots where we have an idea of what the events do without actually knowing the details.   I also think a funny way to counter when chat gets toxic is to have a low level donation (like the overflow) to essentially give ""hugs"" to people like Coe who are reading when chat is toxic at the time. Just to have something silly that makes the roll play a bit funnier or even just a random RP item. Nothing to cheer up a player like a jar of leeches!  Also I can't wait for the session where Rob tries to pit characters against each other and they somehow come to a peaceful resolution that saves everyone. That would be really funny to see.  Anyways, can't wait for next week and I'm really looking forward to the new campaign!"

I know you banned me from the subbreddit and im not going use this to get around the ban. I want to post this one comment and be done with it. Im only doing this because you were talking mainly about a comment i made and while i explained it to you when you banned me you seem to be giving/have gotten a terribly biased and wrong perception of it. Im not here to argue i should be unbanned or not whats done is done maybe youll unban me sometime soon maybe you wont what ever.  For those that our unaware I made this comment during the stream and it seemed to have been the spark that lit the match of the drama. I shouldntve made this comment i know that i was pissed off at the time and the main reason i was pissed is because a moderator told me sub mode would not be turned off. That was the entire crux of me being pissed off that little bit of information i had. There was no word from other moderators that it would eventually be turned off or that it was a temporary measure and i did ask them. As far as i was aware a few rowdy people on twitch chat had just ruined this stream and i was understandably pissed. I still never should of made my comment but i didnt foresee the giant bit of drama it would have caused and i certainly didnt intend for it to hurt the stream in anyway but it did and again for that i apologize to you fans and to all the buffalo wizards especially to coe i fucked up plain and simple. The ""bipolar"" nature that was seemingly shown was due to the fact it turned out that the moderator who told me sub mode would not be turned off was wrong. You can see i went back to enjoying the stream and even made a discussion post after it was lifted. you can tell my entire anger was made off of one little bit of false information. I fucked up though again by continuing the drama i shouldntve made the sub mode discussion post in the middle of the stream and i should not have kept my comment up when submode was turned off. I shouldve immediately deleted that comment or edited it explaining myself i did the complete wrong thing just leaving it. I didnt realize at all the broad implications it appears to have caused had I done so i might not be banned and the drama i appear to have caused may not have happened.  So all i can say though is please fans think before you act like i did you may be a swell guy 99% of the time like i was but all it takes is 1 fuck up to cancel that all out. Had I thought more about my actions so many things might have turned out different, but i did i fucked up bad and now i must atone for what happened and once again id like to apologize for that."

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,baronale,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:37:48 2015 UTC,"Sub mode is an awful idea. Like, seriously, making it so only people who are willing to pay $5 a month to Coe can talk. If you're looking for the community to give feedback, don't rely on only the feedback of those who can pay.  Edit: I realized I should probably give an idea to make this constructive. I really like the forum idea, it's awesome.  I believe that maybe there should just be a live chat thread on reddit/forum, the the guys could check instead of chat.  Along with this, just let twitch chat do what twitch chat does. It's just Kappa's and Kreygasm's."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Nihillo,10,Fri Jul 3 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"Sub-mode was activated because the moderators know they can trust those people, they are regulars from Coe's streams and people he considers his friends, you've got to realize that some of the people who are technically considered subs haven't even paid anything to Coe, they are just regulars.   When they turn on sub-mode on, they are basically turning chat off, and that's because some people are ruining it for everyone."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,baronale,2,Fri Jul 3 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"When you have 4000+ people watching your stream, you can't just talk to 'your friends'. It's important to get everyone's ideas, even if their ideas are rubbish."
BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Nihillo,9,Fri Jul 3 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's important to get everyone's ideas, even if their ideas are rubbish.   I respectfully disagree, if all an individual is going to do is spew hatred and toxicity, then he has nothing to add to the discussion, and the privilege of utilizing the chat is wasted on him. This is why we ban people, after all. We are not talking about selective censorship of ideas, we are talking about people who are not being respectful to others.  Ideally it would be better to just remove the offenders from chat instead of resorting to turning it all off, and hopefully the mods will be able to do so in the future, but since the show is still in its infancy, I think it's understandable for this to happen."

BuffaloWizards,3bzzsp,Bakkidza,0,Sat Jul 4 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem is how a community expresses distaste.  Any distaste is going to be negative. I personally don't like combat, so I'm a bit more negative in the combat sections than in the RP sections.  Here on the subreddit, I can take time to think out exactly what I want to say. I can figure out exactly which parts I didn't like, and why those parts weren't my favorite. I can also spend a bit more time phrasing my thoughts so they don't come out as rude.  Over on chat, there's a bit less time. Events happen quickly and the reactions are much more instinctive. This makes it so any fleeting thought is more likely to be said, be it negative or positive.  Most of the people who say something negative don't hate whatever is happening, they just want to say they'd prefer something else. It's in combination with the three dozen other people saying the same thing that the message turns into one of hate.  I don't have a solution to this. Chat is always going to be about instants and the communities reactions to that. People are always going to find something they like a bit less, along with a way to express that. I just can't find a way to combine these two things without causing that ""whole is greater than the sum"" effect."
BuffaloWizards,3c0zw8,LokiofSP,29,Fri Jul 3 19:45:24 2015 UTC,"Not a single donation event is mandatory. It's hard to explain, but basically the entire story can change on what does or doesn't get donated. The reason it's hard to explain is because we don't have an alternate timeline in which a donation doesn't occur. I plan around everything being donated, but also things that feel ""critical"" I always have ways to continue telling a story without them. No Knock Knock event? Pay dies of a heart attack. No necklace crush? Heather might very well win because the guys can't figure out a Medusa, but as the Goblins fall one by one, Heather walks over to them reveals her true form before having the Paladins take them off to be thrown in her dungeon as slaves, setting up a completely different setting.  This is how you, the audience, are still young to this type of content. You are only able to see what has happened and not what could have happened and so you draw conclusions that things could have only possibly played out in a single way. Nothing is mandatory, because the story is whatever happens. Pat fusing with Justin feels so important to the plot because it was important to the story, but because you could of never known that without the donation event, it could have just played out in a way where the guys get overwhelmed and beaten by Heather setting up a completely different follow up campaign.  By being Heatherfol, her story is now over and can't really be explored as well. You miss out on seeing what could of happened, had they lost/surrendered.  Also I simply can't have donation event after donation event that is just Roamin gets a tentacle arm. I have to do a dozen or so events each week and trust me, it's hard to build them."
BuffaloWizards,3c0zw8,Rurikar,2,Fri Jul 3 21:09:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like Pat having a heart attack wouldn't have been nearly as fun. The scene with Pat catching the battleaxe as it was coming down on his neck and declaring ""I don't think so"" only to later be dragged upstairs and beheaded in front of his crying 'daughter' and half-conscious 'son' was so awesome. Him just dying of a heart attack seems like it would have been... anticlimactic. Of course I can't say for certain since that didn't end up happening though. I'm not really sure where I was going with this comment. . ."

Im thinking of making a recap on reddit for the important stuff Rob mentions in the BTS. Anyways, in the BTS, Rob explains that the ""Knock Knock"" event didn't need to happen, that if it didn't happen they would of went on a walk with Pattenborrow and would of got captured. Again Rob explains it best in the video but I understand that some people don't have the time to watch a 1:30ish video."

Besides just needing the donations to continue the project, there's also the fact that there is a alternate path to go, a path that could go in different and interesting ways, but that is difficult to see with what has already happened behind us. I'd like to thank everyone that took the time to explain this to me. Maybe I'll never fully see how things can be different in the story, but I can at least respect it even more now"
BuffaloWizards,3c0zw8,tirakai,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:07:02 2015 UTC,"You have to remember Coe and co are relying on the donations to be able to keep the show running, some of them feel necessary because, well, they are. They expect and need a certain amount of donations to go through and plan the show around it.  Sure you could have everything be totally optional bonus powers and stuff but past streams have shown people like donating for big story-changing events, so making really important-looking ones (like Knock Knock) is a fairly reliable way for the show to be supported."
BuffaloWizards,3c0zw8,TheNamlessGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"While I like the idea of neccessary donation goals (since it gives them more time to roleplay in between, I loved the entire birthday scene before the ""Knock Knock"" event started), I think they should maybe be marked as neccessary, and/or have a neccessary donation counter (so you know to save your donation, if you can only donate a little).  Of course, knowing Rob, he would find a way around it if it took too much time."

A donation event could be helpful or hurt the party, it could be minor or major, it could alter the story. The fact that Rob is making the picture/name of the event be more cryptic (example: the blood snakes would have been beneficial) adds to the mystery. I think it adds a lot flavor not knowing what in the world is going to happen with a particular donation event! It's a spin of the UR live slot machine!"

BuffaloWizards,3c2qzf,FappingMouse,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:26:59 2015 UTC,I find Rob discourages anything that would restrict the characters from acting like they in roleplay especially things that are highly meta. If the guys see a potential fight with characters that they wouldn't want to see die I imagine they would look for a good roleplay reason not to let it happen.

I don't think a fight can be avoided if Rob and chat wants it to happen, but they can try, and once it's too late, and the guys have to pick their characters, they may go for their favorite and go all out aggressive to assure they stay alive, which for almost all characters so far is a pretty fair assumption. I think it's going to be very exciting."

You know what I think would be interesting? A larger donation event that affects the entire UR world, and not just a campaign, people would donate during a month for something like ""awaken the dragon lord"" (who is totally not a rip-off of Deathwing), and then this dragon of epic proportions would show up and start tearing shit up in whatever campaign is next, and the ones following that. This would give the individual campaigns some sense of cohesion, as they would be part of a saga, and yet it wouldn't be a continuous story that requires you to know what happened before, because it's a world-wide event, the destruction wrought by this dragon would be just in the background, as a theme."
BuffaloWizards,3c0p2s,Nihillo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:20:55 2015 UTC,That would be awesome but then what happens if that doesn't meet the goal? I wouldn't mind donating to start a race or something either.

BuffaloWizards,3c0p2s,Toadslayer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:01:48 2015 UTC,"I think having some version of a youtube donation event would be interesting, but I'd be unsure how to implement it without taking away from the Livestream donations. The best I could figure is to have a ""unlock this board"" or ""Have this NPC"" or something similar...  Perhaps it'd be best to have Youtube events affect some ""Twist"" in the later part of the game perhaps."
BuffaloWizards,3c0p2s,TimetravelingGuide,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:36:12 2015 UTC,I do really think that some form of donation that isn't done via the stream is a good idea. I haven't been able to make a single stream yet but I would still like to support the show.
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,KyKobra,10,Fri Jul 3 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"In the BTS video, Rob said that each player would get to choose which character to play as and the other would be a NPC afaik. So I guess if the whole group decided to stay as a team the other side would just be controlled by Rob himself and it would be a NPC battle. Also, here is a link to where he says it https://youtu.be/sBWLClve18U?t=1h24m"
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,spyropulse,2,Fri Jul 3 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"What I'm looking forward to is the pvp possibilities from this.  Imagine Coe as Captain Merci, Deadbones as Kinnie Boots and Rob as the rest of the BoeCoe crew vs Justin as Elmar, Roamin as Templeton, and Rob as the rest of the Theta Squad. The Pvp element would be a nice twist to battles and chat can donate for events that benefit their personal favourites."
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,cc12321,5,Sat Jul 4 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"My big concern is about continuity and time line issues. For example if gobos vs porc hunters were to happen, would Danke be there? Would Ca'rell be there?   If they are both there then we could go ahead and say that the only reason theta squad hate goblins is because they lost to a rag tag group of goblins.  But that would mean gobos side would have to win.  And if that's not the case, well we already know what happens when the theta squad knock out goblins."
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,cc12321,3,Fri Jul 3 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be a concern though, those are just the things that decide the timeline. If the Gobos show up without Danke and Terrence is short an eye then the campaign happens after Gobos. This is most likely how stuff will happen because Rob is smart enough to know if he kills the Gobos before the events of their own campaign it would fuck everything up.  By extension if somehow the one eye Gobos fought full Theta squad this would tell you that Porc Hunters happens after Gobos of Pat.   The only problem is if he kills someone before the campaign they exist in, and in the BTS video Rob states that killing characters requires extra effort, extra effort he and the guys seem smart enough to avoid to preserve the timeline."
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,cmcdonald22,2,Fri Jul 3 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"my question is what would happen if say, Justin makes a new character, then the party finds and fights the BoeCoe pirates and he wants to control his old character, if the old character that he's controlling dies does he go back to playing his new one or does he do something else? If /u/rurikar could clear this up that would be great"
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,shinyman337,6,Fri Jul 3 23:51:47 2015 UTC,Asking questions I am not ready to give answers too.
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,Rurikar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:12:45 2015 UTC,"That was my question aswell. What if Justin controls an old character, and kills off his character for the new campaign?  I mean I definitely think Rob will figure it out. It's going to be a very cool mechanic in my eyes."
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,Petertwnsnd,2,Sat Jul 4 00:19:47 2015 UTC,Did you watch the full video?  If they come up against a character or group of characters they have played in the past. Rob will allow the people who previously played the character choose which character to play as in the combat. The other character would get played by Rob like every other character in the game.
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,ShepardCom,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:49:15 2015 UTC,The guys would control whoever the main characters of that week are. If in next weeks campaign while following Gweneth they meet up with the Pirates they would control the elfs while rob controlled the pirates.
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,PixelScarecrow,3,Fri Jul 3 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"If you saw the whole BTS (i understand it's over 1 hour long so you might not have the time), Rob said that they chose what character they want to be but after they made their choice they can't switch back. The other character is controlled by Rob."
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,gloomyMoron,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, so the other group would just be NPCs controlled by Rob?   Makes sense I guess. This isn't until far off into the future I'd assume."
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,QuiteAwareWereDying,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"Not that far off into the future. Probably, just by my estimations, within the next 3 or 4 campaigns something will happen. At the end of the latest Behind the Scenes, Rob says we might be getting a campaign in the Mines at the end of the summer sessions. The Mines are where Elves send their prisoners and where Philhipé is, probably, awaiting his execution. We also know we sent a powerful Kobold there in the Porc Hunters campaign. Being a prison, there is a good chance we can run into other characters there too, if it gets written that way. So, by the end of the summer, we're gonna run into at least a few characters and there campaigns are gonna collide and meet."
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,Mega_muncher,2,Fri Jul 3 18:28:40 2015 UTC,Man I really hope Philhipe and Malstrom meet.
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,QuiteAwareWereDying,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:41:28 2015 UTC,What if Philhipe is Malstrom
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,Makydog,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:55:10 2015 UTC,Nah malstrom has been around longer than philiepe. He's an old unforgotten realms character.
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,QuiteAwareWereDying,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:30:18 2015 UTC,Well URealms and URealms Live are in parallel timelines. It could be entirely possible that Felipe is just this timeline's version of Malstrom.
BuffaloWizards,3c0n94,Makydog,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:21:28 2015 UTC,But we met malstrom. He was the one in the cart in the theta squad campaign

BuffaloWizards,3bygtf,pcplague,3,Fri Jul 3 04:51:55 2015 UTC,Here is a non-mobile link: https://twitter.com/urealms/status/616804819567792128  Sourcecode | Feedback?
BuffaloWizards,3bygtf,untouchedURL,2,Fri Jul 3 04:53:20 2015 UTC,This looks amazing.
BuffaloWizards,3bygtf,killonator74,0,Fri Jul 3 05:26:10 2015 UTC,"neat, I think there is a bit to much movement. but overall I like it."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,shinyman337,26,Thu Jul 2 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"I also really prefer the RP sections to the combat sections. The problem with that is I'd like to support the show, but I don't want to add something that just is there to lengthen combat, which is what a lot of the donations seem to do.  The negative donations either add more players to the field to fight, increase the health of the current enemy, or give the enemy a new attack that does more damage, making it so the party spends more time healing. I know Rob says that chat mostly donates to events that are positive for the guys (I'm sure that'll get mentioned in the BTS), but I personally do it because it lets us get out of combat faster and back to the guys just having fun.  I have no idea what a good negative event would be. I personally loved the Cultis of Bones event because that added some great RP while making it harder for the guys, but that is definitely not something you can do every week.  You can't just say forget the negatives and just do positives, because you then lose a ton of tension in the battles. It'll remove some of the annoyance (those ""Oh come on, Rob"" moments like when all the enemies get double health and can absorb all magic attacks), but that will also make all the battles less satisfying.  I'd also like to see more tabletop roleplay outside of combat. Stuff like world exploring, or just roaming a village that they aren't fighting in. In this one it kind of felt like the sets were just combat rooms with paths in between them, and that made sense in the scenario, but also made the story feel very linear (I'm sure in the BTS we'll see other paths, this is just the impression I got from how it played out)."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Bakkidza,7,Fri Jul 3 02:10:52 2015 UTC,I guess my favorite chat donation that added was the Pirate one where Deadbones went crazy on that one kobold. It was amazing RP and combat too.
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,v12a12,3,Fri Jul 3 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"I love this show, and I love Rob content, and Buffalo Wizards in general. But I think Rob is falling into a trapped cycle with this show.   This is simplifying, but let's say that there are two types of people who watch content on youtube. People who watch for storylines and personality, and people who watch for gameplay and personality.   For UR Live, it started as a story being told. There was combat, but the combat served to enhance and further the story.  The past few UR Lives have felt, to me, like the appealed to the gameplay cravers of youtube viewers. Some people want to watch people play through a game, complete combat or skill mechanics, and provide commentary about what is happening with some personality inserted (think mindcrack mario kart). When the focus in UR Live is on combat, it becomes ""how to do the buffalo wizards beat this encounter"" not ""how do dankey, pat, Maddie, and friends get away from these crazy dwarfs"".   There are definitely people who enjoy the combat portion of this show, and would prefer to keep the show how it is (about a 60/40 split between combat and role play, respectively. But I do not think that combat is the way to grow the show. How many channels based on game play are we seeing fail on youtube now? Which are the channels succeeding? Vannossgaming, pewdiepie, all of those guys are comedians, not guys who play games for their audience to see the story.  I don't think you need to be a Pewdiepie. But I do think this show needs steered back toward comedy and role play or you will find interest waning.   This is meant to be constructive. I love this show, and I want it to continue. It's my favorite piece of youtube content so far after years and years of viewing. Whether or not anything about the show changes I'll always be a youtube viewer every day they come out.   Also I've never posted on reddit before, so if I did this wrong I'm sorry."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,ChillyRick,18,Fri Jul 3 16:51:14 2015 UTC,I loved Deadbones playing as a father daughter combo and he plays as a great angsty teenage girl.
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,discardedcash,6,Fri Jul 3 02:08:52 2015 UTC,Deadbones easily wins my vote for weekly fan-favorite.
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,GamesWithArty,3,Fri Jul 3 05:38:58 2015 UTC,"I don't completely agree with you. There was a lot of points in which Deadbones just kind of stood doing nothing instead of launching any attack at all. (Of course this may be due to the loss of Maddie's pets or Priar's bad back). Speaking of the Woodland Companion thing that needs to be made more clear. I know in the New Years Stream Pause had to call upon his beavers but now it seems like something that you have until it dies and then it is pointless unless you find another animal.   But back to the point, I think that Deadbones stood in the back and passing his turns to much to get the fan vote"
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Skipper2399,10,Fri Jul 3 06:23:47 2015 UTC,Personally this week was my favorite however I can see where you are coming from. Then again I may have enjoyed it more because I watched the VOD on Coe's twitch channel and was able to skip over the breaks.
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,PenguinLord13,8,Fri Jul 3 00:59:45 2015 UTC,"Here are my feelings about this campaign (Disclaimer: I'm nitpicking):  In the past weeks, they've been playing groups of people who know what they're doing and have a bunch of experience doing it. This week, while they had been trained by Pat, the first encounter with the dwarves busting in would have been their first real experience in combat, other than Prior. I feel like this could have been reflected a bit better in how the combat went down, I would have expected the children to run upstairs while Pat and Prior defended them against the enemies. Instead, the guys strategized and fought this battle like they've strategized and fought the battles in past campaigns. It could be said that Pat gave them all really in-depth combat training, but that might be stretching it a little.  In my opinion, I would have expected a little more character development to be going on when they're first in the waiting area in the arena. After all, these goblins went from having pretty nice lives with a happy family to their adoptive father being murdered in front of them and being treated like shit. It more felt like it was their personalities transferred to a new setting than their characters' lives being turned upside down. I especially felt this way with the Madeline/Prior dynamic. We are previously led to believe that Prior is an alcoholic deadbeat dad, but when something comes to hurt his daughter he starts unleashing force pillars and shift-style punches out of nowhere, and yet when they get to the arena Prior is still his alcoholic self and Madeline is just as distant to him and the others. Although I will say that Deadbones had some of the best development through Madeline with going from the angsty teenage girl to being more caring and supportive of the others in the family.  Despite what it may seem I feel based on what I just said, this was definitely one of my favorite campaigns. I got kind of sick of all of the low rolls by the end, but that's entirely luck, there isn't anything that can be done about that. These complaints are so specific because there wasn't actually all that much that I found wrong with it. It really feels like the guys are growing with keeping their actions in-character, I noticed that they called each other by their character names rather than their real names a lot more this week when doing puppet pals, though that might just have been because of the green goblin thing. Overall, awesome stream all around, here's to the next campaign!"
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Makydog,3,Fri Jul 3 03:48:30 2015 UTC,I feel like Coe definitely played his character like you thought he should in the beginning.
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Makydog,3,Fri Jul 3 11:40:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Coe did a great job in the first encounter."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,FinalFate,6,Fri Jul 3 14:45:33 2015 UTC,I think we need more donation incentives for non combat encounters. Things like the TV for the guys to play with are much more entertaining than adding a few more enemies.
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Sirposion,6,Fri Jul 3 10:09:49 2015 UTC,"There will always be some campaigns with more combat that talking, because some people Like I like the combat parts more than the talking parts."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Mobius1B,4,Thu Jul 2 23:28:48 2015 UTC,I was just saying that I personally didn't enjoy those parts too much
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Slash_Face_Palm,6,Thu Jul 2 23:50:00 2015 UTC,"I felt this week was pretty strong although the middle was slow the beginning and end were very solid personally I would rank it as a tie with Roamins band of thiefs with the other streams beating it. Personally I like the negative events since combat is where some of the best moments come from ie Felipe going beast mode, Justin getting the winchestors finest etc. As for chat events being slow I think that was because 1) people burned out early 2) were saving for a good event 3) and a lot of people decided to not donate to negative events which made things more boring.  The only other thing I have to say and it wasn't the guys fault is chat was real toxic especially in the middle a lot of people were yelling at each other to do this or that for donations I don't mind some discussion on events to prioritize but people actively saying don't donate because this event sucks/I want them to finish the story don't donate and prolong combat. I don't mind people not donating if they don't feel like it but trying to tell others to not donate is just wrong."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,cadd161,6,Fri Jul 3 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"I liked a lot of what happened, but I really feel like the woodland companion spell needs either like a buff or a redesign, it just feels kinda boring when we've seen a character pick it (Like this week and in Dingo isles, it's just been almost worthless from both a combat and RP perspective.)"
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,5ilver42,4,Fri Jul 3 10:47:11 2015 UTC,"I really liked the story this week, but i feel that since they had a larger combat focus, and they were running late on the stream the story didn't get as much focus as i would of liked. I understand that they had to end it there, but i would like for there to be a followup of some sort. I have a number of question about Pat, Medusa and the paladin order."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Gnattman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, while I think the ""low points"" were lower than other weeks, I really liked the sense of the story this campaign gave."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Skipper2399,5,Fri Jul 3 02:01:24 2015 UTC,"This week seemed pretty just... unmemorable to me. That's not to say it was bad, it just didn't have as many legendary moments. Now, that's fine, not every week is going to have super memorable moments, I just think this week was a little lacking on funny parts- at least to me.   I will say I LOVED watching the guys just fail miserably at their roles. I wanted them to win, but watching plan after plan fail added a bunch of tension and honestly emotional investment which I appreciated. Sometimes it's as much fun watching them fail as succeed.   Looking forward to the next one as always! You guys are doing awesome work!"
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Gnattman,5,Fri Jul 3 02:36:42 2015 UTC,The biggest downfall of this whole series was having it's most memorable character set the bar so high in the first campaign in which now many people expect more Phillipe's to come along
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,treebeard189,2,Fri Jul 3 06:25:43 2015 UTC,I have no doubt that something better than Phillipe will come along and chat will explode. I'm doing my best to take every week at face value and not compare them because nostalgia is the absolute worst enemy to creativity.
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,Skipper2399,2,Fri Jul 3 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how it came through in the youtube replay but the moment where Coe died to the donkey may have been one of the best moments in the show for me.  Not only did we get our first charecter death but when Chat absolutely exploded as 3-4 thousand people all realized we could kill a charecter by throwing a donkey on him was amazing.  That excitment may not have shown through on youtube but in person on Twitch when that realization hit it was amazing.  Those kind of ridiculous unintended side effects are what make some of the best comedy, like Philepe was, to my knowledge, never intended by rob.  He was a result of Coe being silly and deciding to just hug an enemy who then joined their party and became the fan favorite.    Also when Coe shot the ramster was fantastic and certainly memorable for me.  I also really enjoyed the characters this week, I can't think of any other show so far where I have thoroughly enjoyed every character.  Coe was amazing especially in that first encounter.  I loved the dynamic between Deadbones' father daughter.  Roamin was hilarious whenever Terrance came out, and while Justin by himself was meh whenever he interacted with Pat it was a lot of fun."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,DarkCloudPi,4,Sat Jul 4 06:38:34 2015 UTC,"I love a good combination of RP and fighting. However this week didn't have as much RP as I would have preferred. Once in the ring it was a lot of fighting and failing to talk to who they were fighting in a future round. However the buildup and introduction to the story was really good at the beginning.  For me personally I kind of lost a bit of interest and entertainment from the campaign when Coe's character of Dankey died. After that there was not as many funny omens of Coe bashing his head against a wall.  I understand that the end COULD have been catastrophic, and even though the whole fight I was rooting for the heroes, I still felt like the ending wasn't the best after they ""won"". Rob explained in a earlier post I saw that he messed up by giving them the hint about the burst damage but still, the Medusa fight was a bit anticlimactic in a sense.  Overall though, this was one of my favorite campaigns with the countless amount of terrible rolls in which they somehow prevailed. I'm looking forward to something just as great and possibly better after the July 4th break."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,sdcSpade,3,Fri Jul 3 06:17:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I felt this week started slow, and I wasn't really paying much attention because it just wasn't as engaging as the other weeks. But then the final battle came around, and I started to enjoy this week's show more than some of the other ones. I love well thought out stories with great foreshadowing that give hints to later plot-points, and so when this one came full circle, I was very excited, because all the exposition finally made sense.  For the rest of the stuff, I enjoyed the characters, as usual, and also enjoyed the uniqueness of this week's show (what with the multiple characters, with Coe becoming a donkey and then fighting his teammates, and from creating a story that wasn't made from having an adventure). However, the low rolls kind of put a damper on a lot of the fun, but there's not really anything anyone can do about that.  Overall, another good show."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,KyKobra,4,Fri Jul 3 06:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't mind most of the ""negative"" things because I feel like this show thrives by being different every week. There was not much room for character interaction? True, but I'll take that for the new kind of setting.  Only thing I didn't like was how the donkey-character was introduced. Or rather, wasn't introduced and just kind of happened. I know it's been a long evening for the guys and the creative juices may not have flown at full capacity, so my backseat DM-ing isn't going to mean much, but my first thought was that Coe's conjoined twin tumor could have popped out of his body as he was squashed, got eaten by the donkey and then took hold of it by ingraining itself in its brain. They could still communicate because the guys (except for Justin) can read his mind."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,cmcdonald22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:18:43 2015 UTC,"This probably was my favorite URealms Live campaign yet. I thought this show had the perfect balance between roleplay and combat, and the humor was non-stop with the abysmal roles, and the threatening of Roamin to up and leave if he kept rolling low.   My only complaint though, and this may just be the way I was watching it, was the final battle felt pretty anti-climatic. It's not a ""Oh I thought they were gonna lose!"" problem, it's just it didn't come off as strong to me as some other ending battles have. Once Rob told the crew that everyone was under the spell of Medusa, it really began ""DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE, ATTACK THE SNAKE-HEADED ASSHOLE"" Which I mean from an RP standpoint makes PERFECT sense, it's just I wish a lot of the time, Rob gave the crew less info, and had them figure it out for themselves.  I guess as time goes on, and the guys get better at D&D type play, Rob will give them less and less, and they'll be figuring stuff out for themselves which is great, so I'm looking forward to that. Chat events were a bit slow this week, and it seemed like Rob really had to pander to get some of them going.   *Sidenote. Are there times where Rob will force out of combat RP in order to get a chat event, or is it just me? I don't watch URealms live, I watch it on Twitch afterwards, so I don't see the chat."
BuffaloWizards,3bxgcd,theohaiguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:01:13 2015 UTC,"It's nitpicky min maxing and significantly less relevant this week than it was previous weeks. I complained about it before but deleted the post because like Rob mentioned in his BTS this week I really should have taken time to reflect on it, but now I have and I'm pretty sure I can express it better.   Rob is a great story teller, and Rob is a great game designer. But the mid game ""bug fixes"" and nerfs drive me crazy. I understand this is totally an ""Alpha"" game with skills literally made up days before use and this being the first time they're play tested, and I also understand Rob has a LOT of experience balancing games and is good at eyeballing things that are broken. But the guys make their characters based off the information given at the time, they're picking the skills based off the idea of how broken or fun they may or may not be. In addition to this, some weeks they just get stupidly lucky rolls. Some weeks they don't. If Justin had been playing his treasure gathering pirate in the campaign of the Gobos then by no means would he have seemed so over powered as he did in Dingo Isles where he kept landing 20 after 20. And it got to the point where Justin was literally rolling 20s and still not succeeding. THAT feels shitty. 20s are a special big deal. To see a guy roll a 20 and fail and then not get treasure because of on the fly nerfs sucks. It takes a lot of the fun out of it for me, and fairly consistently we're reminded by Rob or others that this isn't a pc game and that it is about having fun and telling a story. And I think it's okay for a story to just end up being about a stupidly lucky Kobold or in this weeks instance a stupidly unlucky pair of Gobos.  It's hard because I know I'm discussing fairness and balance in a game that specifically doesn't have it in mind but its just one of those things. I definitely understand reviewing skills at the END of a session and adjusting them but I feel like u/rurikar may be falling into the same pit as chat where he's reacting to skills in a campaign based on the rolls and less on the skill themselves (in some cases, again in general I think Rob is very intelligent about game balance) like in Gobos, it became very apparent that Romain really relies on the air blast interrupt as a crutch and its basically the only reason he survived. But because he had such terrible rolls it wasn't spot nerfed.   I dunno, not a super important thing and its a very dnd player thing to care about.  But this felt like the best place to express it."

BuffaloWizards,3bvyo8,VoltStar,7,Thu Jul 2 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"Ship sooner and this is the best way for the best return for Teespring and us. By running a campaign, they get to do a bulk order which cuts costs which makes the shirts cheaper to make which means more of your support goes to us. Convenience costs money and you haven't thought about that!  When we are bigger in the future, I'm sure we will have our own store, however this is the best way to do this atm."
BuffaloWizards,3bvyo8,Rurikar,2,Fri Jul 3 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I understand.    Maybe if you do another run of your shirts in the future I'll be able to pick them up, but I just cant right now."

I hope a main store does open eventually, and have all the retro shirts."
BuffaloWizards,3bvyo8,cc12321,2,Fri Jul 3 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"That's just the way Teespring works. If I recall correctly though, when you put a shirt on teespring you can choose how long it's available for purchase. I'm not sure why /u/Rurikar picked such a short time frame, as I know I've seen shirts on Teespring be available for at least a month."
BuffaloWizards,3bvyo8,Zylo003,6,Thu Jul 2 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"Shorter time means they're printed and shipped sooner. They're not printed and sent out until the end of the campaign, so it's a matter of preference."

BuffaloWizards,3bvyo8,Euler-Landau,4,Fri Jul 3 00:02:35 2015 UTC,"I really want one of these but international shipping is kicking my ass. It's a shame they're no longer selling the blunder bros shirts, since if they were then at least I could bundle them together to save on shipping.  I might just wait and see if there's any other shirts they come up with before this sale ends, and if not I'll probably end up caving and buying one anyway."

BuffaloWizards,3bw93h,Coestar,11,Thu Jul 2 18:25:34 2015 UTC,honestly I think that was the best thing that could have happened with that event. I only regret I wasn't able to witness the event live. EDIT: Repetition
BuffaloWizards,3bw93h,FrighteningWorld,4,Thu Jul 2 18:44:29 2015 UTC,Ultimately it ended up with a talking Donkey that may or may not be running a combat colosseum after the fact. That image alone makes it pretty hilarious.

BuffaloWizards,3bwwf8,Number333,2,Thu Jul 2 22:57:38 2015 UTC,LOL yea
BuffaloWizards,3bwwf8,discardedcash,7,Thu Jul 2 22:58:24 2015 UTC,I nominate Deadbones for best character because Madlen was an amazing character but so was Coe.

BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,texascsm,7,Thu Jul 2 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"They could have lost if chat donated for the events. The two other donation events were that Gorgons could bring things back to life, and the Blood Snakes turned anything they bit into a Blood Snake. They also would've lost if they didn't have Pat's final gift, as that is what revealed the daughter as the Medusa, otherwise they would've been fighting all the paladins with no way of knowing to kill Heatherfol Threecircle. Rob also had bad rolls, and 6 turns         (Warren, Terrence, Pryor, Madelyne, Desnuttes,Pattenborrow) made it easy to focus fire despite the constant healing. This was also one of the rare times the entire team played smartly, so it was in my opinion a well deserved victory."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,awsomeMrlink,12,Thu Jul 2 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"Audience is still young and I talk about this in the behind the scenes. It's better if the guys are still ""winning"" until the concept of ""winning"" is all but gone. I accidentally helped them out by explaining what they needed to do to win, but they just barely made it. Another round of combat would have resulted in multiple potential character deaths. Their were rolls in that game where I'm a Kobold attacking 3 times and if any of the 6 die being rolled hits a 20, a character dies."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,Rurikar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:18:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I felt they should've lost because of all the help you gave them. I know you are not anti-party, but pro-story, and the story was optimal they way you lead it; but this week it felt a bit like you helped them a bit too much. Not even the healing for half (I agreed with that, or combat would've been infinite), but mainly I mean all the DI's you didn't do in that last battle: I believe you never used it to stop a party attack in all combat (I know they would've certainly lost if you tried harder, but maybe one DI a turn would've felt cool). You say the audience is still young, and I completely understand that maybe it's not ready for a ""sad ending"" with all the party dying, but I guess my question is: With the rolls they had and the decisions they took, a couple campaigns from now, would the party have any chance of surviving that battle? I'm really hoping that the answer is ""no way""."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,Marluck,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:14:36 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the team also acted shockingly well together, and the last few turns were great, and the teamwork is really what won the game for them.  I would say arguably that the Band of Thieves ending was a bad ending, because every character was forced to go their separate way, and really, chat's favorite character was killed off.  Chat events helped the guys greatly this week, and it almost didn't happen. They also almost got fucked because of the brief moment where Justin nearly gave Heatherfol the the necklace.  Also, Roamin almost died which would of resulted in a loss."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,KyKobra,2,Fri Jul 3 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"The team had a few lucid moments, but bad rolls plus bad decisions (Deadbones drinking the quickness elixir too early, or using the wrong attacks on the wrong targets) should equal sad endings.   And I want to differentiate a ""sad"" ending from a ""bad"" one. You say BoT had a bad ending, but in my opinion it was the best one yet. Yes, the party did disband, but it felt like what should've happened given the scenario. Maybe a couple should've been captured or killed even, but this is where rolls come in handy. Philippe's last resort attack and good rolls made sure that Roamin's character didn't die (which I repeat wouldn't have resulted in a ""loss"" per se, but only a really different story) which ensures that he will come back, perhaps really spiteful and wanting to save Philippe's life or whatever."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,Marluck,2,Fri Jul 3 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, this campaign could of went either way IMHO. I think Rob telling the team some stuff about Medusa really gave them some weird advantage which led to a good ending.  I'm more aless group a sad ending and a bad ending together. BoT perhaps SHOULD of went their seperate ways (I mean hell, they were just a random band of thieves). But I guess for me, a good ending would of been that the group stayed together. Philippe could of sacrificed himself, but the rest of the Band would of stuck together. But I see you're point. BoT did feel almost like it was the most complete ending yet, as every character in some way had their story resolved."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,KyKobra,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"I really liked the band of thieves ending. It felt real, the characters screwed up and failed and were forced to split up in he escape. And of course the kobold had to die, he killed elves and was captured. If he didn't die and was just saved by some deus ex machina we wouldn't have any respect for the story because it would feel too safe and devoid of reality/tension. It is like game of thrones, the favorite characters have to be just a bad situation away from death or else we wouldn't feel as invested in their conflicts and dangers"
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,TThor,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I think there's a fair line between the two  There's two sorts of good and bad endings  There's the good ""story"" ending and bad ""story"" ending. In a good story, the good guys win, protagonists win. In a bad ""story"" ending, the antagonists win, the heroes are the defeated/separated and they don't complete their task, like in Band of Thieves.   In terms of good and bad endings, a good ending is the one that resolves the story, no matter who wins, and a bad ending is one where it just feels incomplete.   A good example of a bad ""story"" and a good ending would perhaps be Shakespearean writing (a stretch however it may be) where the protagonists typically die and meet their fate, but the story is complete and told."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,KyKobra,7,Sat Jul 4 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people think they can always win when the series started off with them loosing! The Nuren Campaign ended with Erin supposedly dead, Deadbone trapped in a crystal with his body destroyed, Pause turned into an evil vampire, and the rest escaped by the skin of their teeth without even coming close to getting their objective. Roamin's Band of Thieves ended with Philihipe passing out and being captured, Coe unconscious, and almost ended with Roamin and Deadbones captured or worse and they too failed their objective.  The thought that ""the stakes aren't high"" or that the party will always win is ridiculous as we've seen them fail multiple times."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,Petertwnsnd,2,Fri Jul 3 05:45:41 2015 UTC,"This is actually very true. There's a significant difference between winning and surviving a lot of the time. This week the goal happened to be survival so they were kind of the same but historically Nuren was a failure, Thieves was a failure (they not only failed to steal the sun key but the party was split up beyond repair) Porc Hunters is a win* as they completed all of their objectives with no casualties (pending the results of the mirror drop which could change the historical outcome), Dingo Isles is at the moment another win as the party retrieved the gem and are alive as far as we know (potential for this to be changed is that one if them has a cursed squid arm, Justin's character could go treasure crazy and go back and die, and we don't know what happened when the gem was returned to Nisovin), and Gobos really was kind of a failure in the sense that the ""goal"" was for the family to survive and they lost a brother and multiple pets. They beat the bad guys and had a majority survival rate but definitely didn't come out unscathed by a long shot."
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,cmcdonald22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:48:50 2015 UTC,That's why I found it strange people in chat were getting so toxic about how the guys should win blah blah blah character deaths ruin this blah blah don't donate to negative events blah blah blah. I was like you guys did see the first two streams right they were great and the guys basically got goomba stomped.
BuffaloWizards,3bwx4n,Mobius1B,4,Sat Jul 4 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"Despite bad rolls, they always seem to be able to luck out at the end. (though that luck is usually just Rob having bad rolls too) It's a big of the charm for me, like to see them all come so close to doom and still squeak by. Though even doom can be fun, like the Donkey for Danke. i could not stop laughing."

BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,Tudd,2,Wed Jul 1 02:48:59 2015 UTC,"You would probably get the free turn but not move. Now heres something I thought about what would happen with a spellblade that had blink, blessing of strength and plunder the booty imagine how broken that would be."
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,discardedcash,7,Wed Jul 1 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"You can't double a double. Or else you might as well get enlarge in there as well and start hitting for 80.  Even after that you might think its OP, but is it? You buy a potion of elixir and you get the same effect really for a Wizard doing triple fire balls, add monk secondary and you do 5 fireballs. BoS/Blink are once per round, only NPCs can really break that these days.  To top it all off, lets say you had a crazy character like this. I'll I do is make a melee resistant enemy or an enemy with interrupts of their own or that can purge buffs or that gets more powerful everytime you use an interrupt. Even if an enemy didn't have all that, you gonna run your character against a giant monster in armor who you have no idea what he does and use all your abilities and hope it kills him? Because if it doesn't, you used up everything you got. I know they can gold shot all their treasures and kill something, they don't though. This is why you don't see boss health bars. One trick ponies might seem overpowered in hindsight, but I balance the game with enemies that will counteract anything the guys make each week that I see as a big threat."
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,Rurikar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:55:41 2015 UTC,Ya I suspected the game would be properly balanced thats why you have a DM.
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,discardedcash,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"Kind of the opposite. The game isn't completely balanced, which is why Rob is the GM. He can balance things on the fly if they prove to be overpowered. He has said that he will not, usually, buff something in the middle of the game, but he will nerf or fudge something in order to make the game fairer. The game is constantly influx, and it is balanced as can be considering."
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,gloomyMoron,2,Fri Jul 3 18:35:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's how it would work. Thanks for the input :)  That's an insanely overpowered combination. I don't think there would be feasible way to access it though."
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,discardedcash,2,Wed Jul 1 03:32:42 2015 UTC,Well  spellblade on elf gets to pick 2 spells from other classes and I know at least blink and blessing of strength are spells I think plunder the booty is to.
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,discardedcash,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:47:17 2015 UTC,"Holy cow, you're right. I completely forgot what the Spellblade passive was. That's totally broken, but I'm sure Rob would find a way to nerf it if any of the dudes should somehow come across that combo."
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,discardedcash,2,Wed Jul 1 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"Just checked and you would need to be a booty raider to do it but imagine an elf with blink, plunder the booty, blessing of strength, grapple gun and golden gun. that would be the best setup and its 4 interrupts if you had a 4 damage weapon you use blessing of strength then plunder the booty, cause blessing is an interrupt, so you do 4 times 2 times 2 = 16 damage plus another 8 from the regular melee attack that has blessing of strength that's 24 damage in 1 turn for 6 stamina. With the blink interrupt could kill a boss before it even attacked."
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,Alklaine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:03:30 2015 UTC,"That's so unbelievably overpowered. And on top of that, could you imagine what it would be like if that person had an ally with Divine Intervention? There would have to be a way for Rob to be able to prevent a player from doing that, but I don't think there is. Wow... That's so broken..."
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,doubleupomega,2,Wed Jul 1 04:12:20 2015 UTC,you would probably need to invest most of your gold into a good weapon thats at least 500 gold there probably would have little armor and no ranged attacks.
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,doubleupomega,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:19:55 2015 UTC,Unless it's a hobgoblin and they steal an amazing weapon from the shop. Then all sorts of crazy stuff is possible.
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,discardedcash,4,Wed Jul 1 04:23:33 2015 UTC,Hobgoblins would lose the Elf and Spellblade combo D:
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,keaganwill,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:40:19 2015 UTC,also the 4 from the free attack after blink so its even more over powered
BuffaloWizards,3bpig5,Petertwnsnd,2,Wed Jul 1 04:23:29 2015 UTC,It is if your an elf booty raider since both blessing of strength and blink are spells or if you're a hobgoblin booty raider/paladin/wizard and your party picks the other 2 classes but doesn't pick the skills for whatever reason

BuffaloWizards,3bohs9,Koltiin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:27:16 2015 UTC,Corpse explosion is a little bit on the dull side. Beyond that I think this is fine.
BuffaloWizards,3bohs9,Tundra1232,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:50:24 2015 UTC,"How could I improve it?  The idea is that it could do potentially insane damage if there are lots of corpses-- or backfire and hurt the necromancer really bad.  It would also likely blow up the skeletons, which which could be wonderful or devastating based on skeleton positioning."
BuffaloWizards,3bohs9,Alklaine,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"A better solution would be limit the number of skeletons. The more Rob has to focus on the worse it gets/more confusing it gets. Limit them to like 3 skeles, BUT also make it where depending on your available concentration (Just ask the DM/yourself, ""how into this fight do you think I am?"") makes it where it can lower your max skele count. Critical failure on summon kills all skeles. Also, I would recommend adding an ability that gives starting equipment. A lot of classes have class-fitting items. Exoskeleton is pretty... Rob-intensive. Remembering number of turns immune, halving movement. I'd say cuts like a once per combat limit, and it acts like the item in which you cannot move but are protected for a full turn, but the skeleton remains (for RP purposes). I do like the corpse explosion though.  Nice though, I like the humerus (haha) efforts,"
BuffaloWizards,3bohs9,wilwarland,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:24:56 2015 UTC,"Is there some way to acquire skeletons that I missed, or are you supposed to start out with some? (if so, how many?) Edit: I'm blind, sorry  The only other problem I can think of is that death is relatively uncommon in Robs campaigns (mostly enemies get knocked out), so there are unlikely to be many corpses around."
BuffaloWizards,3bohs9,Petertwnsnd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:43:10 2015 UTC,"Well, that's an easy solution. The necromancer would have incentive to simply finish killing them, similar to the racially driven hostility toward the goblins in the porc hunter campaign."

BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,amayako,25,Mon Jun 29 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"personally what i want to see happen is Philhipé not getting reintroduced for a long time, while occasionally still being teased, until people either forget about him a bit or accept the fact that we'll never see him again, And it becomes somewhat of a running joke.  And then, when we least expect it, he gets brought back, though not necessarily as an ally.  Or if they want to fuck with us even more, they could bring him back, but as a prequel to RBoT, so we still don't get to know his fate!"
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,Tscenzurra,8,Mon Jun 29 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"But if it's a prequel campaign to RBoT we'll likely never know whether it's Philihipe or not. At best, it would be Pete the Kobold, a fairly generic name, and he might not even be called that. Pete was just a name given to him by the Cave Kobold boss, and if he was with a different troupe of Kobolds before, he might have been called anything."
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,Tuskinton,8,Tue Jun 30 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"Plot twist: the campaign ends with them finding a cave full of delicious gems, and then a familiar group of gnomes (and a Dwarf) appear at the entrance of the cave."
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,Nihillo,4,Tue Jun 30 08:26:37 2015 UTC,That would be so evil
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,Rosalen,2,Tue Jun 30 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"I think it would be more fun to do a followup at some point down the line where it's an escape from elvish prison. What would make this a cool episode is that we actually have 2 strong candidates for Elvish prisoners at the moment: Chymera and Phillipe.  Over time we could accumulate more or potentially just create additional Elvish prisoners, but I feel like this kind of revisit has a lot of potential to be great fun. The tricky thing here would be character creation, but that would be tricky with a prison escape scenario no matter what."
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,Lord_Mordoth,2,Tue Jun 30 13:26:41 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic idea! What is two of them get to play as Philhipé and Chimera while the other two create their own prisoner characters, and the leader has to unite all of them in order to escape!  They probably wouldn't have any treasures or anything, so they'd have to knock out other prisoners/guards to get weapons and stuff, and they'd have to be really sneaky or else all hell will break loose!  I honestly can't wait until we get to see characters from older campaigns again, the world they're slowly building is really cool."
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,Tscenzurra,2,Tue Jun 30 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think that a campaign that goes back to previous characters in a way like that would be a lot of fun. It would be pretty cool to see revisits, but in the meanwhile it's been great fun to just watch the new characters being created each week.  Even something minor and silly like this week's revisit to the curse of K4 adds a lot of fun and depth and continuity to the world of URL."
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,Lord_Mordoth,2,Tue Jun 30 15:40:13 2015 UTC,"I dont want to see his return in game, but I would like to see him as influencing lore, in some way.  Like, if any of the band of thieves went off and told or wrote the Tale of Philhipe.    Like he becomes a folk hero in the realm.  People would think ""was Philhipe even real?""  and his name would be  used in the same context that one would mention Herculese.  ""Did you see that dwarf lift that bolder? That guy is a regular Philhipe!"""
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,conno23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"Come on let's be honest.  Philhipe wasn't that amazing or important of a character that he would have his own folk tale/myth about him.  As a community we've made him our favorite character, but if you remember Rob's behind the scenes for Porc Hunters, he said that if you actually thought about it for a second, there was no way the kobold prisoner was going to be Philhipe.  Philhipe didn't do anything major.  He's a fan-favorite, but as of yet, not a important character in the lore of URLive"
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,pyrotrap,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:18:05 2015 UTC,"It is true that Philhipe is not an important character to the realm, however he is very important to the band of thieves.  This includes Deadbones' character, who is a Bard.  Even if not all of the thieves liked Philhipe very much, he is the sole reason Deadbones isn't in prison, and soon to be executed.    Bards like telling tales, it is a rather common aspect of bards. And let's not forget that most folk heroes were not always as important as their tales would suggest.  If you know about Johnny Appleseed, he was just a guy who planted orchards and then sold them. But he is a ""folk hero,"" and his tale has a lot less snake tourniquets and blunderbuss than Philhipe's life."

BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,RealPieIsAwesomeful,7,Tue Jun 30 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that if he had chosen Phillipe, Rob could have just described something that happened during Roamin's Band if Thieves. Rob just happened to describe K4 living with the Great Monkey Fish, making Gobos of Pat confirmed to take place after Band of Thieves, but if he had shown K4 being recruited by Roamin, or K4 cutting that one kobold in half, he could have confirmed that Gobos of Pat took place before or during Band of Thieves. If Phillipe was chosen, it would not necessarily have to be a confirmation of his fate, but could have been an event that occurred before that."
BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,darthfluffy63,8,Tue Jun 30 04:30:36 2015 UTC,"To me Chimera was Shro's Kobold.  It may or may not of been Philipe but when the donations released him, the result was changes.  People could of been happy with believing that Philipe was being transported but but revealing the Kobold, the result may of been changed.  By definition that is Shro's cat style scenario"

BuffaloWizards,3bk4ay,coolpool2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:37:41 2015 UTC,Isn't that just mind project fallacy? A kobold has never in canon been both dead and alive at the same time. A kobold has always been shown on stream to be either dead or alive.

BuffaloWizards,3bkgoi,Qarin_,11,Mon Jun 29 23:21:11 2015 UTC,"I did math this out. It's not that the math is OP on the ability, it's that it's a pain in the ass to count."
BuffaloWizards,3bkgoi,Rurikar,4,Tue Jun 30 01:57:55 2015 UTC,"I can see how that would be true, especially if you've got 500 other things going on all at once.  My point wasn't that this ability is OP and needs nerfed (I don't think it does, the risk/reward factor balances it in my opinion), but rather that the numbers suggest it's a good single-target nuke well worth its cost."
BuffaloWizards,3bkgoi,cmcdonald22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:23:20 2015 UTC,There is another variable at work here consider OPness and overall value. Comparing Stam to Dam ratios you're totally right and SSP seems in the same ballpark as some other stuff. But the secondary effect of added movement isn't one that can objectively be quantified (at least not without figuring out an objective overall value for movement) because its doing ballpark fireball damage but its also allowing potentially 7 spaces of movement in non linear directions.  Not saying it should be nerfed or anything either just pointing out that this move unlike rune blade has a problematic secondary when it comes to value.
BuffaloWizards,3bkgoi,aeam_b,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:57:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that the movement aspect isn't easy to quantify, but here's how I would do it: the movement allows for multiple targets to be hit. We can quantify that, but there are loads of different cases to take into account (eg. two targets hit, hitting each at least once before switching back).  The numbers above are really just a single target analysis. If you'd like to see what moving between targets does to the numbers, I'll see what I can come up with."
BuffaloWizards,3bkgoi,boredompwndu,3,Tue Jun 30 12:24:21 2015 UTC,I can't help but feel that neglecting that the first attack hits makes a h7se different as that is a 5% chance in itself.  Also I'msure there is something wrong as the chance of 7 hits should be less than 6 and even if it wasn't 8+ hits would also play a major role
BuffaloWizards,3bkgoi,boredompwndu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't neglect the entire first hit, just the roll for it. Since the hit ratio is at the discretion of the GM, I felt it not important.  As for the ratios, getting more 7 hit combos than 6 actually makes sense to me. Think about it this way: once you have six hits, the chance of getting a 7th is 13 in 20, or 65%, so statistically it will happen more often than not.  Also, this all assumes a single target. Multiple targets isn't difficult to implement, though, so I might look into it."
BuffaloWizards,3bkgoi,Sceptilesolar,2,Tue Jun 30 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for continuing this ""series"" if we want to call it that. I thought shift style looked reasonable-ish, but I enjoy seeing how some of the weapons and spells play out when math gets involved."

BuffaloWizards,3bisyl,Adobe_Flash_Gambit,6,Mon Jun 29 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"I feel that during the pub quiz, it could be a good way to establish other bits of lore, that dont necessarily get touched on in the streams, and they want people to know before they get to another campaign. But all in all sounds like it could be a fun campaign for them to play."
BuffaloWizards,3bisyl,ThisBeWillis,4,Mon Jun 29 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I feel non-combat related events is something we haven't had much of and is something I would definitely be interested in for reasons such as lore, comedy and content diversity.   Things like riddles, puzzles, mysteries or the pub quiz would for sure be good for expanding the universe while being entertaining."
BuffaloWizards,3bisyl,PrivateChicken,5,Mon Jun 29 16:25:25 2015 UTC,What if there was a campaign that was a knock off of the The Bachelor ?
BuffaloWizards,3bisyl,tjkuhl,2,Tue Jun 30 00:19:30 2015 UTC,It is against the rules to sing karaoke on twitch so tho this would be hilarious it probably won't happen still when they release the tools I'm sure we could make custom campaigns so even if they don't play it on the show we could on our own.

BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,test_marcus,3,Mon Jun 29 03:01:24 2015 UTC,"I love the idea! I believe someone is making a comic-book style version of the campaign, or its planned or is hoped for or something (I don't want to say for sure), so this could be a nice accent to that project as well. I'd be for it!    EDIT: and might I suggest not doing word for word? I think that's fine for the majority, but as someone who as put some thought into this as well, there are parts of dialogue that would be hard to describe as they deal with the board and roles for instance. Adjusting some dialogue so it doesn't put a massive description burden on you is something I'd be fine with."
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,Alklaine,2,Mon Jun 29 03:03:37 2015 UTC,"Oh man a comic book would be so cool! And what I would do when it comes to their dialogue is to have the 'characters' voices be word for word. I was thinking in the written story, there wouldn't be a board or dice of the almighty GM, but just the characters and their adventure."
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,Alklaine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:10:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I assumed as much. There are just several in-character train of thought breaking moments. Especially that occur due to K4 and his curse, and all that. Either way, do your do, I'm all for it!"
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,WildH10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:29:24 2015 UTC,Didn't Rob say he's getting comics of each campaign commissioned?
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,Alklaine,2,Mon Jun 29 06:03:33 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's it. I knew I heard it from somewhere! Thank you!"
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,Quilrond,2,Mon Jun 29 15:33:10 2015 UTC,"I actually was thinking about doing a small community project where we write stories to explain all the weird shit that happens for apparently no reason- Forgotten Tales from the Unforgotten Realms.  Hopefully, we'd find bullshit answers for questions like ""What happened to Nisovin's other pirates?"" or ""What is the story behind Roamin's grandfather book?""  Nothing really important to lore or canon, just small little anecdotes here and there."
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,WildH10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:04:30 2015 UTC,That sounds interesting! We could figure out what's going on with Coober or try to get into the life of that Gnome/Elf and his Eaglebear on the bridge.
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,Quilrond,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:18:33 2015 UTC,"A cool idea, although it might be hard if something we write about gets turned to cannon. But I feel like if we took very minor questions, we might not run into that problem."
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,TimetravelingGuide,2,Mon Jun 29 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"That's the general idea. If we stick to the small stuff, no one will care enough to make actual lore about it."
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,WildH10,2,Mon Jun 29 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of holding some writing contests after the next champaign. just have a central theme and see what the community turns out. Probably with 3 categories. Meta, drama, and comedy or something. I really like the idea of someone doing a ""serious"" rebelling where they take all the improve actions and developments to weave a complex story. Probably won't happen, but hey, it'd be cool if it did."
BuffaloWizards,3bgwfv,5ilver42,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:04:59 2015 UTC,"I've been actually thinking about this myself lately as well. I think it would be super cool to get some of the community writers involved with a story of if not all of the campaigns, at least one or two and turn them into really powerful narratives. If this takes off, I'd definitely love to help out."
BuffaloWizards,3bftn5,killonator74,0,Sun Jun 28 21:11:06 2015 UTC,Comeooon where is that episode 3? I need my fix!

BuffaloWizards,3bg2hc,PuzzlePrism,9,Sun Jun 28 23:06:13 2015 UTC,Yeah...what is the rap battle doing there? That's not music!
BuffaloWizards,3bg2hc,FlorribleBP,3,Sun Jun 28 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the URealms theme is wonderful. Also, ""Fuck the Kobolds"". But that's just about the only defense I have for youtube on this matter."

BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,Pickleheim,9,Mon Jun 29 01:22:08 2015 UTC,"He chose K4 because it was in character to chose him and although I wanted him to pick Felipe, I was very satisfied with him picking K4. It was in character because he acted like a child pressing random numbers on a phone, and it's a lot easier for him to accidentally press K4 rather than anything else. Well played Coe, was really enjoyable to watch you stay in character like that."
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,tak4n,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:22:51 2015 UTC,"I know that, I'm just saying it would have been cool to see."
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,Alklaine,3,Mon Jun 29 13:26:37 2015 UTC,"I think that's what's absolutely beautiful with that (probably) one-time event. The nature of the game is to leave character stories open ended and nothing canon unless proven canon (for all we know the screen was lying), so when situations like this come about, it's a lot of pressure to find out something that itches at you, or be silly like Coe and look at K4 instead of anyone else (like his own character that fell unconscious into the well), or Egoraptor's character, or any of the escapees from the cave during that entire campaign. Anyone really! I'm glad Coe chose K4 though, personally. Curse of K4 is real."
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,TSpades,5,Mon Jun 29 02:14:49 2015 UTC,I was really hoping for him to choose Felipe or Captain Ca-Rell. But was still satisfied with K4.
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,Tuskinton,21,Mon Jun 29 05:59:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was hoping that Coe would look at Dankie."
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,Somniantis27,13,Mon Jun 29 06:08:41 2015 UTC,"""Wait.. you want to look at yourself?""  ""I WANNA LOOK AT DANKIE!"""
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,Jajarz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:43:32 2015 UTC,Then there would have been an endless loop of the TV zooming in on itself to watch Dankie watching Dankie XD
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,Petertwnsnd,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:07:04 2015 UTC,"I, for one, am really glad he didn't say Philhipé. I feel the character has been far to hyped at this point and there's no realistic thing Rob could have shown us that would have satisfied chat/fans. Realistically he'd either be in jail in the mountains, dead, or it would take place before he joined the thieves and he'd just be a normal Kobold. I'd rather the characters fate be left open and mysterious. He's become a legend at this point and should be left that way (for the time being)."
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,theohaiguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:07:43 2015 UTC,"That assumes that Rob doesn't just roll chat by showing Philippe doing something other than the Band Of Thieves Campaign, changing the timeline by showing Felipe munching gems with the kobold group he started with"
BuffaloWizards,3bglqz,Petertwnsnd,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:07:26 2015 UTC,I literally said that.    or it would take place before he joined the thieves and he'd just be a normal Kobold
BuffaloWizards,3beqyc,unpluggedriot,3,Sun Jun 28 15:35:29 2015 UTC,This was truly a great video. K4 x The Great Monkeyfish OTP
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,cc12321,10,Sun Jun 28 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"I pay an animator to make animations for events, if I don't use them one week I mean I plan to use them in future weeks. I don't force them in though, just put them in where they feel like they would fit. While I would love the idea of I tailor everything for every campaign, that's not even remotely possible at the size of the show and you would be expecting way to much from it to think we could do something like that at this stage.  While the animations for donations were the same, the encounters were not. The pirate kobold fight wasn't from previous weeks because it used classes that were introduced in the pirate campaign. The Groundbolds were originally not ""Giant Groundbolds"" you could purchase, but Groundbold assassins from week 1. Triple wield was the same, but again it fit nicely. Same with Elephelks. The first Elephelk encounter was VERY basic. The armor didn't do anything fancy and earthquake was not setup to do permanent arena damage. I liked Elaphelks going first because then Earthquake creates enviromental changes for the next two combat encounters.  Giving the players choices to go left or right did not add anything to the show. I have done three shows now where I gave them choices where to go and it added nothing but to the work load. In the future when I do crossroads, I'm going to make them donation events for chat and explain what's left and what's right because that will add something. But for the guys, they don't really care.  If the choice doesn't matter to the players then you are delusional to pretend it matters. In week 1 they could have gone up or right, but what's the difference? It's a choice they made at the very start of the game with almost no knowledge. Building an entire world just so they make a choice that lasts a minute is a pretty big waste of time. In week 2, again it didn't matter. If they go left they do encounters from the previous week, but they went right and did stuff from this week. You are confusing the illusion of choice with real choices. Having forks in the road has added almost nothing to the game but extra work, it's not that I don't plan to do them, it's that I'm not going to keep forcing worthless choices that don't matter. Next time I make a fork, I'm gonna have it be a chat thing because then its a choice that matters to chat and I can reveal things to them that I can't reveal to the players."
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,Rurikar,2,Mon Jun 29 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"Why don't you create a forking path which has the same encounter? That way, it won't add up to the work and create the ""illusion"" of non-linearity to avoid such rant"
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,dkurniawan,6,Mon Jun 29 02:57:08 2015 UTC,But... that's just linear content anyway...
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,Rurikar,5,Mon Jun 29 03:00:53 2015 UTC,It was merely an illusion of extra content! cough cough I think
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,keaganwill,2,Mon Jun 29 03:29:57 2015 UTC,Extra Credits has a good video on the illusion of choice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45PdtGDGhac
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,Noojuno,5,Mon Jun 29 04:17:39 2015 UTC,"If you are concerned about stale/forced encounters, I wouldn't worry. Rob and the whole BW team seem to be very innovative and just want to make use of missed opportunities before introducing us to the new ones. In my opinion, the arena was a perfect way to do that. I'm confident that we will see a lot of new ideas after the K4th of July break. Also I can't wait for clockodiles to make an appearance."
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,RandumbDude,3,Sun Jun 28 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"It's not so much stale encounters as it is the linearity. In the first two weeks and the Nuren campaign, Rob recommended a path to take, but the guys had full control over what route they took through the area, and the ability to possibly avoid the encounter. Compared to the last two weeks of roleplay, set battle, roleplay, set battle. I prefer the former, but that's a discussion possibly for another thread.  My curiosity is more based on when and under what circumstances will these missed encounters appear again.  Rob took times designing the battle and enemies, along with Nick working on donation animations, so there is no doubt they will all appear eventually."
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,Rurikar,9,Sun Jun 28 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"It's not so much stale encounters as it is the linearity.   You're confusing the illusion of choice with real choice duder. I mean I could have made a boat map that lets them sail to different islands, but if they will never be able to go to multiple islands, then it's an illusion of choice.  Instead that week had combat that was much different then normal because of what the ship created.  This week was about the overarching story. I spent more time creating the first hour of silly RP and then wanted to follow that into doing a gladiator part. You aren't always going to have choices to go where ever you want because that is absurd and not how these games work.  And while some would complain about yada yada you're constantly in combat, yes. Thats the show. In every campaign the guys have been in combat for almost a majority of the time. That will almost never really change."
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,raidergreymoon,5,Mon Jun 29 01:36:56 2015 UTC,"actually it was totally possible for things to have gone completely different. They could have defeated the dwarfs at the start and had an entirely different scenario. Things are more linear this week sure, but their path isn't entirely set in stone."
BuffaloWizards,3bfxe6,Peach774,2,Mon Jun 29 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"They're probably trying different things to see which ones are more enjoyable for them and/or the audience.  Also, the issue with having different paths is that it means their animator has to do almost twice as much work and Rob has to do even more work on the story and campaign."

BuffaloWizards,3bdfut,CorbecJayne,6,Sun Jun 28 11:00:20 2015 UTC,33 out of 489 rolls this campaign. I think I counted correctly based on this. So like 6.75% of the rolls were 4.

BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,CastleNation,3,Sun Jun 28 04:58:04 2015 UTC,"It is almost weird how pretty middling the roll averages came out considering how devastating those 4s and low roles were all game, even though I know that that is statistically how rolls are supposed to average out."
BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,gloomyMoron,2,Sun Jun 28 05:01:49 2015 UTC,"I think it helped that they rolled fairly high at the beginning of the game. But up until that last battle Roamin's mode was 1, it jumped up to 5 in the battle and then went back down again"
BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,gloomyMoron,3,Sun Jun 28 05:07:47 2015 UTC,"I think it is more that the high rolls usually weren't on really impactful events or attacks and that the group didn't really play all that seriously in the beginning. So, a lot of their good rolls were for silly stuff. If it was possible to objectively weight the roles based on importance I wonder what the average would show, but that's not only a daunting task, it is practically impossible because what rolls were important is largely subjective."
BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,Alklaine,2,Sun Jun 28 05:13:52 2015 UTC,"Well, not entirely. Just determining the amount the rolls count for is what is difficult. You can have the weight of non-combat rolls be .5x weight, combat-non-damage/interrupt rolls x.75, and combat rolls-damage/interrupt be x1, but that would give some slightly biased results still, but it's a pretty good rule of thumb. Also, event/supporter event rolls count as x1 as well perhaps, so out of combat rolls aren't thrown to the wolves."
BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,boredompwndu,2,Sun Jun 28 05:23:31 2015 UTC,"Fun facts: The only major outliers for dice rolls were in Coestar's rolls. According to your data, 11% of Coes rolls were 15, and none of them there either 14 or 16.  Justin never rolled a 1 (or a 6, but meh)  Coe had the highest chance of rolling a 4 (~13%)  While there was a fairly even chance of failure/success, there is a slight tendency in failure towards the 5 or less group (difference of 39 rolls/489, as opposed to the 11+ group which was 246, split evenly between 11-15 and 16-20)"
BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,boredompwndu,2,Sun Jun 28 05:30:49 2015 UTC,"Cool to see, I always sucked at stat's interpretation/ teasing things out of data. It'll be interesting to compare it as I'm planning on going over past campaigns and recording all those numbers too"
BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,5ilver42,2,Sun Jun 28 05:46:28 2015 UTC,"Medians and mods are pretty easy stuff, but they do a pretty lame job of counting data. I copied your raw data, and used a countif() to see who rolled what how many times.   If everyone was rolling the same number of dice, it would end there, but Rob almost rolling as many dice as the rest of the group combined throws a wrench in things, so the next thing I did was convert everything over to percents within the person. (number of times someone rolled a specific number / number of times someone rolled any dice at all)  Within percents and roll counts, we start finding the fun stuff. When you start feeling fancy, break things up into rolls of 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20. (Quarters)  Overall, I think these dice felt biased because they were so obscenely fair."

BuffaloWizards,3bdj48,Crockits,2,Sun Jun 28 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"I would say that having a mode doesn't really do anything statistics-wise: since it's a random distribution, it's equally as likely that the mode could be any number 1 through 20. It's not like a median or mean where it should be, let's say, ""biased"" or ""centered""."

BuffaloWizards,3bbljs,cmcdonald22,19,Sun Jun 28 11:41:06 2015 UTC,"Overall thoughts:  The stream was really long. The pacing at some points got really bad and I found myself just tuning out whatever was going on. The final combat was really good though and saved what could have been a somewhat disappointing campaign.   I liked some of the characters, Coe and Deadbones' in particular were very strong and memorable along with Terrance, but Warren seemed a bit all over the place and Justin's character wasn't super well defined.  I was a bit disappointed when Dankie died as I thought he was the strongest character RP wise and while they gave his new character, Don, a lot of things in order for him to play, the RP wasn't quite as good after that.  I have to say I'm getting a little worn out of these really linear boards. It made sense for the Jewel of the Dingo Isles since they were confined to a ship for most of the campaign, but I miss the days of the party choosing which path to take and finding ways to sneak around encounters. A lot of these encounters felt forced and there was no way around it except to fight through it.  The NPCs were unfortunately pretty forgettable this week with the loosely defined Pat dying early in the campaign and not much else for them to interact with later. Even campaigns like Porc Hunters which had few NPC interactions did a good job at making a few very memorable characters like Porbo. I know they were already stretched for time but I would have like to have seen a bit more character from the final boss or something who seemed really cool.  Donations seemed to come much slower this week and I think that has to do with the fact that most of them didn't look that appealing. I may be mistaken but I think the only combat to use all three events was the Elefelk one and Rob had to basically interrupt combat in order to advertise to chat why they should get the last one.   The chat feed was also pretty bad this week. I think it had to do with the fact many of them were getting bored but a ton of people started arguing and trying to backseat GM causing everyone to plead Coe to turn on Submode.  I really liked the mentioning of K4, not because of the fan service, but because I thought it did a lot of good world building by finally giving us a frame of reference of when this is happening. It was much better than accidentally having the Lt. Surge mace without explaining how you got it or running into Dave without any real context of when this takes place.  Table tops update was really frustrating as things were a bit off this week. The ways certain chips acted and the absurd amount of low rolls (4's in particullar) is almost enough cause for suspicion to call fowl on the game for screwing them over.  Overall I enjoyed the campaign although it's not one of my favorites. In the upcoming week off I think some things need to be re-thought through as certain aspects of the game just didn't work well this week."
BuffaloWizards,3bbljs,Petertwnsnd,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:37:11 2015 UTC,"I don't have the source, but didn't Rob say this week's supposed to be more combat based?  As for ""linear boards"" this week was really narrowed by the donation events. The knocking at the door led to them being captured, the necklace led to Medusa, etc. However, an arena storyline HAS to be linear. There was no escaping, no stealth, nothing. The bits in between were for Roleplay which would be rewarded with free tactics. I will admit I'm not a fan of arena's in games as they really do shoot the players in the foot, but I think this one was handled well enough.  To me the story in this one was fantastic, the double twist with Medusa, the hinting about the necklace, and the vision of the future we're all great, especially considering 2/3 of those were improv.  From hearing that, you could guess I liked the NPCs, the Kobolds were tricky, Willis was interesting to say the least, and Heather was, well the main villain! She bounced back and forth from seeming evil, to good, to evil. Which is good character development in my book.  Sure Pat seemed minor, but he was brought up several times throughout the livestream, and had a lot of character produced early on which led to distinctions later in the story, this is a common trope, mainly because it's a good one! His death was really a twist, and it led to the adventure.   I respect your criticism, but I guess I really can't see where you're coming from. This was one of my favorite weeks in terms of story and pacing, I'm not trying to start an argument, I'm just sharing my opinion.   For the more meta stuff, Chat's pleading for sub-mode was ridiculous. If you don't like the chat, don't look at it. Yes, ""K4"" was spammed, but only when it actually applied. There was no overwhelming emotes, or trolling going on unless it was provoked, like ""danger"" or ""coecake."" This is ignoring the argument that broke out, which in my opinion was interesting, to say the least, just because I've never seen one in a stream this large, or in slow-mode.   The mods/Coe (whoever turned Sub-Mode on) need to not listen to spam begging for sub-mode. If it was Coe, I understand that his attention was divided between the game, chat, and RP; so hopefully that was a lesson for him. If it was a mod, they need to know their job is their job for a reason. They need to see when Sub-mode should be enacted.   As for chat being bored, that happens with stream crashes, it's unavoidable.   I had a problem with my own Tabletop gameplay as well, but thankfully an update came out yesterday and it seems to be running smoother.   Okay I'm done now. Sorry : )"
BuffaloWizards,3bbljs,EpitomeOfWhat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:33:08 2015 UTC,"I just want to make sure I mention this: My whole comment/rant was sort of stream on consciousness shorty after watching the stream in its 8 or 9 hour entirety, live, very late at night.  I understand an arena campaign needs to be linear and I guess that's not what my problem is with it. My problem is the fact that we got another linear campaign directly after our first linear campaign. Plus with the week off in between them and the week off coming up, both with no campaign we end up with about of month without the non-linear campaigns that we started the series with. If it had been thrown in later this summer it wouldn't be a huge deal, but I at the moment, because we don't know what plans Rob has, it feels like the campaign are getting more and more linear and I don't want them all to be like that.  In my original comment I only really mentioned the final battle and that doesn't seem fair. I REALLY liked the final battle. As I mentioned I was not a huge fan of other parts of the campaign and as it was getting late I was considering leaving the stream and watching the rest later. However, when we got to the final battle and they started talking to talk to Heather and talk about the force field and started putting things together I got excited. Heather's turn was fantastic and my only gripe with it is that I wished she had talked/taunted the party more after she revealed her true form. The idea of a manipulator has only really been used with the Whisper Snake and I feel a boss on this level could have been a lot cooler (something like Loki). I also love how chaotic everything became during the final battle. All of the sudden Heather turned into a huge Medusa, Justin was fused together with Pat, Coe who had just become a telekinetic talking donkey all of the sudden became mind-controlled by the bad guys, Dwarf Paladins started pouring into the arena, everything kicked off. I just wish the rest of the campaign had been a bit more like this.  I don't feel like Pat's death was a twist. Some people could have guessed he'd die before the stream even started and once he talked about how his family died it became very clear that that was foreshadowing and Pat was likely going to die. I feel like his death wasn't even necessary. The party got captured and was going to be forced to fight anyways. There's a lot of other things they could have done like having the party blackout out right as the axe comes down leaving it a bit ambiguous, he could have been captured and had a whole mirad of things happen including being used as a hostage when the party revolts or have him fight the party in the 3rd round, there's a lot they could have done with his character and his death wasn't as impactful as it could have been either. As far as his personality,he didn't have much of one. He was basically a gay pedophile innuendo joke. He only had one well defined relationship and that was with Justin. I would have liked to see more unique relationships like his relationship with Pryor, who he didn't raise, or Madelyne, who had her actual father still in her life in addition to Pat. They tried to establish a relationship with Warren by having Pat trust him as the leader, but Warren didn't really do anything leaderly. He didn't particularly help anyone get up the stair case, he didn't lead the group into battle, and he didn't save Dankie when he had a chance. I think this mainly has to do with how Roamin plays as his theif, Yumi, wasn't a great leader either.  Personally I felt like a lot of things dragged.  It took a little long to get to the inertial Dwarf invasion fight, the Elephelk fight felt liked it dragged and I toned out for parts of it, and even the Kobold fight took too long with them taking forever to finish off the last few. I liked the Dwarf fight but as Rob made clear it was intended to go much shorter than that and I think it showed with how long the other fights went and how long the campaign went in general. Rob kind of backed himself into a bit of a corner when he stated that they had to do three arena fights. Personally I think they could have cut the Elefelk fight and the pacing would have went a bit better. Either that or they could have made it an Arena campaign from the start and skipped the Dwarf fight and Pat storyline.  I admit I was one of the people who requested submode. At the time a most of the chat was just complaining and people were arguing. While I usually enjoy chat it was becoming very toxic and on whole most of the active chat agreed sub mode should be turned on for a bit till people calmed down. A lot of people have said it was ridiculous but it definitely worked and other than a vocal few most people were fine with the decision. It had nothing to do with spamming ""K4"" or ""Danger"" or anything.  I too respect your criticism and I just want to clarify on some of my thoughts."

BuffaloWizards,3bbljs,EpitomeOfWhat,14,Sun Jul 5 04:52:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are asking for recaps in the twitch chat, so this is probably easier. I'm not sure the canon spelling's on names, so please hate me as much as possible.  The Many Bad Rolls of Pat: A Summary  We open on a house in the woods, the owner: Pat (there's more to his name) loves his Goblin children that he adopted, especially Justin. Justin and Pat spend many hours ""meditating"" together, definitely creepy sex stuff.   Today is the Goblin's anniversary of being adopted by Pat. Pat got each of them presents, Madelyne got a blunderbuss; her dad got a hug; Coe got a Crystal Flat Screen that could view any URLive character at that moment, establishing a timeline; but DezNuttes and Roamin didn't get a present after Coe accidently put on ""Dwarf Smut"" on the TV by typing K4 in on the remote.  The flatscreen showed Justin's first official URLive character, Kobold #4 being massaged by the Monkey Fish from the ""Roamin's Band of Thieves Campaign."" Making this campaign canonically after that campaign.  Pat destroyed the TV after seeing the practical porn on TV, and stormed off with Justin. Roamin went and talked to Pat, and Pat apologized for overreacting, and decided to give Roamin a piece of paper stating he'll inherit his fancy mace when he dies.   Pryor (Madelyne's dad) talked to Maddie about what was on TV and got very angry at Coe. He rushed downstairs and tricked Coe into drowning himself, but Coe thought the water was too cold. Pryor returned to the couch and Pat asked Roamin to gather the family for a sing-a-long. Roamin went upstairs and after Terrance creepily hit on her, Madelyne and thus Maddie kicked Terrance extraordinarily hard in the crotch right before heading downstairs for the sing-a-long.  Right when they were about to start they were interrupted by a knock at the door. Suddenly Dwarves swarm into the house, demanding to arrest Pat, leading to the current combat situation. With Ramsters busting into the house and Justin high on Swammies who knows what will happen next? During the fight Coe becomes a badass Ramster mounter, ala Chris Pratt, and Roamin's character: Terrance was blinded in his left eye, destroying his prescription goggles. Proving once and for all that ""the goggles do nothing.""  Pat made sure to get each of the Goblins upstairs as the battle raged on. As they sat in upstairs DezNuttes began to meditate and saw a vision of the future, which showed Pat dying, as well as Pat being ""inside of"" Justin. We also learned more about Maddie, who seems to strive for equality for goblins, among other things. After a long battle the dwarves stood victorious over our Goblin friends. The lead dwarf knocked majority of the team unconscious as they hid upstairs. But Maddie, Pryor and Terrance all watched in horror as the Dwarf cut off Pat's head.  We learned from the Dwarf Paladin that Pat was a former member of their team, and that the paladins killed Pat's family causing him to leave the order.   As the stream fades to black, one question sits on everyone's mind... How is Pat going to be inside of DezNuttes when he's dead?  -Intermission #1-  Now the heroes awake in a mysterious dungeon with a group of Kobolds. Maddie informs them that they've been sentenced to death, and that their only chance is to win 3 arena matches, assuming the paladin order holds true to their word. On top of that they killed Scott (the wolf) and Scott (the comb). Things are seeming very strange to the Goblins, as the order isn't acting like Pat described.   The Kobold prisoners begin to talk to the Goblins. As chat begins to freak out about which of them is Filipe, one named Scott cons Coe's map of his house. And one named Reginald (Reggie) decided to show kindness and give them hints on how to take out the Elephelks they'll fight in round one, but reminds them that they'll be fighting in Round 2.  A dwarf comes in and announces the first round of combat. The Elephelks, stand in front of our heroes, in the midst of a creepy arena. The audience claps slowly in unison and the dwarf in charge mentioned himself that he doesn't know what he's doing. Everything seems extremely off, but there's no time to deal with this as the horn blows and the battle begins.  As the group manages to slay the last Elephelk. The crowd grows and they all begin to chant ""Goblins, Goblins,"" in mysterious unison. As the dust clears Roamin is left with a choice.  -Intermission #2-  As the gang comes back Deadbones found a Rat and named it Summer. Roamin decided to carve the Elephelk's horn into a staff. And the Greenskins decided to read Coe's tumor's mind, learning that it's hyper intelligent. But alas, the fates frowned upon the group and decided to just take the stream down, but there is hope! The music resumes.  They're back! We resume with Maddie defending the ""lesser"" Goblins once again. Their conversation was interrupted by an Elf chatting with the Goblins, making it extremely clear that she really hates Goblins. The Elf asserts that no Elf would take in Goblins.   After more disturbing comments by Terrance. Coe rushes out to the roughed up arena followed by the Goblin crew. After a thankfully failed trade with the Kobolds, The dwarven leader, Willis, begins his speech marking that combat has started, but in it we learn that the Kobolds are pirates and that Willis thinks there is a King and Queen. Which increases the confusion for the audience.  The group finally manages to kill off the remaining Kobolds. With Donkey Coestar in tow, the group loots the room and leaves the arena, heads hung low mourning the loss of Danke, a beloved compatriot. Well... it's either that or because they just got the hell beat out of them by a group of furry rocks.  -Intermission #3-  Our heroes return to find out their new Donkey friend has telekinetic powers, and can actually speak. Justin consumes the rest of the his swammies and they enter the arena. Their final enemy is Heather, who claims to be the daughter of Pat. Shocking plot development!   Using Justin's necklace and what the Dwarf announced, they convince Heather to rise up against the Dwarven leader. But there's a magical barrier in the way, and she seems extremely interested in Justin's Necklace! But Don, the Donkey somehow fell through. They decide to send Justin through the barrier, as he has a magical necklace, but he fails to make his way up the stands.  The dwarf blows the horn and the battle begins. With a reluctant competitor and a very angry dwarf, what will happen?  Deadbones force pillars Justin up to the Dwarf and throws him into the ring. Pissing him off so much to the point of him calling in his entire army. Moments after Justin feels a tickle deep inside him, he pulls his necklace off, and hears the voice of Pat call out to him, ""crush it.""  Justin begins to throw it away, when suddenly he's urged to smash it in his palm. Upon doing so Pat fulfills the prophecy, and emerges inside of Justin. Suddenly Justin has two minds inside his, Pat can now act through Justin.   Upon seeing the necklace crushed Heather grows extremely angry, and transforms into Medusa, her true form. It turns out it never was Pat's daughter and that Heather was actually mind controlling the dwarves the whole time.   Knowing this, the party stands before an army of innocent dwarves, compelled to attack our heroes against their will. Sadly Don the Donkey falls under Medusa's curse as well, and now stands on her side.  Who will win? What will happen?!? FIND OUT by watching the stream. I'm out. Thanks for reading."

Sub mode was the only way to calm down chat at the time. Heck, even people who wern't subs were asking for sub mode.  Sub mode only occurs when something happens that requires chat to calm down, such as the stream going down, or an argument. If you arive to the stream and you see it on, odds are something happened and chat is being given time to calm down. Until the sub mode is lifted, just relax and enjoy the stream."

BuffaloWizards,3bbljs,pizzabash,2,Sun Jun 28 04:58:41 2015 UTC,"What an....""interesting"" stream. I really felt like Rob learned a lot to bring into future games. He mentioned that he needed a way to speed up encounters when they need to fail/the story needs them to struggle with it and that coupled with how Chat killed Coe... I'm really lookin forward to the next game. And everyone's assuming that chat was mad but from what I saw, in the first half of the game, people didn't want to donate because they wanted the encounter to go by faster because the roll play aspect was so much more enjoyable. Between Deadbones and Coes characters, I honestly didn't want to see them get hurt. I cared about them and wanted the. To be happy. When Madilyn started to cry, I actually felt bad and wished we had an event to bring back Scott or something. It was funny how Dankey died, but at the same time, I could feel the pain of the loss for the sad scared band of Gobblins that were forced to fight.  Despite the chat and the long run time with reeeeaaallly long fights, I still enjoyed the stream and thought that this champaign was pretty unique. Can't wait for after the 4th!"

Great character choices and roleplaying.  I don't know if it was just me (but the pace with which donations were coming in seemed to agree), but the donations events felt pretty off this week--and I mean this with a lot of love and hope for improvement; not as an accusation. In the beginning, it felt like the campaign was stalling until donations finally came in. If this is going to be a longterm thing, which I really hope it is, I don't think that's a tenable model."

Maybe players are in a labyrinth for some reason fighting/racing for treasures inside, or something similar.  This was a great stream.  The only negative thing I'll say about it is the maps seemed kind of limiting.  Maybe the huge first couple maps (including the ones from nuren and Roamin's Band of Thieves) spoiled me though and it's a perspective thing.  Anyway, great job guys."

BuffaloWizards,3bbljs,pizzabash,0,Sun Jun 28 06:00:10 2015 UTC,I feel like rob made donation events way too high this week. It seems like everyone ran out of money early on. I don't think we'll even get close to getting the 1k done.
BuffaloWizards,3bbljs,pizzabash,-6,Sat Jun 27 23:12:07 2015 UTC,Yeah im fucking done with this stream and im not going be donating any more money to them. I fucking hate submode it ruins the whole point of this kind of stream.

Dankie with the on-point oneliners and general derpiness had me crying of laughter (plus I'm Afrikaans, ""Dankie"" is Afrikaans; gotta have loyalty to my countrymen...er...realmgoblins...). The headbanging, the Monkeyfish x Dwarf porn, the constant mounting, the waving, they were all hilarious.  Madeline (or however you spell it) was surprisingly deep (I bet Terrence would concur) for an angsty teenager. I loved the GAGD and the loyalty to her pets (the first one anyway) and family, and the kiss at the end was a nice touch. Prior was pretty cool too, and surprisingly smart and collected for a drunkard, but I personally liked Madeline more out of the two.  Romaine's conjoined goblins was pretty unique, and I liked how they were essentially foils of each other (wow...never thought I'd use literary devices in the real world ._.). Terrence's obsessive desire to raid a certain booty was funny even when the party was on dire straits and while Warren was a good leader, Terrence stands out to me between the two.  Finally, Goblin Desnutes, a glorious name. I quite enjoyed the...special bond...he had with Pat. I know it wasn't his doing, but the occasional ""wow"" during his cutscenes was quite funny as well. Also, the final namechange was too perfect.  Jeebus, didn't mean to write a review. Either way, although the incessant 4s (curse you K4) were literally starting to piss me off, the ending was so clutch that it was worth it. Top kek Rawbert Moran, Deebie Booners, Cooster McBooster, Romaine/Ramen, and SCJustin. 9+ hours well-spent."
BuffaloWizards,3bd4s6,Imagine_Baggins,5,Sun Jun 28 07:54:08 2015 UTC,"I really liked all them for different reasons but Madelyne was my favorite. While everyone was picking on Dankie, she stood up for him (I was totally shipping those two). Everyone else but Dankie was hitting on her too, and her reaction to all of that was great. Honestly the kick to balls she gave Terrence made her my instant favorite, everything that followed form her just made me love her all the more."
BuffaloWizards,3bd4s6,Fallkon,3,Sun Jun 28 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed! So far in these campaigns, deadbones has shown how good he is at playing a wide variety of characters. One of my favorite parts of the stream was when Madelyne made the GAGD."

BuffaloWizards,3bd4s6,TSpades,3,Sun Jun 28 03:42:07 2015 UTC,"All of the character's had their moments, and it actually brought it all together in, well, almost a cliche Hollywood movie plot line. (I mean that as a compliment of comedy)  Desnuttes was the favorite of Pattenborrow and had been specially trained, and was so trusted by him that he chose him over all of the other goblins to let him feel him inside him.  Warren was a go getter, trying to do the right thing. Terrence was just a little shit. Warren seemed to get exhausted and cared less as things progress, while Terrence remained unbearable as ever.  Pryor. He was a decent dad at heart, though he was a terrible ass, he was cruel and degraded the Hobgoblins. Madelyn didn't like that at all, and was the only one other than Pat to stick up for them.  Pat's death was horrific, especially for Madelyne who not only witnessed it but She also had to bear the loss of her wolf, Scott.  Dankie was the lovable fool. His death was really sad for me, Though at the same time completely hilarious. It would have been nice to see him grow and have a friendship with Madelyne. Maddie was in a ball crying during one of the battles even. His death was the second fall for our heroes.  Don. Well... Yeah, he was just great. Heehaaw Mother Fuckers!  Desnuttes' arc came around when he began feeling Pat inside him, and let Pat release inside him as well. Pretty EPIC animation there."

BuffaloWizards,3bd4s6,Nihillo,2,Sun Jun 28 04:59:02 2015 UTC,"Pryor was definitely my favorite; Deadbones played him very well, and I enjoyed every single one of his interactions with the group and NPCs. Even though Warren was supposed to be the leader, it was nice to see Pryor be the responsible adult the group needed after Pat died. I think they made it out alive thanks in no small part to Pryor stepping up when shit hit the fan."
BuffaloWizards,3bd4s6,Mega_muncher,2,Sun Jun 28 10:07:54 2015 UTC,"They were all great, but I would give this one to Coe. Dankie was an hilarious character, and you gotta give him props for rolling with all the crap he had to put up with, that includes dying, having to play as a pet for the rest of the game, being neglected by his team and finally being forced to go anti-party.  He's not the only one would've been able to pull it off, of course, but he still deserves recognition for actually going through all of that. It's gotta be sad to be the only one to lose all of your characters, all in the same campaign."

BuffaloWizards,3bd4pf,Qarin_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:58:06 2015 UTC,There's really not any fast way to do it; it's all random selection from a set of numbers 1-20. The programming isn't hard; it's just some looping with conditional statements.
BuffaloWizards,3bd4pf,Bur_Sangjun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:39:09 2015 UTC,It's just 20 choose n over 20 to the n
BuffaloWizards,3bd4pf,Bur_Sangjun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:22:30 2015 UTC,"Actual Maths:  1: 100% (20/20) 2: 47.5% (190/400) 3: 14.25% (1140/8000) 4: 3.028125% (4845/160000) 5: 0.4845% (15504/3200000) 6: 0.0605625% (38760/64000000)  If anyone wants to generate the values for higher orders this is the equation.  ( 20Cn ) / ( 20n )  where n is the number of rolls  So, for example, the chance of getting 20 rolls is  20C20 / 2020  or 9.537e-25%  And obviously, it's mathematically impossible to get any value less greater than 20. As the minimum the die cna go up each time is 1."
BuffaloWizards,3bd4pf,Qarin_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:02:21 2015 UTC,Would it be ( 20Cn - 1) / 20n to account for rolling a 1 on the first roll?
BuffaloWizards,3bd4pf,Bur_Sangjun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"20Cn is 20, so no"
BuffaloWizards,3bd4pf,Qarin_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:19:01 2015 UTC,Your first iteration should not have a 100% success rate though. Statistically it should be 95% (rolling a 1 is a miss regardless).

BuffaloWizards,3bc7hk,TheLastSparten,3,Sun Jun 28 00:11:48 2015 UTC,"Base 16, also known as hexadecimal, is when the number line is 0 to 9 like normal, them it has A, B, C, D, E, F. Which represents the 11th to 15th numbers, then you get back to 10 which is the 16th number.   Different number systems are weird and really hard to conceptualise if you haven't heard of them before. 6*2+5 = 17 =16+1 which in base 16 is 10+1 which is 11."
BuffaloWizards,3bc7hk,Chockrit,3,Sun Jun 28 00:55:21 2015 UTC,"In Base 10 (Decimal system you're used to), every digit is a power of ten. 1's = 100, 10's = 101, 100's = 102, etc  Works same way in any other base. Base 16 (Hexadecimal) 1's =160, 16's = 161, 256's = 162.   The digits in hexadecimal go 0-9 but also use A-E to denote ten through fifteen.  For example, 215 in decimal = 2 * 102 + 1 * 101 + 1 * 100.   In hex, 3D7 = 3 * 162 + D * 161 (which is 14 * 161) + 7 * 160   6*2 + 5 = 17 in decimal = 11 ( 1 * 161 + 1 * 160) in hex"

They're behaving themselves now, but before it was just too much and we needed sub-mode to make chat calm down."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,AmbitiousHobo,9,Sun Jun 28 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"As I said on the other thread:   Subscriber mode was used as a tool to mitigate the situation in chat, right or wrong.

I don't think chat really had a chance to stay free at that point. I'm sure once this comes back, it'll be placed into slow-mode once again, after the Jimmies are unrustled.   I do feel you though, this stream is special because of interaction, and taking away the majority's voice is like cutting our legs off. But in this situation I think it had to happen.  Edit: Said this before noticing slow-mode was reengaged. But it's back!"

I completely agree that one of the great things about the show is the viewer interaction, but we need to be responsible with it."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Phijkchu_Pikachu,7,Sun Jun 28 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"...You know Coe's chat isn't the only place to interact with other viewers, right?"
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,TornStar,2,Sun Jun 28 01:04:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this sentiment for one reason. Chat is chat. Without chat, you should just go and watch the vod, as there is little to no benefit to watching a livestream."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Phijkchu_Pikachu,9,Sun Jun 28 01:07:10 2015 UTC,"Ooor you could just chat in...and don't let me blow your mind too hard here...another chat. Coe's chat, again, is not the only chat that exists.  The benefit to watching a livestream is to watch it live. You can talk to whomever you want, while it's live, with absolutely no problem regardless of sub mode.   Not sure what's so hard about that to grasp."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,cellojake,0,Sun Jun 28 01:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, and twitch has a chat function for the ease of talking to a lot of people at once. I do not care to talk with a select few people who I know, I enjoy the banter. Yeah, you could watch it live in another chat, or you know, you could just get a group together and watch it later.   My sentiment stands, the main reason to watch a livestream on twitch live is twitch chat."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Maxattack1126,5,Sun Jun 28 01:12:15 2015 UTC,"The chat needed to be slowed down. It is not like this is a permanent thing, it was used to control chat."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Phijkchu_Pikachu,3,Sun Jun 28 05:00:32 2015 UTC,"I think what he means is watch it on deadbones or rob's channel, since they are hosting the show, which means they would have their own separate chat. Sure, it would be less people, but it would still be a decent amount of people chatting, and a decent amount of people to interact with."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Maxattack1126,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that as well. I like the chat. I like the chaos of 300 people. Kicking out a majority of the chat elsewhere to wander around. Max, I love chat. I live in it. I like the banter as I keep saying. You are correct, it is less people, and that ruins it for me, as I do not want to talk to the same 10-30 people who will always just use Deadbones chat room, I rather talk to 500 random people at one time."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Phijkchu_Pikachu,3,Sun Jun 28 05:10:28 2015 UTC,"Then occasional submode for when chat gets extra roudy or salty is a tradeoff for when you want a bigger chat, unless what you desire is a spam filled chat like an LCS stream or something. If submode does become a common thing, then sure, there is a problem with not letting the average viewer interact, but I think for now, you can't just go no submode, because people can get too rowdy (yes, even for twitch chat). I don't necessarily enjoy it, but I think you need it once a stream gets big like this."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Maxattack1126,0,Sun Jun 28 05:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think you have me wrong here max. I have no problem with calming chat down. I was just arguing against Torn's statement that ""...You know Coe's chat isn't the only place to interact with other viewers, right?"""

I've been on pain meds for a while because I fucked up my knee, and its been messing with my ability to focus lol. But I guess if you really do enjoy the huge chat, then it is the best place for you to get the full experience. I understand where you are coming from, I used to chat a lot, you know that. But like, for the time when it is submode and stuff, its a possibility to go to the other chats and talk. Not necessarily for the whole stream, but just for a little bit until things calm down and chat is released."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,PickShark,0,Sun Jun 28 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, no worries m8.

I hope your knee heals soon Max, have a good one m8."
BuffaloWizards,3bcx6i,Phijkchu_Pikachu,2,Sun Jun 28 17:54:43 2015 UTC,"that's completely a personal preference. there's no need to attack people who would prefer a smaller, more intimate chat. Not everyone likes the chaos of 500-700 people spamming mostly the same ideas/comments. there are more than a few of us who prefer civility. to be able to have time to discuss. 90% sure thats what /u/TornStar was getting at here. not everyone is like you"

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,Imagine_Baggins,12,Sun Jun 28 01:03:38 2015 UTC,"Class:  Powder Wizard    This class is an explosive based class. I guess I could of called it a demolitionist but that would be boring. It can output high damage through combos and is strong against immobile enemies and large groups of weak enemies.    Abilities:  Black Powder Keg   This ability hits hard for anything that cant get away from the bomb before it detonates at the end of the Powder Wizard's next turn. It works well if another party member keeps them immobilized. If paired with some sort of aoe immobilize it can clear out a couple of enemies. EDIT: I changed the damage from 10 > 14 & range from 4 > 5. The reasoning for this is as follows:    The enemy must not move for a turn for it to be hit. Has low range. Not a spell, thus cannot easily have the stamina cost reduced. Compared to many other spells, 10 damage is not a lot for the amount of conditions that need to be met.  For example: Fireball can be cast at 10 range and does the same amount of damage and most importantly, it is much more reliable to land.    Ignite Weapon   The Powder Wizard can ignite it's own weapon or somebody else's weapon do deal increased fire-based damage. This effect will last for two of the receiver's turns (it will only last one turn after the cast if the Powder Wizard uses it on itself); that is enough time for one enhanced attack from the caster's weapon or TWO enhanced attacks from another's weapon. This ability will combo well with Pocket Powder!   Final Flare   Had to photoshop the aoe icon in, could not find it on the card builder.    This ability is used well as a final gambit or if the Powder Wizard is not concerned about it's stamina. This ability can also set up well for Black Powder Keg since it will stun the enemy and keep it immobilized. Of course this ability can only be used once per combat, lets not be silly.   Volatile Powder    This is a very situational ability that can pay off well if you find a good opportunity to use it. It can clear a whole horde of weak monsters if they are cluttered up. Keep in mind that in order to start the explosion, the first hit must kill an enemy at or under 3 stamina, and only creatures adjacent will be hit by the explosion. A good fight to imagine it's use for would be the Gemlord fight in the Roamin's Band of Thieves campaign.   Pocket Powder!   Since this ability is an interrupt, the Powder Wizard can attempt to avoid an incoming attack at close range, as well as setting up for extra damage from any fire-based attack (or anything that would make sense to ignite). The easiest way for a Powder Wizard to ignite the powder would be: Pocket Powder! > Ignite Weapon > Melee Attack. OR if the Powder Wizard has a blunderbuss. Although I'm sure you could figure out other combos involving the other Powder Wizard's spells and other class' spells. Keep in mind; Volatile Powder will only ignite Pocket Powder! from the resulting explosion, not the initial hit.     Powder Wizard Album  Artless Powder Wizard Album  Previous Submissions"
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,k_main,2,Sat Jun 27 04:17:33 2015 UTC,These are really nice abilities for this class I just think the name could be different because Power Wizard sounds like a sub class of Wizard.  Cool class idea man.
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,Codywild1234,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch man. I understand what you are saying but, I think the name Powder Wizard is fine. I chose the name because it deals with explosive powder and has hints of magic in it also, it is just fun to say. Since there are no subclasses, I don't think there should be much confusion for it. Honestly, I wouldn't mind if the Powder Wizard was considered some kind of subclass if it existed. The Powder Wizard shares some aspects with a Wizard such as using fire to do massive amounts of damage and aoe damage. You could almost imagine a Powder Wizard as a Wizard that relies more on physical materials to use it's abilities. In the same vein, would you consider a Deathknight / Dragonknight a subclass of Knight or a Booty Raider a subclass of Raider if such a class existed? I personally don't think so, because like the Powder Wizard, all of these classes share aspects of their identities with the surname of their class but, at the same time, they are all their own unique class.  Sorry for the long paragraph. I am just trying to explain my reasoning behind the name. At the same time, I completely understand your reasoning too BUT, I am sticking with it.  Edit: Whoops, grammar."

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,PixelScarecrow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great concept.  You might need to balance some of them out (Swashbucklers get very useful gear right off the bat, Paladins get +1 bonus damage in very specific cases) and just rework some of them (The free staff on sorcerers basically means all their abilities cost one less than stated, becomes rather redundant.  Focus on bound weapon idea)  but I think it is a great idea to give the classes passives.  Might want to change them to the blue class cards and just put the passive symbol though."
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,Entrox_Licher,2,Sat Jul 4 19:34:26 2015 UTC,Okay I have changed them to blue class card and changed some Passives: http://imgur.com/a/M5pqK I will go over some of the changes. First of all I changed Paladin's passive to be be more impactful because there is a chance they don't fight any undead in a campaign. I do think sorcerer should start with some type of weapon so i gave them a dagger instead (I think there abilities make it easy to backstab). I have 2 theurgist passives because I don't know which one I like better. I changed Cabalist's passive because they kind of have a possible negative effect (should I keep the change or not). And for the Swashbuckler (and Buccaneer) I'm having a hard time to think of pirate passives that suit them so i didn't touch them. I would like your thoughts on the changes and any idea for different pirate passives.
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,PixelScarecrow,2,Sat Jul 4 21:20:30 2015 UTC,"Nice changes, here are my thoughts.  I think the Paladin passive should get some sort of bonus that isn't directly tied to undead.  Keep the stuff that is there, just add some other thing that isn't completely reliant on there being undead to be effective.  I like the idea of giving the sorcerer a basic weapon to be bound, but I would buff the effect of bound weapons, make them do more than be instantly summoned.  With the theurgist, instead of doing the first hit, or half damage, I would give them a small initial, independent stamina pool (5-10).  They can take their own damage until that is depleted, and then the caster takes their damage as normal.  With the cabalist I like the theme of dark magic, but I think it's a bit too circumstantial, like the paladin.  Also, as a general rule, I think it's better to put 'resistant to dark magic' than an actual number, so the GM can work with it more, less math, etc.  You accidentally named the Swashbuckler as Bucaneer.  I think the Swashbuckler's passive is perfect really, and it suits them well, maybe even through in a Freeboot Coat (Or maybe not, not sure).  For the Bucaneer, I would give him a captain-focused passive, maybe something like imposing authority or raising morale.  As for the others.  While I like the idea behind Bard, I don't think there are really that many musical items/treasures in the game.  I think it would be better to design say 3 treasure, a lute, a flute, and drums, for example, and have the bard choose one.  I think the Booty Raider passive is perfect as is.  The monk I think is too circumstantial, again, but I like the strong spirit theme.  I like the Warrior one a lot, as it encourages going in face first, but you would have to specify how it is he survives; heals for 10 stamina, becomes immune to that last hit or for a full round, something like that, for logistical reasons.  For the wizard one, I would make it so they can force spells at any time for free, but with the penalty you mention.  You have to specify the penalty though, because in its current state it is still unclear."
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,Entrox_Licher,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"Here are some Instrument Treasures: http://imgur.com/a/93ZMb I made them utility based and was going to change the bards passive to ""Bards start with a free musical Treasure of their choice. In addition, Bards may use instruments as their movement.""(it basically gives bard another minor ability). For paladin I was thinking 1)when he uses a spell his aura becomes stronger so until his next turn his aura affects all enemies. 2)his aura protects allies reducing damage by 1. For Sorcerer, i was thinking 1)that the bound weapon marks targets so that the next time the sorcerer attacks them it deals 1-2 extra damage (might be to complicated). 2) attacking with the bound weapon lowers cost of spells by 1. For the theurgist, I like your idea with the independent stamina pool but i think air sprites messes up that idea because summoning 3-4 sprites with 5 stamina seems to be too powerful, for the earth and water sprites it fine. For cabalist I changed it so that he took 1 less damage from all spell/magic attacks but he is unholy now. So maybe ""minor spell resistance"". The monks passive i was thinking that maybe Cleanse/resist the first ""debuff"" in battle. So if someone casted a Fog and that was the first ""debuff"" he came in contact with, it wouldn't affect him. I don't know how too phrase that on the card though. For the warrior i was thinking that once he takes that damage he would go in bloodlust rage and interrupt whoever's turn it was to do his 2 actions and after the action he remains at 1 hp (unless he has an item that allows to attack and heal). I like your idea for the wizard being able to force spells at anytime. As for the penalty i was originally thinking n+1 was the penalty to his max stamina (where n = number of times he forces a spell) but i think thats too complicated so maybe reduce max Stamina by 2-3. And for the Buccaneer I need more time to think about it."
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,PixelScarecrow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:42:17 2015 UTC,"I really like the new instruments, and I think the idea of Bards using them as movement would be interesting, but it would have to be seen if it's OP or not, I'm honestly not sure.  They should still start with one instrument free though.  I think for the Paladin I would just rework it into a passive damage reduction, or maybe the Paladin can do a chivalry-esque thing for nearby allies.  If you start doing the other way it just gets too complicated seeing when the Paladin did a spell, mathing out for everyone in range, etc.  I like the bound weapon marking in theory, but you are right about it just getting to hard to remember and stuff.  Maybe do a risk-reward system for them, where the bound weapon will do extra damage if it siphons some of the sorcerer's stamina, but he can get some or all of it back if he hits, but if he misses, he just loses it.  Very good point with the air sprites, hadn't thought about them.  Maybe just make it so each elemental has a different value, maybe 2-air, 5-earth, 10-frost, something like that?  I think maybe minor magical resistance sounds better, but yeah pretty much that would be good.  Now I understand what you were going for with the monk.  Say something like the monk's pure and steadfast mind allows them to see past any impediments and just give them overall advantage against debuffs.  For the warrior you need to be careful though because if he gets killed with a crit on grunt #1's turn, than even with 2 actions, grunts 2-10 can take him out pretty easily later.  Make something like he becomes damage immune or recovers some stamina.  I agree that keeping track of the wizard's forced spell cost would be tedious, but I'm not sure about the max stamina reduction, I just don't like that mechanic in general, but I don't know what other penalty to impose.  Another alternative is to make it so they can cast any spell as an instant for double cost.  But I do still like the spell-forcing idea though...  Still no concrete ideas for the Bucaneer, just that it should have something to do with his authority, his presence, something like that."

Say the player used Devourer of Souls the last encounter and got it on their first try, the DM could say ""You devoured its soul making it so that its soul now inhabits your body"" or something of the sort so the encounter wouldn't end so easily. The class functions that you can have your move do 5 damage a turn if you manage to stay onto an enemy with munch, a way to heal and gain objects for regurgitate or to swallow something for roleplay with Swallow, a way to spit anything out for either a ranged attack if you swallowed something big or an interrupt to something with regurgitate(Though both distract the party/enemies and in roleplay unless you are all devourers the party probably thinks less of you for doing something that disgusting), an interrupt to give you an extra turn at any point when you use Finger Munch even though it takes away a finger each time, and lastly a way to kill everything in melee range with Devourer of Souls.

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,nightcaller92,2,Tue Jun 30 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"A new class called; Vikings Blessing of Odin This ability card would give you a strength buff, and will last the entire combat session. This card cannot be used as an interrupt, and is only a one-time use per combat. This ability have a range of 5 and can be used for allies. What the card does: When used in battle it can’t be used again until the next combat begins(once per combat). When casted the player must role a dice. If the player roles a 1(critical) the player will lose 1 attack dmg (And it is up to the GM if one of the foes should get a buff in attack dmg) if the player roles a 20 the player will gain 5 attack dmg for the rest of the combat. What I would suggest is that low roles will just do nothing to the player, otherwise when the player roles average and higher, the GM should decide between 1-3 extra dmg. The extra attack dmg is not stackable with other abilities, tho if a player has a sword that deals 2 dmg, and you get another 2 dmg from this ability, it would be 4 dmg, and if the player rolls a 20(critical) the bonus dmg, would be based from the 4 dmg, and not the 2. This extra attack dmg will only count for melee dmg, and not ranged dmg. This card is over powered as hell, therefore I have decided that the stamina cost of this ability card, should be half of what the dice shows, if you role say a 19, then we would say 10 stamina cost. If rolled a 3 it would cost 2 stamina, even if the action fails. This ability also have a range of 5, this means that the players allies can also be effected by this card. When a player decides to cast this on another player/allie, the allie cannot go down in dmg only up. Summon Fenris (Fenrir) This ability card will summon a pet wolf witch is a slightly larger tile then the others, and I able to move 7 tiles each turn. The wolf is commanded by the player that spawned the wolf, and can stay around even after combat is over.

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,DaDeltaDrum,2,Sat Jul 4 02:20:19 2015 UTC,"Class:  Puppeteer  spells:  Sock Puppet:  You pull a puppet from your pack and give it a simple form of life.  You can control it on your turn.  Its only melee attack is to jump onto the face of its target and attempt to suffocate it.  Once it starts attacking someone, they are incapable of speaking or casting spells until they defeat the surprisingly resilient and stubborn puppet.  The damage that it deals will double each round until either it dies or its target dies.  Low stamina cost.  Meat Puppet:  Temporarily take control of another character's body.  You can't make them use any class abilities or cast spells, but you can make them dance, or punch somebody, or jump off a cliff.  You control them on your turn.  On their turn, they can roll to see if they break the spell.  You both roll a die, and whoever rolls higher, wins.  You do not lose any stamina from this spell until it is broken, and you take one point for each turn that the spell lasts.  Soul Puppet:  Capture the soul of a dying character and put it into a puppet.  That puppet now has the mind of whoever you put into them, and they will act accordingly.  You can choose what kind of puppet body to give them.  High stamina cost.  Hand Puppet:  You turn a glove into a puppet and give it life.  It becomes like an extra hand to you, and any damage done to it will be felt by you.  You can make the hand run around and do whatever a disembodied hand can do.  Low stamina cost.  Bone Puppet:  Animate the corpse of a humanoid as a stumbling sack of rotting flesh.  Its arms flail uselessly and it has no melee attack.  The only command that you can give it is a direction in which to shamble, and it will keep trying to walk in that direction until you tell it a different direction.  Medium stamina cost to cast the spell, and one extra stamina per round to keep the corpse animated.  Voice Puppet:  Like ventriloquism, only better.  You make another character say any words that you want them to say.  You can make an enemy give bad commands to his troops, or you can use this on an ally to convey information to somebody who would otherwise be out of earshot.  Massive range.  Low stamina cost.  No Strings on Me:  Easily break free of any kind of mind control or stun, and heal yourself for five points.  Can be used as an interrupt, but only once per round.  No stamina cost.  Gepetto's Wish:  Your puppet becomes a real flesh-and-blood creature.  For example, you can turn a sock monkeyfish into a real monkeyfish, or a finger puppet of a dragon into a real dragon.  High stamina cost.  You must have the puppet in hand or within reach to either cast this spell or to cancel it.  Tangled Wires:  Ethereal strings attach to two of your opponent's limbs, you cross the strings and pull.  An interrupt that turns your opponent's 20 into a 1.  Low stamina cost, but can only be used once per combat, and only in self-defense.  Take the Reins:  If Character A has cast a mind control spell over Character B, you can take control of Character B away from Character A.  You now control character B.  You can't release them from the mind control, but it will be easier for them to break your control than it was when they were controlled by Character A.  Medium stamina cost.  items:  Plush Kobold:  Unlike real kobolds, which are rocky and covered with sharp edges, the plush kobold is soft and squishy and covered with soft fur.  Use this puppet with ""Soul Puppet"" to turn your dying enemy into a harmless little toy.  Can also be used with ""Sock Puppet.""  Iron Marionette:  A highly-detailed work of art, with fully articulated body parts made of the strongest iron alloys.  Perfectly attuned to the magic of ""Soul Puppet"" and ready to turn your dying friend into a tiny metal man.  Stick Figure:  A wooden marionette with fewer moving parts than the iron version.  Very fragile.  Could be a good vessel for a ""Soul Puppet"" that needs to be more capable than a Plush Kobold, but not as strong or as durable as an Iron Marionette.  Sock Monkeyfish:  The perfect little thing to become a ""Sock Puppet.""  Made from two of your old socks, it smells a bit like feet.  You probably should have washed them before turning them into a monkeyfish.  Element of Distraction:  A pendant made of a strange metal that defies discovery because it doesn't want to be found.  When you wear it visibly, anybody who looks at you will feel compelled to turn their attention to your puppet, instead.  All of the best ventriloquists are rumored to use these to keep their audiences from noticing when they move their lips.  Invisible String:  A mainstay of the marionette-maker, invisible string allows you to put on puppet shows without anybody ever seeing the strings.  Probably useful for a bunch of other string-related stuff where you don't want anybody to see the string.  Talkie Teddy:  Ask a question and pull the string.  This magic puppet knows everything, but you'll have to roll a die to see how much it tells you.  Googly goggles:  These goggles come with a pair of googly-eyes that have a strong adhesive on the back and can be placed anywhere.  Wearing the goggles allows you to see whatever the googly-eyes see.  Punchin' Judy:  A violent little puppet that lives in your backpack and pops out whenever somebody attacks you.  It carries a large stick that it uses to parry the attack, but if it is overpowered it will hide in your pack and not come out again until combat has ended.  Fun Finger Friends:  A veritable menagerie of simple finger puppets, with several of every kind of living creature, including some mythical creatures.  Excellent for entertaining children and idiots.  Often used in conjunction with ""Gepetto's Wish"" to give the Puppeteer a variety of creatures to choose from."

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,dokoattack5,2,Sat Jun 27 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"Maxian - Race from the Core  Hello everyone. I have wanted to make my own race with all kinds of racials and treasures. I hope you like it and can give some constructive feedback.  Lore  Origin Maxian's origin is not known to many, but they appear to be made of white marble. They look like an elf, but can be seen by their white skin and eyes of jewels. Adventures, who have said to have met a Maxian, have expressed a large different in behaviour amongst them. They appear either very friendly or very aggressive.   An old myth speak about a goddess giving the first of the Maxian’s live. She blessed a jewel from a cavern near the core of the world and laid it in a body of marble, giving it life. This jewel have been theorized to give the Maxians their behaviour. A jewel is said to be inside every Maxian. Maxians have since lived beneath the earth, where they were first born, secluded from the outside world. It is not known, how other Maxian’s came to life after the first one.  The City For centuries, the Maxian civilization have lived under the earth, far beneath the upper layers. Here they lived in a giant city known as Maximulius. This city is in a cavern filled with jewels of all colours and shapes, lighting up the cave with a mysterious light. In the middle enormous is the high seat where the council, and more importantly, the High Maxian lives.   The High Maxian  Once per millennia, a Maxian is born with all three sub-race attributes. This Maxian may challenge the High Maxian to become the next High Maxian. The High Maxian is the leader of the civilization and is the absolute greatest fighter. The High Maxian is blessed by the goddess herself; gaining a greater effect from the sub-race attributes. It is the High Maxian’s job to protect his people from outsiders whilst keeping Elemental Lords and various other threats imprisoned.   The Vault Maxians are mostly righteous people, wanting to protect and fight evil at any costs. They have, over many millennia, caught many dangerous monsters and imprisoned them in their city. The treasures and powerful relics of these monsters have been kept away in The Vault, together with other powerful Maxian artifacts. The Vault is what many adventures try to find, but none have gotten out alive.  The Shattering The Maxian civilization have been secluded from the other races up until now. A giant earthquake have shook the cavern and have opened up to the outside world. Many of these dangerous treasures have disappeared from the Vault and many Maxians have gone out into the world to reclaim these treasures. Some amongst the Maxians have also went up to the outside world to trade. Maxians are almost as good smiths as the Dwarfs, but the Maxians ability to commune with the elements have given many of the items and additional ability, if wielded by a Maxian.   Cards for UR Live Race   Maxian   Sub-races * Smoothskin * Jewelskin * Roughskin  Roughskin Attunements:   Fire Earth Ice Wind    So for the Maxian race and subraces, i really wanted something to do with their origin story. Marbleskin is a easy one, but the subraces were a bit harder. I'm pretty proud of how the turned out, especially Jewelskin and Roughskin. I think they could make a lot of interesting fights.   Treasures  Maxian relics   These treasures are relics only given and created for Legendary Maxians. These are powerful weapons, wielded by the greatest defenders of the Maxian people.    Claymore of the High Maxian High Maxian Blaze Armor Archer Commander's Longbow Earthwarden's Belt Gift of the Maxian Thinkers Greathorn of the Elders Jewel of the Council Maxian Darkdagger    The dagger is my absolute favorite item i've made. Hope it gets used.    Maxian Priestess Staff Shield of the Maxian Gladiator   Treasures of the Imprisoned   Many of the relics, that had been taking up to the outside world were weapons and items wielded by the most dangerous of enemies ever seen.    Wrath Hammer Trinket of the Shadowlord    This thing can do some damage if wielded by a boss    Ice Fiend Acid Lord's Cudgel   Items   Of course some of the Maxian traders brought normal items up to the outside world, these items are especially potent if wielded by a Maxian.    Jewel Wand Smooth Marble Bow Roughrock Sword    End note  If anyone or Rob himself is interested in seeing more treasures or items, i will do more. But right now they serve as a good way to see the idea behind it. I would love to add more Maxian treasures, which also adds an extra layer of play, if wielded by a Maxian. I may also add some lore to each treasure if needed.  Link to full album"
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,MaxeIi,3,Sun Jun 28 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is just amazing, really, really fantastic work.  The lore you put behind, the sheer number of cards you have created.  I absolutely love it, and congratulate you for making this.  I would suggest taking away number values (Most of the Roughskin attunements have the 17) as there are many mitigating circumstances that make secondary effects easier or harder (For example lighting an ice creature on fire would be a lot easier, lighting a fire creature would be near impossible).  Most of the treasures would have to be event-exclusive or boss-exclusive, or simply not be a part of the standard circulation, as some of them would be a bit OP.  Great work all in all."
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,Entrox_Licher,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your interest!  The idea about the roll values in the Roughskin Attunements was mostly to balance them out to not always get their benefit. I do agree with your arguement for secondary effect values. That can easily be fixed.  This ""treasures"" was indeed made to better fit the role of ""Relic"" type weapons and other things, which could be found in events and bossfights. These are one-of-a-kind items and as you said, wouldn't be found in standard circulation.  Again thanks for the interest and appreciation."
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,MaxeIi,2,Sun Jul 5 11:16:03 2015 UTC,"Not at all, with pleasure, I encourage you to develop it further.  One thing that would be interesting would be to create Items, not Treasures, that could be bought at the store with similar Maxian-boosting effects, for a Maxian centered campaign.  Then the Relics would be used more outside of these Maxian centered campaigns and more as a big Maxian encounter that might drop the loot or be just boss-exclusive (Like Chimera the Kobold's treasures).  Think this is great, if there is anything else I could help with, please ask."

I remember during a stream when rob was creating classes for this the first time around, there was an alchemist or something that had an ability to copy itself splitting stamina between the copies.  I think it would be fun to have an irreversible form of that, and hey the copy will need to find its own armor and stuff, it might be a fun mid campaign moment.  I can't work the card builder on this tablet and I'm not good with descriptions but I like the sound of Twism. I want it so much, would use the hell out of that."
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,AndWe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:16:43 2015 UTC,"Here's a few card submissions.  Treasure  Ryknar's Maw - Essentially this is supposed to be a cursed treasure, but there was no sort of icon to indicate that.  Celestial Serum - Made this for the fact that I will most likely submit more cursed treasures, so why not have a cure for them? This might actually need a nerf on cursed treasures like Ryknar's Maw as doing double damage at no extra cost sounds pretty absurd.  Opal of Recapitulation - For when your or a teammate's attack was just too good to not repeat.  Transient Foresight - Also known as the get-out-of-character-free card.  Accessories  Nevermelting Snowflake  Ending the submissions with the class Feycaster, which has the gimmick of summoning fey to perform basic attacks. They may also immolate themselves to attack, heal, or buff you, an ally, or an enemy. The last thing they can do is sacrifice themselves to augment a weapon with the specified element to do increased damage. Another note is that Feycaster's are meant to be able to either summon two fey or one fey then immolate or augment them on a single turn, assuming you haven't moved or performed any action or attack. On the assumption that there are two Feycasters, they may only control the ones they summon as no matter what the summoned fey are completely obedient to their masters. Their abilities are as followed:   Summon Forest Fairy These guys deal 2 damage but only have 1 Stamina. Summon Fire Imp - Fire Imps are meant to be summoned more on the front lines of battle, therefore they have 5 Stamina, they only deal 1 damage. Oh and no you cannot immolate them right before they get killed unless you have some sort of wack ability that says you may use an action to interrupt. The 10 range is meant to show how far they may charge prior to immolating themselves. Summon Water Sprite- They only have 1 stamina and only deal 1 damage. Keep these guys in the back so your heals don't die. Summon Wind Pixie - This one may be subject to change. Wind Pixies would naturally deal 1 damage and they have 3 stamina. Summon Entropy Puck- Like the Forest Fairy they have 1 stamina and deal 2 damage. Their immolate is set so it would never stop a 20 or make something a 1, this may be subject to change upon a DM's request.   That's all I have for now. Until next time, enjoy the show!"

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,Uppercasenumber,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:14:05 2015 UTC,"Here is an all female race I have developed. I have taken in considerations for current races and NPCs that have been shown. I present:     Nimp     Also known as “The Sisters.” There are no mothers, there are no daughters, and no men! These women are elemental base (loosely elemental…) and are brought into the world every hundred of years, coming into being in waves of hundreds of thousands. Yes, there are the NPC race of elementals… the frost, air and earth spirits. These are their pets, which they are not always fond of the other races controlling them…     What else is unique about Nimps? There are 7 sub-races, based on the 7 Deadly Sins:     1) Narcia *(vanity) - element of light 2) Dweller *(envy) - element of dark 3) Brimstone *(wrath) - element of fire 4) Minx *(lust) - element of air 5) Avarice *(greed) - element of minerals 6) Sloth *(sloth) - element of earth 7) Gorger *(gluttony) - element of aroma see cards for more descriptions of each     These sisters are passive in nature. Brought into life in the wilderness, they migrate towards towns and clusters of other races. These women live to play tricks and to tease. However, cross one, and you will feel the power of all of them coming down on you hard.     And the Narcia… you know vanity is supposed to be the deadliest sin of all? Well they are very much aware of Gwyneth and her Sun Clerics. Narcias have a very subtle distain towards Gwyneth, claiming they are more beautiful and the true controllers of the sun. Help us all if Gwyneth pisses one of them off… can we say most bitchy badass cat fight ever!! coughcough* And of course, all the other sisters have their quirks. The Sloths and Gorgers are the two grungy ones of the group, sometimes a little derpy… Brimstones and Avarices are more of the tomboys, not afraid to get rowdy - You might find a Brimstone in taverns heating up the place, starting bar fights while an Avarice is picking on a greedy Goblin, having them chase around fake coins. Don’t get a Kobold around an Avarice! She feels uncomfortable transforming and manipulating around them because they always try to eat her! The Dwellers are more of the depressed type, preying on other races to make them belittle themselves. Lastly there are the Minxs, who love tampering with the air quality, making people hook up and cause drama. Nothing like a good scandal! Nimps are always loyal to each other though, so don’t piss them off! They just want to have fun…. but don’t underestimate them.      (nimps came from nymphs and imps - the blend of personality and physical characteristics I imagine for this race.)"

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,Bendy_Blog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:05:05 2015 UTC,"The class is called Shapeshifter.  most attacks or abilities will involve turning into some kind of creature, either completely or partially.  limitations: can not wear armor or any clothing of substantial bulk.  can only turn into mammals; no birds or bugs or lizards or fish or marsupials.  abilities:  eye of the liger:  turn your eyes into cat eyes for two or three rounds, or until you perform another transformation.  bloodhound: turn your nose into a dog's nose for two or three rounds, or until you perform another transformation.  you can track anything or anyone by their smell.  tree climbing: you gain the agility, hands and feet of a monkey for two or three rounds, or until blah blah blah.  hung like a horse: quite frankly, this is the ability that makes many young men want to become Shapeshifters.  you have a horse penis.  use it responsibly.  goat coat:  do your skimpy clothes leave you feeling a bit chilly?  grow a goat coat!  if you then shave it off you can knit a cashmere sweater for a friend.  gliding: survive a long fall by turning into something resembling a flying squirrel.  one round.  dairy king: you grow an udder and produce one bucket of cow's milk.  swimming with fishes: you become a dophin-man and can swim like a dolphin.  you remain in dophin-man form until you get out of the water and can not perform any other transformations until you do so.  playing possum:  if, for some reason, you need to play dead, this is the ability to use.  slows your breathing and heartbeat to almost undetectable levels.  every turn you must roll to see if you can keep doing it.  wolf pack:  howl like a wolf while simultaneously covering yourself with wolf-scent.  if you are in an area that has wolves, 1 - 4 of them come to you and treat you as their leader.  you can communicate with all wolves with yips and barks and growls.  works independently from ""talk to the animals"".  talk to the animals:  only works on mammals.  you can talk to them as if they were people.  GM can either choose to voice the animal characters, or appoint another player to the task, or bring in a special guest star to be the voice of the creature.  mouse-like reflexes:  huge bonuses to dodging all attacks and detecting traps.  increased range of movement (7 instead of 5, and 15 while sprinting).  can smell cheese from miles away.  politician's tongue:  there is a strange race of mammals known as ""humans"".  from them you gain the devious ability to convince anybody that anything you say is true, no matter how preposterous your lies.  beaver cleaver:  you gain the teeth of a beaver and can gnaw through trees, logs, wooden furniture, etc.  attacks:  butt-head:  you grow the horns and thick skull of a ram.  does medium damage and leaves opponent dazed or unconscious.  medium stamina cost.  melee range.  gorilla attack:  with the strength and ferocity of an enraged gorilla, you rip and tear at your opponent's flesh, maiming them in a gruesome manner.  high damage.  high stamina cost.  melee range  skunk spray:  anything and anyone behind you will be covered with a noxious scent.  some creatures will be affected more than others.  some creatures actually enjoy the smell.  low stamina cost.  high range.  elephant stomp: you gain the legs of an elephant and step on some toes.  smaller damage but breaks legs and feet.  high stamina cost.  melee range.  slashing claws: your hands become the paws of a big cat, and you attack with your razor-sharp claws.  does medium-low damage but any decent roll will leave your opponent bleeding.  medium stamina cost.  fairly useless against heavily armored opponents.  melee range.  porcupine quills:  defensive interrupt.  if your opponent is attacking you with their fists, or attempting to grapple you, they will regret it.  no stamina cost.  stampede:  you turn into a buffalo and charge forward ten spaces (no less).  can go right through walls and does high damage to anyone who doesn't dodge.  low stamina cost but you take damage when you go through obstacles and people.  anybody in the way must roll very high to successfully dodge.  unlike ""charge,"" nobody can jump onto your back, and nothing can stop you from going all ten spaces.  rabbit punch:  leap over your opponent (no taller than twice your height and no more than two tiles away), and kick them in the back of the head, landing in the tile behind them.  medium stamina.  medium damage.  leaves opponent dazed or unconscious.  grin and bear it:  your mouth becomes the mouth of a large bear, and you bite your opponent.  high damage.  medium stamina.  if your opponent tastes bad, it could cause you to be distracted for a round.  do not use this attack on undead creatures as you may become infected.  boar gore: you grow the tusks of a wild boar and use them to gore your opponent.  medium stamina.  reduces opponent's maximum stamina.  whale tail whallop:  you grow the tail of a whale and use it to attack.  the tail is very ungainly and using this attack will leave you laying on the ground afterwards, but you are able to flail around and hit everything within a 3x3 area.  high stamina.  medium damage.  will knock enemies back at least one tile.  shapeshifter items:  leather loincloth:  barely covers your naughty bits and offers no protection whatsoever.  has one pocket in which you can carry a single, small item.  mantle o' morphing:  a fancy-looking cape that reduces the stamina cost for any transformation spells.  if a non-Shapeshifter wears it for a long time, they start to slowly transform into whatever they subconsciously see themself as.  fuzzy undergarments:  provides a bit of protection against cold and very little protection against attacks, and reduces stamina needed to use abilities that involve becoming furry.  makes you look sexier, and has a cute little tail.  talisman of liquid form:  worn around the neck, this talisman reduces the stamina cost for any transformation into a beast of the sea (such as whale tail whallop or swimming with fishes).  for all other classes, this talisman gives a small bonus to swimming ability."

BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,DarkMotron,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"I know there are a lot of ""Curse of K4"" ideas going around. But I'm going to submit my idea of what a card relating to K4 could entail.  Curse Card Title: Curse of K4 Description: All 4s rolled by a character inflicted with this curse become K4s. If a K4 is rolled a second, ""K"" dice is rolled (in the form of a six sided die); low roll (one/ two) equates to a zero, an average roll (three/ four) equates to a one, and a high roll (five/ six) equates to a two. The 4 is then multiplied by the ""K"" number and becomes the resultant roll (low= 0, average= 4, high= 8).  Rob can decide what a zero resultant roll means. Is it just another chance of a critical failure the same as a 1? Is it somehow worse? The 8 would make the attack/ whatever action successful rather than a failure, but possibly not greatly successful (Think, you've made the best out of a bad situation).  How the card may look (Keep in mind there are side-notes still on the card itself to make it easier to understand. The Card would obviously also not be a ""Treasure"" card): http://i.imgur.com/0jaRgho.png  I know that Rob isn't big on math inside the game. I wouldn't even submit this as an idea if I didn't think that it wasn't straightforward enough. The 3 possible results are listed on the card. How much easier could you get? As a curse card it wouldn't get too much use anyway. I think it'd possibly make a great little joke within the group if however, Rob were to implement it within the story and force it upon a character in the middle of a game (Think, Roamin all of a sudden gaining a behemoth arm, as reference to how it may go. Possibly without the need of a supporter event, or maybe so if Rob wished it to be)."
BuffaloWizards,3b8n1r,ShadowFoX33Omega,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:00:02 2015 UTC,"I already posted this as a seperate thread but someone pointed out that it was supposed to go here. I'll just copy paste the post.  Hello friends,  I was thinking of a class that basically worked like the paladin's divine intervention but instead focuses on getting in the way of your enemy rather than helping your allies. I came up with the Jester, and came up with the following spell ideas:   Insult to injury 1 stamina 1/round Interrupt You perform a dirty trick on a creature that was just dealt damage. Dirty tricks could include examples such as tripping, pocket sand or pulling down someone’s pants. Mock 3 stamina You mock target creature, making them furious with you. The creature must roll twice on every roll and take the lowest result until they successfully damage you with an attack or direct damage spell. Mock may not lower a critical success unless the lower roll is a critical failure. Mock ends automatically when you die, but not when you go unconscious. (It’s like a debuff version of DI. I originally wanted to give this class a DI for his enemies, but then I noticed that DI already does work on enemies so I designed this instead) Punchline 3 stamina 5 range Spell Tell a joke to all targets, causing them to burst into hideous laughter until they take damage, attempting to snap out of the spell each turn. If the target cannot hear or understand you they will most likely resist. (It’s a language based mezz based on the booty curse. Rather than having to face you and giving a chance of a free treasure this ability only works on targets that can hear and understand you unless you roll a 20) Laugh it off 3 stamina 5 range Spell You amuse target creature, healing it for 10. In addition, many negative effects are removed from the target. Using this ability reduces your maximum stamina by 3 for the rest of the campaign. (This would remove many debuffs at the DM’s discretion based on the roll, so for example it could remove being on fire but it would not remove a permanent mind control (apart from a critical success maybe). The stamina reduction is a placeholder for whatever the penalty for healing will be.) Killer joke 1 stamina You may perform a weapon attack against a creature as a move action dealing a maximum of 2 damage. If the creature is below 10 hit points after your damage is dealt it dies from laughter. Slapstick Interupt 0 stamina Activate only after any character (PC or NPC, including you) rolls a critical failure. You may take an action. This action may not lessen the effects of the critical failure. (This ability might work better as a class trait/passive if these do ever get implemented. It’s basically an inverse sea swagger based on slapstick humor)   I was also thinking of a jack in the box themed spell but didn't see a point in adding another crowd control spell unless it's distinctly different from Punchline. It could also be a pet mechanic. I just know that rob doesn't like traps so it shouldn't be that. This is also a perfect class for trickster/deception spells such as mirror image, but it might be best to save these for an actual illusionist/trickster.  Please share your ideas:)"

Cutting edge aim: Range 5, Stam 1 - Throw a well-aimed knife at a target dealing 3 damage. This almost never misses.    Sharp-eyed: Range 5, Interrupt, Stam 1 - Move to one adjacent tile and respond by throwing a knife that deals 2 damage.

From there, my brain came up with the idea for a stone in a fantasy world to draw all liquids towards it, including blood from inside your arm, making that part of you very strong and at the same time very frail if damaged.  Edit: I just had to add the ""normal"" Swetstone seeing as how I put an adjective over the first one.

BuffaloWizards,3b4jl5,AvidDTech,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"I think what would happen is the entity would choose a character from the book that has enough detail to ""flesh out"" into a person. They would then attemp to go through the story as best they could, changeing it as they go to fit their experiences.  Now something that Zi think would be cool is if one of theses books embodied a spell book, and became one of the spells. A flare, zipping around, randomly blinding people, that when killed drops a flare spell book(single use, probably). Or a grand raven's claw. Or a fireball. Or a blizzard. In the center of each ""spell"" is the posed book, and if it is killed the spell stops. Could be an interesting encounter."
BuffaloWizards,3b4jl5,tamwin5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:32:48 2015 UTC,"What I was thinking as along the lines, they know they turn into books, but they do not see that as being different to the race they are seen as.   Each book person takes on the role of one character from the book they are from. Once a book person dies in it's humanoid form it turns into a book closed, the book is damaged but if re-opened it comes back to life.   The only way to destory a book person is to destory the book in it's book form( eg. Burning it), or you dispel the magic of the book.  Normal books in general do not have self awareness, but it is possible that they could as we saw cannon Arin's character conjure a living being. So I see no problem with some books being self aware from the magic besides encyclopedias and dictionaries."

BuffaloWizards,3b1r73,PrivateChicken,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:11:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I love the idea of the Psycho Shrooms. What if it were anything that touched a Psycho Shroom came under the effects of the hallucinogenics? That way Pyscho players would have an interesting trade off between providing a buff for their team, but providing buffs for enemies if they get hit.  The only problem I can see with a racial ability that buffs teammates is that it's never not going to be used in a fight. Sure, there's a penalty to using it afterwards, but the possibility for lots of back to back crits makes it sooo worth it. If every party member takes a lick whenever an encounter starts, they're garunteed to come out of the gate swinging with several crits every single encounter. That's great for min-maxers, less great for telling stories. Rob has a tendency to use crits as a storytelling device. They provide natural highlights for the narrative arc of the encounter. That, plus their unpredictable nature helps keep fights fresh and novel.  So basically you need some sort of control valve, there needs to be some mechanism so that psycho shrooms don't buff every teammate every encounter. Either the penalty is so large it's only worth it in dire situations, or the buff becomes less effective with repeated uses."
BuffaloWizards,3b1r73,FungiCharizard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"What if the buffs grow and shrink? Like the first roll gets a bonus to crits, the second roll a lesser bonus of crits with a slightly increased chance of failure and then the third roll is only a boost to failures?"

The Fane would basically be like humans, but they would have brightly coloured skin of any colour in the ROYGBIV range. They wouldn't technically be all female, but the men would live for a max of 25 years and the women would live for hundreds of years. They would be tribal people led by Grand Fane, who are a lot bigger than normal Fane and have 4 arms. That would be kinda it.

Then the third part involves trying to defend their dungeon from the heroes that try to take back the valuable thing.
BuffaloWizards,3avap6,FrighteningWorld,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"That sounds really fun and funny to play, but I feel it wouldn't be very entertaining for the viewer."
BuffaloWizards,3avap6,Godheadweasel,2,Wed Jun 24 00:51:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe make it so they're all monster wizards who have to conjure traps, but they have to roll for it. The randomness factor and the creativity of the guys might make for some interesting traps.  The stealing part would be similar to Roamin's Band of Thieves, where they have to kill a few guys, steal something valuable, and leg it without losing too many limbs.  The final part, when heroes come and try to take bake the thing, would be like the finale, being the most difficult and longest encounter. The strategy that they have would mostly depend on how they set up their traps and deciding when to attack the heroes directly (lure them into a trap and strike, be at the very end when the heroes are weakened from the traps and fight the heroes as the ""boss"", etc.)."
BuffaloWizards,3avap6,FrighteningWorld,2,Wed Jun 24 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"Not only that, the heroes could be characters they had played as previously for added drama."
BuffaloWizards,3avap6,TinyLongwing,7,Wed Jun 24 05:13:11 2015 UTC,"Every time this topic comes up, I get these cool ideas of places that would look amazing, but probably are lacking in terms of actual things to do, haha. I have a tendency to imagine some really cinematic scenery to be explored and then I end up just wanting to paint it. Places like:   an ancient elaphelk graveyard, with some really gigantic skeletons in there - maybe they get truly colossal if they live long enough! a wide-open plain with some rolling hills, covered in vivid green grass, with the landscape dotted with enormous jet-black boulders, ringed with bright red poppies. The sort of place that feels like these things have some kind of meaning, but you don't know what until you try to investigate - and maybe it will always be a mystery. Ruins of an ancient city, carved out of granite or white marble, which sit on the shore and seem to continue down into the sea. Did the sea rise? Did the land sink? Were the inhabitants at home in both, maybe? Dunno. A desert, with a deep, narrow crevasse/canyon running through it. Above, on the surface, rocks the size of cars sit perched atop pillars of sand - thousands of years of wind and water has carved away the top layers of desert, leaving these strange formations where the sand directly below the rocks was protected from the weather. Below, in the crevasse, the temperature drops sharply once you get deep enough, because the sun rarely if ever touches the very bottom, and veins of ice run through the walls and ground.   I just love scenery, I think.  Edit: ended up drawing one of these tonight just for fun."
BuffaloWizards,3avap6,ZackZeysto,3,Tue Jun 23 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"The boneyard scenery instantly made me think of The Lion King. That one would be really cool. I feel like that would have a fight with a giant monster that lives underground, so then it would be like the elaphelk all got eaten by the big monster."
BuffaloWizards,3avap6,raidergreymoon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"As you said, those ideas are very cinematic. If you or somoene could add some campaign-frame or a deeper storyline it could totally work. For example your ""ancient elaphelk graveyard"" has more frame than the other ideas, becouse you gave hints of actual URLive-condition for a campaign.  But i really like your style of writing, i could easy picture those landscapes! (Maybe you should write some novels etc!)  Edit: I draw a mediocre picture of the dessert ravine"
BuffaloWizards,3avap6,SabrielandOJ,2,Wed Jun 24 11:35:43 2015 UTC,"I would be interested in some kinda underdark situation. could introduce a lot of underground type races and such.   Could also be fun to have some wildly different landscapes from map to maps. start in mountain, move down into swamp, end off in desert. Something like that. wildly different creatures and races in each map. Course trouble with that is there is usually barely enough time for 2 boards."

BuffaloWizards,3au5vy,unpluggedriot,15,Tue Jun 23 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Sigh. I always hate hearing people talk about bees, so much misinformation.  All worker honey bees are female. The males are drones and only live to have sex with virgin queens.  Though I like what they have come up with. If they go with bee type eyes then they have 5 eyes."
BuffaloWizards,3au5vy,oddball_gamer,6,Tue Jun 23 15:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole time I was thinking: But what if I want to be a female bee? They exist besides the queen!"
BuffaloWizards,3au5vy,catzalot,5,Tue Jun 23 16:25:04 2015 UTC,"Let me just add a bit more info about bees, just for reference.  Drone bees (aka male bees) are far and in between, there's not a huge amount of them in a hive. They don't have stingers, they don't do work, their sole purpose in life is the reproduce with a new queen bee.  Workers bee (aka female bees) and massive in quantity. They, as the name implies, work by collect pollen and nectar from flowers. The pollen is loosely attached to their bodies and legs and it does fall off. Pollen gets eaten once it arrives at the hive. The nectar gets stored in their stomach and gets spit out (alongside with some enzymes) later on in the hive to turn into honey. The worker bee's stinger is pronged so when it stings, it gets embedded to the target. It also pulls out a bunch of stuff alongside the stinger (don't remember what, I think their could be an organ taken out, but either way this kills the bee after stinging).  The queen bee is typically bigger than the rest. There is only one in each hive and, for the common north american bee, the queen bee has a blue dot on their back. She is the one that lays a bunch of eggs and the only female that can reproduce (worker bees are sterile). She also does not have a barbed stinger, meaning she can sting and infinite amount of times. In addition, she sometimes lays the next queen bees that will feast on a substance called ""royal jelly"" made by worker bees. It is not sweet, people that have ate it described it as savoury and has an acquired taste. If there are more than one queen bee larvae, which there usually are, they will fight to the death using their stingers to be the next queen bee.  That's all I have about bees on the top of my head. If anyone else has something I missed, feel free to add it or correct me."
BuffaloWizards,3au5vy,deathdoom13,2,Wed Jun 24 02:06:54 2015 UTC,"Not bad, but I will just say the mark on the back of the Queen is whatever colour the beekeeper wants and not natural. The Queen only uses her sting to kill off other princes bees in the same hive. The queen is also a egg laying machine and the other bees will feed her. But all bees in the hive will know if the is gone within about 5-10 min.  The only other thing I will say is that the worked has different jobs depending on age, from nurse to guard to forager. And I believe only young workers can make the enzymes to produce honey. (bees don't eat honey, they would water it back down to drink it.)"

Everything is hand draw in the program. I have a top layer with the grid and side board and I just plan out the map beneath it. Here is the version Rob tweeted out for fans to use   As for the map sizing I believe there's an option to change your sizing and also where you can make the grid invisible since there is a more subtle grid already the image.

BuffaloWizards,3as8n7,NickGraves,19,Tue Jun 23 03:24:39 2015 UTC,"Most comics are in black and white because black and white has less information to decipher. When you look at something black and white, it's instantly clear what it is. Something with color takes time to digest.  Because of the animations, it was easier to make them black and white because of time, but that just became the established style because the show and the animations are linked.  You would only use colors if you were setting an atmosphere or you had images with a long exposure, or multiple things to decipher and differentiate. Since we are doing comedy, you only need to know what it looks like and what it is communicating as efficiently as possible.   I do use color in the donation animations when it is necessary, the Porcs have a pool of purple acid they come out of. The Porbo Enrage animation also flashed multiple colors when he grew in size."

BuffaloWizards,3as5sz,dokoattack5,2,Tue Jun 23 08:22:35 2015 UTC,"You missed the opportunity to have one of the freaks be ""The Strongbad.""   But in all seriousness, I like the idea of circus themed classes, but I don't like the Ringmaster class very much, mainly because it seems to have a lot of underpowered versions of other moves. I really like the Three Ring Circus and Jack in the Box, but the moves that have you creating doubles don't feel ""Jestery."" Shiv is nice, but needs to be buffed. As far as the Puppeteer goes, I really like it. The only thing that should be changed is the Puppet Bomb destroying all puppets. The Fortuneteller is probably my favourite of these classes, because it has some really good RP elements. I especially like False Fortunes."
BuffaloWizards,3as5sz,ManInTheHat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason we explicitly made the Puppet Bomb not destroying all puppets is because I was concerned about the idea of the first encounter fighting several enemies, like a dozen or more, then the Puppeteer getting really lucky and making ALL of them into RIsen puppets, and then being able to do some absolutely absurd amount of damage in a single turn to an enemy (plus the fact that Risen Puppets are not resummonable after dying once).   Thanks for the feedback!"
BuffaloWizards,3as5sz,dokoattack5,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:02:18 2015 UTC,You could just have a cap to the number of Risen puppets you could summon after one combat. Or maybe a limit for the entire campaign. Or maybe make Puppet bomb have a limit to the amount that explode.
BuffaloWizards,3as5sz,ManInTheHat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Well, limiting the amount that explode is the entire point to making it not affect Risen Puppets :^) There sort of is a cap to how many can be had at one time -- they are treated as item consumables added to the inventory until summoned. Once they've been summoned they're pets like the Theurgist's air sprites; if the Puppeteer ever chooses not to take a hit for them, then the puppet just falls over dead, and is not resummonable under any condition."
BuffaloWizards,3as5sz,ManInTheHat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"The cotton candy seems like a really cool idea! The collectable coin seems pretty overpowered if its a 50/50 to get a treasure, maybe have a negative effect for failure and make it once per combat? The air horn and action figure are good ideas but they seem like they could be items rather than treasure. Same with walking stick and T-Shirt, seem kind of weak for a treasure slot, but would be cool as items you could buy during a circus campaign. I also like the flak vest but for 1000 maybe 10 stam? Depends on what type of enemies they are fighting I guess."
BuffaloWizards,3as5sz,Cronurd,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"The coin isn't 50/50, you flip a coin and if it's heads THEN you get to roll a die to find one. It's got a double conditional on it. Probably still a little powerful but I'll have to see after I run the campaign for people that includes it.  The Flak Vest provides complete immunity to all explosive and fire damage so keep that in mind; I've actually had several people suggest that it's OVERpowered. It was designed to have synergy with the Deconstructor originally.  All of the circus treasures that we have for the campaign were built with the idea in mind that, at least for this campaign, they DO function as items and the shopkeeper won't run out of them as they purchase them.

I'm a fan of things that expand the range of critical fails and critical strikes (or really, anything that has additional fun rolls). Perhaps make it so that rolling a 7 makes the blade stop giving bad luck for a while?  The Wand feels a little bit overpowered. I'd say make them pay double the original stamina cost instead of original plus one in order to double the effect. It feels a little better, because it's like you're really hedging your bets--like you NEED to get a certain amount of damage down in a hurry and don't want to risk not getting a critical, so you pay a whole bunch of stamina upfront in order to ensure your victory."

I'm not really sure how I'd fix this, but some spells are ALREADY crazy long range and mean that the player is never in danger at all -- being twice as far back puts you basically off the board entirely. Dragonkin Flamer feels good. It actually seems a little underpowered if it consumes your action; if you specify that it can be used freely then it feels a bit better. Maybe it's just in comparison to the first that it feels underpowered. Dragonkin Collector is neat. I don't really like the 'drawback' of you disliking destroying treasure, mostly because there's very few means of destroying treasure in the game. There's Golden Shot for Booty Raiders, there's the Wiggly Wrench, and then there's Okagnoma Gnomes. The Collector obviously can't be the third, the second is entirely dependent on if you happen to get a Wrench, and the first means that the Collector just picks a different class (assuming the Booty Raider is even available to be chosen for that campaign). I'm not entirely sure it NEEDS a drawback, but if it does, then this probably needs some tweaking to make work. The dragonkin base ability seems a bit absurd. I think it could be one or the other, but not both. With this ability, I'd never go anything other than a Dragonkin Seer Wizard, so I could stand 20 tiles away and spam Fireball, so that anytime it criticals I do 30 damage to everything in a 3x3 area. Wait, no, excuse me, a 5x5 area, because when it crits it becomes an AoE spell, so the second part of Seer comes into play. If there's an enemy in all of those squares (which there could have been if this was done during Porc Hunters, with that finale), then the spell just did a total of 750 DAMAGE spread across 25 enemies.   It's definitely some good thoughts, though. Nerf the Seer and Dragonkin base, tweak the Collector, maybe a very slight buff to the Flamer and it's solid."

I like the idea of an instant that adds to a nearby ally.  Subtraction - Cute with the theme, but not a very fun ability to use or interesting outside of that.   Multiply - Very limited with little use. At this point you are focusing far too much on trying to make math terms fit instead of fun abilities.  Divide - Worthless and inherently broken. A 5% chance to do so much damage to a big boss like creature that ruins an encounter and worthless in every other encounter.  Tax Dodge - This one punishes you for rolling high which while isn't a big deal, is backwards and weird. It's name also doesn't fit the theme.  Some of the ideas are neat, but you got 3 abilities that all do damage with zero flavor to them and the two other abilities the class have don't add much. I love the idea of a Mathmagician, but you focused far too much on the numbers part and less about the theme and flavor abilities that are interesting. You need players to have to make hard choices between your abilities. Right now Divide and Subtraction are pointless and would only ruin games. You can't make an ability that can do 100 damage in a very specific situation, but does less then a weapon in all others. Subtraction also has this problem as a Critical would be 40 damage.  Don't think I'm shitting on your ideas or anything like that, I just want you to know why I wouldn't use them the way it is now."

BuffaloWizards,3apubb,Yamil01,7,Mon Jun 22 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"While they were breaking down the various skills that make illusionist slightly redundant in the scheme with bards I wondered, will we see classes that share abilities?  We've seen a totally custom class in Nuren, and we've sent Hobgoblin that pick up extra. But could we ever see an illusionist class that has mirror image, rolling fog, disguise etc? Skills which are applicable to other classes and this one but also allow for different builds and synergy due to new possible combos?   Edit Also Grid vs Hex. I think part of the clutter is scaling.

BuffaloWizards,3ar78j,dokoattack5,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"This kinda reminds me of an idea I had for curse/blessing cards. Vampirism would be a curse.

BuffaloWizards,3ar78j,DanelerH,2,Mon Jun 22 22:05:24 2015 UTC,Well in my opinion having the Undead as a race of their own is kind of weird because they are living dead corpses and those corpses have to come from some race. The Undead might not be a great choice for a playable race because i dont know if they are borderline mindless or if they possess some level of intelligence. As for vampires i don't know because they haven't been well established other than in the first campaing.
BuffaloWizards,3ar78j,Rurikar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Based on the current descriptions of them, they sound like the bones of a dead creature, usually humanoid (as the only non-humanoid skeletal creatures seen thus far are the skelefelks), being reanimated by a magic that also holds them together."
BuffaloWizards,3ar78j,Qarin_,2,Mon Jun 22 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"Vampire would be a class not a race I think, classes typically encompass a theme. Undead anything won't be playable really."

BuffaloWizards,3aqd9l,cellojake,8,Mon Jun 22 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"TL;DR It wasn't that it was bold, that can be fixed by drawing them on the map, it was because that it was too messy to understand alighnments easily  Actually the reason you see the square grid so subtle is because the map had the grid drawn on it (on the image of the map) but when they added the hexagonal the grid was in its normal color. The reason why they decided not to use a hexagonal wasn't the color of the grid (grids can be invisible in tabletop), but because the grid was too messy to be stared on and understand what happens in a general audience."
BuffaloWizards,3aqd9l,GaaraTheFifth,6,Mon Jun 22 19:13:01 2015 UTC,One thing I noticed is that the hex tiles absolutely destroyed the twich video compression.  It added so much noise and lost so much of the detail depending on how Rob zoomed in and out.
BuffaloWizards,3aqd9l,Call_Me_ZeeKay,4,Mon Jun 22 19:55:46 2015 UTC,Part of the may be because the map was designed for square tiles and so it fits a bit better with buildings and such.
BuffaloWizards,3aqd9l,Bluenosedfiber,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:42:17 2015 UTC,"the reason hex tiles look so weird is because they aren't linear lines. to be honest a square tile could be just as good. corners are the only issue i can think of, and you can solve that by weakening range of attack or movement by 2/3 or 3/4 ratio"
BuffaloWizards,3aqd9l,hydro_phoenix,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"I wonder if hex tiles would look good if they were bigger than the size they tried, like 1,5x or 2x. The hexes they used fit inside the squares, if the square were to fit inside the hex instead maybe it would be ok."
BuffaloWizards,3aqd9l,darmstadi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:10:46 2015 UTC,I think a bit more further experimenting with hex tiles would be worthwhile. Maybe do a campaign or single combat with them and see how it goes.
BuffaloWizards,3aqd9l,Toadslayer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:26:35 2015 UTC,"if you want to keep squares for visuals but hex for practicality a compromise is to just offset one of the axis by 50%. Take each other row or column and shift the squares so they overlap both on either top and bottom or left and right. Each square is now touching one square on opposite side, and two squares on the other two opposite sides, meaning they touch 6 adjacent squares. It becomes fully hex movement but for many people much easier to adapt to visually."

You could just make Porc class cards with all the stamina costs updated with the -3 built in and deal those though an reference them instead if it's really that much more work to just remember to -3 it.

BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,samiamrg7,4,Sun Jun 21 16:29:42 2015 UTC,One potential problem with this is that diagonals are longer than straight lines.

BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,Ace8280,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:33:02 2015 UTC,"And on a strict grid you can move further on grid lines than diagonally, so it's already a problem that isn't a problem.  When I GM I let people move diagonal because it feels more fair to players, and less like a strict, numbersy game."
BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,DeltaDaedalus,2,Sun Jun 21 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it's not a huge deal, just wanted to point it out"
BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,Ace8280,3,Sun Jun 21 18:04:51 2015 UTC,I think that maybe they should try a Hex style one week with a map that's designed for it. It would be fun to see.
BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,dokoattack5,2,Sun Jun 21 17:53:03 2015 UTC,"Something that can work, but the probably won't use(because of math) is to treat a diagonal like 1.5 tiles. It's actually the square root of 2, but 1.5 is a lot easier to use."

BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,O_xD,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:10:15 2015 UTC,This is already sort of how they do this. The problem they have is when they shoot a line spell at a non-45 degree angle and then judging distance.
BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,ManInTheHat,2,Sun Jun 21 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, in general Rob just eyeballs the distance and gets a rough count. If it's something with like, range 10, and the player is 8/9 squares away, then yeah he counts it out--but generally at a glance it becomes apparent if it's in range or not."
BuffaloWizards,3am7ri,Zylo003,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:42:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, this is kind of already a thing in dnd, and I'm sure Rob already knows about it. In dnd you can move diagonally but every other diagonal move is twice normal. So in Robs system of moving 5 squares, you could move diagonal and that would be one of your five, then if you moved diagonal again (so a total of only 2 squares but both diagonal) it would take up 3 of your 5 moves.  The problem with it is that it's not simple for the watcher. He wants things to stay simple and easy to understand, and not involve math. So something like it won't probably ever be implemented."

BuffaloWizards,3amo0k,Lucain34,4,Sun Jun 21 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it is about breaking them at all. A good GM can will keep players from exploiting potentially broken elements of the game.  You are attempting to add layers of complexity that aren't super necessary. That said, it's a good idea, and if developed properly it could become a fun additional element that many fans can opt to apply.  Leveling  Something that you absolutely have to consider is how you would level up.  Are level ups solely from combat, or can they be attained through other means?  How many times should someone level up in an adventure?   After 5, 10, 20 level ups, and learning 8 more spells, getting 4 more class abilities, would the options be too complex to have fun with?  How long are you going to play?   If it's a 3 hour game, 6 encounters would be at the high end, and that's if your rp is light. How are you going to split the right amount of level ups across the adventure?  Is there an xp system?   If so, you're going to need to develop monsters with that in mind, with their own individual values. You can use a geometric or exponential xp system. You're going to also have to decide whether xp is split amongst the party or not. If so, math, but no power disparity. If not, you encourage aggressive playstyle and RP.  Rethink ""Levels""   What does it mean to level up in your world? Are the characters aware of their own levels? Of their friends? Can they eyeball enemies' levels? Have you taken into account the powerspike with numerous class abilities? (High damage + Healing + Quickness Potions/Spirit Rush)  Stealth  In Tabletop RPG, and how it has generally worked in URealms, if you are aware you can dodge/resist. If you're not you can't. You shouldn't need to worry about creating a system for it as long as you, as a GM reward stealth tactics, the players will tend towards them. If you are dealing with really aggressive players, punish their characters for charging head first, and reward bonus damage from the shadows. Items that benefit from stealth is a good idea."
BuffaloWizards,3amo0k,critkek,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and help, and I will keep your tips in mind. The stealth system is no longer really a system and should be renamed now.  After I reflected on it, I realized I was more setting guidelines for myself.  Your information on leveling is super helpful though, and I will make sure to draw up specifics before implementing it in my game. If you are wondering,  I am a very RP heavy person, and my campaign will reflect that. There will be no visible levels, and the system will be used as a way to reward my players for growing.  Extra stamina maybe rewarded for a life changing decision or after an incredibly tough encounter, but any skill gaining will be given at the start of a new session instead of a character creation like Rob's group does.  Again, thanks for the help."
BuffaloWizards,3amo0k,Rurikar,2,Sun Jun 21 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"Leveling is a flawed gameplay design that has plagued RPGs forever. Progression is important, but collecting invisible points when you defeat encounters doesn't add much to the fun of the game. We love leveling systems because we love character progression, but I have found that LOOT based character progression is far more enjoyable to the average player.  So many players love the ""end game"". The part of the game where you have unlocked all your skills and the new form of progression comes from items. In my opinion, you don't need experience to give characters progression, you just need items along the way that will slowly increase the power of the player and give more options. I have already put some thought into how a group of players could do a longer campaign, and I don't believe that just having a level system adds ANYTHING to the game. It might feel like it adds something as there is a reason every app on your phone has a leveling system, but overtime players learn that these levels and systems don't always matter.  Stealth, is completely redundant, did you not watch the first campaign? That's stealth. You don't need a complicated system with surprise attack bonuses and junk, that would go on weapons or treasure cards at most. You are overcomplicating a system that doesn't need to be complicated because it adds very little of value to the game. If a player is attacking something without them noticing it, the game master just takes that into account. That's it. You don't need rules for it, because rules just add more layers of difficulty that don't add anything to roleplay or gameplay. A Sorcerer already has advantage in the fog, if they needed a damage advantage, it have been on the card.  I personally think it's a good system to have people make new characters from session to session anyway. It creates a world your players know and characters they can relate too. It makes it so the bad guys aren't just the bad guys because the GM said they were bad, but you create the tension of a player being forced to fight and kill one of their own characters. You slowly start to build a deep world and there is nothing that stops you from revisiting characters in the future. Death becomes something that matters and something that can always happen as you know don't always play the same characters.  Character Creation is some of the most fun you can have in these games. In my opinion, if your looking for a game with leveling/stealth techniques, you really should consider moving your group over to pathfinder or D&D or any other very serious RP game because they are designed for it. If your friends want something basic and easy to understand, I feel like adding new complicated systems right out of the gate is foolish.  Finally, you don't care about your players ""exploiting the game"". If all the players are relatively the same power level your fine, you balance encounters accordingly. If a player is too strong or too weak, you help them out during the RP parts of the game or focus the power gamers more in combat. You want your players to feel like they are overpowered super heroes, that's fun for players. A GM has unlimited power. If they get to your dragon encounter and you know they are way, way too strong. You spawn two dragons. It's as simple as that."

When I made this a few days ago, I was way more nervous then I am now. I wanted to create these systems because they made me feel comfortable, but after designing my story, the maps, and looking over the cards more, I decided that I was thinking too much on these familiar ideas. I decided that the item or story based progression is by far better. Also I do like the way you all play the game with creating new characters every week, and I plan on designing my story to allow that. My friends however wanted to create main characters and have a longer campaign. I, being a new GM and deciding to use your format, looked at these systems as ways to fill up my inexperience.  Having a leveling system is an easy way to give character progression. You also gave a ton of ways to make a stealth based character without a dedicated system. I was just not being creative enough with implementing these ideas. Most of the written ideas are being scrapped because I am now seeing ways that I can incorporate the core ideas of what I wanted into the format and story without changing core mechanics.    Your behind the scenes videos did help me by the way. I forgot to watch the first one, and after taking the time to see it, I have a much better view of the GM having unlimited power. I am also starting to think of item ideas that can give my players what they want. The Behemoth arm was an ingenious way of giving a character a new ability without the need for a system dedicated to it.  I am sorry if I upset you. I should have taken the time to looker deeper into the game you created.  Again, thank you for your insight and creating this game. You have brought me literal years of entertainment with all of your works, and I cannot wait to see how this game turns out."

BuffaloWizards,3aker9,Rurikar,3,Sun Jun 21 03:15:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't like how Rob described them as sort of autonomous and living  to do only what their book is written about. I think they should have not been sentient prior to imprinting themselves onto a book. However once they do imprint themselves to a book it should literally and figuratively be their core and they should be disillusioned to actual reality. When they die while living as a book. they return to themindless autonomus spirit, ambigous wheter it can become another book or is forever a non hostile magic fart cloud.  Like the book will be responsible for their  memories, personailities and their wants and needs, and live their lives one page  at a time. But their should be a possibility that they can become self aware. Like I said, they have a book inside of them. Say they got run through with a knife and the ending of the book is destroyed. They get put in a situation where they have to continue on with their lives without having it written out for them.   I think if they ever continue with these book characters the story can get sad and creepy. Like if an enemy has imprinted onto a book that isn't well written they can be unstable.   Also instead of a library they could live in a fake land created by a spirit imprinted onto an atlas that follows laws of science listed on an archaic physics book.  Sorry for the long post, I'm just really feeling this book idea."

By removing the responsibility and sentience, it makes for a concept of being that provides a lot of story telling elements that focus around sadness."

TL:DR sentience while potentially less sad for other characters can be much more sad for said character with more relatability and i cri everitim moments
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,Ace8280,6,Sun Jun 21 05:30:55 2015 UTC,"If you really think into the idea that they're just a mindless being you do lose some of the relatability, but at a first glance, if the book entity takes on the form of something familiar, whether it be something humanoid, mammal, reptilian, etc. people's natural reaction would be empathy. Especially if it talks and appears to express emotions.  Have you ever watched that Futurama episode 'I dated a robot'? In that episode Fry downloads the personality of Lucy Liu into a blank robot, with her preset memories and feelings (except she's programmed to love him), and even though you are aware she's just a mindless machine acting the way it's programmed, you still feel empathy because she feels like a real person.  In my personal opinion i feel like them being mindless beings is way more interesting, you just don't get this kinda thing.  Forgive the rambliness, this is really interesting though, I love these sorta discussions :P"
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,AmbitiousHobo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:53:30 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, while sentience might make them more relatable, you can have better stories if they are ""mindless"". I'll always take story over the ability to relate to a character."
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,Rurikar,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:36:38 2015 UTC,"What would happen if a book-person ever read a copy of their 'chosen' book? If ""Jimmy Two-Shoes McGee"" realized that his entire life - even the parts that haven't happened yet - were another person's fantasy, would he then become aware of himself and have a complete mental breakdown? Or would his reaction just be another product of his character?"
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,Gorinich_The_Serpant,3,Sun Jun 21 05:59:14 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't have the realization to ever understand what they are. Reading a book about themselves would be like them going ""Oh neat someone wrote a book about my adventurers!"" without questioning it. They aren't self aware."
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,Tscenzurra,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:48:27 2015 UTC,It would probably be based on what his character would do in such a situation.
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,Gorinich_The_Serpant,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you can see the sadness of it. That scenario is totally viable and can totally open the eyes of a character that wasn't one of these book races but can blaze the trail that the ""people""  are figments of the words of a writer.   This concept can go so many ways and I'd be so hyped if you perused it."
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,Voyl,5,Sun Jun 21 06:43:58 2015 UTC,"The book people started pretty silly but ended up as some pretty freaky twilight zone shit, they're really cool.  I almost feel like having a campaign about them won't do them justice, I don't know what exactly the guys are planning to do with Coe's Quest but i think an episode or two about the book people would be amazing."
BuffaloWizards,3aker9,TenMilesDown,2,Sun Jun 21 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"If I were a mage and I knew about this phenomena (I think most people who know about these would be mages or people literate in the workings of magic) I could see myself trying to gleam something useful from this. If I could capture one of these things in cloud in say an enchanted jar, and the supplies to write a book I could make myself any kind of being I wanted. I could compile the right books and write a fitting personality to get the perfect tactician or a chef that knows almost every dish, or a powerful wizard who follows my orders, the ideal spouse, a cool dragon mount, an assassin who will never double-cross me or anything else I wanted. Of course doing so would require a carefully made book and potentially dangerous research to contain the spirit, but the payoff would be great. A job on the street would see the Library City as a bazro land but clever and the informed man would see a gold mine of opportunity."

BuffaloWizards,3ajhvw,Uppercasenumber,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:16:11 2015 UTC,"Dave said in Porc Hunters that the mace that Ca Rel picked up had a 'lesser magic' enchantment on it, not being very impressed. This could imply that many of these maces exist and can be enchanted by even weak wizards, so the odds of Ca Rel finding that exact mace might not be that high. Still very plausible though, cool theories!"
BuffaloWizards,3ajhvw,Ningamer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:55:03 2015 UTC,Or that its been lost for so long that it's lost many of its magical properties.   Or Ca Rel just can't use it to its full potential like Kinney could

BuffaloWizards,3aiarz,shinyman337,8,Sat Jun 20 13:20:53 2015 UTC,"Here's my own personal spin on the transfer of the mace:  The mace is similar to the sun key (I think that was the name) in that it's of great power and mysterious origin, nobody's really sure where it came from. Somehow someway it wound up at the bottom of Emerald Lake, and it was first discovered by Ca-Rell during the events of Porc Hunters. Once Theta Squad has defeated Porbo, Ca-Rell now leads this group of porcs. Soon after the dust has settled, Ca-Rell gives one porc in particular the name ""Porco"" and it becomes her second in command. Porco wants to be just like Ca-Rell, so he starts to try to learn things. He starts out with simple stuff, counting, the alphabet. Pretty soon, he's figured out how to read, write, and even do multiplication. Proud of how well Porco was teaching himself, Ca-Rell made a quick trip to Danaver and brought him some books so that he could learn even more. One of these books was a book about nature and animals, and as he read on and on, he saw that not everything was a porc. There were elves, dwarves, gnomes, goblins, lots of things! And then, he got to the chapter on porcs. Because this was an elven book, it was heavily biased against every other living thing, and porcs weren't excluded. Seeing how much elves hated porcs, how they saw porcs as vermin, he thought Ca-Rell felt the same way. Now hating his former idol, he stole her prized mace and fled. However, he did still remember all of the kindness that Ca-Rell had given to him, so he renamed himself after the only thing she gave him that no one else ever had, Merci. Eventually, he became twisted by the world and joined up with a band of pirates. He killed the captain and wore his skin as a jacket. After leading for a time, a couple of kobolds joined the crew. One of them happened to be female, and well, they were at sea for a very long time.... let's just say there was a good reason why Kinney's coat was in the captain's quarters. In return, Captain Merci gave her the mace.  The End."
BuffaloWizards,3aiarz,Makydog,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:38:49 2015 UTC,"During the show this is what I was thinking.  Well, not exactly this, but something similar.  After thinking, I began to wonder if the opposite wasn't true:  The pirates join Merci as he visits home either out of sentimentality or to blow off steam.  While there things happen.  Another thing that stands out to me is Porbo had a ""mother"".  Kinnie could have even been the ""Mother"".  The Porcos looked up to her for some odd reason, and some of the local Porco culture oddities could be explained by this.  Ca-Rell reminded them all of their previous ""mother"".  Maybe she died, maybe she gave a Porco the hammer who then died, maybe it was stolen, or she dropped it."
BuffaloWizards,3aiarz,Tinfoil_King,2,Mon Jun 22 04:42:47 2015 UTC,"My theory would be that Kinney had it first and then Ca'Rell had it after Kinney. Ca'Rell found it underwater and Kinney is a pirate so pretty much lives on the sea. It's possible that Kinney dropped it in to the water like she did with the wine, and it found it's way in to Emerald Lake, which looks more like a river and could be close to the mouth."

BuffaloWizards,3aiarz,MagmaCode,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"It could have happened afterwards; anything could have. It's just that nothing is canon until it happens ingame. Like Philhipé's execution isn't canon, though it probably will happen unless an ingame event affects it."
BuffaloWizards,3aiarz,Jajarz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"It's not canon yet, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. It might very well be that Rob chooses to continue the campaign in that way."
BuffaloWizards,3aiarz,duggabboo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"I think the mace goes to a worthy holder so it's kind of a ring of power thing so then it went from Ca rell and she loses it whilst gambling and it gets won by a pirate. But with Kinney being a blood lusted killer she would probably kill Ca rell for the mace, or a wizard did it."

BuffaloWizards,3ag0gz,Godzillas_Toupee,2,Sat Jun 20 00:17:21 2015 UTC,"For anyone interested I also did a proper mathy combinatorics way. The chance of doing at least 2n>0 damage is equal to binom(19, n)/20n. Wolfram Calculator We can see this because the chance of getting 2n damage is equal to (increasing rolls) / (all possible rolls). Alls possible rolls is always 20n. Increasing rolls can also be seen as picking from the set {2, 3, ..., 19, 20} n times and ordering them from small to large. We can pick 19*18*...*(19-n) different permutations of elements. These can be ordered in n! ways, of which exactly one is increasing. So 19*18*...*(19 - n)\n! = 19!/n!(19-n)! = binom(19, n). For a few examples this means that * 19/20 chance of at least 2 * 171/400 chance of at least 4 * 969/16000 chance of at least 8 * 1/2019 chance of the max 38 To get the chance of hitting exactly 2n you simply calculate binom(19, n)/20n - binom(19, n+1)/20n + 1  Wolfram Calculator This all adds up to an average damage of ~3.05 without crits and ~3.29 damage with crits. So this item benefits more from crits then the average item. This has to do with the fact that you are more likely to have a 20 in an increasing row of rolls then in just random rolls."

Kinnie is then forced to jump into the lake on the Snakes wishes. Then Ca-Rell finds it later on in the timeline.  This is the second time I've said this idea but I've refined it even more!"
BuffaloWizards,3ahlvl,shinyman337,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:36:54 2015 UTC,"So you are in the party that The Jewel of Dingo Isles took place before the Porc Hunters. Interesting. One problem I do see is how are the elves going to let a kobold go into their town, but at the same time its at the outskirts. I kind of can see Kinnie leaving the ship, but at the same time he would leave his friend Jo on the ship. Also I doubt that he would leave the Bocoe due to the rum/wine they had.  And does Kinnie die from the snake's wishes? Would be pretty dark for that to happen. I feel like it could be said different, like when Kinnie decides to leave the ship to become a Bartender, Captain Merci told him to leave his mace, as it is ship property. The Mace stays on the boat for a while, and one night when the crew get drunk, they lose the mace from all the drunkness. Or Harpies could have stolen it. Either way the mace drifts slowly until is reaches the whispering snakes lake."
BuffaloWizards,3ahlvl,shinyman337,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:32:24 2015 UTC,yeah Kinnie was forced to drown herself because of the whispering snake

But at the same time, I understand Rob aims towards more interesting stories, to which Kinnie drowning is pretty dark but cool. I just think you need to elaborate how he finds himself at the lake, because that transition is confusing  Thanks to shinyman337, everything in the comment referring Kinnie as a boy is incorrect, sorry!"
BuffaloWizards,3ahlvl,duggabboo,4,Sat Jun 20 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"The lake is named The Emerald Lake right? So how about Kinnie stole the emerald and left the BoeCoe, then after traveling Kinnie find the lake. The Whispering Snake then whispers to Kinnie and has her drown herself. The emerald's power causes the lake to glow a faint green and thus it was named the emerald lake. Then a few whatevers later Ca-Rell finds Surge.   P.S Kinnie is a girl"
BuffaloWizards,3ahlvl,Smartezz,2,Sat Jun 20 13:55:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's what I will call... The Emerald Isles Theory.  [cue dramatic music]  When Nisovin's gnome ship attacks, Kinnie is promoted by Captain Merci to a Lieutenant. Then, one of three things happens: Kinnie  1) Lets the mace slip (history of losing things)  2) Drowns (history of bad swimming)  3) Goes down with the ship  After several years, hell, decades, the Drink eventually drains or goes through a drought of some kind. At the point that Theta Squad then arrives to fight the Whispering Snake (which may possibly be a baby version of the Behemoth), the Dingo Isles have transformed into the Glistening Caverns/Danevur/Emerald Lake area. When Theta Squad arrives, Ca-Rell gets the mace, and it just happens to be a coincidence that they were both Lieutenants (and therefore also takes away the necessity of retconning).  EDIT/ADDITION: The Whispering Snake would actually likely be a baby of the Behemoth because while the Behemoth forced Jakelad to worship him (Cultis of Bones), the Whispering Snake is also able to brainwash people."

There where 4 porcs in coes crew, three that are alive. Kinney was the only female. Couldn't you say that kinney and some other porc started the colony of porcs living in the cave near emerald lake?   Now, depending on their life span, Kinney or a relative was the mother of Porbo. But, I say Kinney started the colony because of the Lt Surge being lost in Emerald Lake.  But, I don't think she drowned. I think she somehow lost her mace and started a colony of porcs in a cave near the isles, either before or after the drought. But either way, the drink drains around the Dingo Isles, elves eventually create a small town, and the Whisper Snake inhabits the lake.  I believe the Whisper Snake to be a separate species from the Behemoth, as it was stated that there could be more of them. Although this wasn't directly in the story, it is the most information we currently have, and most likely true. Plus, it did not make much sound. It survived on sneaking up on people and mind controlling them with its whispers. The Behemoth made whaling noises, and was much less aggressive."

That could include Elf!Deadbones losing Lt. Surge to Pirate!Deadbones somehow.  Elf!Deadbones found Lt. Surge in a river.  Pirate!Deadbones is a terrible swimmer.

Like a scenario where the characters are caught in a time spell and end up in a futuristic setting for a little while, or perhaps the campaign could even end on that note, with the characters stuck in the future and having to find a way to go back."
BuffaloWizards,3ag2vc,Nihillo,5,Fri Jun 19 22:02:04 2015 UTC,Seems like a good idea for a special campaign. I think it'd be funny if the fantasy characters got abducted by aliens and were then forced to play as fish out of water.

I believe it was in the Behind the Scenes video for said campaign."
BuffaloWizards,3ahhqa,DanelerH,4,Sat Jun 20 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"they're not doing it in consecutive order per say.

Justin just doesn't want to be captain"
BuffaloWizards,3ahhqa,unpluggedriot,3,Sat Jun 20 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"It's based on who wants to be captain. Roamin was actually going to lead Jewel of the Dingo Isles and later didn't want to, so it fell on Coe. It wasn't going to be in order or anything.

BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,shinyman337,11,Fri Jun 19 16:24:08 2015 UTC,I actually think that Dingo takes place before Porc hunters because we've already seen that Kinny has a habit of dropping things in the sea. Maybe the mace somehow got into the lake from the sea?
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Railith,7,Fri Jun 19 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"Actually there is evidence that Porc Hunters take place after Roamin's Band of Thieves. Dave. Dave first appeared in RBoT, then after a 'bunch of thieving gnomes' he appeared in Hunters.   As for the Nuren Campaign, all we know is that it takes place around the time of RBoT, as Rob has said they have to take place pretty close together, yet we aren't sure just yet."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Clarkmeister,4,Fri Jun 19 16:51:46 2015 UTC,Don't quote me on this because I'm probably wrong but wasn't the thieving gnomes referring to chimeras group which is not related to Roamin's Band of Thieves? So it could still be up in the air on the order.
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,doubleupomega,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"Right now we are operating on the assumption that each week happens after the other. Since Rob has said on the Talk Page for the Timeline   I think you should leave this because I can tell you now that unless there is a DIRECT link that one event takes place after the other, it's up in the air. Week 2 had a direct link and Week 3 had a lucky direct link that without could have easily gone anywhere. Since this is something we don't plan on fitting, it would helpful for fans to work on figuring out the timeline for us to naturally adopt unless we have some other plan. Rob (talk) 01:31, 17 June 2015 (EDT)   Until we get more evidence otherwise, it makes the most sense to do it like that. To be honest, we have as much evidence going either way on any timeline theory. And there ain't no URL Historia to tell us otherwise and the world hasn't been developed enough yet to properly garnish enough theories."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Clarkmeister,6,Fri Jun 19 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"but there is no evidence that Porc Hunters take place after Roamin's Thieves.   Dave the Sun Cleric talks about what the gnomes did. There may be a way to link Nuren, but I can't think of one yet."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Rurikar,3,Fri Jun 19 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"ah I forgot about that. I thought people were assuming that Porc Hunters takes place after Thieves justbecause Dave appeared.(Even though you could totally have it be another band of gnomes in a future week). I think trying to piece together a coherent timeline will be one of my favorite parts of URealms live.   Edit: oh and is there anything that proves that Dingo Isles takes place after Porc Hunters? You never confirmed how Kinney Boots got Surge. Kinney is known to be bad at swimming and Ca-Rell found Surge at the bottom of a lake it, so makes sense that maybe Kinney drowned with Surge only to have Ca-Rell find it later."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Rurikar,6,Fri Jun 19 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, it could go the other way around. Kinney could lose surge and Ca-Ral finds it."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Makydog,2,Fri Jun 19 23:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really like this idea because it uses the Kinney can't swim lore and gives Kinney a fate. The real question is, if this is true then where did Kinney get Surge?"
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Makydog,3,Sat Jun 20 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe Merci had it and Kinney got it by, well, becoming buckle buddies with benefits."

BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,pure7777,3,Sat Jun 20 18:26:24 2015 UTC,I just re-watched the episode with Dave in it. The gnomes that he mentioned weren't Roamin's Band of Thieves. The proof is that Dave says that the prisoner they're carrying is related to those gnomes but that prisoner is Chimera who the the hero's in Roamin's Band of Thieves never even heard of. So i'm pretty sure there's no campaign that's has concrete proof of being before or after another in the timeline
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,pure7777,4,Sat Jun 20 03:07:01 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then you are right. I had written it intending so it is clearly after, but if there is nothing that directly connects them, then the connection should NEVER be made, regardless of my intention or not."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Nihillo,3,Sat Jun 20 04:01:13 2015 UTC,This is going to be the Legend of Zelda timeline. People are going to debate over it for months until you finally make an official one that actually confuses people even more.
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Rurikar,2,Sat Jun 20 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"Split timeline theory, one where Philhipé escapes the elves and one where he dies and his friend Chimera goes on a revengeful rampage."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Makydog,2,Sat Jun 20 05:42:45 2015 UTC,"man so far all I've done is prove that as of now we can't place any of the campaigns on a coherent timeline, well hopefully one of the guys will say something stupid so we can establish it as lore and connect some campaigns"
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,wilwarland,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:55:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah but wasn't there talk about Philippe being taken to be put to death due to the fact that he blew up the elven village? Chimera so far has committed crimes but we're unsure of what. Based on his fight where he attempted to knock everyone out but not kill kinda disproved murder, but that has never directly been stated.  But either way, Philippe was apparently put to death for what he did, though it could or could not be cannon, it's all we currently have linking his fate. He was prisoner in the elven village, until killed, which, if is true, proves he has no known relation to Cimera.  But, then again, the corner of the cell was blown up by Philippe, so he could have been transported somewhere else, most likely the silvermine mountains.   No idea, but I think the first thing I said happened. But, who knows."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,Tigerred100,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:46:07 2015 UTC,iirc Rob said that he was executed. I' not sure if that counts as canon because of how Rob has decided to do canon
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,duggabboo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:04:02 2015 UTC,"It is all we've got for now, so canon until proven otherwise?  Off topic, go read the first few messages on here, great theory; the dingo isles become emerald lake after some time, and the green emerald that was there is why it's named emerald lake.  To expand on that, the lt surge was found in that lake and porks live near by. Could the ports living near by be descendants of Kinney and maybe Jo Krystal?   But hey, that's just a theory (taken from the others who said it before me), a Urealms theory."

BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,duggabboo,3,Fri Jun 19 22:18:49 2015 UTC,It was never established how long the fire would really last though.
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,dokoattack5,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"If the fire does last the expected amount of time, would it continue to spread across his body, albeit slowly? If so, what if the next time we see Thanks, he's become one with the fire and is a super powerful fire wizard, good or evil depending on whether or not he goes insane because, y'know, he's been on fire for 25 years. I don't know if that would hold any water (pun not intended), but it might be an interesting concept for a character."
BuffaloWizards,3af0qv,pure7777,3,Sat Jun 20 00:10:08 2015 UTC,"Technically, Kinny could have lost the Lieutenant Surge in the lake where Deadbones found it, meaning Dingo Isles happened before Porc hunters."

Actually come to think of it I think rob already has something like this planned with the silver mine mountains possibly.  But ya I was thinking further down the line when they're better at RPing and stuffs flows a lot better. A lot of character interaction ect... Hey maybe even save it for a week when they are down a member or two so its more personalized.
BuffaloWizards,3aczki,raidergreymoon,13,Fri Jun 19 15:48:07 2015 UTC,"An ""Escort [name] to [place]"" type adventure would be funny. Especially if the person they were guarding was useless in battle."
BuffaloWizards,3aczki,RealPieIsAwesomeful,10,Fri Jun 19 03:38:04 2015 UTC,However they think they are and try to get into the battle.
BuffaloWizards,3aczki,HawkBug20,2,Fri Jun 19 04:55:27 2015 UTC,I like this idea. Another thing I would like to see would be more RP elements so them meeting NPCs or something in a sort of marketplace setting to get their item/treasures in the beginning. Or needing to go to a market to find information for the adventure.     Of course more RP elements means longer running time and I don't know how late the guys are willing to go.
BuffaloWizards,3aczki,KadaSauce,6,Fri Jun 19 18:38:46 2015 UTC,A family member of the residing official is kidnapped during a festival. The party is contracted to hunt down the kidnapper.
BuffaloWizards,3aczki,5ilver42,8,Fri Jun 19 05:00:05 2015 UTC,Or the inverse... Nisovin contracts the party to kidnap said person during a festival instead...
BuffaloWizards,3aczki,5ilver42,13,Fri Jun 19 05:01:38 2015 UTC,Or this week Nisovin hires the players to kidnap someone then the next week the players are hired to find the person they kidnapped last week. (DUN DUN DUNNN)

BuffaloWizards,3aczki,tamwin5,2,Fri Jun 19 03:33:37 2015 UTC,There needs to be some great dramatic adventure where they are trying to find a item and it turns out to be a forgery.

According to a rumor, a huge horde of zombie has rises up from the grave and is putting nearby village to risk. The Church hope they failed to return.  [2] Nisovin has sent a group of mercenary(player) to his rival's tower, tasked with retrieving his Jar of Magical Delicious Jam, hopefully the group won't end up eating the jam.

BuffaloWizards,3aczki,mountainy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"So I am entirely plagiarizing this idea from about the first half of DBZ: Battle of Gods. Basically, in the first half of the movie Beerus the God of Destruction has come to Earth and Vegeta is tasked with making sure nobody else in the main cast ticks the god off in order to prevent him from destroying the Earth. Comedy ensues.  I think it would be fun for the guys to do something similar. Definitely not on the scale of destroying a planet, but maybe they have to escort a very powerful foreign leader that's on a secret visit through the town, but he/she's very temperamental, so if anything goes wrong then the leader will declare war on them and an extremely difficult fight against the invaders would ensue. It would then be chat's job to cause events that would have the possibility of going wrong, like a cart comes barreling right at the leader.  That's just my idea anyways."

BuffaloWizards,3aczki,-SteinCr,2,Fri Jun 19 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"I think the only problem with a campaign like this is even though we know this happens at some point and would like some official canon to do some storytelling with, the campaign wouldn't have much surprise.   With a prequel campaign like this, you would know that at some point, Skinny Boots would find the Lt. Surge and they would recruit Octivius and Jake Lad.   Basically when you predetermine what will happen on a campaign in such a way in which certain things MUST happen and the players have no decision on whether they would like it to happen, the campaign loses its sense of the ultimate role play experience"

If there was only going to be 1 compliant it was that the crew members having to fear/respect Coe wasn't really a thing that happened... I would have liked a situation where Coe chewed out Deadbones for being overly aggressive on Jakelad and having him be punished for it like being locked up in the Captain's Cabin and being stuck.  Regardless, VERY awesome and I really hope there's some awesome fanart for the puppies and the crew."

Because there are a ton of these tabletop pen and paper roleplaying games, and many of them have multiple editions.   I mean, what I'd do is find a group in your area that already exists and welcomes new players - lots of comic book shops have these. Or you can look for a group who plays online over a site like roll20. See if some of your friends want to play, because a lot of fun comes from roleplaying with people you already know and are comfortable with, in games like this. You may also just want to go over to /r/RPG and see what some of your options are. /r/lfg also may be something worth checking out since it's for people looking to join a game and also for DMs looking for players."

BuffaloWizards,3a886q,raidergreymoon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:18:07 2015 UTC,I want it to be a running gag where justin can never be the leader
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,AbdealiGames,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:44:04 2015 UTC,That could work if like whenever he is leader he isn't treated like one. I do feel like it would get old though. But ya I could see it being a funny short running joke.
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,raidergreymoon,8,Fri Jun 19 05:49:01 2015 UTC,"good news, of the 4 Players, Roamin seems to be (by far) the one most comfortable with being the Leader."

BuffaloWizards,3a886q,fanzel123,7,Fri Jun 19 00:39:46 2015 UTC,I assume Justin turned it down? Or have we deemed Justin unfit as leader?  I think a ton of hilarity would ensue from captain justin
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,SAXTEN2011,12,Thu Jun 18 14:12:14 2015 UTC,"Mostly just want to 2nd Deadbones efforts. Not to knock other people I mean Coe is making all the cards, and Justin just does a stream a week now literally thinking up character concepts so its not like DB is the only one working but as far as during the show goes his efforts are very audible and stand out."
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,cmcdonald22,6,Thu Jun 18 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"I will also be very interested in how Justin plays the leader because I've noticed a trend in the past between the guys when they lead or don't lead. One's strong and the other's weak, and I in no way mean that in the quality of the performance, I mean the disposition of the character. When Deadbones isn't leading he's a very up-in-your-face shifty kind of guy, but when he's leading he's the opposite, he's very timid and shy, his character is more in the background than up front. Roamin's the opposite, when he's leading he's big and loud, ""Alright guys here's the game plan,"" type of thing. But when he isn't leading he's mostly a, ""Yes sir. No sir,"" archetype of character. For Coe, he's surprisingly been consistent in how far of the foreground/background his character is. Of course, this is all observed by one person from only 3 campaigns, and each person has only lead once, so it's hardly accurate, but nevertheless it'll be fun to see what Justin does when he inevitably leads the party."
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,Makydog,3,Thu Jun 18 01:14:01 2015 UTC,"Also the 2nd Campaign, everyone tried to be something totally different than normal. So the next time Deadbones is the leader, he probably won't be a wimp."
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,lindeloef,7,Thu Jun 18 07:09:04 2015 UTC,"I have alot of faith in Justin this week. He's been a supporting character for the most part, but  has greatly improved over the past couple weeks in terms of roleplay and in-game decisions. He is by far the best puppeteer, always seeming to have the perfect expression/movement for the given situation. I can see him really breaking out if he is the leader this week."
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,cc12321,4,Thu Jun 18 01:52:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, he nails the puppet's expressions and even his timed entrances. Sometimes the other guys will remain scowling if they have a grumpy or mean character. It just doesn't utilize the range of emotion."
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,CederDUDE22,9,Thu Jun 18 06:10:19 2015 UTC,"Justin isn't the leader this week, and won't be for a few more. At least thats what he said on stream.  Also Justin's a quiet guy, but he has the best story and punchlines. K4!"
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,josh__ab,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:53:00 2015 UTC,There needs to be a card thats similar to the curse of K4 where when anyone around you rolls a 4's it gives them a 1 instead :D

BuffaloWizards,3a886q,DanelerH,5,Thu Jun 18 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like even though Justin doesn't talk a lot, when he does say things they are great. Also, on Justin's stream they said that Roamin would probably be the leader, but from the way they said it they were probably just guessing too. I'm really interested in how the guys will play as goblins,  seeing how they are universally hated."
BuffaloWizards,3a886q,Maxattack1126,2,Thu Jun 18 02:05:45 2015 UTC,I totally agree about Deadbones. His roll play has been spot on in both Porc Hunters and Dingo Isle.

BuffaloWizards,3a8h78,Run4urlife333,17,Thu Jun 18 01:39:17 2015 UTC,"I think your problem here is describing the game, rather than the show. Your description is perfect if you're trying to introduce the D&D game to someone who has never played a tabletop RPG before and is nervous about the idea. But introducing it to someone as a show? You've missed the entire point. There are a million D&D shows a person can watch, some even as simple to get into as URL, but very few/none with the Buffalo Wizards standard of comedy. None at all with the Puppet integration. The fact that it's simple and easy to get into is great, because literally anyone can follow what is happening (assuming they can wrap their head around 20=good, 1=bad) but isn't nearly as important as the ways in which the guys interact with each other, or the flow and quality of the roleplay and comedy.  Pick a few of your favorite moments to show them. Have them watch part of a really fun encounter, or some of the out-of-combat puppet interaction. Let the humor sell itself. You don't have to start on the first campaign if you think there's a later one that suits your friends' sense of humor better (especially right now. We're so early in the series that it's not hard to take an afternoon and catch up on earlier campaigns if they want to see more). Or watch/Skype with them during one of the streams if they're close friends; hype can be really infectious sometimes.  More than anything, keep in mind that it's THEIR sense of humor you want to play to. If they like fantasy tropes, play to that. If they like drunken humor, the New Years campaign (although not canon) might be best. If they like witty banter, the puppet-centric scenes will have that. If they have no idea what you're on about, well anyone can understand saving puppies from flaming skeletons ;P  Those are my rambling opinions, anyway. Hope you got something of use out of it. Good luck!  (edit because I'm an idiot and tired)"

Monk Nimbus Familiar- ‘anyway' should be 'any way’  Monk Soothe Spirits- 'Attempts' should just be ‘Attempt'  Paladin Blessing of Strength- it says “For allies, they must yell a phrase chosen by the paladin  when they attack to they will lose this effect” I think it should be “For allies, they must yell a phrase chosen by the paladin  when they attack to lose this effect”  Paladin Holy Light- ‘Stamina' is capitalized for no apparent reason :P  Paladin Honor Chains- I think it should be reworded to “Use chains of pure light to shackle one target to another”  Paladin Unholy Water- ‘flask’ is plural when it should be singular.  Sorcerer Flare- there are a few things to be noted. ‘Summon for’ should be ‘summon forth’  The word ‘cast’ shows up twice when there should only be one. I think it should be re worded to something like “Summon forth a powerful ball of light in your hands that can be thrown for 5 damage. You are able to change the properties of this ball in many ways. You can specialize it to blind or burn, change its size for distance or power, have it explode on contact, or split into 3 separate balls. The more complex you make it, the harder it will be to successfully cast.""  Sorcerer Rolling Fog- it says “The fog expands to a nearby spaces each turn” the ‘a' should be removed.  Swashbuckler Grandpa Smokescreen- it says “unable to of their abilities and attacks” it should be “unable to use”  Warrior Blockade- I think it should be re worded to “While blocking, you cannot be moved by enemies.”  Wizard Ice Blast- it should be “Each turn that you haven't moved or taken damage, the stamina cost is reduced by 1 until it no longer costs stamina”  Matchlock Rifle- should be something like “Bullets burn hot enough to ignite gunpowder”  Spellblade Spellblade- it says melee and range but it can only be one… I think..  Bone Tusk Rampaging- ‘there’ should be ‘their’  Treasure Dragonskin Bow- “Deals 5 Damage. Damage is tripled on a critical”  Treasure Frog on a Stick- ‘stick’ is plural when it should be singular.  Treasure Ginyu’s Shard of Perversion- “You and a target of the same general size and strength switch bodies. You retain your class, but your inventories are swapped. The shard then breaks forever”  Treasure Grace’s Light- I’m having trouble understanding this one... Consider revision."

Keen Stone Flask: Should be ""An 8oz flask made of Keen Stone - a bendable, rubbery type of magical rock."" [Side note: Would ""kind of magical rock"" be better than ""type of magical rock""?] Locket of a Loved One: Should be ""A small piece of silver jewelry that contains a picture of someone who has passed away.""

Rancid Swammie: Should be ""A rotten fish that becomes more potent in its magic abilities as it ages.

Spellblade Pasta Bread: Should be ""An enchanted bread that, when held by a gifted magic user, becomes warm and coated with a fresh pasta sauce. The Elven word for this food is Pissa."" Spoon of Realties: Should it be Spoon of Realities? Description is fine, however. Torch: Should be ""A wooden rod with a piece of cloth wrapped around it, soaked in oil."" Anhk of the Paladin Order: Should it be Ankh of the Paladin Order? If so, the description should be ""A small golden Ankh that can be worn as a necklace or charm. It is a symbol of the Paladin Order."" Bag of Juicy Beetles: Should be ""A bag of live beetles. Beetles are somewhat of a delicacy to Gnomes. It's really gross."" Blacksmith Hammer: Should be ""A small hammer used by blacksmiths. It's not a very good weapon, but it's great for things like nails."" Blood Book: Should be ""A journal that can only be written in using blood, and read by the person whose blood its words belong to."" Blood Flame Lanturn: Should it be Blood Flame Lantern? Furthermore, ""Spirit"" should be capitalised in the description. Bottle of Wise Rum: Should be ""A 20oz bottle of wise rum. Wise rum often makes characters more clever than regular ale does."" [Unless you mean to say it makes them more clever than regular ale itself.] Coral Comb: Should be ""A small comb made of coral, used to comb hair and beards. It is normally used by sailors. Goblins are often allergic to coral."" Dvergr Rope: Should be ""10 meters of rope made from the beard hair of a dead Dvergr. Very offensive to most Dwarves, but it is some of the strongest rope around."" [Side note: Some cards use imperial units, others use metric. This isn't really an issue but you may want to stick to a single system for consistency in URL lore.] Elaphlek Skin Backpack: Should it be Elephelk Skin Backpack? (If not, it's still incorrect, and should be Elaphelk.)

Cabalist: For ""Pestilence"", ""Pestilence"" is capitalised and not capitalised in the description at different points. Paladin: For ""Blessing of Strength"", ""...when they attack to they will..."" should be ""...when they attack or they will..."" Paladin: For ""Unholy Water"", should be ""Throw a flask of Unholy Water at the target. If the flask hits, you may change the target of their next attack, action, or spell."" Sorcerer: For ""Blink"" and ""Enlarge"", ""target's"" is used instead of ""targets"". Furthermore, for ""Enlarge"", ""it's"" is used instead of ""its"". Sorcerer: For ""Flare"", the first sentence should be ""Summon forth a powerful ball..."" Sorcerer: For ""Rolling Fog"", the second sentence should be ""...expands to a nearby space..."" Swashbuckler: For ""Grandpa Smokescreen"", the description should be ""Fire some of the ashes of your dead grandpa at a target, creating a smoke ring around them. Anyone (besides you) inside the smokescreen is unable to use any of their abilities and attacks. Using this ability makes you very emotional about the loss of your grandfather. Swashbuckler: For ""Lunge"", the comma should be a full stop/period. Theurgist: For ""Call Earthlord"", the second use of ""Earthlord"" in the description needs to be capitalised. Theurgist: For ""Summon Air Sprites"", the second use of ""Sprites"" in the description needs to be capitalised. Theurgist: For ""Frost Elemental"", the term ""water elemental"" is used at one point, which should probably be changed to ""Frost Elemental"".

Warrior: ""Chivarly"" should be ""Chivalry"".      Matchlock Rifle: Should be ""Deals 5 Damage. Shoots bullets that burn so hot that they can ignite gunpowder."" Porc Skin Armor: ""porcs"" should be capitalised in the description. Blunderbuss: ""Damage"" is capitalised and not capitalised at different points in the description.

(haven't tested if it lags for short audio files) Then I used the software from this video to convert them to .ogg files. (You are also able to listen to the current sound files make by opening it in the program and selecting play) You're then going to want to rename them to the exact name of the RP's file names that you wish to change.

BuffaloWizards,39tgli,pizzabash,3,Sun Jun 14 20:40:34 2015 UTC,Maybe he learns or realizes the statues had amazing potential to be enchanted or at the very least sees that there's a random treasure jutting out of it.

As I am unsure as to why it wouldnt be working (Im using Chrome too) unless you are getting 404's or something on the image downloads for the card backgrounds (which would in turn cause it not to allow you to save)."
BuffaloWizards,39sd9x,Plorntus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"I've just went back to it, it looks like the  card builder is just extremely slow, the background took about 10 seconds to load, same thing with the save, weird..."
BuffaloWizards,39sd9x,Mranth0ny62,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:07:39 2015 UTC,"eh I mean it is downloading 5 large images (1000x700 card BGs), 3 fonts, and various other things before it saves so I guess that could be it if you've not visited the page before and you're on semi slow internet. The servers upload/download stats are:   Ping: 6.9 ms  Download: 831.83 Mbit/s  Testing upload speed..................................................  Upload: 316.85 Mbit/s   So not too sure why it would be slow."
BuffaloWizards,39sd9x,Plorntus,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"I've already made cards, so I had them before    but out of curiosity, isn't the card on the card builder page a canvas element? wouldn't that make it faster?"
BuffaloWizards,39sd9x,Mranth0ny62,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"Bit of both!  The card preview is all HTML to ensure it has something on the page as fast as it can (Also means rendering the description is easier due to not having to implement justified word wrapped text on canvas).   Then when you click save, somewhat stupidly it downloads all (even if not used) the images ready for the canvas, outputs it all to a canvas element (doesnt use any html>canvas since those come out blurry). But yeah I had to output a hidden element to the page with the description in it, and then wrap every letter in a span tag and then get all the positions of every letter to use when rendering each individual letter to the canvas so I can see why it could be slow on mobiles etc.  Edit: To reply to your edit, it would technically be faster from a performance standpoint once the required images have downloaded. However... since you have to wait for images to download before you can even think about drawing to a canvas, it likely would be perceived as slower. Also as stated above there is no way of drawing justified, word-wrapped text to a canvas element. So all in all I wouldnt say it wouldnt be the better choice if done right however for speed of getting this thing implemented and created, I didn't start with canvas.  And to add on to that, I used React to make development faster. AFAIK there is no proper (good) implementation of 2D canvas for React. There are 3D versions however the 2D pixiejs implementation does not work correctly so I could not use it at the time of creating it."

I personally like that things aren't traditional fantasy tropes/names; that way when someone says ""hey, watch out for behemoth on your travels"" we're not instantly looking for the traditional creature, so there's a better chance of being caught off guard.

BuffaloWizards,39q22a,KadaSauce,2,Sat Jun 13 21:53:07 2015 UTC,Maybe it has that weird One ring sentience
BuffaloWizards,39q22a,kojima100,2,Sat Jun 13 22:23:53 2015 UTC,"I actually like this idea. People in chat were talking about Joe Krisstal (did they decide just Crystal? I don't remember) turning into Chimera because of how powered Justin was. And if that, along with this theory, then we can easily add in the lore that Nisovin looks for 4 souls that he thinks are worthy, or connected in some way (be it souls of the past or reincarnation) because there's some huge prophecy that depends on it. And timeline wise it would be Jewel of the Dingo Isle a few lifetimes before Porc Hunters. Roamin's Band of Thieves might be just something happening in the same timeline as Porc Hunters since they spoke of Gwndolyn (or what ever) and there really isn't much of a connection between the characters from there. Come to think of it RBoT is like a world building start to set the stage for the lore/canon for future campaigns."

BuffaloWizards,39qni2,darthfluffy63,2,Sun Jun 14 13:59:55 2015 UTC,I assumed Cormac was a dwarf because then entire party was a dwarf in Nuren.

BuffaloWizards,39qni2,tmha88,2,Sun Jun 14 00:11:52 2015 UTC,They said he was look at the wiki
BuffaloWizards,39qni2,NinjaX3I,6,Sun Jun 14 13:44:55 2015 UTC,"I just re-watched the video, they called him a man, not a human.  Also, see Rob's comment."
BuffaloWizards,39qni2,Gatling_Tech,2,Sun Jun 14 14:30:51 2015 UTC,I believe Nuren was non cannon

BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,Heartgold3,5,Fri Jun 12 22:05:36 2015 UTC,It can work both ways really. Either Kinny at some point attacked the Porc encampment (which coild even be where Merci or McCoy came from) Qand stole/fought Ca-Rell and took the mace or if at some point in this weeks encounter Kinny loses the mace in the ocean it washes into the lake Ca later finds it.

BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,Missterycaller,14,Fri Jun 12 21:39:13 2015 UTC,I really liked Roamin's character in this. He shined in that end of episode discussion which made me happy. Something about being a worshipful first mate really fits Roamin's humor.
BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,KierkM,17,Fri Jun 12 22:28:17 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping he goes all earthlord and does exactly what Coe says. Coe told him not to let Deadbones kill anyone, so first fight he's gonna stop Deadbones from fighting."
BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,Missterycaller,7,Fri Jun 12 23:19:46 2015 UTC,That's so great. I'm now imagining Coe telling him to get him a drink and suddenly they're in an encounter but Roamin won't fight because he's busy getting alcohol.
BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,cmcdonald22,4,Fri Jun 12 23:22:48 2015 UTC,"While they were still going I was really wondering how Roamin was gonna play half wit lacky as up until now he's been leader, or the guy in the back who thinks he knows better, but now he's a dutiful first mate porc, and as soon as he started doing it I was sold.  So good, the sextant bit was fantastic, RP items already paying off in building better characters."

BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,incrediblemulk,3,Fri Jun 12 21:26:35 2015 UTC,Kobold would be better in the long run because of his class abilities that require him to roll an 18 or higher to get a treasure.  With 2 die he'll have a higher chance to gain a treasure card.
BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,cmcdonald22,6,Fri Jun 12 22:22:56 2015 UTC,Rob's starting a pattern here where the main enemy of the previous week are playable characters in the next campaign.  Granted this is only a pattern of two so far.  It does create an interesting dynamic of previously more one dimensional enemy character races becoming more fleshed out in the following campaign.
BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,Patriot_Brother,7,Sat Jun 13 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"It makes sense from a work flow stand point.  He has to think up the racial traits/skills and get art work done for the race in order to use them as the villain.  Then to make sure he isn't immediately recycling the same races he needs something different and already has the former ""enemy"" base work done.  And I agree it actually does flesh out the races and make them more interesting."

BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,Juliandroid98,4,Fri Jun 12 21:21:20 2015 UTC,A Cook with a Parrot?  Must be LL Cool Porc from Deep Blue Sea
BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,olesideburnsatx,3,Fri Jun 12 22:21:48 2015 UTC,Oooh pirates.  This is going to be a very interesting campaign to watch.

BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,Petertwnsnd,6,Fri Jun 12 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, stuff like ""BlazeMaster"" works better for single pokes than it does for in universe characters.

My biggest problem with the Nuren campaign was all of the ridiculous dick joke names and user names on the internet fall really close to that same vein."
BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,cmcdonald22,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:54:06 2015 UTC,Rob ultimately retconned the names of the characters from The Nuren Campaign to make them more appropriate and fit in world better.

BuffaloWizards,39mjvr,Kevtrev,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:45:41 2015 UTC,1-(17/20)2-2*(3/20)(1/20) = .2625  2*(3/20)(1/20) = .015 is the odds that you roll over a 17 but also a 1.

BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,Rurikar,18,Fri Jun 12 19:50:05 2015 UTC,Him talking about the goblin racism (or whatever we're calling it) made me really want to see the guys play goblins and live in their really shitty sewers (or whereever) and try to steal stuff. I feel like it would be similar to the first campaign so I don't know if it would work but I think it would be great to see. (Especially if the brave goblin who lived under the bridge in an elvin village was a legend or something.)
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,Missterycaller,3,Fri Jun 12 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"They would roll 1's on stealing, and then a 20 on swimming away :P"
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,Missterycaller,2,Fri Jun 12 15:57:57 2015 UTC,The entire map is water with rocks and everyone knows fog.
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,tobben20,13,Fri Jun 12 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"Instead of Goblin ""racism"", maybe prejudice is the term you are looking for. Also to note, your improv on this show was good. Bringing in Roamins brother was great, and the fire elementals spawning on the small fires were really funny IMO."
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,ASK_ME_ABOUT_VOAT,11,Fri Jun 12 16:02:29 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved the part where Chimera came out instead of Philhipé. I can't believe anyone actually thought that that wasn't going to be a bad thing if they have been watching Rob for a long time. The amount of times he has trolled chat and such, you'd think it was expected for him to pull something like that.  edit: I just realized something. Where was Coober this time around? Was he hiding somewhere?"
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,RealPieIsAwesomeful,2,Fri Jun 12 17:11:02 2015 UTC,He was probably on the left side of the map that they didn't go to.
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,yuvalal,7,Sat Jun 13 00:16:07 2015 UTC,the loot event is nice it will better if there wil be only one event (for example 1 loot chest=300$) bar whic will be 900$ goal. and if if pass 300$ the players will get 1 chest if it pass 600$ they wil get 2 and if it full (900$) they will get all 3 chests. this might save a little time but still something.
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,ScorchHellfire,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:45:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. Having 3 equal and competing bonus loot goals felt kinda weird.
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,MrLKK,12,Mon Jun 15 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"Man, talking about lovable characters, roleplay, and improv reminds me of a Felipe esque character I had in one of my D&D campaigns. I had them all befriend an orc tribe captain while recruiting to get more people to fight a war.  They fucking loved that guy, he was a badass and they all became good friends with him really fast even though he was cold and distant originally. Once they were good friends with him and he became their traveling companion, I got them to really hate the opposing army by having the enemy's commander chop off his head. It was fantastic, one of the best part of the campaign.  This series really resonates with me as a DM, and I wonder how different I'd feel about the show if I wasn't a DM."
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,olesideburnsatx,3,Fri Jun 12 15:56:48 2015 UTC,Any idea's for Tshirts? A Shirt that says I am Porbo? Porbo in the mirror? Roman's brother holding Porc heads?

BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,Absynthexx,4,Fri Jun 12 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"A couple of thoughts on this video:  1) Rob you seem a little more sensitive or concerned than you normally are about your content. Probably because you are so excited about this. I say continue your tried and true method of relying more on neutral metrics (like views, likes, etc.) and less on chat messages.  2) I'm glad you are tackling the topic of players losing or dying. I was actually concerned that you would do everything possible to prevent that and just as you suspected, it made me think of the show as slightly more scripted than crazy, anything can happen. This will definitely change how I view the combat encounters now.  3) I like the idea of the players RP'ing different characters and I totally got what Coe was doing at the start of the last campaign. At the same time, there are some quirks that certain members do REALLY well and I would like them to come back to that maybe a little more often than normal. For example, Roamin does the 'I'm not amused' snobby attitude so well! Plus his puppet has perfect animations for that. I would be sad if he left that personality for multiple weeks in a row.  4) Regarding your back- I've thrown my back out 3 times and it's very scary. If you are recovering from that or if you are afraid your back is under a lot of stress that may be putting it at risk of a spasm, make sure to keep your elbows close to your hips when doing activities until your back heals. The further out your elbows are, the more stress there is on your lower back muscles. Also, its not just some single major event that causes your back to go out (like TV pretends). It's usually a slow buildup of stress on the muscles and then the spasm can be triggered by something very mundane a day or two later like reaching out to dry your hands on a towel or opening a door. Every time I have thrown my back out the spasm dropped me to the floor instantly and I couldn't move and could barely breathe. Obviously preventative measures include stretching and strength exercises. My last back problem was over 5 years ago so keeping your back muscles strong and flexible certainly works as a preventative measure."
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,Makydog,2,Sat Jun 13 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"I noticed that when Rob was talking about how some people felt that the donations were going up slower he specifically repeated some things I had said in a comment he had replied to, so I'm gonna assume that's what he was talking about. If this is the case, I just wanna say that looking back, I do now see what Rob was talking about with all that, it's all clear to me now."
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,Run4urlife333,2,Fri Jun 12 20:40:55 2015 UTC,I kinda want to see them as Goblins one of these weeks. Also I think the correct term for species racism is speciesism. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/speciesism?s=t
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,pizzabash,3,Fri Jun 12 23:01:27 2015 UTC,"I believe the term he was searching for was discrimination, as for how the game is set up with the races and such"
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,pizzabash,5,Fri Jun 12 23:02:31 2015 UTC,"I kinda dont like when rob goes on long rants about out of campaign stuff in these videos. I really wish it was more focusing on the campaign it seemed like 70+% of this was just rants about the state of URL itself. Which is fine but not for a behind the scenes video for a campaign.  I mean he never brought up the entire left side of the first board that wasnt even mentioned live and I expected it to at least be mentioned in this video. Another small thing is that random red tiled creature in town completely ignored. He did not address the controversy of chimera COMPLETELY dodging a 20 with a lower non 20 roll. Had he still gotten singed or something that'd be one thing but to completely dodge a 20 seemed bullshit. Then there was the blind porc that somehow managed to do whatever he wanted despite his blindness. I expected some explanation on why the porc was able to hit roamin walk up to deadbones and easily hit him and walk up to porbo somehow. I mean come on the guys suddenly struck with complete blindness and hes a dumb porc he's going to panic. He didnt discuss how the party and campaign developed at the end with porbo being trapped in the mirror, deadbones staying behind, chilly wizzy being promoted to leader, and roamin getting completely shown up by his little brother. Plus he didnt talk about the MAJOR event that happened at the end, coe's 20 roll on the mirror toss at the very end."
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,AmbitiousHobo,3,Fri Jun 12 17:05:24 2015 UTC,I mean i dont need it spoiled i would just like it acknowledged. Like why he didnt have the party go left at all what couldve been a reason for them to go left etc...
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,pizzabash,5,Fri Jun 12 18:03:57 2015 UTC,"But that 70+% was discussion on how this campaign and how it played out might affect future URL shows, which is kinda what you'd expect from a Behind the Scenes video.  As for the left side of the board, he said in the last Behind the Scenes that he wouldn't show those alternate routes and events because he could potentially re-use those in the future.  The 20 Fireball that completely missed, and the 20 Nearsight that buffed the victim (as opposed to a 19 that wouldn't have let it Drain from so far away) left a bad taste in my mouth, too. But with how well the guys were doing at that point, and with how well the subsequent reaction rolls by the enemies were, I can forgive it as a necessity. These guys had next to no trouble in both of those encounters, and to me at least it's just not a satisfactory conclusion if a legendary badass like Chimera who can easily manhandle 8 Spellblades just dies to a 20 Fireball, or if Porbo's mooks are straight up useless and the fight ends before anything happens. I personally would rather that a couple of 20s are dodged to keep the show entertaining than for stuff like that to happen."

It seemed like only a few minutes were spent on each encounter   As for the left side of the board, he said in the last Behind the Scenes that he wouldn't show those alternate routes and events because he could potentially re-use those in the future.   As I said in another reply he doesn't need to reveal it however i really wish he had acknowledged its existence and said why he didnt have the party go that way or how they would've ended up there.

The fireball i would've been completely happy with just barely hitting him doing slightly above average damage instead of full crit damage whereas a non 20 fireball would have missed him completely. Either way i still would've liked those instances brought up and explained by rob in the behind the scenes video."
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,Boingboingsplat,3,Fri Jun 12 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"he wanted it to be a cliff hanger ending that you decide on which way the 20 goes on the end, so I see why he didn't do that. But he did seem like he really kind of played unfair in an attempt to win this campaign"
BuffaloWizards,39ld4o,ScorchHellfire,2,Fri Jun 12 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"I dont want him to tell us what it means. I wanted him to discuss it in the sense of  ""these are the kinds of moments im talking about that well revist later. No one not even me knows what the hell rolling a 20 means on this. Perhaps in a future campaign we'll see the effects of this roll. Ill be honest though when i heard coe do that i was like wait what and started doing some major thinking of how it was going be played out depending on a high or low roll. I did not expect that 20 and am kinda glad it happened. Now it gives me more time to make that 20 make something very memorable in the future and also look at some of the ideas you guys have that I might adapt or even straight up use for it.""  Something like that wouldve been nice to hear."
BuffaloWizards,39ljba,Lt_Shniz,3,Fri Jun 12 16:03:55 2015 UTC,I don't know how well balanced this is but I like the idea of items being cursed.   I was thinking that the wearer couldn't or really didn't wan't to take it off but I didn't want to go all one ring with it

BuffaloWizards,39n8ek,CaptainDeston,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:13:03 2015 UTC,Personally I like the idea of this but I feel it would fit better as a chat event
BuffaloWizards,39nn0r,CaptainDeston,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:16:33 2015 UTC,Its nice to see more unarmed (punching based) item ideas. The only problem I see with this is the price should be 500.
BuffaloWizards,39mksu,Missterycaller,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"On second thought, it probably should cost less $500 given what it does but I'm not really confident on what it does anyway so if anyone has any better ideas...? (I just thought of the name and associated it with something that would help people sneak around, trick people and steal stuff.)"

BuffaloWizards,39n3gv,Skipper2399,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:07:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, I was trying to balance it, but one turn of invincibility seemed kinda useless.    maybe make it so that they move faster and don't have to use stamina for their speels but they can still take damage?"
BuffaloWizards,39n3gv,Skipper2399,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:13:38 2015 UTC,Maybe. Either way it is a really powerful passive
BuffaloWizards,39n2ib,EpitomeOfWhat,2,Fri Jun 12 22:27:06 2015 UTC,I find it helps a lot if you precede your grammar corrections with what you like and find interesting about whatever it is.
BuffaloWizards,39n2ib,tamwin5,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming I may have something to do with this one, or that might be just me trying to feel like I actually caused something to happen ... I have to say, I feel like an ass every time I correct someone. I mean, English isn't even my first language and here I am telling other people they're doing it wrong.  But I think I'll continue doing it, because of a simple reason: if you make spelling or grammar mistakes, people will probably think less of you.  They take you less seriously and it's a shame if good ideas get ignored or overshadowed because of this.  It really doesn't take that long to check for typos and in my opinion, only good things will come of it."

BuffaloWizards,39n2ib,Drizzle_0,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, k. The reason I thought I might have had something to do with it was that I pointed a typo just a couple minutes before your post lol.  I just wanted to feel important ... xD  And yeah, I know it can be annoying, but I too want to do it to help. I'm not trying to annoy anyone, it's just an unwanted side-effect."
BuffaloWizards,39n2ib,Drizzle_0,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and so I want to know the best way to do that. A grammar nazi card thread, for example."
BuffaloWizards,39lqi0,SnowieHD,2,Fri Jun 12 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"This is actually a really good idea, however I think this should be a treasure item. At first I thought this could be extremely OP against bosses with burst damage. Like lets say a boss uses a spell like Fireball and crits then it would do 20 on base add the 2 extra and you have 11 damage with only the use of 2 stamina. But then again if you think about it you basically just have an instant that costs 2 stamina so it is pretty balanced."
BuffaloWizards,39lqi0,Smexyhillbilly,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:50:14 2015 UTC,I also like to think that it's armour that doesn't add stamina so it would be hard for anybody with low stamina to use and would make it not for everybody   Armour so dark it resonates with all the toxicity of a twitch.tv stream
BuffaloWizards,39n9yk,death5900,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:25:44 2015 UTC,"I was thinking, how about 4&1 counts as 1 and every other n counts as n+1? So 1->1 2->3 ... 4->1, 5->6... 19->20, 20->20. Double chances for critical fails and critical rolls."
BuffaloWizards,39n9yk,GaussWanker,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:33:49 2015 UTC,But what does the +1 thing have to do with 4? Maybe if it was 4&1 count as 1 and then 14&20 count as 20 then it would make sense but not as much.

BuffaloWizards,39lqwv,Skipper2399,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:17:16 2015 UTC,But how would any random enemy know to take out the scroll to kill it. Maybe if it was immune to magic OR physical damage it might be a bit more balanced. The damage is also way too high for a pet.

So far, Rob has been trying to make the game a very simplified version of D&D, and he hasn't introduced any from of weapon proficiency.

BuffaloWizards,39ejn2,ManInTheHat,3,Thu Jun 11 05:10:14 2015 UTC,"Alright, Imma give you some feedback if you like (no particular order):    I like that the Deconstructor is some kind of high risk, high reward type of character. You're able to blow kinda everything up, but that everything might be yourself and your allies.  The Flak Vest seems a bit overpowered, you might want to take out the immunity to fire damage and reduce the immunity to explosive damage to some some kind of ""no knockback, far lower damage"".  Also: is the Air Horn In A Bottle a one time use? If so, seems alright; if not: might be overpowered. Possibly change it to an consumable item.  Oh and if I see that correctly, the Firebomb, Proximity Mines and Burning Blood Tonic are spells. You could change that so it's like the abilities of the Bard, and not spells. (for technicality reasons like Spellwall Armor)  On the point of Burning Blood Tonic: I feel like the initial damage should be higher, because it's (unless big damage hits) infinite healing. Maybe even a one time per combat use, but that would be pretty limiting.  I'm also a fan of the Frugal Leaon and the Leaon Herbalist (and the Leaon race itself). The Leaon Apprentice feels kinda boring compared to the other two.   The Ashen seem like they would only have a use in fire encounters, but they also remind me of the Falmer of TES(Skyrim). You could be give them some poison-y things, but DOTs are annoying to keep track of. Argh, I don know, so far I'm not so much of a fan of them.    I can't really form a meaningful opinion on the stuff I didn't comment on, but I hope for the rest my feedback helps. Great that you put your effort into this."
BuffaloWizards,39ejn2,SeegurkeK,2,Thu Jun 11 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"Hey that's all great man thanks! I definitely see your points. The air horn was meant to be flagged consumable, guess that bugged out. And I dunno for certain about the flak vest -- yes, it's REALLY powerful, but it's also 1,000 gold, meaning unless you're a Dwarf or a player who got one of the ""best rp moments"" awards then if you buy it, you have no weapon. I was aiming for synergy with the Deconstructor, to the point that (I personally at least would allow it) the Frugal Laeon could roll to not consume one of his limited Firebomb spells."
BuffaloWizards,39ezo1,tuns_of_fun,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:35:41 2015 UTC,"I like it, provides a ton of RP opportunities. But it seems maybe to RP focused.

BuffaloWizards,39ezo1,raidergreymoon,2,Thu Jun 11 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I made otherworldly punch intentionally weak since I want them to pick up the more role-play ones.  The secret to this class's combat effectiveness is in possession.  My idea is that they'd have premade heroes that they'd want to possess them, e.g. they'd create a wizard hero with powerful attack spells that they could use in battle.  The trade-off for being able to exchange spells and abilities at will is that a bad role would mean getting the wrong hero or having them refuse to leave when asked.  I'd imagine a roll of 1 on an exorcism attempt would mean expelling yourself and leaving the hero alone in your body."

BuffaloWizards,39e7yz,Alklaine,3,Thu Jun 11 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"What's with ""Word of Mouths"" range? 1000? If you want it to have an unlimited range just don't put in a number for range. Plus the Suicide Crow is kind of rascist. Rob has said in TTT that if he could change one sound effect in the game he would change the Jihad bomb since it's kind of uncomfortably racist.   Other than that they're not bad. The Sketchy Elixr sounds fun, the Confession Bear is interesting for RP, Renunciation is interesting although it seems more like a spell or ability than an item, and very shiny rock seems like a good crap treasure."

BuffaloWizards,39e7yz,Petertwnsnd,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:23:00 2015 UTC,My point was that Rob has recently gone on record saying he's not a huge fan of that joke and including it in the card makes it less likely that it would be chosen by him for the deck.
BuffaloWizards,39e7yz,SeegurkeK,2,Thu Jun 11 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"The Confession Bear seems like a really good RP idea. Not so much a fan of the other cards, but that Bear seems really really good.

BuffaloWizards,39ciws,Petertwnsnd,7,Wed Jun 10 21:07:19 2015 UTC,"I really do think that it's better to stay away from DoT effects, bar something important like rabies. Keeping track of all sorts of effects is a nightmare to do during a livestream, and they aren't integral enough to role play games to be worth their trouble.  Possession is neat, but it really doesn't need the selfie clause, that's uniquely flavoured for charm.  Deathbolt is neat, but it seems a little underpowered. Critical trigger events and dramatic and swingy, but not enough to balance out a weak ability. It definitely doesn't seem like a 3 stam ability.  I guess the problem is carving out an identity for the class that isn't just ""wizards with flavour"". I think a neat ability for a necromancer class would be something along the lines of grasping hands of the long-forgotten dead, that snared all enemies within x tiles of a target space, denying the movements of the afflicted targets unless they make a roll, or use up their action. That'd be a neat CC that works well with maybe slower, shambling pets, which are characteristic minions of necromancers."
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,Glass_Underfoot,3,Wed Jun 10 22:47:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feed back. I might take some of these back to the drawing board and update the with your suggestions.
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,Glass_Underfoot,3,Wed Jun 10 23:05:48 2015 UTC,I've updated the cards with some of your suggestions. I'd love to hear what you think.
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,cmcdonald22,3,Thu Jun 11 00:30:28 2015 UTC,"Well, of course I'm going to say the one I inspired is cool. One damage seems like the right amount too. I'm not sure how the three stamina cost plays with cost reduction mechanics, those seem to really swing balance in favour of spells.  Possession is a little bit narrow, it's utility is huge when against the undead, but nil in all other situations. Abilities like that are fine in the context of an MMO, there too many relevant abilities mean bloat. But when you're only picking 2-5 abilities for the entire game, having one that is totally negated based on circumstances beyond the player's control feels anti-fun. It's either so good you'd be dumb not to have it, or totally useless. That said, it's not bad, or unbalanced, it's just hard to fit into the game as a whole.  The issue with deathbolt is that it doesn't feel very necromancer, it feels like dark magic, yes, but it doesn't support the skill set that a necromancer should have. This isn't a huge issue, it's a good spell, but I'm trying to think about how it could be turned to better serve the class as a whole. All it is, I think it makes sense to have a necromancer as a pet class, and so how can we support that? The idea that jumps out at me is to make deathbolt do 2 damage, cost one, but have 10 range. So a really obvious build would be a necromancer with Grasping Hands, some spell that summons the undead, and deathbolt, where deathbolt works to supplement pet damage, while keeping the necromancer far from harm's way.   One of the other issues, and this sort of connects with possession, is the reliance on dead bodies. Okay, maybe it would be pretty funny to have the party hauling around corpses. Maybe the necromancer could have one ability that creates a weaker (slower?) undead, like a shade, with no body requirement, and then another that makes a stronger undead that requires a body. That's kind of neat because, absent body-dragging shenanigans, it means that the necromancer is weaker at the start of the fight, and stronger as it goes on. It also influences strategy vis-a-vis who to take down first. And by having these as two abilities, it forces interesting choices. Both work well together, both work well separately. You can't take both with the other two spells, deathbolt and hands, but any combination of abilities is pretty good. Body detonation would work well with some, but not others, but that's fine too.  As for the raise dead on unconscious, nah, it's much cooler if it forces the player to kill downed enemies. It takes time, and is very necromancer flavoured.  Anyway, I don't mean to rag on your ideas or anything, it's just you've got a really interesting idea with some really cool possibilities that I can see."
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,Toadslayer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I agree with most of what you said.  In regards to Possession, it is very narrow, however in this setting that seems to be ok. The guys always have a rough idea of what they're up against before they make their characters and tend to have classes built around that. Heck, this week it looks like we're getting a Pirate theme and they're adding two new pirate themed classes, so having a class that relies so heavily on the undead and the corpses of defeated enemies seems like it could work given the right setting.  I included Death Bolt because I felt I needed to give the class a cheap basic attack. I really would have preferred something like Life Drain, which would fit in better with the Necromancer theme,  but I don't know how I could have made that ability any different than the one the Cabalist has and that one costs 3 stamina. I tried giving it that critical twist, but it wasn't balanced. I also ended up giving it 5 range because most other basic attacks have a similar range and I didn't want it to powerful. I might change it again although at this point I think everyone who's gonna see it has seen it already so I don't know if there's much of a point.  Quick note about Grasping hands, I was trying to keep it balanced, especially against something like Blanket of Darkness. Upon inspection though Blanket of Darkness is REALLY OP. It costs the same as Rolling Fog and has the same range but is instant, causes the people inside it to go crazy, and can be detonated at will. It should really be a once per combat thing since if Coe had kept spamming it and realized he could detonate it whenever they could have wiped the floor with any encounter. I'd also like to point out that Grasping Hands with another persistent AOE attack like Blanket of Darkness of Blizzard would be REALLY good."
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,Toadslayer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:46:32 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of balancing and tweaking just for us, even if Rob and co never end up using these classes we might in our games we run amongst this sub.  I certainly would.   I think deathbolt should just be a piddly low damage high range attack. A necromancer doesn't feel right doing direct damage and when it is doing direct damage it shouldn't be a lot and should be I'm a way the necro is still safe. I'd go 10 range and maybe something like you can cast deathbolt from summoned undead at cost to their stamina and 5 range. That way if you have a skellie that just can't catch up to someone with a ruby you can just pop it into a suicide bolter? Though that could be too similar to corpse explosion in the long run."
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,Toadslayer,2,Thu Jun 11 10:34:22 2015 UTC,Due to your and /u/Glass_Underfoot 's suggestion I update Death Bolt again to increase the range and try to balance it out a bit.
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,MrLKK,3,Thu Jun 11 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"An issue with Raise the Dead is that pets die imidiately if they get hit and you don't take the damage, so it can't get any extra health. In fact it doesn't have any health at all."
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,tamashinoerufu,2,Wed Jun 10 23:31:26 2015 UTC,"Didn't Rob establish in the Porc Hunters campaigns that more complex pets like the Frost Lord actually have a small amount of health while simple pets like Earth Lords only have one?  The idea of this is when creating the pet/minion you can give him more stamina by sacrificing your own, but only while making him."
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,tamashinoerufu,2,Wed Jun 10 23:50:37 2015 UTC,I don't think he did. I remember Coe being asked if he wanted to take the hit for his Frost Lord and I remember he said no so it died.
BuffaloWizards,39ciws,JetpackAwaaay01,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:13:36 2015 UTC,"Even so, how would that effect the card?

This dog factor is fueled by alcohol or raging hormones of which, when activated one can only hope to escape. A Robdog will usually play an instrument to release sexual tension, often performing musical acts from various artists such as Jack Johnson, John Mayer and a number of other popular musicians.

BuffaloWizards,39cvbi,ManInTheHat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:46:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest, an important part of balancing games is that there are bad cards/abilities alongside the good ones. Too many fan versions of cards (see: the Hearthstone subreddit) only include cards that are obviously good, and frequently way TOO good. Having cards that are bad, and sometimes very subtly so, is a good thing -- it makes you seriously think about it and consider whether or not its worth taking/having or not."
BuffaloWizards,39cvbi,Godheadweasel,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"The BWs aren't trying to make a balanced game. They're trying to make a game that entertains, using the various offered abilities as a way to make the game fun. An overpowered ability isn't always a good thing. But, more often than not, OP abilities are fun. This provides an alternative to buying a weapon, when instead you could have an option to do a backflip and stab somebody in the eye. Practical? Probably not. Balanced? Who knows. Able to entertain an audience of several thousand people? Hell yes."
BuffaloWizards,39cvbi,ManInTheHat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"Depending on what treasure cards come up in the shop, saving the 500g on the weapon may absolutely be worth it. But I will agree that it is a fair point."
BuffaloWizards,39cvbi,Godheadweasel,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"Well, if we're talking balance, a weapon costing 500g is probably better than a flat 4 damage weapon. I think Deadbones' Mace was 500g and did 4 damage BUT it could also stun."
BuffaloWizards,39cvbi,ManInTheHat,2,Thu Jun 11 01:32:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and that's part of why this would actually be a card worth considering. The way Rob does character creation, you don't actually know what treasure cards are going to be available until after you've selected your abilities -- meaning that in taking this, you'd risk getting awful treasure cards that aren't any good for you (a possible combination example would be Wriggly Wench, Crystal Catalyst, Blood Drinker, Ring of Fire, and Heartwall Locket), but you'd ALSO have a possibility of getting an amazing choice of cards (perhaps something like Holy Canteen, Potion Launcher, Spellwall Armor, Wellforn Ruby, and Bladeturn). It's a gamble, but taking this means that for the cost of 3 stamina each combat, you don't have to spend 500g on a weapon and could potentially get some other ridiculously good items instead. Even if the treasures aren't amazing, you could pick up some plate armor for your full 1,000 gold, and have +15 stamina."

BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,Plorntus,9,Wed Jun 10 19:15:53 2015 UTC,Nothing really. It's just so I know who Red Kobold is and who Blue Kobold is for tracking stamina/abilities.
BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,Rurikar,5,Wed Jun 10 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they're just so Rob can keep track of their abilities and such. During the Chimera fight in Porc hunters, each colour of elf had the same skill set I think. Don't quote me on that."
BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,dokoattack5,5,Wed Jun 10 19:54:15 2015 UTC,Its just so that Rob can keep track of each npc's health individually without mixing them up.
BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,darthfluffy63,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:17:48 2015 UTC,That sounds more accurate than mine. Now that i think about it that's what he did.
BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,Aero103,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:20:00 2015 UTC,Ah yeah that makes sense! Guessing he just has different colour versions of each.

BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,L1nkFTW,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:06:46 2015 UTC,Did you figure out how to implement textures onto the tiles.. really itching to put some stuff on my campaign.
BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,cmcdonald22,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:13:39 2015 UTC,use this for the square model: Link
BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,Aero103,3,Thu Jun 11 10:51:52 2015 UTC,"Blue are the science and medical officers, Yellow are security and Engineering, and Red uniforms are command.  .... wait that's Star Trek.  Yeah it's definitely just a mechanism to help Rob keep them in order and differentiate abilities."
BuffaloWizards,39c0ws,keaganwill,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:52:30 2015 UTC,I don't think there's much of a difference. I've seen the enemies in all the tile colors... Like the Kobolds in the Band of Thieves all were different colors. Maybe some have a higher ranking.. depending on color...? I'm not too sure
BuffaloWizards,39d13l,Aero103,2,Wed Jun 10 23:06:07 2015 UTC,"The official one by Rob does not yet have the cards and whatnot in it. This is a (technically unofficial) mod that has them in it, however."

BuffaloWizards,39dm39,tamwin5,2,Thu Jun 11 01:28:42 2015 UTC,"While I would love to, doing so would prove very difficult considering I don't have some of the raw source material (ie, URLive intro you see in the beginning and end of the URLive episodes on Youtube, especially just the logo and not the brown background), nor is there a lot of material for a trailer from Tabletop, and using the animations feels like it would ""undersell"" URLive, even though it's fantastic, when they come from seeing animations galore in a short trailer to tabletop gameplay. Maybe the presence of puppets would make it a bit easier? Who knows. It'd be interesting to see what people make, and I might take a crack at it later, when I'm not so busy with working and stuff."

Use it as another way to enforce the move diversity that Rob usually has to enforce by making rolls more difficult. If you roll doubles that move goes to jail and the player can not perform that action at all next turn."
BuffaloWizards,397q1t,Mistermartijn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"What do you mean size? Like have enough a space for combat, that players can use movement to their advantage but not to much that its just a large field. Little obstacles are nice in large areas."
BuffaloWizards,397q1t,prabhnoor10,2,Tue Jun 9 22:30:43 2015 UTC,"I think he means resolution, because as it stands you can't use tabletop defaults, as the inventory of the players takes up the right side of the texture."

BuffaloWizards,397q1t,prabhnoor10,2,Tue Jun 9 22:37:34 2015 UTC,Coe posted the image of the side menu placement on his twitter so you could probably work out the size of default map - size of that.
BuffaloWizards,397q1t,Plorntus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:44:09 2015 UTC,Tabletop Simulator recommends a 4400x2600 resolution image for the custom board. You could easily just build the map in such a way as to account for the player inventory on the side.
BuffaloWizards,397q1t,ManInTheHat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:50:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I also question how they do the grid. like, from what I see, the maps (at least the first stream's maps) seems to have the grid perfectly aligned with all of the walls of buildings and stuff, I wish I knew how to do that"
BuffaloWizards,397q1t,Alklaine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"Well, what they probably did was have one layer where they did the grid, then made a separate layer to draw the map on.  Then it was just a case of using the grid as a guideline."
BuffaloWizards,397q1t,Rueddit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rob released the grid and inventory part of the map, so it will be much easier for map makers.  Also, what I meant was where did they get the grid itself? Like, it matches the one on tabletop perfectly, and Google doesn't reveal any grid template for Tabletop, so someone had to make it, ya know?"

For Exaliju however, you said it allows an instakill on any creatur same type that turn, the insta-kill should be next turn because a PROC isn't really a barrage attck type thing all at once, I think it would be better as: allowing an insta-kill on any creatire of the same race next turn as long as said attack lands. But thats just my personal opinion, looks cool though!!!"
BuffaloWizards,396l9c,MasterDJV,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yea that's what I was thinking too, and maybe just have it as your proc goes on it becomes harder to attack, maybe nerf damage as well."

BuffaloWizards,393sj4,EverionEU,2,Tue Jun 9 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"Not bad, I like the combination that results in this class. Your cards fits the URL theme. Conjure tree has good potential for comedic effect as well."
BuffaloWizards,393sj4,cmcdonald22,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:08:51 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: theory crafting balance post incoming.  Roots of life should render the caster immobile until they break the spell. Roots in the ground should have to stay planted for at least a turn (like a tree taking time to grow) otherwise this would very quickly become a bit broken. Every turn you would just move to the fringe of ally positioning to get the most in the 5x5(which is massive) then in conjunction with like the see around corners ability be totally safe and still deadly.  Its almost like a sniper and a druid mixed and the balance let's you do both a little too well. Being able yo reposition yourself makes you a good sniper, being a massive walking healing spire makes you a good druid/cleric. Both together is crazy good.  I love the idea and theme of it and even that as a general class it kind of allows for two very different specializations but the middle road option actually seems too good a mix of both."
BuffaloWizards,393sj4,cmcdonald22,2,Tue Jun 9 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, I forgot to mention that Roots of Life root the character. I thought it was kind of obvious, but will fix. The healing is not as good as the Paladin's light, but can be better if the Arborlist maintains concentration. I could also just make it once per combat."
BuffaloWizards,393sj4,cmcdonald22,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"I think immobile and make it a delayed effect. You Roots turn 1 it doesn't  heal till round 2. Or give it a grow effect. A canopy of healing, first turn is user only 2nd turn is 1x1 and it expands out one every turn up to 5x5. Then you could even afford to buff the heal."
BuffaloWizards,393sj4,cmcdonald22,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. I just delayed the heal until the next round. however, there is a penalty to moving, as you would need to use an action to set it up again (with a new roll, and you know how those can go), and spend additional stamina."
BuffaloWizards,39322u,tamashinoerufu,4,Mon Jun 8 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Tough it may be really simple, I love the Animal Empathy card. Phrasing and mechanics are perfectly fit for URL.  Pretty common utility Druid spells in there. Would have liked maybe just a single offensive damage spell."
BuffaloWizards,39322u,EverionEU,2,Mon Jun 8 22:30:44 2015 UTC,"nature's blessing could be used on yourself, but yeah i wanted to focus on utility because druids do tend to be protrayed as more of a support kinda class Edit: basically they are 4 spells that can be used offensively, as i stated above nature's blessing can be used on yourself, animal empathy and summon animal can both be used to summon a bear, or if the gm okays(probs would have to get a 20) it a dragon, and you can transform into an animal as well. so while there may not be one spell that is inherently offensive you can still have the ""don't fuck with that druid, you'll be in a world of pain"" sterotype-thingy"
BuffaloWizards,39322u,Jajarz,2,Mon Jun 8 22:35:51 2015 UTC,"Like those cards, though I think the overgrowth is something that'd quickly become a hindrance to the Players having to spend multiple turns stuck... just did that the other day in a D&D game and tripled the length of the encounter"

A single quiet weak boss, but invulnerable throughout most of the battle. He will continue to spawn more and more enemies every turn(however at a stamina cost) and will only be vulnerable after some  time, but then quite easy to kill(like only 10 stamina left then). Events could be:  First Tier: More enemy spawn  Second Tier: Enemies get more stamina  Third Tier: Minions gain some kind of life drain ability, healing boss when they deal damage  This boss could as example be some stone golem wizard that spawns earth elementals."

BuffaloWizards,390192,shad0wman37,4,Mon Jun 8 09:54:18 2015 UTC,I was actually thinking about doing this (but I realized I stink and modeling) What was your process and do you have any tips for new modelers like me? ( I use cinema 4D)
BuffaloWizards,390192,Darnokthemage,3,Mon Jun 8 10:19:23 2015 UTC,"For modeling I create a very base model then import it into mudbox, from that the process is very similar to that of sculpting. You make a very high poly and detailed model then import it back into maya. In Maya, I retopologize the model using the quad draw tool, and then I once more put it into mudbox to bring out the final details which get imported back in as a normal map.   If you're new to modeling I suggest you look up images of edge flow on google  (http://s3.envato.com/files/219815.jpg, here is an image of very basic good edge flow). Knowing how your model will deform after it's rigged is extremely important.   Work with half of your geometry then duplicate it across your negative scale X and then combine it. It makes your geometry easier to manage. However, don't do this in zbrush or mudbox. Those two programs have well constructed mirroring tools.  If you're just looking to create a model for looks just keep all the quads even as possible. In fact I would just tell you to start out modeling in mudbox or zbrush. They have base models already constructed for you in there. I highly suggest having a cintiq if you're going to model in either of those programs. Makes your life much easier.   Last step I can think of is make sure you avoid bad geometry (everything must be quads or tris, everything will break if you don't). When you start UVing this could create quite a few issues for you and your model will have a ton of problems when you attempt to start rigging. This is actually what makes or breaks a modeler.   I can't think of anything else currently. I guess find scripts that can better your workflow. Maya and 3DxMax have tons of scripts on creativecrash.com. And yeah... I hope that helps"

I'm going to fix it up to look nicer tomorrow and add exporting as an image, just need to write a renderer for canvas. In the meantime you can screenshot :P   I tested it on chrome, it may not work on other browsers but if theres a bug can you just post it here or on the Talk page on the wiki.

He specifically mentioned the example of elves never sleep.   If we say something, but it's not proven, it's not canon. An example would be about elves sleeping. Two characters have claimed opposite positions on if elves sleep or not, until you see an elf sleeping or meditating, you cannot confirm or deny it as lore.    So, when Deadbones said he was sleeping, it was at that point that it was confirmed elves sleep. Metagame though chat was going ballistic and Coe ran with it telling chat ""whatever Deadbones believed about elves is actually the opposite."" The rest of the party then began to act as if elves never sleep."

Would make choosing to set targets on fire a more strategical choice since it would remove the bonus fire damage until the weapon is lit again.
BuffaloWizards,3901k9,EverionEU,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea and i wasn't think you wouldn't roll to see if the fire is extinguished, i was thinking if you rolled 1-4 when you attack it would go out and the chances of the fire being extinguished increase 1 for every attack or 2 if you lit someone on fire. But I do like your idea and it would add a cool choice to make when attacking."

BuffaloWizards,38xh0s,Rurikar,4,Mon Jun 8 06:51:02 2015 UTC,"Well felipe also was right in their base and freed two prisoners but yes the Elvish justice system is weird ,probably all that sleep deprevation causing it,"
BuffaloWizards,38xh0s,Bjorty,5,Sun Jun 7 18:13:49 2015 UTC,The Elven punishing system is just as weird as their ranking system. If I was to guess being a General is the lowest rank and being a Recruit is the highest possible rank.

BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,brogus,36,Sun Jun 7 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"I second Deadbones ending, from a role play perspective it was a really great character arc.  More subtle than maybe some other stuff from other campaigns, but Deadbones as leader of rag tag Theta squad leads his team through multiple difficult and initially uncooridinated team skirmishes gradually leads the squad allowing them to grow into a much better squad who eventually become more than capable of managing themselves.  At the same time Deadbones literally grows (via LIEUTENANT SURGE) into a better leader, realizing that fighting isn't always the solution and even when diplomacy seemingly fails it can be managed into a better situation (limited numbers 4v4 fight).  And then realizing that his team didn't need him but there was not only a horde of people he needed to stay for the safety of Theta squad, but also a horde of people (Porcs) who could use a strong leader in an environment where he can excel and be respected.   It was a really cool growth.  Gets my vote."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,cmcdonald22,9,Sun Jun 7 16:28:49 2015 UTC,"Your explanation made me a little emotional, and definitely swayed me quite a bit.  From disliked and disrespected to heroic and likable (except for Roamin), ultimately making a sacrifice to save others.  Well done Deadbones."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,cmcdonald22,7,Sun Jun 7 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually hope the final roll doesn't end up screwing DB's character in the future and that the 20 is interpreted as something good, like Deadbones makes Porbo his new #2 or something and raises the 1st Porc legion defenders of the elvish faith."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,FlorribleBP,5,Sun Jun 7 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that while this weeks campaign didn't have as many funny moments, it had a much better story and RP than last week."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,Razorhead,12,Sun Jun 7 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"To be honest, my favourite moment was when the Bridge goblin tried to rob the party - twice - and failed. First by just being pushed back underwater by Roamin, and thereafter by failing his roll trying to jump on the bridge, landing face first onto the floor.  But really, this entire campaign didn't have so many 'great' moments, but the story progression was very nice. Just seeing the journey of a captain who can barely lead her troops, the laughing stock of the entire elven army, slowly climb up to greatness through the disastrous first Fire Elemental battle, where Coe and Roamin were mostly dicking around, to the Whisper Snake encounter where Deadbones earned respect from his troops by Blockading and Chivalrying damage, even saving Coe's life, to the capture of the dangerous Kobold prisoner Chimera when all other elves got slaughtered, finally earning some recognition among the elven army, to the final deathmatch with Porbo himself where Deadbones landed the final hit, a Flarefist, thus becoming the new leader of the Porcs and deciding to leave her squad behind, the same squad she's been trying to get together as a team, motivate and rise up to glory, to protect the elven village.  I personally think the entire journey from zeros to heroes of the Theta Squad has been the best RP moment of the night, and that, even though it had less 'Wow'-moments then the first campaign, it had a really great story and satisfying ending."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,scraps414,4,Sun Jun 7 16:05:24 2015 UTC,The goblin failure doesn't work very well as that was decided by the dice (or rather die).   But the character arc and progression through the story was enjoyable looking back.  Coe and Justin (and even Phineas) respecting Deadbones due to getting respect back while Roamin despises him more and more as he feels left out and disrespected by everyone.
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,Bjorty,10,Sun Jun 7 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"My favorite part is when deadbones talked with the porks and was able to get a fair duel when they were in porbos lair, I also liked coestars plan at the end where he spammed blanket of darkness. That last fight had a lot of good teamwork IMO."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,matchboxdan,6,Sun Jun 7 18:55:52 2015 UTC,Lots of diplomacy and cooperation near the end.  They very much deserved the win.
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,matchboxdan,10,Sun Jun 7 19:16:18 2015 UTC,The beer run and the failure of delivering it
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,FlorribleBP,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:59:52 2015 UTC,I had forgotten about that.  Hopefully Coe learned to be a little more specific on his orders from now on.
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,coldhotshot,10,Sun Jun 7 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"I thought Deadbones really drove the plot this time and made it a satisfying story beginning to end. Unfortunately the pacing this time just didn't let everyone develop their characters as fully as in the Band of Thieves, but he pushed for everyone to have their own place in and connection to the Theta Squad and the outcome of their mission."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,Railith,6,Sun Jun 7 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"I also found it hilarious that at the very end everyone was arguing over what the main point of the mission was in the first place, because they never really listen to the questgivers."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,Boolderdash,3,Sun Jun 7 17:55:29 2015 UTC,I'm definitely liking Deadbones as the leader this run.  He had good plans and actually did what they were tasked to (kind of).
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,Jajarz,9,Sun Jun 7 19:11:00 2015 UTC,"Still watching it atm, but so far, my favorite moment is Justin decapitating the elf against the fire elemental(although that was more a combination of Rob being DM and a bad dice roll)"
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,TheDetective13,3,Sun Jun 7 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, classic team killing.  The biggest problem here is that it was not Justin's choice in RP to do, which is what Rob is looking for."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,Imagine_Baggins,11,Sun Jun 7 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"DB played this campaign well. Love the Underdog story where at first he was not respected for being theta squad leader and his new squads didn't listen to him. But then the party grew closer and more respect was for DB to lead everyone. Most of the decisions he had made a lot of sense and worked and even the people in the elven army started to respect him. I feel like even though I like Justin, I can't tell if he is RPing or just being himself, which isn't bad but idk if it deserves best RP. Both Roamin and COe played their parts well, as both were Noble Elves and even if Roamin stuck to his snobish and asshole ways, Coe took another path and started to see the power in his team."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,chasbdude,3,Sun Jun 7 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"Coe was supposed to be the grumpy noble, but the power of teamwork, mostly comprising of pay raises and compliments from his superior, melted his cold heart (much like his ice elemental).  Meanwhile, Roamin received no love from his captain, and gave none back as a result."
BuffaloWizards,38wt6m,TimetravelingGuide,8,Sun Jun 7 19:25:23 2015 UTC,I really liked when the party was talking about what to do about the porcs as they were lead through the caves collecting more and more porcs. It was such a good bit.

The most common camera angle we must use is from the top down, so we'd most often be looking at the tops of 3D characters' heads.

BuffaloWizards,38y19i,cthomlan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:41:50 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the 2D tokens, do you think it would be a good idea to give a symbol on the reverse/flip side of the icons to symbolize a stunned/unable to move party member? Like the same character icon (maybe the near death icon instead?) with a cloud over it, that way Rob can flip you guys and easily see who is and isn't able to do anything (easy for everyone to see), and in the case of enemies with only one art piece, just a symbol? I can't speak if that is worth your guy's time to do, but to me it sounds like redoing the assets slightly to make Rob's GM time a tiny bit easier."

I think this campaign didn't have as much of the RP that I loved from the first one, but I wonder if maybe some of that is also because they were playing as different characters than what they typically do."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,5ilver42,2,Sun Jun 7 06:00:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I'm waiting for the first party wipe. This campaign was bound to be focused on combat given that it was called ""Porc Hunters""."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,HBKKurt,15,Sun Jun 7 13:06:59 2015 UTC,"I wanted to do a stream this week that was more ""kicking ass"", but I also felt near the end of the campaign that RP was missing out and time was going long, so I decided to ignore most of the porc encounters and have the porcs be a lot more diplomatic then I originally intended.  You have to understand from my point of view, they could have NOT fought the giant flame spirit and chat god could not have activated the whisper snake or the carriage event, which for the most part would have just been minor RP parts into the porc cave.  Still, I'm very happy with the story as you see a party of bumbling idiots get more and more serious and start to work together until they were put in a situation that looked almost hopeless, came out on top, and for the most part bonded over it. I liked that Roamin's character felt snubbed as it sets up that character to be a anti-hero in the future.  Overall I was really happy with the story, remember that the Bridge event could have been combat as well could the Wind Fish. In fact the wind fish was almost for sure going to be combat, but I fudged it back then too and outside of those two events the RP for the most part was the same in my mind."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,Rurikar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"I can't say with certainty because I don't know but the way it felt from the character creation video and comments here and there but it seemed like the campaign was presented (at least to the fans) as being combat driven before it even started and I think maybe that was a ""problem""?  Like, providing them the same number of opportunities to be kick ass is awesome, because if they want to be kick ass the world is at their finger tips.  But not inherently framing it up as a combat session would lead to more diplomacy.  That being said, I actually didn't mind it at all.  It was just another form of a story.  It felt less like a fantasy band of thieves and more like a fantasy military campaign (like the black company novels) where you get little snippets of ""the squad"" here and there but it isn't a hugely character driven thing the entire time.  It's more about Theta squad as a hole than the individual bit players that made it up.  Which, since it WASN'T a band of thieves frolicking through the woods felt right."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,cmcdonald22,9,Sun Jun 7 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that a combat focus changed the RP and the story/character development. I think many things were involved that effected the way this campaign played out, outside of just the fights     For one, everyone solely being elves effected the variety of role play the guys could do. This is something that could be changed with other things, but I'll talk about that later. Also, the encouragement of min-maxing by purely offensive classes did that too.  Yeah, there was some utility, but the purpose of most spells (that the guys chose) was damage. Rob did influence them a LOT to focus of that, even had them talk amongst eachother before episode 0. Not a critique of Rob, but it did seem to change rp elements     From what I watched, the donation events improved, sometimes being slow enough, but I want to hear Rob's opinion. He has a ton going on. But, as stated previously, because of the damage/combat focus before the campaign began, the timing of event's effected Rob's ability to both cater to the viewers AND manage all of the combat well. See, the difference from last campaign is that, with the donation goals being met quickly, rob could instantly pile on an encounter that favored the enemy (good or bad, the d20 determines it all), while in this campaign Rob almost needed the goals met because of the strength  and plays of the party. While I like seeing the strength sway from the DM to the party, it effected the campaign and role playing. Does that make sense?     There are some other things about the character creation that I want to mention, kind of related. Since there were few races/classes/overall variety, I really think the shop is the place to offset both staleness and party strength when that is the case. I mentioned in some other thread, but I think having a shop with limited inventory but good variety could help with a number of issues. Take a party of 4 wizards but the shop has 2 robes, that adds some more variety, makes other items get picked more, balances the stats of the party. It also allows RP(fighting) of the leader of the week and everyone else.     Now, I make these claims but I didn't watch it all. But, I'll wanted to share some opinions that I have and that I have seen floating about. Overall I agree, I think there were things outside the battles that effected things."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,Argorine,2,Sun Jun 7 05:35:48 2015 UTC,I really like the idea of the shop not having unlimited inventory of items.
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,tamwin5,7,Sun Jun 7 15:26:46 2015 UTC,"I think the thing is, in the last stream there were some encounters which didn't involve combat, although they could've. Like the bridge 'troll' and his eaglebear or the great monkeyfish.  They bypassed combat in those with RP, which gave a nice break from fighting and served as a nice downtime. In today's stream however they incidentally killed their allies in the first fight, which probably took away the downtime they coulda had, and in the encounter with the prisoner transport chimera escaped, and the combat kinda diluted from that little bit of downtime.  However i felt it was compensated with the time they tried to be diplomatic with the porks rather than straight up fighting them.  But i kinda agree that having encounters that can't break into combat would be nice to have.  Also i miss Coober, it's a shame we haven't gotten to see him in the last couple streams...  Edit: after rereading my comment it seems a bit cold so i'd just like to add that the streams have been absolutely fantastic, and this is just nitpicky things that don't impact my enjoyment at all!"
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,Tscenzurra,3,Sun Jun 7 04:47:49 2015 UTC,I think the problem wasn't the fights but the characters. They seemed anti party most of the (rp) time.   Sure in Roamins Band of Thieves they were also assholes to each other but that had more a puckish rogue feel to it. And that it was in good fun. This was probably because they played characters closer to their own persona.   This group just came off as mean to each other to me.
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,lindeloef,6,Sun Jun 7 10:25:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Coe and Roamin were RPing high class characters (Noble Born trait), while Justin and DB were playing military trained (Spellblades). Between that, the not-so subtle fact that DB can't control all of his men, and the general faffing around by Coe (hung in the back, used powers for personal needs) and Roamin (ultra excited about ""killing"" a stump on fire) fits their stylized view.  Remember: Castes are found in all forms of society, and some of them are bound to be dicks."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,tdis8629,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"sure just coming on this from a DM point of view, there is little reason/motivation for those characters to keep working together.   Mostly because it didn't seem that there were consequences/punishment for not obeying your commanding officer (Deadbones).  Best example is the dialog where everyone but Roamin gets a promotion. From a characters point (noble elf) there is little reason to put up with that crap.  In the Band of Thieves we got banter, here we got bickering. Wasn't as enjoyable in my opinion. (session was good but not great)"
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,lindeloef,2,Sun Jun 7 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"I think the variety is what's going to be making it so exciting. Their gonna be trying to be different characters each week and once we get into a rhythm. Their gonna know which characters than can play for a lot of value and how to interact well with each other. It may not have been ""good"" from a purely entertainment standpoint like last stream, but it brough it a bunch of new systems and styles that'll be refined over time."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,TimetravelingGuide,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:23:59 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you that variety is good, playing a character untrue to yourself (having nothing in common, character goes against the players morals&believes, etc pp) is really hard.  That is why (good) actors get paid so well, because they can pull it off easily."
BuffaloWizards,38vhxt,lindeloef,2,Mon Jun 8 05:45:37 2015 UTC,"I personally want less combat and more aventure+RP overall. The first stream was better at this than the second, though I'd say I want even a little more than the first stream had. But that's just me.  It's like the Matrix movies. The first one developed the plot so well and was super entertaining throughout. The second and third featured way too much of the big battle and were somewhat boring because of it."

It's a credit to Rob and the guys for getting us to care that much that quickly. It was, however, pretty terrible seeing that vocal minority overreact so bitterly to the ""not-Felipe"" event.

I'm not going to lie though; I was hoping it was Felipe but when it turned out it wasn't I yelled ""Fucking Rob!"" at the screen but continued having a great time. And I think it not being Felipe is the best thing that could have happened to be honest. More people would have been mad that the party of elves would have had to kill him so I'd rather have to fight Chimera under false assumptions then to have Felipe's story-slash-ending be weakend.

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Emperor_PPP,4,Sat Jun 6 23:08:33 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but I think it's human nature in those cases. Once the hype train gets rolling everyone gets on board, especially given how much was being asked for it. Then when it turns out different to how people hoped, they're going to be disappointed. Add in usual twitch chat dynamics and you're looking at a salt storm."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Dystant21,45,Sat Jun 6 23:16:17 2015 UTC,"Story is more important than donations. I could make lots of money by having it be Phillipe and making him the uber Kobold, but it would have ruined his character and this story.  I felt like it was an obvious trick most would understand. If these types of donations aren't enjoyable to fans, then I just won't do them, but I'm not going to ruin great character stories as a fan service to make money, that feels so wrong."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Rurikar,12,Sun Jun 7 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"I thought really it was obviously not Phillipe anyway. Was just a fun extra fight in the campaign. Great way to add the fight too.  In terms of story it also lets you know that the elves do transport prisoners about (maybe on the way to Phillipe's execution) and we now know at least one instance of a kobold breaking out of the transport. If theta squad weren't there to save the day, who knows what could have happened....  Especially if Phillipe was joined by 3 other elven prisoners at the time...   Could be future urealms live starting with the 4 guys as prisoners. Maybe Coe or Deadbones, as Phillipe, is not involved in the episode 0 (couldn't make it, whatever excuse), but gains 1 of the skills from each prisoner that they taught him and he's beefed up a bit while in prison as a means to balance the campaign.  edit: expanded detail."

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Taters_McShit,13,Sun Jun 7 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"Dear Rawb, [SPOILERS AHEAD]  Let me preface the following criticism with a positive statement: I love what you do. I've been a huge fan of yours since the beginning of Unforgotten Realms (the web series). I, alongside the other string of fans who suffered after the Moonwell Pass musical ***(is that the name of that episode? I dunno..) have seen you grow so much as a content creator, and I couldn't be happier with what you've become. Also, despite what I am about to say, I think that you will find success with UR Live regardless of whether or not you read this or take this into consideration. Now: I love the RP stuff way more than the fights. I get it, the audience can participate in combat, yada yada. But with such a talented group of guys and yourself, the role playing is so much more successful and memorable in my opinion. This, of course, may be because you and the guys have a lot of growing to do as role playing game players/DM's, and that's totally fine. But right now, the fights all seem drawn out and time-intensive for them to occur one after the other, so frequently. I remember the days when an encounter could range anywhere between climbing a weird-ass Abe Lincoln wizard tower to simply stealing an old dude's clothes!  TL;DR: Perhaps what I'm trying to say is this: There are either too many encounters, or too large of encounters. A band of thieves on the side of the road every once in a while never hurt, while a huge goblin/snake battle on a bridge (which was really creative, by the way!) can take away from those ""Don't fucking talk to me!"" moments.  Well, shit. That was kind of a long TL;DR.  TL;DR;theTL;DR: Love you. Fight less. Laugh more. Balance things out. Have fun. :)  ***EDIT: Let me clarify, I mean the lack of Unforgotten Realms, aka the end of it after that episode  EDIT #2: Let me also put this in, after thinking back on my point. I realize that both the whispering lake and the escaped convict were donation goals to be reached, and had the potential to just be walked by. I think with the potential of them happening, and the hype of the show right now, they were bound to happen. This is not me revoking my opinion, but I do understand why it was so combat after combat after combat. /end pointless edit"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Somniantis27,14,Sun Jun 7 00:31:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly this was bound to be a combat intensive campaign, they're all mages, and they did do good role playing by going straight past the book Porcs."

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,stormoftara,2,Sun Jun 7 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"I think combat is just another platform for role playing. The characters need prompts or it just becomes ""you guys are still walking do you do anything different yet?"". Instead combat encounters become a point of interest. And points of interest so far are where all the RP happens in URLive.  This isn't to say combat is the only type of point of interest and it definitely shouldn't be, but for a starting point of only two weeks its still the easiest and most straight forward.  Hopefully in the future we see more. Non hostile NPC's (the return of Cooter), puzzle and trap rooms (though those are way more time consuming to make) would all be great to see as future points of interest for the guys to RP around."

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,boredompwndu,5,Sun Jun 7 02:24:38 2015 UTC,I love that the air sprites are free spirited (wind going everywhere)  While the earth lords are single purpose stony mind (earth and stonme is unchanging) while ice elementals are a mix of both as water is free flowing while ice is unchanging(ish)
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Bjorty,5,Sun Jun 7 02:25:09 2015 UTC,That was the greatest ending ever.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Waytfm,4,Sat Jun 6 22:13:55 2015 UTC,I could not support Justin being Captain any more. I really hope we get to see a Justin led campaign soon :)
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,CritterBritches,5,Sun Jun 7 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"I said this on a thread the other day, but is it possible that you can change the order of the wizards at the bottom or the screen so that it is the same order as you guys take turns in the combat? Not a BIG deal or anything, though.  I loved the stream this week, and I can't wait until next week! :D"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Azurillkirby,5,Sun Jun 7 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"I love the way that in the beginning, Theta Squad was useless; summoning elementals to deliver pizza, accidentally killing all allies, generally hating each other and not trusting Deadbones. But by the end, they had evolved into a mean, coordinated, porbo-crushing machine. So much awesome character development."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,AnArmyofJedi,3,Sun Jun 7 22:17:32 2015 UTC,If anyone wants to help fill out the character sheet as the new campaign unfolds: http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10gouspTg0J2bbc9_gtSxAa4lRoaxYrsF5zx2BuM6TA4/edit#gid=1797246356
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,matchboxdan,7,Sun Jun 7 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"There also a wiki, if you want to help out there!"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Razorhead,3,Sat Jun 6 17:22:21 2015 UTC,About 30 minutes left till the stream starts! HYPE!!!!
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,prabhnoor10,3,Sat Jun 6 17:38:48 2015 UTC,Is Rob still putting Coober on every board? We haven't seen him since The Nuren Campaign.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Xlane_,3,Sat Jun 6 18:23:06 2015 UTC,He was in the last one. I'm guessing he was on the side of the board that we didn't see this time.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Cheakz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:45:49 2015 UTC,Thanks.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Xlane_,2,Sun Jun 7 03:26:53 2015 UTC,19.00 GMT for the Europeans.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Tatermen,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:34:02 2015 UTC,We're at BST or GMT+2 though in the UK and central Europe aren't we?
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,InverseCodpiece,2,Sat Jun 6 17:12:45 2015 UTC,Depends on each countries variation on daylight savings.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Tatermen,2,Sat Jun 6 17:13:53 2015 UTC,I'm suprised nobody had outwardly considered running from the whisper lake once they figured out what the snake was about.

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,brogus,2,Sat Jun 6 22:30:45 2015 UTC,I missed like 4 hours and left right after the Unnatural Critical and came back to see the 20 for Coe's final toss. But did we hit all donation events?
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,KadaSauce,3,Sun Jun 7 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"Mostly. The only one intentionally missed was the 1-UP elves. The final battle was an accidental recopy of last weeks final, pricing included, so Rob just closed the donation and played the encounters based on Porbo's HP"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,tdis8629,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:25:43 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. The final event's money bar was messed up, so since so much had already been donated, Rob gave them to us for free.   (The only thing we didn't get were some of the loot bags.)"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Xlane_,2,Sun Jun 7 02:33:20 2015 UTC,Ug why couldn't it end with coe going over rezing icelord and making a shitlord to sit there for all eternity as the porc lord
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,keaganwill,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:37:02 2015 UTC,Because DeadBones killed Porbo.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,MagmaCode,2,Sun Jun 7 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"That final 20 though, what an end to such a good night!"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Aprilfoolsa,2,Mon Jun 8 17:16:19 2015 UTC,...that 20.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,kaji1313,2,Sun Jun 7 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"Just a little suggestion, you may have thought of this already, but for the donation intensives you should list how much left needs to be donated to meet the goal instead of the the total amount required."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,camo3d,2,Sun Jun 7 02:27:46 2015 UTC,I was watching Rob's highlight video and he said that the viewers said they hated that Kobalt encounter because it wasn't phileppe.  EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WASN'T HIM BECAUSE ROB SAID GWENITH KILLED HIM.

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Euler-Landau,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:09:49 2015 UTC,would this be a good item a spell that takes (4) stamina witch makes you unable to be harmed but cannot harm anything else try to fight the spell breaks only last 1 turn max  with a (20) you can stay there (2) rounds and cast healing spells on your team mates roll a (1) and you are stuck in that state taking 1 damage a turn  until rob decides that it should end
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,icer21uk,3,Sat Jun 6 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds sort of like blockade to me, which is already in the game"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Boolderdash,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:55:27 2015 UTC,not realy this is good with a twent it lasts twice as long and you can interact witn your team and on a 1 every turn you stuck in the void you take 2 damage
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,icer21uk,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:38:22 2015 UTC,Hype!

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Eoinp,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"gotta be honest, I found it hilarious that the most threatening thing this campaign was probably Chimera the Kobold as opposed to the boss"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Bladesbane,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:16:34 2015 UTC,I actually felt really bad for the Porcs as the game went on. They were just kinda dumb and adorable. I hope they'll have a better life now.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Railith,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:14:02 2015 UTC,it would be funny if coe's earth spirit was arrive to coe when the elfs get to the final event (of the stream) and coe give the pizzato the final boss xD
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,yuvalal,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:15:05 2015 UTC,Can we please get the cards they used? They said they were coming soon and they showed us last weeks cards but the imgur account hasn't been update in a week.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Petertwnsnd,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:32:29 2015 UTC,I'm so excited for when these cards come out

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,5ilver42,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:24:31 2015 UTC,Hello! I have really enjoyed U realms live. I wanted to make custom cards like theirs just with different texts. I wondered where I could possibly find the card set for this. I wanted to try making fan cards and cards I could play with friends and family. I'am eager to start creating these amazing cards! I hope somebody could help me find  this!
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Pandawizard02,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:51:57 2015 UTC,I've replaced the text version of my class proposal with an imgur gallery. Here's the link to the ability cards of the Luckmaster:  http://imgur.com/a/6rJKv
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,nightcaller92,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:19:49 2015 UTC,Anyone want to give me a rundown on whats happened thus far? Just started watching.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,ZebraRenegade,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:22:37 2015 UTC,"Roamin's brother ran away from home, they accidentally killed an ally elf, knocked the other two ally elves unconscious, and almost got killed by the giant flame spirit that Justin created.  That's about it."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,DanelerH,2,Sat Jun 6 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"Not that guy but cheers, Champion's League final kept me from the show"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Generic_Name_82,-3,Sat Jun 6 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"THAT UNNATURAL 20 WAS BULLSHIT. £1000 donated on false pretences...   Edit to clarify my reasoning   I am not mad because I wanted Philipe back as a companion, or that the event was a trick. It was the amount of money asked for under false pretences (that the event would bring back Philipe). I personally wanted it to be Philipe, just because I think it would have been really cool to have the guys have to fight him.  I think the whole donation events way of getting revenue depends so heavily on the goodwill of the community (for better or worse) that they can't make many more trick ones like this. I really want URL to continue and thrive, I am almost definitely going to donate more money. I think this will leave a sour taste in some peoples mouths and I just don't want Rob to have to deal with a loss of income because of a stupid troll of chat.   Edit number 2 (after some time and some sleep)   I over reacted and said some things I am not proud of, live and learn."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,transonicduke,13,Sat Jun 6 20:49:54 2015 UTC,If you really thought Rob would bring back Philhipé after one week then you deserved to be trolled
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Emperor_PPP,2,Sat Jun 6 22:53:15 2015 UTC,I was thinking it was going to be super interesting for the guys to have to kill or injure Philipe (because they are elves and Philipe would attack them probably). I just think it's disingenuous to play on the heartstrings like that when the stakes are $1000. I think the whole donation events way to getting revenue depends so heavily on the goodwill of the community (for better or worse) that they can't make many more trick ones like this.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,transonicduke,14,Sat Jun 6 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"I was thinking it was going to be super interesting for the guys to have to kill or injure Philipe    He has like 20 health. The guys can literally 2-3 round him as those elves. It wouldn't have been a good fight, it would have ruined a good character man. Really disappointed by this reaction from fans like you dude, this will only limit the potential of shows."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Rurikar,14,Sat Jun 6 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Believe me Rob, it was only the vocal minority of people getting super salty and overreacting."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Makydog,12,Sun Jun 7 04:10:15 2015 UTC,That's how I feel. I'll have to just be more careful in the future with events like this.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Rurikar,3,Sun Jun 7 04:25:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think its just an natural growth of the donation funds. I didn't care for Philipe/Filip/Fafopata the Badass but I was still surprised that it wasn't him. Now that I know your willing to do those passing nods (Like with Monty Python and the decision to not go to Camelot.) I'd be fine with them and find them hilarious. Maybe make those kind of references/donations slightly less expensive so the sea salt people won't be so salty, but I think the majority would look forward to these kinds of references."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,TimetravelingGuide,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:20:18 2015 UTC,"Although, Rob, you should feel proud that you've created something that people are SO interested in that an unplanned, improvised ally causes this much excitement. After all, people only get mad about things that are important to them."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Drayko_Sanbar,6,Sun Jun 7 05:49:13 2015 UTC,"I completely agree... when the unnatural 20 showed up I instantly hopped on the band wagon of ""OMG PHELIPÈ""  Then when it wasn't him I laughed my arse off but didn't make any comment in chat... as well as the majority of phelipè dreamers"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,keaganwill,4,Mon Jun 8 02:49:49 2015 UTC,"I put this in another place but here is my view, I generally agree with you.  I do not think Rob should put Philippe in anymore stories, nor should he make any references to Philippe.  The people that watch this show are the kinds of people who loved Helix in Twitch Plays Pokemon. They love to be on the devote bandwagons...the point of what I am trying to say is, with a character you are playing with; you can deceive them and trick them, that awesome. The audience, however, is not a character you are playing with..It's just doesn't seem like a good strategy to play with the audience's emotions.  It was a great trick and they really got chat. In a more mature crowd it probably would have been a good lesson but this is twitch chat, maturity just melts away in that chat stream"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,brogus,11,Sun Jun 7 05:24:51 2015 UTC,"Dude. You're just supporting the show, when you think about it, I could really just bake all these ""donation"" events into the base show, we create them because its a cool way to support us.  I'm sad to see this as a reaction, because it means that I will be limited to what I can do in the future with donations if they are perceived so negatively. I felt like it was an obvious trap, and I thought I made a cool new villain that you WOULD hate because he wasn't Philpe, but comments like this just tell me that I have to stick to being really basic with what donations are if they are going to upset people.   I think the whole donation events way of getting revenue depends so heavily on the goodwill of the community (for better or worse) that they can't make many more trick ones like this.   Then you are basically saying the show isn't allowed to have fun. Can I ask, did you personally donate to this event today? If you didn't I really think you should take a step back and ask yourself if this is really a problem, or if you might be over reacting. I really like being able to do these subtle nods and not destroy characters. If that was Philpe, you would have been even more angry because it would have been near impossible for him to escape. You think it would be more fun for the show if he just escapes into the woods for the event? The reason the cost was so high was because it was a ""Mystery Box"", you didn't know what was in it."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Rurikar,7,Sun Jun 7 00:06:55 2015 UTC,The overall writing and plot for these two shows have been fantastic. Good pacing and enough breathing room for the actors to create their own stories while also working towards an overall goal. I love what you've created and hope you and the team continue to be successful!
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,jon_eod,4,Sun Jun 7 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sad to see this as a reaction, because it means that I will be limited to what I can do in the future with donations if they are perceived so negatively.   Nah, man, please don't feel like you are limited. People will be angry at the moment, will say a lot of shit and it will go away. Next week they will be watching, donating if they were before, and it will be the same thing all over again. Its just how people act in the internet, like they know anything and like they are entitled.   If they felt like that event was money grabby, they are extremely stupid. We can feel and we know when that is the case, and that was not."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,MNick,6,Sun Jun 7 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"I apologise for over-reacting, that was uncalled for and I think at least partly due to sleep deprivation (I wrote that first comment at like 3am).  Coming back after getting some sleep I have come to the realisation that you are right. I don't want you to feel like you have to stifle what you are doing because of the opinions of the vitriolic few (I am including myself in that).  I had a great time last night watching the stream and I am going to continue watching the rest of the campaigns you do! I really am sorry for what I said, I guess I got caught up in the hype and over-donated which didn't help. Love your work man, keep being awesome."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,transonicduke,8,Sun Jun 7 09:03:10 2015 UTC,"You assumed something and that was wrong. Why is the chat so fucking salty about something that was not sure to happen?   Enjoy the stream, I bet the money was worth it."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,MNick,-2,Sun Jun 7 16:40:16 2015 UTC,I was thinking it was going to be super interesting for the guys to have to kill or injure Philipe (because they are elves and Philipe would attack them probably).

BuffaloWizards,38tawm,transonicduke,2,Sat Jun 6 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"This also sent a message, which is that ""Chat"" should not donate because they feel generous- they should generate because they enjoy the content. They chose to ""trick"" Chat because it would make a better show (which, as someone who didn't donate but thought about it, it did), and it also is good entertainment for those kinds of people who did not bandwagon but will watch the show again and again and again and donate repeatedly."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Typodestoyer,6,Sat Jun 6 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"Beat me to it. Here's my 2 cents though. We basically just got chat to pay $1000 for a legitimate encounter (that may or may not be campaign ending, we're still in the event :P). I mean, I get chat REALLY wanted Felipe back in the campaign (even though last we heard he was 100% dead), but chat kind of forgot the idea that even if Felipe came out of the wagon, he's going to attack the entire party, and the party is now going to have to kill Felipe, which inarguably would piss off chat and the community even more.  The resulting encounter events again REALLY lean on chat to support the heroes to make the event even work out. Bladeturn heroes clears oncoming damage, Revive all elves works well if things get hairy, and Reinforcements buys time. (In essence, a smart chat will buy top down, but the betrayal immediately following a $1000 paid encounter does not fare well.  In Rob's full defense: immediately before the encounters even started. He did EXPLICITLY state that ALL goals for the day's show had already been well more than met."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,boredompwndu,7,Sun Jun 7 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"Bladeturn stopped a single attack. The 4 elves soaked maybe a round of combat from Chimera. I made three position events to show the severity of how dangerous this character was, it's a shame you guys saw it as a ploy to make money. If I wanted to make money, i'd have just slapped Philpee in there and have him escape. Woo fun story."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Rurikar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:04:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, that was a larger nerf of bladeturn than I was expecting. I think I had moved it from all damage to 1 target per round, not per combat. I will admit you gave the party a fair chance by going for the npc. You took every step you could to keep this from being a huge PR nightmare, since you are primarily doing this to write an amazing story, and money comes secondary objective to help make this show as high of a quality as possible.  I think the story chat was looking for with the ""kobold in the prison cart"" scenario was Felipe the accidental badass of last week being allies with the main party. Storywise, the issue is that this party is made of elves, which Philpee kind of wants to kill. Which means maybe he escapes, but that would be lame.  More realistically it turns into a combat situation, where philpee maybe has access to a blunderbuss, but more importantly, chat has to watch philpee die. It doesn't matter how much health you decide to boost him with, between the base npc's and the party in proper RP, he's going to die.   The collateral for more or less paying $1000 to watch philpee die would seriously hurt the trust that the community had. (Personally I never got too emotionally invested in him, but I enjoyed getting to see you get to play along with the party you were also trying to create reasonably challenging encounters for)  Chat was super shitty about the whole releasing Chimera thing, and story-wise and gameplay-wise it makes more sense for Philpee not to be in the box, but at the same time I think there was a bit of a loss of trust in that pre-encounter.  I liked that style of encounter though. Some ""thing"" is in a box, and then without any real explanation, the box explodes, and the thing starts trying to kill everybody. The only issue with that style of mechanic, is that in order to sensibly start combat, there has to be enough plot exposition for both chat and the players to have an idea of what is in the box, but at the same time keep the players unsure of whether or not the thing in the box escapes, or when it will try. For a first public iteration of the mechanic, it wasn't a bad mechanic on its own. Now if it were maybe a dwarf in the box instead of a kobold, I don't think you would have had the same crazy backlash. (Heaven forbid K4 comes out in his raspberrying glory murdering everything in sight)   If this encounter style was to happen again, maybe after adequate plot exposition has occurred, you could roll a d20 in secret from the table. 2 or less, nothing happens, 15+ encounter starts, each roll after's requirement is reduced by 2 (13+, 11+, 9+, 7+ etc). (I'm thinking these rolls could start after every time someone says something, similar to how you kept advancing the party through the porc cave during their scheming today.)  (I'm sorry if this sounds super rambly, its late, and there was a fair amount on my mind with the encounter style. Stepping back from it for a couple hours got me to think a bit from multiple sides.)"
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,boredompwndu,8,Sun Jun 7 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"being a huge PR nightmare   Dude. If the fans of this show could be so pissed off they wouldn't support it because of something like this, then I'd have no interest even continuing it.  People keep saying that donations ""slowed down"" after it, but another 1000 bucks was raised right after the box event. It seems to me that people are just saying what the feel, not what they know here, and while that's cool, I really think those upset with the events should rethink their position. Think about if the show really would have been better if you gotten your way or if the story we managed to told was a lot more fun."
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,Rurikar,0,Sun Jun 7 04:45:24 2015 UTC,I get that and I was thinking it was going to be super interesting for the guys to have to kill or injure Philipe. I just think it's disingenuous to play on the heartstrings like that when the stakes are $1000. I think the whole donation events way to getting revenue depends so heavily on the goodwill of the community (for better or worse) that they can't make many more trick ones like this.
BuffaloWizards,38tawm,transonicduke,5,Sun Jun 7 05:13:25 2015 UTC,"Expect a full response from Rob. This particular encounter is guaranteed to be a talking point after the show. I don't know what he'll say, but its best to think of the ""set-up to the encounter"" as somewhere between an experiment of execution, and a way to demonstrate to chat how separated the two events (and likely future events) are going to be from one another"
BuffaloWizards,38xelj,JubbaJabba07,2,Sun Jun 7 17:38:14 2015 UTC,One thing is that IT IS ALL ROLE PLAY so if you get pissy at coe for being a schmuck just remember it's primeraly for content. also Rob kinda has to be an asshole sometimes as his aim is to win encounters
BuffaloWizards,38xelj,Bjorty,5,Sun Jun 7 18:11:05 2015 UTC,as his aim is to win encounters   Not really. His goal is the produce quality content while giving the guys a run for their money.
BuffaloWizards,38xelj,baronale,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:16:02 2015 UTC,Well also the players need to have fun
BuffaloWizards,38xelj,Bjorty,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:36:44 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Coe is just a shmuck, but thank you!"
BuffaloWizards,38xelj,Tripleat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"It's basic watered down dungeons and dragons. They roll a dice to determine to how things play out, and go on adventures.   I guess one thing to know is that they use a stamina system to determine both health and actions. Skills will drain your stamina and your taking damage will reduce your stamina. The reason being is it makes it easier to manage and it's an easier thing for the audience to see."
BuffaloWizards,38xelj,Tripleat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"Oh and also they implemented a donation system in order to allow the chat to affect the game in different ways, they'll either help or make the game harder for them.  They'll show up on the stream during events and depending on what chat put their money to, certain events will happen."

BuffaloWizards,38vubh,QuiteAwareWereDying,4,Sun Jun 7 06:52:34 2015 UTC,The donation page is always active if you wanna support the show. We are really trying to step up production to add more and more to it as we go on.  http://buffalowizards.com/urlivedonate

BuffaloWizards,38vxpg,ToriBoshi,8,Sun Jun 7 07:40:36 2015 UTC,"In the long UR Live Behind the Scenes episode that Rob posted on YouTube (about 57minutes in), he said that the execution of Philhipé didn't happen yet.  It may happen if he decides not to revisit that character, but as of last week, Philhipé is going to die in a few months.    I agree that it seems unlikely that Philhipé will be brought back (and honestly he will have gone out as a hero when he is executed, while bringing him back may ruin the memory of Philhipé). However the fact that he supposedly isn't dead yet, keeps the hope of ""savePhilhipé "" alive.  But yeah, call backs to previous weeks are going to be important because they are just plain fun.  It is like an inside joke.  The small encounters with NPCs can be very entertaining to those that remember the little references made.  And I am interested to see if there are going to be any small stories turn into big plots in future games."

BuffaloWizards,38vxpg,brogus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in the latest campaign Rob kinda trolled us by the kobold not being Felipe...but so far, I think that they quite well developed the elven race."

It gives it this mystical feel of.. ""What the hell am I going into!?"" and when you see older things that you recognise and you understand.. Your more understanding and less well. Intrigued.  Though quick nods through-out the world would be a clever way to pull together a timeline, Because who knows what order these go in! 2 Months from now somebody could say ""Hey'dyou here about those gnomes?"""
BuffaloWizards,38vxpg,IceCubesBurning,11,Sun Jun 7 13:17:07 2015 UTC,"would hope they would not cross over.   That wouldn't make sense in the long run because we want to build a world of characters. To never have the characters interact would not be fun.  However the sentiment you have here is what we share. I feel it's better to go from week to week with new stories from different places in the world and for the most part just subtle nods or secondary characters (Like Dave the Suncleric) being connected. There may come a time when we revisit characters, but only after enough time has past that they feel fresh and new again."
BuffaloWizards,38vxpg,Rurikar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I completely agree, I guess what I'm saying is make it like the icing on the cake.

BuffaloWizards,38vxpg,Bjorty,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:19:49 2015 UTC,The campaigns all take place in the same world. I believe rob has mentioned the possibility of bringing back characters (even ones first played by Coe/Deadbones/Justin/Roamin) as NPCs in later quests. There will defiantly be mentions to other campaigns (as sen by the heroes talking to some of Gwyneth's soldiers).
BuffaloWizards,38vt1o,tak4n,6,Sun Jun 7 06:35:51 2015 UTC,It doesn't break but falls down a random cave stream and theres a super long montage that ends with it reaching Felipe. He smashes the mirror and starts to ride porbo around

BuffaloWizards,38uzha,tdis8629,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:42:30 2015 UTC,"That's more of a treasure idea instead of a weapon they can buy right out of the gate.  It'd be better, at that point, to make the staff have a ""silence"" effect that makes the enemy unable to cast spells for a turn, and add to the damage, since the Wabbajack would pretty much work like that. It wouldn't be as fun, but remember, you're talking about a weapon, not a treasure."

BuffaloWizards,38tuu7,unpluggedriot,5,Sat Jun 6 19:45:55 2015 UTC,I found the first half of the stream to be rather boring. They stayed in roughly the same place for the first 3-4 hours and it was just non-stop combat. It got really old really fast to me. The second half of the stream where they were advancing through the cave and there was actual story delvelopment I thought was fantastic. The boss battle was great too since it also fed into the main objective and made sense as the climax.  I feel like this show needs more small encounters and map exploration so there's more variety as well as time for storytelling and potential special moments... rather than combat combat combat. Just my personal opinion though.
BuffaloWizards,38tuu7,unhi,2,Sun Jun 7 02:36:29 2015 UTC,"Well, here's part of the thing: this week was very much a combat build and that was mentioned. Compare it to last week where the party was attempting to sneak around and use more diplomatic tactics to reach their objective."

BuffaloWizards,38tuu7,Railith,5,Sat Jun 6 22:06:53 2015 UTC,well rob mentioned going against your last character (he mentioned Roamin being SUPER nice and justice based) maybe Coe is taking that and completely polarizing from last week
BuffaloWizards,38tuu7,Bjorty,0,Sun Jun 7 00:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'm alright with him being a jerk, I didn't like how he wasn't helping during the fire elemental fight when it was getting very dire."

BuffaloWizards,38tuu7,Railith,10,Sun Jun 7 02:23:42 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of how much of a dick Coe is being.   *Denada
BuffaloWizards,38tuu7,5ilver42,2,Sun Jun 7 06:18:27 2015 UTC,"I get that IRL Coe isn't a dick, but the character in a roleplaying game who is just being difficult kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth due to some personal experiences. It's not a deal breaker or anything."
BuffaloWizards,38tuu7,purpleholsterz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"It's roleplaying, his character Denada is the dick, not Coe. It's a difference that people new to the idea of roleplaying can have some confusion about, but it's no different than the separation between an actor and their role. Harrison Ford and Han Solo. Emma Watson and Hermione Granger. Orlando Bloom and Legolas. etc etc."

BuffaloWizards,38v5za,Glizzerd,10,Sun Jun 7 02:33:18 2015 UTC,"I think streaming it would kinda take away from it. The whole reason they said they weren't gonna stream it was so they could take time and do it! The stream goals for character creation is a weird idea: If the guys aren't happy with their characters, they won't be able to play them as well. That would SERIOUSLY take away from the stream! It's an interesting idea, but in action? I don't think it'd work too well."
BuffaloWizards,38v5za,MrPuffer,4,Sun Jun 7 02:37:18 2015 UTC,"This is correct basically.  We don't want to stream it because when you're streaming it's a different atmosphere, we really like the laid backness of being able to just record and release it.  We also do character creation on tuesday, that's how we can have things like special stuff for puppets. Streaming it on tuesday just makes it awkward."
BuffaloWizards,38v5za,Rurikar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:25:02 2015 UTC,When I said stream goals for character creation I didn't mean we'd control who they were more so unlock more options or random starting treasures. Also they they could take their time if they didn't do it on saturday like I suggested.
BuffaloWizards,38v5za,MrPuffer,0,Sun Jun 7 02:45:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe... The thing is, some people don't even watch character creation, and people have to work on fridays, if they streamed it then. Donations might be kinda dry if not enough people show up. I also don't think character creation is very stream-able. It's more relaxed than URL. It's possible, but I doubt it'll happen. Neat idea though!"
BuffaloWizards,38v5za,Random0Task,3,Sun Jun 7 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"Well it being on tuesday gives them time to set up cool things. Like how Deadbones wanted his character to have pointy ears, they had time to get that done before the stream. Or how Roamin took the Ray of Frost ability and then went and wrote all of those jokes to use with it. Doing it earlier in the week gives them more time to implement things from character creation if they need to."

A: No, it simply won't be possible and would lower the quality of the show. The amount of prep work to setup a guest for the show is far too much work. There was a point when we considered guests, my buddy Millbee would have totally been down, but it's complicated and each guest would need a lot of training to be able to properly participate in the stream."

BuffaloWizards,38pxff,DeadBones5,13,Sat Jun 6 00:00:47 2015 UTC,Ca-Rell or for the full title Captain Ca-Rell of Danaver.
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,Petertwnsnd,8,Sat Jun 6 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"Is she a reference to Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel?"

BuffaloWizards,38pxff,Fallkon,3,Sat Jun 6 04:51:29 2015 UTC,Deadbones' name is Cah-Rel but I got no idea how to spell it
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,thirdtotheleft,2,Sat Jun 6 00:14:21 2015 UTC,Deadbones was Car-El I think.
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,Mewkid999,3,Sat Jun 6 00:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think the large size of the dice is causing them not to roll around as much, which is kinda fucking with the rolls these guys are getting."
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,Boingboingsplat,8,Fri Jun 5 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"When you shake the die in tabletop sim, it randomly shuffles which side is facing up."
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,Mewkid999,3,Fri Jun 5 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but it just doesn't feel like enough to me. Just my opinion."
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,Teraka,3,Fri Jun 5 23:57:45 2015 UTC,"Well it is enough. Regardless of how much the dice rolls after it's thrown, if the face that was facing up before it was thrown was random, the result is going to be random. It can roll all the way to the end of the table or just fall vertically and not roll at all, and the result will still be perfectly (pseudo) random."
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,MeMyselfandDID,6,Sat Jun 6 03:12:55 2015 UTC,Shouldn't Frost Elemental's Card say it cost 10 stamina? Or does it Cost 3 and reduce by 10? So if Coe has 21 Stamina and he uses Frost Elemental should he have 11 or 8 (reduce max by 10 minus 3)?
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,RenVit318,4,Fri Jun 5 23:41:35 2015 UTC,"This is something I'd been wondering about too, because it could be that the 3 is worked into the 10.  Though I think we'll have to wait for tomorrow because Rob's probably very busy atm"
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,PixelScarecrow,3,Sat Jun 6 00:10:49 2015 UTC,"I think it works so that the cost is 3 but then your Max Stamina, not your current Stamina, gets reduced by 10. But they said that your Max Stamina goes back up by 10 if the Frost Elemental dies, so i think he would gain 7 Stamina (so he would have 18 if he didn't take any damage) but his Max Stamina would go back up 10 (To the total of 21). That also means that the damage he has taken reduces how much Stamina he gets back. For example if he took 5 damage before using Frost Elemental (so he would be at 16 Stamina) he would get hit with the cost of the spell (so 13 Stamina) but then reduced to 11 Stamina. And when that Frost Elemental dies he would only gain 2 Stamina putting him back so that Current Stamina is 13, even though his Max Stamina is 21."
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,RenVit318,5,Sat Jun 6 02:56:42 2015 UTC,"Well.. No, right?   I do think Rob said that when the frost elemental dies, you max stamina goes back up, thought your current stamina level doesn't."
BuffaloWizards,38pxff,Alklaine,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:16:41 2015 UTC,"The way he described it is different than the mechanics that he described. Your max stamina is decreased by 10 when you summon it, so you pay the price of three, (21 stamina to 18) then reduce by ten the max stamina, negating the cost to make you have 11 stamina (21 -10), however, once it dies, your max stamina is restored by ten (11 + 10) back to 21, but you are not healed(11 stamina left). Casting it again would make you pay the cost (11-3, as you were not healed) to 8, and your max stamina back down to 11. It makes it cheaper to continuously re-summon your one elemental, and makes summoning more than one and maintaining them very difficult, as you could not perform a re-summon at a stamina of one or two without fainting."

BuffaloWizards,38pxff,HCJustin,10,Sat Jun 6 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"Whatever time it is for the east coast haha.  I'm honestly not sure which we're on, but its 9:10pm right now if that helps.  Show starts in 18 hours!"

This could add some rp elements for the leader, and could avoid the dual-wielding/double-cloaking by simply having a certain number of staffs/robes. Leather armor and potions would/could also more likely to get bought, and prices for OP items could be more reasonable.  Thoughts?"

It is used to store items and equipment. Living things put into the bag die within 10 minutes. It is useful enough that it might as well be endless because holding close to a ton of items is more than most adventures need. A 60lb Bag of Holding would hold 2400lbs of stuff and always only way 60lbs.  So, a different thing. I was just explaining it.

Like bringing silver armor with you just in case you actually run into a werewolf

BuffaloWizards,38kpd7,unpluggedriot,4,Thu Jun 4 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"This was fantastic. I can't express enough just how fun these are. The amount of effort put in is really apparent.  My one ""eh"" thing is the players playing themselves. And I don't mean like the choices they make role playing reflecting their real life personalities or anything that's fine virtually every player does that at some point. I mean the puppets and names just being them.   I understand from a logistics standpoint its way more efficient and expressive to just have a Justin puppet than to have a bunch of blank race templates with enough accessories to be able to make every PC a unique character for the run of the show.  And the puppetry parts are so amazing I can't argue that isn't amazing because it is.   But K4 is just Justin with goggles. So what happens if we see K4 as an NPC? Is his tile just another Justin tile? When they go to do puppets is there Justin with nw accessory talking to Justin with goggles? Since there's nothing to visually differentiate does Rob have to break a bit of the fun of an ""OH MY GOD K4"" reveal by introducing him and the explaining which Justin PC this is?   And as a role player I also get how much easier it is to just call people by their names than character names but again for the purposes of world building and lore I feel like character names might be useful. I just had to sit here for 3 minutes trying to remember Coe's character name because I think they only use it once the entire campaign. Even if he comes back as an NPC later on and Rob explains ""This is Gracias"" I will probably have no immediate recollection of who that is.  Also it kind of makes them feel a little samey. Yumi and Romain's dwarf (i think it was inky? Or blinky) are different characters. In the head I know this. But in my head so far I also just consider Romain and Deadbones to just be 2 slightly back stabby but always paired together treasure hungry guys looking out for themselves. There are nuances amongst the characters no doubt. But at the moment every time I see Deadbones puppet I just immediately assume he won't like anyone but Romain and will probably try to escape on his own at some point.   I'm probably in the minority for this though and again I understand its just way easier on all levels to do it this way so I'm not trying to say it's shitty or anything. Just expressing my immediate thoughts on it."
BuffaloWizards,38kpd7,cmcdonald22,3,Fri Jun 5 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"We have some of these problems in mind already, and some solutions in mind as well.    For one, we are definitely going to push ourselves to don a variety of personalities each new campaign.  That should help alleviate some of our ""default"" behaviors, and we'll become better ""actors"" over time.    As far as identifying/differentiating characters, there are a few possibilities.  We might add our characters' names to the status screen in the following form:  ""Justin as 'Dwarf No. 3'""  Instant problem?  Justin becomes K4 (among other names) throughout the campaign.  It's possible that we could make it changeable in  the app, but that's another thing that needs to be micro-managed... sounds like a bad idea.    Let's also look at your example of a later Justin character meeting K4.  I feel like this is easier to answer - K4 will simply look different, an artistic representation will be made that ""looks like K4"" taking his attributes into account; the helmet, his gnomish race, his class, etc.  Live-Justin will always look like himself (with a costume), but past Justins can be more artistically rendered.    None of this is set in stone, but possibilities that have been discussed."
BuffaloWizards,38kpd7,Coestar,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:13:47 2015 UTC,"I assume you guys had thought of stuff like that already and really the ""acting"" was always the thing I was least concerned with. Funny is funny if people default too much oh well. No big deal   The other stuff is just weird logistical stuff that stands out (ex-programmer so I immediately go into debug mode for things I enjoy) And I still just think the redrawing old PC's is cool, but you still lose that immediate recognition where fans will explode ""K4!!!!!"" In chat as soon as he pops up.   But its a really really small ""concern"" in the scheme of all the work you're doing. I just figured I'd mention it for future off season reworks. Definitely not a thing you guys should worry about right away. Really fun though!"

BuffaloWizards,38j0ne,oddball_gamer,2,Thu Jun 4 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"A possible suggestion for how to improve the events (other than just flat out increasing the price like Rob already said) could be to make it so the fans have to choose between them, i.e the first 1 of the three (maybe 2 of the three) is the one that happens. Since people are mostly donating money for supporting the stream I don't think they'd be too upset that they donated for nothing, but the fact that their suggestion might lose might cause the donations to come in a bit slower?"
BuffaloWizards,38j0ne,OhmicFoamy,4,Thu Jun 4 16:16:24 2015 UTC,I think Rob might have said something similar in the behind the scenes but generally when fans of your content are giving you money for something you want them to feel like they're winning. Short term competition is good but for a sustainable long term venture the fans need to be able to feel good every time they donate.

BuffaloWizards,38fc8g,Sch0rsch,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:03:36 2015 UTC,"Is there an item that will let you control/switch initiative turns with someone? I'm commenting a while after I watched these so I can't remember the specific situation (or episode) but there was a part where Justin was setup to clean house but it was Roamin's turn and I thought of this. Idk how it would balance out in game, but if you could pay a huge cost to take your turn, say, instead of the enemy it could really turn the tide of a losing battle or save time on what should be a stomp. Or you could steal a kill or gtfo."
BuffaloWizards,38fc8g,Hi_mynameis_Matt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:41:50 2015 UTC,"Traditional D&D just had the ability to delay your turn and permanently alter initiative order, no fancy stuff required just ""I'll delay until after Justin"". So I imagine if they wanted to they could just discuss that option or introduce a treasure to let the players do it.  I figure though it's probably not brought up jus because of people being new, not being try hard min/maxers, and the cause its way easier for rob to just go off the same initiative order and not have to worry about it being changed and remembering it."
BuffaloWizards,38er05,tristanduffy,37,Wed Jun 3 18:58:25 2015 UTC,"Nuren Yes, the New Years stream no. Only things that happen ON STREAM are ever cannon though.  If I reveal something in a Behind the Scenes, that's not canon. An example of this would be talking about the Dragon/Phoenix events that could have been in the Nuren Campaign.  If we say something, but it's not proven, it's not canon. An example would be about elves sleeping. Two characters have claimed opposite positions on if elves sleep or not, until you see an elf sleeping or meditating, you cannot confirm or deny it as lore.   If we recap a character, it's tentatively cannon. We said that K4 went to go live with the great monkfish, it's cannon until it's proven otherwise. If K4 comes back in a future adventure and never talks about the great monk fish, then the recap was not canon. This means things like Philpee ,or however Roamins silly spelling of it goes, being dead is canon until it's proven he is alive. This allows us to always end a character's story, but not have it be in stone."
BuffaloWizards,38er05,Rurikar,6,Wed Jun 3 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"You should probably try to avoid such definite words on those recaps if their futures can change like that. So, if you ever do come back to Kaefore's/Gracias's/Plilipe's story it'll be confusing to any viewers that thought that their stories had already been ended. Stuff like ""Slated to be executed"" or ""On death row"" let people know that he's going to die, but hasn't yet. While then moving Gwyneth Sunsword over next to him while saying that he got ""100% executed"" and going into excruciating detail gives a different impression."
BuffaloWizards,38er05,darkychao,8,Thu Jun 4 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"You should probably try to avoid such definite words on those recaps if their futures can change like that.    I don't need too. He's dead until it's shown otherwise. You don't know internet audiences, they value closure more than anything else. If I don't say he's executed, I will be hounded until the end of time to put him back in a campaign.  He's already 100% dead. He died saving his friends, that's a much better story then ""To be Continued""."

BuffaloWizards,38er05,darkychao,2,Thu Jun 4 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with both you and Rob. If this show worked differently I would say Rob is wrong because Coe survived and there is no way his character would leave him to die. But each week is a different story with a new set of characters. And ya Rob should be careful about who he just kills off like that, but he's 100% right that he would be hounded to bring him back. But thats not entirely a bad thing ether. Like what if he has a Kobald campaign, he could have brought him back for a cameo appearance. But he wants to keep things fresh and new each week (it seems like anyways). That all being said he's not 100% dead, its more like 99.9% dead. Because its still possible for his tale to be returned to and him survive/get rescued somehow. But its just better to say 100% dead so Rob doesn't have people bugging him to bring him back."
BuffaloWizards,38er05,raidergreymoon,6,Thu Jun 4 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"So Doctor Who ""Timey Whimey"" logic. If its never mentioned again assume its true but if anything contradicts it in the future, the latest information is the true information."
BuffaloWizards,38er05,TimetravelingGuide,5,Thu Jun 4 04:07:10 2015 UTC,"I believe that Rob said in the Nuren Campaign Behind the Scenes, that they could, he even mentioned that Sir Spanky the Monkey could return. Remember if it happens on the board, its cannon (usually)"
BuffaloWizards,38er05,laserboy99,4,Wed Jun 3 19:30:08 2015 UTC,Yes. They've mentioned on how characters from other campaigns could pop up in the future like Pause's character as a minion of Bopen or someone could get the crystal with Deadbone's character's soul in it. That's also why people are keeping track of the lore created every week.

Some of you have told me Wikia has stepped up their game, but I dunno if that should excuse them from the shitty company they were years ago and all the Wikis they ruined through greed back then.   Thanks Plorntus, I don't mind if you run ads if you need to support the Wiki, but keep them tasteful if you need too."
BuffaloWizards,387wyn,Rurikar,5,Tue Jun 2 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"About the spam bots, from personal experience I can recommend ConfirmEdit. Using that with the QuestyCaptcha module allows you to set questions when an edit is made. You can completely customize these questions (ranging from for example simple questions like ""what is the first monster you can play in a game"" to more complex questions involving random number generation and arrays).   The wiki I set up used to suffer a lot from spammers at first, but once we managed to get this up it completely stopped."

I'm asking because it seems like a more long term efficient solution would be to create basically a 2x4 slab object that goes across the table and keep inventory on it. Then as the players progress you could just slide the slab down the table (assuming simulators physics don't send the cards flying everywhere).  Also even though it isn't a big deal since it's just a fun game for entertainment but the slab could have a designated dice pen for rolls to prevent table slips and Jack dice.

BuffaloWizards,3884lw,Rurikar,2,Tue Jun 2 16:54:16 2015 UTC,You'd still want to use fog probably since you wouldn't be revealing entire rows/columns at a time but it would actually keep the larger map hidden from the audience allow you more accessible space for organization and such.   And if you didn't just want it to be plain black you could just grab a sampling of the table trim texture so it just looked like one large wooden cover for the table.   But yeah glad it seems like a workable idea and that you already had it pop into your head. Work flow stuff will long term help you maintain your mental sanity through all the stress.
BuffaloWizards,3884lw,cmcdonald22,3,Tue Jun 2 17:22:46 2015 UTC,I'll be messing with some ideas we can use to make things easier.

BuffaloWizards,38abnt,blacknekos,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"Ok here I go;   Name for project-I don't care, this is fan art; this is your project so choose whatever you want. I will not play your game if it does not use the Ur-Live stuff because then it is not a Ur live game. Make the board game with the cards and maps that have been released for now. Then add ""expansions"" and or ""dlc"" to add the new cards and new characters.   2-1/2. Ok for 2 I was a bit rough, but this is a Ur-Live game. Instead of new characters. Give tools that let players make their own characters while still being limited by the Ur-Live stuff. Also for the characters make on steam, make pre-made sets for them. So a player can have be ""Gracious""(Coe's name) ready to go.  My Ideas;  I make 2d games myself and these big projects take a long time to complete. Many other people may want to do what you are doing. So make a community to help you with your project. Next, your idea is really good but can we have some more info on what exactly you are going to do.   Anyway sorry if i sounded rough, on 2, I am just tried with exams and everything. Have fun with your project. I was thinking instead of a board game, how about a computer game where you play d&d but only Ur-Live. So like a Ur-Live simulator."

But yeah, people will be able to use any of the classes, races, treasures, items, possibly maps if and when Rob releases them.   I plan on getting a video up of the project and at some point once I feel that there is enough progress done on the project, I will set up a subreddit for the project (also when a name has been sorted) where people will be able to submit ideas and get involved with the project. I know that as soon as I have programmed one of the creators (in this case the Character Creator) it would be easy to ""copy"" the code and modify it for each of the card types which shouldn't be too hard. When it comes to the campaign part, I will probably ask the community about it as that is when I will need the help with how I should do it.  But thank you for commenting, it has been very helpful and I am sure I will be able to use it to help me out."

BuffaloWizards,38580n,NickGraves,9,Mon Jun 1 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"Animation is a crushing amount of work. If you keep at it and keep learning we might be able to have more fan animators in the community help us out with the animated bits!  Also you pretty much took a couple days or less to do this, so you didn't spend as much time as you could have to really flesh this thing out. So don't think that any part you consider lackluster was because of skill! It might just be that you rushed it."
BuffaloWizards,38580n,NickGraves,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:03:02 2015 UTC,":') Oh man, thank you so much for the kind words! That makes me feel really good about it, actually!    I spent basically all day yesterday, part of the day before (after stream), and the better part of today (internet was out until like 6PM today) working on it. The levels of frustration as I redid piece after piece was immense, and there were only like 30 or so unique frames to it, I had just never drawn so much ""complete"" pieces in such a burst before (sketches are a different story), I wanted to do backgrounds and all sorts of things that I just couldn't bring myself to do in such a work load.    If you look at my layers for each frame for the first ten or so, they were going to have a background each, and one did, but that's it, and the sketches were obviously removed.    So props to you man for your patience, I'll try my hand at shorter, more fleshed out pieces and work my way up (hopefully). I think you use After Effects, which I have never tried my hand at, so I guess I'll see. Again though, thank you!"

The different layout Wikia uses sets itself apart from more traditional wikis, but a great deal of functionality is lost in doing so.  Wikis like MediaWiki keep the traditional layout, but alongside retain the more neuanced means of editing many wiki vetrens are more used to.  Although I personally loath Wikia, I've generally seen a higher ratio of editors to users with Wikia wikis as opposed to their MediaWiki counterparts, even if the number of monthly uniques they both get are roughly the same.   For UR there are pros and cons to both, and whoever wants to dedicate the insane amount of time it will take to get either off the ground is welcome to choose their favorite and run with it.  Here are a quick few quick glances to illustrate the differences in appearance between the two wikis:  High End: Wikia - MediaWiki  Low End:  Wikia - MediaWiki"

BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,DalanianKnight,19,Sun May 31 05:57:17 2015 UTC,Agreed 100%. I've formed too much of an emotional bond with him throughout this day for him to just be executed as a footnote.

BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,unhi,11,Sun May 31 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"I took a few notes throughout:   'Supporter' was spelled wrong for the ""Supportor Events"". I feel like enemy health should be visible... at the very least, boss health. [Edit: To clairfy, I mean for the viewers, not the players.] Is there some sort of reasoning behind the enemy tile colors? It seemed weird seeing green enemies since green is usually a good color. I feel like the card overlay should be same height as character bar. I'm sure they want to make it so the small text is still readable, but it sticking up the whole time bothered me a bit. They should have tokens of some sort that can be placed on enemies to to indicate if someone is frozen, passed out, etc.     Holy crap though. 9 Hours. that was bloody amazing. The map was beautiful, the puppet system is the greatest thing ever. This was so much fun to watch.  Bring back Felipe!"
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,Boolderdash,8,Sun May 31 06:02:47 2015 UTC,"Is there some sort of reasoning behind the enemy tile colors? It seemed weird seeing green enemies since green is usually a good color.   To me it seemed like that was mostly so you could differentiate between different enemies more easily. Instead of having to point to the one kobold out of the 5 and say ""I wanna attack this one"" you just say ""I wanna attack the green kobold"". In addition to that, when Rob's keeping track of HP, his notes can say ""Green kobold has X hp, red kobold has Y hp"""
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,Euler-Landau,5,Sun May 31 06:22:05 2015 UTC,"Furthermore it showed different types; at the end, he said green elves could only use flare, for example."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,DKnucklehead,10,Sun May 31 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"Enemy health should be visible... at the very least, boss health.   From my experience that is something that is not typical in table top RPGs like this. It's typically something that is kept hidden by the DM, with only descriptive indicators as to what it is. This was used during the first Kobold fight where Roamin asks how a Kobold was looking."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,unhi,2,Sun May 31 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"Well I agree that it shouldn't be visible for the players, but it's somehthing I personally really want to see as a viewer. Same as how we know the special events are going to happen when the players don't."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,bluesmcgroove,2,Sun May 31 06:08:03 2015 UTC,"On the subject of notes, there wasn't much scaling on the damage dealt compared to rolls, especially on the first boss. I.E rolling a nine would hit for full damage, whereas a seven or eight would just do one damage."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,PrivateChicken,3,Sun May 31 06:07:26 2015 UTC,"Rob has mentioned a few times that he doesn't like all the math and memorization that games like pathfinder and DnD have, and that URLive is more played to his whim as the DM, so I feel the damage values are fine for what the game is: a fun roleplay experience with some funny guys."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,MP227,1 point,Sun May 31 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"The fact that there is scaling at all is strange. Generally it's all or nothing, or there is a sperate damage roll. I wouldn't be surprised if Rob often scaled inconsistently or not at all in the future. He's probably just being nice as a DM when there are low rolls."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,Biglaw,7,Mon Jun 1 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"Not only was that fucking great, I'm so glad the donations were rolling in. I would've hated to see this be something great that went nowhere because of cost. Either way, that was entertaining throughout, never got old or boring. Good job guys."

BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,arlaton,4,Sun May 31 14:22:12 2015 UTC,Wow
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,Makydog,4,Sun May 31 05:56:51 2015 UTC,"The show was absolutely amazing and had me at the edge of my seat at parts (the whole well incident) and barreling over with laughter at others (Call me K4!). That said, I have a few notes that could hopefully streamline things:   Perhaps one of the other guys be the one controlling the stream interface and camera. It would be a ton off Rob's plate. I know the viewers would have to be in Fog of War mode, but that might be a good thing as it puts us more in the player's shoes. DMing takes a ton of mental bandwidth, even without streaming. Just having a player manage party health would help a ton for combat speed and with remembering effects like Justin's rabies.   Also, this got a lot better later in the stream, but the players should be generally figuring out what they're going to do the turn before its their turn. Its understandable that Rob may need a moment to process his moves, but if the players can generally figure out their turn when the previous turns book keeping is happening, things move a lot faster. At least it does wonders for encounter time in my group."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,Zonnewyzer,5,Sun May 31 06:28:29 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I had high hopes for this stream and it was fucking incredible. The comedic timing was so good it almost seemed scripted, and the puppet pals just made everything come alive. I really hope they got a lot of money from this, all the work that got put into it really showed, and this is gonna be weekly! If I had to give any feedback, it would be that the puppet pals talking moments were a lot more enjoyable than the combat, with the exception being the final fight. That being said, I'm not saying that the fights weren't funny, they were still top notch, and the supporter events definitely spiced them up, and when they're distributed throughout the fight more instead of clumped at the beginning that'll just increase exponentially."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,jon_eod,3,Sun May 31 12:25:38 2015 UTC,"Loved it, got a few notes I'd like to add, just some personal opinions.    The combat can go on for quite some time and that's not necessarily a flaw, that's just how the group seems to work. What would be best is to design the maps with that in mind. For example first encounters could be a lot smaller and minimal, just to get things going. In my opinion, encounters should be shorter, but more plentiful. The time spent fighting some bosses can get up to an hour, so instead of having to rush at the end cutting some enemies in the encounters wouldn't be bad, as it leaves room for new encounters with different quirks. The best part of the stream is obviously the comedy, the best way to achieve that would in my opinion be to make the encounters very open ended and in large spaces. This would give the guys a lot of possibilities to come up with ideas to acces their environment to their benefit instead of being huddled up with their enemies in a tiny room spamming their attacks. Killing an unexpecting enemy by chopping a tree in such a way that it falls on their house for example is a lot more fun than killing it with 8 ice strikes. Enlarging someone to pick up an annoying npc and putting them on the top of a tree would be a nice way to deal with someone in your way without even starting combat. That leads to my last point, a very interactive environment. The world isn't just the guys and the enemies. Sometimes just showing that trees, rocks, benches and signposts aren't just a decorative backdrop would be enough to encourage a lot of creative plans.   That's all just my personal notes, though. I can't wait for the next saturday."
BuffaloWizards,37xjlj,5ilver42,3,Sun May 31 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"Wow. What an amazing show. It was incredible and I can't wait for more. My only suggestion, and it's not even needed (just an idea for changing up the show), is positive events. Viewers could donate towards events that are both positive and negative for the players."

BuffaloWizards,37xfar,SkyWolff,18,Sun May 31 05:06:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just really worried about making chat donate against each other, but at the same time this is being so requested that I may just make events that empower as well.  I'll some more thought into over the next day or two while we plan next weeks campaign."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Rurikar,8,Sun May 31 09:30:58 2015 UTC,"If you take a look at Games Done Quick's donation wars, it's pretty clear that the most money is raised when donators compete with each other"
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Dr_Silk,1 point,Sun May 31 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"To add to that, not having an ""end goal"" helps - With the save/kill the animals thing, the two compete without a goal in sight, just until the donation period ends which ends up at ridiculous amounts of money. So there could be a good vs bad donation war where only one will end up occuring, but if anything it engages the viewers even more."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Ningamer,1 point,Sun May 31 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"you have to also be careful, battles like that do raise money but, donator money is still finite and you wouldnt want donators having a war over the first objectives then not have enough money for the others since most of the money was spent on the first battle"
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,techh10,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing for the final $2000 Enrage objective this week because it was initially pretty slow but I was proved wrong on that one.  Having a donation-war for the final battle of the night would be the best of both worlds, I think."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,DynamicAjax,5,Mon Jun 1 09:22:19 2015 UTC,"I like events like the gemlings, which create a third party that could potentially help or hurt the group. Thought there should be more of those."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,tamwin5,1 point,Sun May 31 14:46:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could save having beneficial supporter events for the final fight? When I was watching the donation bars go up at the end it seemed like people were more hesitant to start donating than the other times, probably because everyone now knows and loves all of these characters and want to see them win, but that's just me."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Makydog,1 point,Sun May 31 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe take a page out of DragonBall and have some game changing party buff you can throw on the donation board a few rounds after the encounter has reached it's final form and the party seems screwed, allow for a turnaround victory if the donation goals throw the balance off too much."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,TimetravelingGuide,1 point,Sun May 31 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"It would be a shift in atmosphere but I think, as long as the donate goals aren't too crazy or clash too much (Ex: Healing Party Members which later leads to one of the party members dying.)  It would be more of a ""Friendly competition"". Not to mention to ensure that donations don't all happen at once you can shift them so they come in waves or so a smaller goal needs to be met before other goals open up. (Ex: Either 400$ for event B or raise enough for Event A + An extra 100$)   Either way, this is all just semantics really. The only thing people really want is a way to help the part and once you get that, everything else just comes down to your personal preference and how much time you have.   Personally I'd just say make Kruber a ""Wild card"" donation. Depending on how combat is going at the time and whenever chat raises enough to summon him, he can either hurt or help to give some control back to the DM while also throwing in something new to provide entertainment."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,TinyLongwing,10,Sun May 31 21:26:10 2015 UTC,Yes! We were talking about this in Deadbones' chat as well for a while. We really want to be able to donate to help the guys! Making things tough is fun but giving them a surprise boost while they're in a tight spot would also be really fun.
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Drifter808,3,Sun May 31 05:27:42 2015 UTC,I would like to see a supporter event where viewers can donate towards a certain person to help or hurt them. After a couple minutes who ever has the most money donated towards them gets affected.
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Boolderdash,5,Sun May 31 06:07:21 2015 UTC,"Either that, or a sort of ""race to X money"" thing for helping/hurting. Both have their own bar and the first one to hit say, $250, gets activated. Perhaps the second one could stick around as an option, but have a higher activation goal. Obviously this would take some programming in the back-end, but it would make it super interesting to see which way the viewers want each battle to swing, and which neat animation they want to watch."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,TinyLongwing,2,Sun May 31 06:25:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about donating toward a certain person. It might be really cool, but it might make more sense to have events affect the party as a whole. I dunno, but some way to do more with donations would be pretty neat!"
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,prettypinkdork,2,Sun May 31 06:28:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking the entire game that they needed a more expensive helper item."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,JetpackAwaaay01,2,Sun May 31 05:57:23 2015 UTC,"Could make it so that the viewers don't know which ones are good and which are bad, so they don't know what they're donating for..."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,5ilver42,1 point,Sun May 31 13:57:19 2015 UTC,I agree with you here on this. We love seeing the challenges but having one of the many options being actually helpful I think would be a nice idea for the final battle...
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Ace8280,1 point,Sun May 31 06:04:38 2015 UTC,Totally agree
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,k_main,1 point,Sun May 31 06:09:49 2015 UTC,The helpful events should unlock after so many offensive events. That way you could just have people cherry picking on whether to just help the fights.
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,RedstoneGate,1 point,Sun May 31 06:25:57 2015 UTC,Add reroll purchase! This would make the finale much more epic.  May fire be purged!
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Manofzelego,1 point,Sun May 31 07:02:15 2015 UTC,"I think one way to make it seem like the supporters are actually affecting the game (and not just negatively) would be to have 6 options, 3 beneficial and 3 detrimental (or possibly 2 beneficial, 2 detrimental, and 2 neutral/wildcards-anything-could-happen!) for the events.   However maybe make it so only the first 3 to reach the goal are activated? (because reaching the goal for all 6 every time would be well, a likely wash every-time)  I know, however, that this suggestion is probably unlikely since it would effectively double Nick's work load... but it's an idea I guess."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,dkurniawan,1 point,Sun May 31 08:27:11 2015 UTC,"We need a description about what the donation does. And, I think the donation event can be made more exciting. (Idea: 2 $1000 dollar event competing, one will help the enemy, one will help the team. When one event reach the target first, the other event would not happen. So, it will be like a voting system."
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,Jalbot,1 point,Sun May 31 15:11:52 2015 UTC,i was thinking that if they did add a helpfull event perhaps it would bring in either a ghost or a living companion that has been helpful-ish in the past. such as philepe's ghost or Blinky from the nuren campaign :D (this might be to much work)
BuffaloWizards,37xfar,FusedBlackBlade,1 point,Sun May 31 15:31:58 2015 UTC,I would like it if some weeks it was set up more like chat and the guys against rob where he sets up harder encounters and other weeks where it's rob and chat against the guys like it was yesterday.

Not sure if this would be difficult to do but I think it would add a lot!"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Venturi200,28,Sat May 30 22:13:37 2015 UTC,"My fear is how repetitive it would get. With a 5 hour +stream, your going to listen to the same music way too much. If we get to the point where we can have a musical budget, it's something I plan on investing in though."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,5,Sun May 31 08:47:39 2015 UTC,"Could you really make sure, that you get seperate audio lines then. For the animation later on it might be really bothersome to have music in it. With cutting and all that."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Impuredeath,8,Sun May 31 10:42:28 2015 UTC,See this is just another reason I wouldn't want to add music. I'd need to invest in some more audio tech which I'm not familiar with which cost R&D time. This would be something we want to do long term.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,3,Tue Jun 2 01:08:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I rather have no music untill you have a secure platform figured out.

Once it's made, you'd probably only need to switch it out every summer or just put the playlist on shuffle."

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Imagine_Baggins,31,Sat May 30 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, so since its painfully obvious that people want to throw their money at you, I feel like the only limit right now is that you could use more events. I propose that in addition to the 3 events that help the enemy, you have a neutral or good event that can help the team as well. It could be an inspiration thing, where it gives one of the players a reroll for one of their actions (ie Justin rolls to hit, rolls badly, but then uses the inspiration to reroll it and must keep the reroll).  EDIT: Also, you could use a fight escalation mechanic type thing where you open up the 4th donation option after x amount of rounds to keep chat interested."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,OneManArmy77,37,Sat May 30 22:11:48 2015 UTC,"The events just have to be more expensive, flat out. I underestimated how long it would take to do them and how much people wanted to see this happen. All of our events should have just been more expensive so that they didn't happen all three in the first turn of combat.  I don't think more events is the answer. Adding more and more to a fight would already drag it out with these battles lasting long already. Instead I would put animations in for the potential start/end of combat and parts of the campaign.  The show has to be a good blend of puppet RP and table top RPG. Obviously combat is going to be more beneficial to making money, but I also don't want to ruin the show because of it. After the Gemlord fight, the guys were suppose to bump into Elaphelks, but I skipped that encounter as it was purely combat in favor of going right to the bridge part for RP. Sure the bridge part could have ended in combat as well, but we needed a break from it either way.   The fan support was immense, I know I can get away with only 3 or 4 combat events a week which means less stress on my animator and more time to make better animations. If we do half as well as we did today each week, the quality of what were doing is going to drastically increase."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,16,Sun May 31 08:52:58 2015 UTC,"Well, rob, it's kinda hard to really tell whether you should raise the donation incentives, this was the first stream and generally the first of anything gets far more viewers and in-turn it'll get more donations."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,darkychao,13,Sun May 31 12:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried and you shouldn't be either. I'm totally cool with us talking about this stuff as long as you guys have faith that I have some decent judgement with where to go next. I got us this far and everything is going better then expected, I'm going to take it slow as I do changes I think will make things better and some things will work and somethings won't, but they will be small changes that don't ruin entire shows when I make mistakes."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,4,Tue Jun 2 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"Rob said it in his behind the scenes video, it's not about whether he should or not raise the donation incentives, he must raise it.  He said himself to support the show and keep it going with all the guys who work both on the cast and behind the scenes, he has to make at least 2 grand a week.    If the show and the viewers cannot and do not meet the higher donation incentives it just means his business model is wrong or the show can't go on.    Anyway rob's behind the scenes video is excellent, I love the raw enthusiasm and the insight that he gives off.  He repeats a lot that he is very excited about this whole project, so much that he's redundant, but I like it, it makes you fee good."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,sryfootinmymouth,2,Sun May 31 14:26:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and thinking about it now there might actually be more viewers next week. Seeing how well this one went down I'd kinda expect peeps to tell their friends. Either way we'll just have to wait and see."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,darkychao,2,Sun May 31 18:19:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I think you are probably right, but I would still consider giving the protagonists a chance with a ""good"" event that can help them out. I think if you keep the 3 bad events, especially for the boss battles, its gonna wear down the viewers who want to see the wizards succeed once in awhile. Plus it feels good to help out and feel like chat did something to help the story."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,OneManArmy77,6,Sun May 31 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"Another big thing is the timeline. I start planning the next campaign on Sundays and try to give the artists all the work they need by the end of Monday. We don't record the character creation till the end of tuesday which means I can't make positive events for characters because they haven't been created for the animator to make events on, until Wen.  This is a hard show to put on, it's well worth it I think we would all agree, but all the changes I do have to be slow ones to do this every week and I think doing it every week is the most important thing we can do going forward. It will let us build a summer audience on twitch from which to bloom."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:13:09 2015 UTC,"I dont think anyone is taking the hard work for granted right now. the mere fact that you are taking our suggestions into account is already great to hear. I would say that the positive events can be tied to a class ahead of time to activate, like the paladin would get a flamethrower for a positive event, or the sorcerer would get a ""double flare"" thing where he can attack with 2 spells in a turn by sacrificing the movement. Some of them probably dont need to be tied to a class at all, like if Phillipe gets freed, you could make him charging in to help the heros an event, or a stone of many talents thing that can allow one of them to change class abillities to match someone else in the party (ie if Justin is a paladin, he can become a sorcerer for x turns but only if someone else in the party is a sorcerer so Justin can use their abillities)"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,OneManArmy77,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"Also, unrelated, but can you give us a link to download the u realms theme song that you played during the intermissions?"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,OneManArmy77,5,Sun May 31 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"I think there should be a category of donations. I mean we should know which side the event will support and we can choose which one to donate. So, it will be up to chat to support the team or the enemy.  It will also add a sense of chat involvement too, which I think is really exciting....."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,dkurniawan,5,Sat May 30 23:19:34 2015 UTC,Well i dont think rob expected the chat to donate as much as they did as quickly as they did. I mean like 30 seconds after they were up they were already mostly filled due to a couple hundred dollar donations.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,pizzabash,3,Sat May 30 23:24:14 2015 UTC,Ya I felt the same. like good donation options to offset the evil. but make the good donation cost a lot more.

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,ScottishNutcase,18,Sun May 31 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"Just a thought while watching the stream. These donation events are extremely powerful and really slow the game down, but they're so freaking awesome. So I think it'd be awesome if there were events that power up our friendly neighborhood Buffalo Wizards, I think it would fix most of our issues. You could make them really expensive, e.g $200 (or double the largest enemy donation goal). This way it would have to be reached after the event/battle begins, letting the heroes struggle for a while."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,EpitomeOfWhat,22,Sun May 31 00:37:09 2015 UTC,"I don't really want to make the chat at odds with each other, I like it being us vs chat and while the events might make combat longer, they are exciting! I need to raise the donation amounts and slow them firing off to compensate for the long encounters, but I didn't want to do that opening week for fear of people seeing it as greedy. I mean we could have made more money if I forced more encounters, but it would have been a shittier story."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,3,Sun May 31 09:01:59 2015 UTC,Perhaps a passive kind of counter. If chat donates X amount of money throughout the entire campaign the party gets +1 to all dice rolls. After that is completed another one is set up and lets say they get +1 to all attacks. That way you get a constant stream of money instead of just the bursts when you fight and lets the chat help the party while still fucking them over. Now obviously these passive helpful things would be pretty expensive.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,pizzabash,2,Sun May 31 19:38:39 2015 UTC,Maybe donation goals for potions (like 1 for each combat.) would be enough to help the guy while also not reeaaaaaaaaly helping them as only 1 person would get a random potion.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,cellojake,1 point,Sun May 31 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, I understand that, it would appear greedy. Well, regardless awesome stream, can't wait for next Saturday!"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,EpitomeOfWhat,1 point,Sun May 31 21:43:08 2015 UTC,How about donate for reroll when team's total health is below 30%  That would prevent the game from ending too soon. Or they might die in the first battle if they are super unlucky.

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,loldudester,5,Sun May 31 05:11:21 2015 UTC,"He suddenly realized he was Irish while walking around Boston, is what we've been going with."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,challistwin,3,Sun May 31 04:33:19 2015 UTC,"The Boston accent was part of his character, but yeah, didn't last haha."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,TinyLongwing,8,Sun May 31 05:30:03 2015 UTC,This is going to be great! Im really exited for the animation!
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,_Twigs,7,Sat May 30 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"GG that was amazing. I really hope you do another ""walk through"" video where you talk about the possible outcomes! If you guys did a kickstarter, I don't know what would happen. Also, I'm thinking a ""Felipe's Scarf"" treasure card for the feels. It makes canonical sense because he had to sell it to the troll that wasn't a troll."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,EpitomeOfWhat,6,Sun May 31 05:56:04 2015 UTC,There is no containing the hype. An Hour until amazingness. I am so glad I get to watch it live. I cannot wait for the Band of Thieves Campaign!
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Clarkmeister,7,Sat May 30 19:53:47 2015 UTC,Suggestion: Adjust the location on the screen the event videos appear at. Part of the videos were cut off by the gui when they happened.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,lade1rex,8,Sat May 30 22:08:07 2015 UTC,I need to just change some tech to play nicer with each other.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,3,Sun May 31 09:03:07 2015 UTC,If there is a way to better balance sound levels (sometimes people were really quiet then suddenly really loud.) would be awesome. I was watching this on my tv and had to turn the volume up/down frequently depending on the voice of characters.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,cellojake,5,Sun May 31 15:08:44 2015 UTC,You literally have no idea how hyped I am for this. I need to go grab my notebooks.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Euler-Landau,6,Sat May 30 20:17:38 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see fan art of Philippe the Mighty Kobold.  Bonus points if they include the snake tourniquet and blunderbuss.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,lpchaon,5,Sun May 31 02:59:08 2015 UTC,"At this point, it should pretty much be cannon that Kobolds in general are snake wrecking badasses. Kinda like mongooses."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Glaedien,4,Sun May 31 03:21:35 2015 UTC,Philippe Tikki Tavi?  I like it!
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,lpchaon,5,Sun May 31 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"Did the stream generate enough revenue to be financially viable? If so, how many more streams do you think you can do after tonight (I'm assuming there was a ton of excess revenue tonight since its the big first event.)"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,BeanChompingOgre,6,Sun May 31 05:45:41 2015 UTC,the final tier of events for the last segment was $2000 and it was raised in about 10 minutes. so.... Yes
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,PickShark,1 point,Sun May 31 06:01:38 2015 UTC,"That's so great. I had to work and got interrupted to a point where I quit watching (I didn't want large gaps in my knowledge of what had happened.) I really enjoyed what I was able to watch and look forward to the next stream.  I wonder if they can disable the donations on the web page after it reaches the threshold, forcing people to save their money so future events can happen. An overflow could also be used but then I think you take away the ""voting aspect"" of donating towards an event. I don't know how big of a deal that is, since you only know a name and a picture as a viewer."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,BeanChompingOgre,4,Sun May 31 06:05:36 2015 UTC,That was 9 hours of absolute bliss. I really thought they were all going to die. I love how it's Roamin and Deadbones who managed to actually escape the village. It's basically a failed heist. It's like the beginning of GTA V.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rautakello,6,Sun May 31 06:03:56 2015 UTC,Will there be another stream this weekend? I seriously have been looking forward to it since Sunday.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,BeanChompingOgre,3,Fri Jun 5 04:25:37 2015 UTC,"A suggestion would be to make sure the donation events wouldn't cancel out each other, for example the gemlings came and then the whirlwind kobold's came and killed them all making the gemlings useless. Also maybe in the future have some different events that help the buffalo wizards or that are neutral in who it helps."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Dinocicle,2,Sat May 30 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"The gemlings were kinda neutral as they just attacked anything, but I would personally would be more inclined to donate if the event would benefit the BWs"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,InverseCodpiece,2,Sat May 30 23:16:46 2015 UTC,Maybe a donation event to get Rawb a better ISP?
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Imagine_Baggins,1 point,Sat May 30 23:29:42 2015 UTC,you'd need to change how the ISP market is structured then. You think there's anyone else even remotely viable other than the obvious? Rob is stuck with his 200$ a month 50 up and 50 down. Shit's expensive but it's needed to upload his terabytes of Haunter Editing data.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,ToriBoshi,3,Mon Jun 1 08:33:06 2015 UTC,I think there should be a total donated counter as well as the supporter events. I want to see how much we are helping the guys!
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,transonicduke,3,Sun May 31 01:00:50 2015 UTC,UR Live: I will forever remember it as the night I spent seven hours recapping the stream as it went on. Loved every minute.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,chronohawk,3,Sun May 31 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"That....was just plain amazing. The map was great, the little puppet animation was great, the cut scenes, the enimies, the selfies, the characters, fucking everything was just great. What was perfect to was it was so obvious how much fun you guys were having and it made the show. Plus bravo to the community, every little battle goal was met INSTANTLY. The TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR goal was met in like under three minutes, that's just mind blowing. I cannot wait for next Saturday, I am so freaking excited about this show! Bravo to everyone involved!  Edit: Oh my god! I almost forgot like what got me so excited at the start of the stream! That intro video with the remixed UFR show music made me actually clap like to hear that again was great."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,warthog15,3,Sun May 31 06:00:25 2015 UTC,"Again, that was absolutely amazing. just please, for the love of god, GIVE US THE MUSIC"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,OneManArmy77,3,Sun May 31 06:00:42 2015 UTC,"Wow... I mean I was hyped before it began, but that was amazing. The artwork, the animation, the music but above all the laughter. My face still hurts from smiling. This is the breakthrough that these guys deserve.  My favourite thing was of course puppet pals. It's remarkable how well it worked and how funny just an eyebrow raise could be.   This was the first one, which was a total success, despite technical difficulties and a crew getting used to doing this live for the first time. I can only see this becoming better and better over time. Well done guys :D"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,ampinstein,3,Sun May 31 06:27:32 2015 UTC,"I have a suggestion! Along with the donator events that hinder the adventurers in battle, I'd also like to see some that buff them up, such as reinforcements, assistance from Nissovin, or something like that. Just my little suggestion."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,mr_pootis,2,Fri Jun 5 02:55:07 2015 UTC,Awesome Coe and Rawb and Justin and Deadbones and Roamin and EVERYONE!!!
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,theanomaly18,2,Sat May 30 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"Holy Light seems slightly OP right now, maybe have it so that it becomes half as effective every time it's used on the same character?"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Venturi200,3,Sat May 30 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell for NPCs. I think it would only truly be broken if you had 2 people with Holy Light, I might make the reduction not self but class based."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,2,Sun May 31 09:05:18 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: The stream's not over. One last try. If it crashes that's it. If not, ends 12am EST"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,matchboxdan,2,Sat May 30 23:51:25 2015 UTC,And if it crashes the same campaign will be back next week

We hit one single $2000 dollar donation incentive. So much support, it's so great to see.   I can't wait to do this again next week."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Waytfm,2,Sun May 31 05:56:44 2015 UTC,Thant was seriously one of the most fun streams I have seen in a long time! cant wait for next weekend!
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,hooverdam26,2,Sun May 31 05:58:36 2015 UTC,"this show was really great! the roleplay in this was even better than the last UR stream, which is a tough thing to top indeed.    only thing to put a finger on for me, was that i had to go to bed halfway through and watch the rest today. but since you are starting earlier next week that should be no problem. and besides, you can't please everyone, especially regarding timezones.    this show was awesome, and will be sure to watch it all summer whenever i'm able :D    RIP: Phillipe"

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Darnokthemage,1 point,Sat May 30 20:07:00 2015 UTC,Will you be releasing the whole deck for us to see/use? I ask because I am planning on DMing for a laidback tabletop game and these would make things SO much easier! I totally understand if you won't because you guys have worked hard on these.
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,transonicduke,3,Sat May 30 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"All the cards we used today are at the top of the thread. I think it might be missing races and such, but will be adding those in as we go along. This will very much be an ever evolving game."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Rurikar,0,Sun May 31 09:16:52 2015 UTC,"Please rob, I beg you not to do it this way. For DM's (like me) who want to put on our own games this is extremely frustrating. I understand that this is all yours, you own it and can do whatever you want. But, having said this, i urge you with all my will to change your mind.  PS. I LOVED the stream. Keep up the good work."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,frozencrow777,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:28:22 2015 UTC,According to Rob's talky video he put out yesterday. they are going to give access on the Buffalo Wizards website as soon as they can.

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,transonicduke,1 point,Sat May 30 23:24:19 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to watching the stream! In the future, could you put the title card up a 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes before the stream starts. Probably five minutes early would work. People were just annoyed because they didn't see anything at the exact start time."

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,thirdtotheleft,1 point,Sat May 30 21:12:00 2015 UTC,Hey /u/Coestar.  Can you put some information in the post about how we can support/where to donate?  <3
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,calrogman,2,Sat May 30 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"He's probably busy. But, on the stream, if you scroll down there's a donate button! You need a paypal account to donate, at least that's the only option there for me."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,EpitomeOfWhat,1 point,Sat May 30 21:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I posted that comment (I think) after the button was added but before I refreshed the page, so I didn't know it was there!"

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,cboland,1 point,Sun May 31 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"Idea for the next one.  Have a big donation event that is always available (even out of battle) so people can donate to that in general when there is no other options. Set it to some really high number, say $1000. Once reached have a random event to happen and the bar is reset.   The event could heal the whole team back to full health, summon a random boss to fight, etc. You could even split it up into two different goals, one good, one bad."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,TimetravelingGuide,2,Sun May 31 00:35:34 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of having an ""Overspill"" fund that's there the entire stream. that way it takes a long time to build up and it can result in an event that won't screw over the gang. I'd say bring in that Kuber Wizard guy. Then it's left to Rob to make it good or bad, and we get shenanigans."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,TimetravelingGuide,1 point,Sun May 31 00:40:44 2015 UTC,"Just going to note that at this point in the stream, over 500$ has been raised. To continue and make this a weekly thing, we need 2000$ per stream. We're 1/4th the way there."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,sterffff,2,Sun May 31 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"Um, theyve made significantly more than 500 so far.."

BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,IH8B8,1 point,Sun May 31 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"It really was an amazing experience to see all this happen. I hope the next adventure will be one of the two groups, and not the two at the same time (might cause confusion). The two other looking for their own group could be like supportive characters for then.(like how Deadbones played Filipe)"
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,boredompwndu,1 point,Sun May 31 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"Having watched the replay, my real concern at this point is how line of sight is being established. I've always enjoyed the imperial assault method of line of sight. Draw 2 unobstructed non intersecting lines from one of your corners to 2 corners of your target space."
BuffaloWizards,37vk1r,Stuwey,1 point,Sun May 31 22:55:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure if its planned or not, but spell effect tiles would be a nice thing for Rob to have, especially if they were a little more distinct than the regular player squares.  I saw the simulator has support for custom models, so it could happen.  Otherwise, I can only think of good things.  Far beyond what others have done, and IMHO, this has a chance of dethroning PAX's DnD sessions."

Rather then allowing your next character to select a treasure from this one I think it should allow this character to select a treasure from your previous character. I know this sounds like semantics but I think it makes more sense this way and goes along with the theme of Golden Inheritance. This only a suggestion to enhance the game mechanics. Thanks for taking this into consideration guys, and for the great content"

I'd suggest that if the group actually manage to finish the campaign and kill the boss or whatever, you finish your drink.  Also, I'd say 2 or 3 drinks for each hour they spend in the same encounter. For example, we're still in the first encounter right now."
BuffaloWizards,37we92,Euler-Landau,2,Sat May 30 23:27:58 2015 UTC,I saw someone in the chat suggest 1 drink every time Roamin makes a bad pun

BuffaloWizards,37xs39,punxtr,5,Sun May 31 07:50:02 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on whether he's French or Spanish. Felipe is the Spanish form, Phillippe being the French. Given Rob's Canadian and they speak a lot more French than Spanish there, I'm also going with Philippe."
BuffaloWizards,37xs39,ampinstein,5,Sun May 31 08:51:39 2015 UTC,But... Coe befriended him... And his name was Gracias... So its more probably Spanish
BuffaloWizards,37xs39,PickShark,4,Sun May 31 14:20:20 2015 UTC,Coe called him Phillippe on Twitter.
BuffaloWizards,37xs39,AwesomeName7,2,Sun May 31 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to Felipe, but since Roamin gave him the name (if I remember correctly), I think Roamin is the only one who really knows how to spell it."
BuffaloWizards,37xs39,fealos,2,Sun May 31 13:28:02 2015 UTC,We have to ask roamin
BuffaloWizards,37xs39,Buttsack_,3,Sun May 31 14:36:32 2015 UTC,Roamin named him after the name Phil stating that he could keep the spirit of his name. Therefore the only spelling that makes sense is Philippe.
BuffaloWizards,37xs39,Haloover9000,5,Sun May 31 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"But his original name was Pete, right?"
BuffaloWizards,37xs39,Dr_Silk,2,Sun May 31 15:32:35 2015 UTC,actually we don't know his original name. Petey is what the Kobold gang named him.

BuffaloWizards,37wn0n,cellojake,3,Sun May 31 00:39:49 2015 UTC,The only thing I do not like about a donation counter always on the screen is it seems tacky. Maybe if there was a way for it to update on the bottom right then fade out again?
BuffaloWizards,37wn0n,Rurikar,10,Sun May 31 04:08:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think it's tacky too. Random people coming into the streaming, seeing a number like that can come off as off putting when they don't understand the insane amount of work going on behind this simple number."
BuffaloWizards,37wn0n,MoreOne,3,Sun May 31 10:11:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe somewhere out of they way? Like on the donation website? I feel like sometimes people want to have a progress point, but yeah, on-screen counters are tacky."
BuffaloWizards,37wn0n,cellojake,2,Mon Jun 1 00:29:30 2015 UTC,"I actually like the counter the way it is right now. It shows the ""live progress"" and is important for anyone watching outside the stream. I would like, however, that the counter was put live (Not only on the 20 second delay stream)."

BuffaloWizards,37rokt,thirdtotheleft,20,Fri May 29 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"In the future will throw a tipjar into videos, but a lot of the success needs to come from livestreams.  Twitch.tv is a much different enviroment then Youtube. It's almost purely gaming centric and having a ""Big"" stream attracts tons of new users who will sort by channels.  While I know there would be tons of you who would support the videos after the day, we designed this as a live show and tie a lot of it's success to the fact we want to pull big numbers each Saturday to build our audience. When you do super niche content like this, it's important to get lots of eyeballs because only maybe a couple percent of people who even check out the stream are going to keep watching it from week to week."
BuffaloWizards,37rokt,Rurikar,2,Sat May 30 00:12:59 2015 UTC,ill be watching from work on my phone and have my home computers on coe's stream to boost viewer numbers.  i have very very high expectations and i know without a shadow of a doubt i'm going to laugh my ass off and have a great time.

BuffaloWizards,37rokt,Euler-Landau,17,Fri May 29 22:52:26 2015 UTC,Coe and Rob and the BW in general have been my favorite content producers for awhile now and it honestly puts a huge grin on my face every time I hear Rob or Coe talk about how excited they are for future plans. If I could I would donate the 2 grand a week myself to keep this going.
BuffaloWizards,37rokt,Unguided_Llama,8,Fri May 29 21:50:52 2015 UTC,Rob talks about installing the puppets so we don't spend entire videos looking at a board while people talk  Does entire video of looking at the board while people talk.  Ok.
BuffaloWizards,37rokt,TimetravelingGuide,7,Sat May 30 02:41:02 2015 UTC,"Rob, with all of the content that you've been putting out, I know that this is selfish to ask, but do you think that it would be possible for you to put up that puppet pals program? I'm playing warhammer 40k with some friends  over the internet and I know that it could make things even more fun. Also, I cannot wait for the stream tomorrow. The last one was fantastic and all of the effort that you and the others have put into UR Live will be worth it."
BuffaloWizards,37rokt,MrBrianM,12,Fri May 29 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"Puppet Pals is hardcoded. Like when you launch it, it connects to a server in my home. It's not designed to be used by anyone else. The time it would take to make a client for all to use is not something I can afford because I'm a content creator, not an application developer.  Also, I'm not even a good programmer. My code is sloppy and messy, it be much better for other people to just take my idea and build something there own. The design is pretty obvious once you have looked and seen what I have done that I'm sure there will be people who build their own type of puppet systems in the future. It's a novelty I built to take our show to the next level and I wouldn't be surprised/upset if I saw other groups/guys do something similar in the future because it's also great for podcast type shows."
BuffaloWizards,37rokt,Rurikar,1 point,Sat May 30 00:15:57 2015 UTC,Any chance you could atleast put the code up on github for us to bastardize to make work on our systems?
BuffaloWizards,37rokt,pizzabash,9,Sat May 30 00:31:04 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't ask that if you looked into what programming is like in Adobe Director, but even if you were a master of it, it's not really something I want to share. I have no problem explaining exactly how I am doing stuff, but I really don't want people going through my code."
BuffaloWizards,37rokt,Rurikar,1 point,Sat May 30 00:53:26 2015 UTC,I bet it's just a question of how long that a program similar to yours comes around that lets you focus just on the creating of the puppets and not on the whole base programming part.   You might even put out there what features you would expect of a program like this so that if some people from this community find themselves able to do such a project that they have a base to build on and orientate at.

BuffaloWizards,37s0k1,grimer30,9,Fri May 29 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"Each puppet is multiple layers. They have a hat layer, a body, a head, eyes, mouth layers, and a special layer.  It's just a simple program that allows you to switch between the layers quickly and then also netcode it together. Movement is based on 5 standable locations so that you do not notice latency since we have guys like Deadbones in the group that will have a 150+ ping. When I did Harry Potter books with Deadbones, the ping was very noticeable when he would move things for example.  Like everything I program, it's build in Adobe Director, which is not something I recommend to anyone. I use it because like I been saying for years, it's the language I know inside and out from my youth and I can program almost anything I would want in it for projects like this. You could build it to use green characters if you want, but not if you want to greenscreen overlay it over things. I can't use anything with transparency effects either because of it's design, however I do have the ability to pop up backgrounds which is something we will use in the future as I want to include particle effects for being able to light characters on fire/freeze/smoke or other special effects.   The characters so far don't have any ""real"" animation. Mouth layers are simple random mouth positions and when they move they are just bouncing. I plan on putting animation layers in as well, but it isn't needed and it's better to start out too simple. Giving the guys too much too fast will overwhelm them, so it's better to slowly give them more and more features for them to use from week to week. Since the program is overall just a novelty to the stream anyway, it's better because it means characters will get more animated as time goes on by me giving them more and more buttons to push.  I'm 100% sure it can be built/designed better then I have done it, I am not talented in this respect."
BuffaloWizards,37s0k1,Rurikar,2,Sat May 30 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks :D  GitHub could help you with building it better if you want, if you can figure out the setup then it basically let's other people copy and rewrite your code and then submit it back to you so you can check if their version better.

BuffaloWizards,37s0k1,jon_eod,1 point,Sat May 30 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a sprite system, so there's set sprites/avatars for each animation/movement and pressing an emote button or a movement button or talking would just activate the corresponding sprite. This could be done in a ton of different languages, although the greenscreen/overlay portion of it is a bit more advanced.   So there may be 20 different ""talking"" images, ava when a character is talking it cycles though the still images to create the ""illusion"" of movement.  C# or .NET would be nice and simple for importing images and responding to keypress/button click events, but you can create this software in a ton of different languages.  Edit: to expand on your other questions, yes it could have green characters, yes it could have varying height/y locations on the screen ( would look weird because the sprites are probably just torsos). If it's more advanced it uses modular faces/moving parts, but it's most likely done the way I described above.  I'm interested in the networking aspect of it and how they're all connected. Source/disclaimer: 6 years of software development classes/work experience. I don't know how any of it actually works but I gave a good description of how I would write it."
BuffaloWizards,37s0k1,Qarin_,1 point,Sat May 30 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with animation in the .NET framework is that the main way of accomplishing it (storyboarding) is a tremendous pain. It's great for creating the app and establishing functionality, ie. key bindings, network stuff, etc., but when you want fancy moving parts, it just becomes a major pain.  When it comes to programming, I agree with Rob: use what is most familiar, especially if it's just for personal use. If you can make something that works the way you want it to in a language/framework that has the tools you need, then there's no reason to use anything else."

It's still hard to organize things like these because a lot of the people who work on the projects are still very much part time and can't give 100% of their time.  However, all the cards will be on this thread in a moment for what we're using this week.  As we slowly build this world, we want to provide all the cards/information for free on our website. Were not looking to make a game we sell, but a are hoping the stream experience and the contribution support from the live stream will really drive this project.  And just so it's out there, we WELCOME anyone to play with our assets we release. If you want to make your own Youtube series or just play them personally, go absolutely nuts!

I generally don't think having guests of people I haven't worked before with is a good idea because I haven't worked with them and they will be unfamiliar with our format and tech. I'm sure down the line it's possible, but the core crew of Roamin/Coe/Deadbones/Justin are our main guys, others will step in for weeks they can't make it."

Modern browsers provide you direct access to Mics and Webcams via JavaScript, and there's libraries out there that take care of the complex stuff, so you'd just need to add a relatively simple layer to e.g. trigger speech animations when talking, if the person looks right on cam, turn char right, if left, turn left etc. Stuff like that could make it much easier for new people to use, while still maintaining advanced functionality.   Though, I'm fully aware you're a busy man, and this may be somewhat of an undertaking (thus the open source/ open to community suggestion).   Regardless, it all looks awesome, and I'd still be watching even if it wasn't a Euro-friendly time :)"

BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,keaganwill,4,Fri May 29 06:40:56 2015 UTC,That fucking ending was amazing. I was cracking up for the last 3 minutes!
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,keaganwill,4,Fri May 29 06:30:46 2015 UTC,"Rob, could you perhaps upload a very short reminder video before each URL so people like me don't forget about it and miss them?"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,zzCratoszz,6,Fri May 29 11:43:21 2015 UTC,You bet. I'll have one an hour before we start.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Railith,2,Fri May 29 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"Follow him on twitch! You can get an e-mail notification, and I think you might be able to get other types of notifications too."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,sensarwastaken,2,Fri May 29 15:01:14 2015 UTC,"It's actually going to be going on coestar's twitch channel, not Rob's!"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Tresnore,2,Fri May 29 17:42:01 2015 UTC,"Right! I forgot. Anyone know why, though?"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,EvilGRAHAM,2,Fri May 29 18:49:04 2015 UTC,Not sure but probably so it can count as Coe's Stream a Day.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Johnniey,2,Fri May 29 21:03:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe so Coe can get more twitch followers so he can quit his job, too?"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,argetbrisingr101,2,Fri May 29 22:16:52 2015 UTC,Rob talked about this in a video. Its basically what nirogunner said. Coe is almost big enough to quit his day job.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Clarkmeister,3,Sat May 30 00:03:29 2015 UTC,At the tall dwarf shouldn't it be dual wield? Sorry if its said in the video but i did not watch it yet.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Clarkmeister,3,Fri May 29 04:48:09 2015 UTC,"This video is awesome and quite informative for someone who's not familiar with the game, unfortunately I won't be able to watch the stream :( but will be really looking forward to it on YouTube!"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Kylesmomabigfatbtch,3,Fri May 29 06:15:00 2015 UTC,"Holy crap that was amazing. The animations literally put me in tears. I don't have the cash now but I garuntee that at some point in the future now I'll become a patron. This is online entertainment on a whole other level. One thing I would like to see in the future is for the animations to have a ""laughing"" animation. Otherwise I can not be more excited. Seriously Rob, go get wet and see what happens, you've earned it. Also have it be Coe who got you wet. He did good with the cards.  Also question: where do we submit our fanfiction? The fact that you'll have in-game names but not use them would make it a neat writing exercise to rewrite the champaigns using everyone's character names and adding the cultural quirks that come with them. (Ex. Making Coe a Mexican Gnome) or shall I save it for my Happy Birthday Coe shrine I keep in my closet with the rest of my Waifu collection?"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Kylesmomabigfatbtch,3,Fri May 29 07:07:33 2015 UTC,The animations might just be the best thing I've ever experienced in my life.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,RenVit318,3,Fri May 29 12:38:55 2015 UTC,Hay rob just an idea  for the puppets could you give a indicator for that persons turn? and perhaps combat vs out of combat  such as sparkles on the character that has the turn... as for combat maybe some red tint or something of that sort to show danger
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,RenVit318,2,Fri May 29 21:37:32 2015 UTC,Rawb you scared the living skooma out of me! I thought that this was from last week and I missed a stream... Rob never ever scare me like that again... your voice is too smexy to miss! Wait wat
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Makydog,2,Fri May 29 04:28:48 2015 UTC,Love it. I just hope nis lets them go before the stream starts.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,EpitomeOfWhat,2,Fri May 29 06:14:54 2015 UTC,I lost it several times during the talk with Nisovin. I can't wait.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Thunder_Dino,2,Fri May 29 06:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm incredibly impressed with the puppet tech you guys built for the show. Seriously. I had trouble watching the first URealms live, because there's only so long I can stare at the Tabletop screen. But this a beautiful way to solve that problem while increasing the comedy value one-hundred fold.   Hats off, and bigs thanks for all the work you guys have poured into this. It's really paid off, and I'm legitimately excited for it now."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,TimetravelingGuide,2,Fri May 29 08:09:04 2015 UTC,"Rob, will you be doing a commentary for this URL like you did for the last one?"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Boolderdash,10,Fri May 29 10:10:11 2015 UTC,After each show for sure.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,stufforandom,2,Fri May 29 10:23:59 2015 UTC,"I have to say, the puppet program was fantastic. The faces even matched the tone of voice, and each puppet seems to suit each person perfectly. Now I'm extremely excited for the stream."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,HypothermicIce,2,Fri May 29 14:23:11 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, those last 20 minutes had me in absolute stitches, which isn't a good thing when everyone else I love with is going to bed. The character creation was very cool, and looks to be just enough in depth the maintain those rpg elements that we can need out about, but not slow down the pace of the game, allowing you to concentrate on the humour."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,chronohawk,2,Fri May 29 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"I'm super hyped but unfortunatly I'm not going to be able to see it live, will you upload the livestream in parts like you did with the first one? The lenght and frequency was enough to keep me hyped for it every video.  Also mad props to you/whoever made the puppets program, it looks really cool and polished! Those puppets are going to chance the way you guys play it all."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,ManofBerg,5,Fri May 29 19:43:53 2015 UTC,"It will be faster, 2 episodes a day. Entire stream over 5 days starting the day after so Sun/Mon/Tues/Wen/Thr, then on fridays you get the game prep like this episode and then the stream on Sat."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Nirogunner,1 point,Fri May 29 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome! This will probably be some of my favorite content of yours, but I wont be able to see the stream live tomorrow. Glad we will still be able to watch it!"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,SeegurkeK,2,Fri May 29 19:53:39 2015 UTC,"Question: For documentary sakes, is the Nisovin of this campaign the same from the Nuren campaign? or should we just assume that there will be multiple Nisovins?"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Clarkmeister,5,Fri May 29 21:11:30 2015 UTC,They are the same. Nisovin is a funny character to play as I purposely try to give him no lore since he's Nisovins.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,DrKlezdoom,1 point,Fri May 29 21:14:01 2015 UTC,Ah! Thank you! He is a very funny character to see you portray as well.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,phoenix616,2,Fri May 29 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"In the future, I think Gnomes should get 3 treasures, and Dwarves should get at least one."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,The__Linker,6,Fri May 29 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"Dwarves get 1000 gold which is effectively 2 treasures. Gnomes get 4 treasures which is equal to 2000 gold, but the treasures are random and you only get 2 class abilities. It's a big gamble."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,jjmikhale,2,Sat May 30 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"When you put it that way, it makes much more sense! Thanks."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Taters_McShit,1 point,Sat May 30 02:35:22 2015 UTC,Didn't Justin get 2000 gold instead of 1000?
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Taters_McShit,1 point,Sat May 30 22:45:35 2015 UTC,I meant that was in additional 1000.
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,pizzabash,1 point,Sun May 31 10:55:58 2015 UTC,"Oh.. Yeah of course, I'm an idiot"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,danyb0y,2,Sun May 31 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"I know this is a really circlejerky thing to say, but wow..... just wow. This is all absolutely incredible, and I do entirely believe that what you said will come true, URL will be the thing that boosts you guys up into being huge, if only for being known as the guys who started the trend of using a puppet pals program in DnD streams. Just remember all of us little people when you're a star!  All that being said, I do have a couple of questions:  1.) Are you going to be adding more races for people to play in future streams? Things such as elves or kobolds, I know you're typically against using humans as a playable race.  2.) How long would you say it took you to put the puppet pals stuff together? By this I mean solely the coding of it, not necessarily the art portion of it.  I've gotta go, cause it seems like the hype train is pulling into the station! CHOO CHOO!"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,keaganwill,1 point,Sat May 30 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"Should the keen gnomes load all their ""reusable"" stuff on Coe? So all three of them can use it? * edit * Or on Justin ""Bumbly Dwarf #3"" Justin, as it is his last name."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,EpitomeOfWhat,6,Fri May 29 05:58:44 2015 UTC,"That is in fact a tactic, but while there is no encumbrance/inventory, trying to do something like this wouldn't work out. The nice thing about games like this, is I can easily skew the balance on the fly and change it next week so that there really can't be ""exploits""."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,DanelerH,1 point,Fri May 29 06:39:41 2015 UTC,"Can't Roamin give the ring to Justin? Then Roamin, Deadbones and Justin can use it and Justin can bring it into the next game."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,EpitomeOfWhat,3,Fri May 29 07:10:47 2015 UTC,"Only if Roamin's character is giving it to him forever, which so far is not exactly in character for him to do."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,DanelerH,1 point,Fri May 29 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"Yup. But depending on how the champaign turns out, chances are they'll nerf it. I think it'd be interesting if during the ""game transfer"" something could go wrong, or instance someone else in the comments had the idea of a ""dull blade""."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Makydog,1 point,Fri May 29 07:19:45 2015 UTC,"Sure they could, but I feel like these guys aren't really gonna be playing hardcore to win. There are probably plenty of loopholes in the system to cheese through the whole campaign but that doesn't make a good show."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Juicysteak117,1 point,Fri May 29 13:31:48 2015 UTC,"I'm even more excited for Saturday now! You can already tell the huge amount of work and effort put by everyone. Thank you so much, in advance, you guys are all amazing!"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Juicysteak117,1 point,Fri May 29 07:20:24 2015 UTC,I am so out-of-my-mind excited for all of this! Today was a great day!
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Juicysteak117,1 point,Fri May 29 07:22:02 2015 UTC,Already really looking forward to the stream!
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,aeam_b,1 point,Fri May 29 07:23:07 2015 UTC,I am so goddamn excited for this. When I saw Episode Zero go up I thought I missed the stream and I was really pissed
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,aeam_b,1 point,Fri May 29 12:24:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this has been asked before, but will the puppet program be used during the livestream in this form? Doesn't it take up a level of attention to move the puppet all the time?"
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,Juicysteak117,4,Fri May 29 14:57:00 2015 UTC,"Yes and Yes. This really isn't us ""playing"" a game anymore, it's very much a live show. The puppets are simple, but it takes awhile to naturally use them well."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,fantasypirat,1 point,Fri May 29 17:29:40 2015 UTC,Time and Day thingamajig For the different timezones
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,fantasypirat,1 point,Fri May 29 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"I am so excited for this! Sad that I will missed watching it live this time due to a new job and the slight delay this week, but it doesnt hamper any hype! All the art that Coe, Nick, and Meganzoor has does for this is just inspiring."
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,TheYellingMute,1 point,Fri May 29 16:16:30 2015 UTC,Where can I get this game?
BuffaloWizards,37ojpm,TheYellingMute,1 point,Fri May 29 16:25:34 2015 UTC,Roamin should totally give his Ruby to Coe/Justin so that 3 people of their party can do an additional move.

BuffaloWizards,37o708,JetpackAwaaay01,2,Fri May 29 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"Here's a new, updated countdown to the time"
BuffaloWizards,37o708,InverseCodpiece,2,Fri May 29 13:33:18 2015 UTC,"Meh, starts at 9 in the UK, shouldn't go on too long into the morning if it's their usual time. Should still be good - not doing anything on Sunday!"
BuffaloWizards,37o708,JetpackAwaaay01,5,Fri May 29 13:46:32 2015 UTC,"Starts at 10 pm, remember we're at GMT + 1 at the moment due to daylight savings."
BuffaloWizards,37o708,InverseCodpiece,3,Fri May 29 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"Time how does it work? I had completely forgotten, cheers mate. Still not too bad though."
BuffaloWizards,37o708,JetpackAwaaay01,2,Fri May 29 15:17:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah for a weekend. Though I do have my final exam on Monday, so not sure how long I'll stay up seeming as Sunday is a busy day of revision."
BuffaloWizards,37o708,pizzabash,1 point,Fri May 29 15:23:05 2015 UTC,Damn that means it might interfere with the hawks game depending on how long the session lasts. Howell least vods exist.
BuffaloWizards,37o708,discardedcash,1 point,Fri May 29 16:58:57 2015 UTC,This is great for me I have work from 10a.m. to 6p.m. so I thought I would miss almost all of it now I only miss an hour.
BuffaloWizards,37o708,terrabellan,1 point,Fri May 29 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"Best news ever, 7am wake up is much more achievable than 5am for me"
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Yamil01,25,Thu May 28 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"Yes!  That was the best part of that event and it was animated perfectly.  I died laughing at the ""It's already in my mouth"" part because it perfectly captured how I imagined that scene.  Fantastic!  Now I'm a giant mess of tears and snot from laughing so hard."
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,lpchaon,24,Thu May 28 14:50:28 2015 UTC,"This comment is dedicated to Nick Graves, the best damn fanart animator and drawer, for making the amazing moments the buffalo wizards make just a little bit more special. Keep up the awesome work and good luck."
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Haloover9000,29,Thu May 28 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"At this point Nick Graves isn't a fan artist, he's an artist for the Buffalo Wizards in the same retrospect Meganzoor and Haunter do awesome work for us!"
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Rurikar,4,Thu May 28 19:37:07 2015 UTC,True enough. Thanks for the correction.
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Haloover9000,2,Thu May 28 19:48:44 2015 UTC,"It is so smooth and well animated, man, how long did that take?"
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,TheDrCreeps,8,Fri May 29 02:11:10 2015 UTC,I spent a month doing 2-5 hours of work a day. It was a doozy.
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,NickGraves,20,Fri May 29 09:06:49 2015 UTC,"""I just wanna say, this is a huge moment for pansexuality""  This was brilliant, it's great to see it animated"
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Emperor_PPP,13,Thu May 28 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"Truly excellent and hilarious. Every time I watch it I notice something new and funny in the animation, great work Nick!"
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Meganzoor,9,Thu May 28 20:10:58 2015 UTC,The shoulder fire was perfect. The expression on Coe's face perfectly captured the his mood.
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,chemistryundergrad,6,Thu May 28 17:39:45 2015 UTC,Wow.
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Railith,5,Thu May 28 16:48:41 2015 UTC,I love Nick's art style and his animation makes funny scenes 10 times funnier!
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,stufforandom,3,Thu May 28 19:54:36 2015 UTC,GLORIOUS!
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,Syidas,3,Thu May 28 21:01:28 2015 UTC,"I had a lot of trouble watching this stuff live--for some reason, I just wasn't enjoying this particular session--but the animation really made the comedy click for me. This is fantastic work, Nick--more, please!"
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,sensarwastaken,2,Thu May 28 22:49:02 2015 UTC,Amazing work Nick.
BuffaloWizards,37lg4o,coolpool2,2,Thu May 28 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"If this becomes a regular thing after the UR Live videos,  for an Anniversary animation, you should start it off with the audio from the Stream, them break from it (but keep the animations) to go into the beginning of the Anniversary Video.  With that said, I am slightly sad that we only got to see the birth and not the death of the Apple Juice."
BuffaloWizards,37nnbd,F4JPhantomII,3,Thu May 28 23:38:10 2015 UTC,I was in a video again! This is the third time this week! That's more videos than I was in as a squire! I'm so proud!  This time you see me running into the lord aura within seconds of it being placed down. You know. To demonstrate it. And not because I was confused as to why there was a block of TNT lying around.
BuffaloWizards,37nnbd,Boolderdash,3,Fri May 29 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"Well, as we all know, curiosity killed the peasant, or jailed them at least."

BuffaloWizards,37ljjp,Ariodan7,5,Thu May 28 14:35:04 2015 UTC,So. I want to make sure I have this right. EST. not EDT. it's going to be 3:00 in the -5 GMT zone.... right? US is in EDT and I want to make sure I show up to the stream on time.
BuffaloWizards,37ljjp,5ilver42,4,Thu May 28 16:48:50 2015 UTC,A lot of people here use EST and EDT interchangeably. It will be at 3 pm EDT.
BuffaloWizards,37ljjp,TinyLongwing,3,Thu May 28 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I just want to make sure both myself and everyone gets the right time, because people in other time zones might not know..."
BuffaloWizards,37ljjp,5ilver42,1 point,Thu May 28 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, never hurts to ask! I know I've become more careful about daylight vs standard time when I give times for something, just because I've seen this issue pop up a few times before in the community."

BuffaloWizards,37h5d1,Gnattman,1 point,Wed May 27 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"I think about the only thing missing was a Tuna Bandit's Oath and some Game Theory going on, and they'd have had them all covered."
BuffaloWizards,37f1ed,MUFFINTOAST3R,6,Wed May 27 03:45:31 2015 UTC,Dead Friday Bones Night.  Still a great title for a great night.
BuffaloWizards,37f1ed,JaingStarkiller,2,Wed May 27 07:03:44 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the curse of the Walking Dead strikes again."
BuffaloWizards,37f1ed,Yamil01,2,Wed May 27 10:21:29 2015 UTC,"Oh don't worry, I was actually waiting for someone to make that joke. I thought the bones in between might change something :P"
BuffaloWizards,37f1ed,JaingStarkiller,1 point,Wed May 27 14:33:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, they had the opposite effect. The large skull in the center provides a huge amount of separation between the text on the two sides. What you've created is the exact inverse of ""don't dead, open inside."" Kudos to you. ;)"
BuffaloWizards,37f1ed,DeadBones5,2,Wed May 27 18:48:39 2015 UTC,"Ok fair enough, oh well ¯_(ツ)_/¯"
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,Meganzoor,42,Tue May 26 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"Whelp this should probably be a meetup sketch now...throw in Justin singing ""My Heart will Wow On"" in the background and that ""Never let Go"" scene  for good measure, we'll be rolling in dosh"
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,DeadBones5,12,Tue May 26 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"Alright, you heard the man, ""My Heart Will Wow On."" Get on it Wild."
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,Makydog,3,Tue May 26 22:35:56 2015 UTC,"Paging /u/Wildfallen make it happen brosef. I mean, I guess haunter could do it too..."
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,PixelBoom,0,Wed May 27 07:44:50 2015 UTC,wow
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,PM_ME_YOUR_KlDS,15,Wed May 27 11:18:07 2015 UTC,I like how DeadBones is barely touching Rob 's nipple.
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,chaoskid411,8,Tue May 26 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"I need buy a DVD copy of Titanic, print this image out and use it to replace the original cover."
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,Clarkmeister,7,Tue May 26 19:40:34 2015 UTC,i flinched
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,Cestida,4,Tue May 26 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"DB is trying to push him off, right? Lure him in with romance and backstab him.... right?"
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,linivy,6,Tue May 26 20:15:02 2015 UTC,[See BruceWillaker's latest Lords video for context ;)]
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,Tscenzurra,8,Tue May 26 20:21:30 2015 UTC,So when can we expect the car scene?
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,FroderickDankenstein,3,Tue May 26 20:24:54 2015 UTC,Dat smirk
BuffaloWizards,37d6i5,Arove,3,Tue May 26 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"Simply beautiful Meganzoor, I'm surprised how quickly you drew this considering it just came out"

BuffaloWizards,37c872,samiamrg7,3,Tue May 26 15:44:25 2015 UTC,Rhedmonkey is hilarious man. When I first saw this I didn't even realize what it was. Holy shit that's funny.
BuffaloWizards,37c872,Rurikar,1 point,Wed May 27 04:45:23 2015 UTC,gasp thank you senpai. :D
BuffaloWizards,37c872,dkurniawan,1 point,Wed May 27 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"Oh! I have also just set up a group on Deviantart called BuffaloWizardsFans, feel free to give it a look if you have the time"
BuffaloWizards,37caib,Yamil01,15,Tue May 26 16:00:56 2015 UTC,They did it! They finally did it! They showed Deadlantis!
BuffaloWizards,37caib,Boolderdash,4,Tue May 26 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"And Carnifex Tower! And Colin!  Seriously, so happy right now."
BuffaloWizards,37caib,TinyLongwing,2,Tue May 26 19:41:34 2015 UTC,Colin is wonderful! I hope that they go back and use the space more in the future
BuffaloWizards,37caib,DrLolzworth,7,Tue May 26 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"I know they mentioned it a lot, but this was a great field trip episode. Very reminiscent on older episodes of DvZ, it was nice to just see the guys walk and mess around for a little while.   I wouldn't mind more episodes like this."
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,Bakkidza,21,Mon May 25 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"In order to make it up to Justin, I've created a new statistic in his honor."
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,musican391,15,Mon May 25 19:42:05 2015 UTC,"Anyone else see Rob or Deadbones talking like a nerd, quoting the stats and acting like Pyro next TTT?"
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,TimetravelingGuide,21,Mon May 25 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"We'll find out in October, with how much they have prerecorded."
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,Emperor_PPP,20,Mon May 25 17:57:35 2015 UTC,Still waiting :(
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,stufforandom,9,Mon May 25 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"I'm merely providing data for the odd episode, having said that I'm going to need a new notebook soon,http://imgur.com/DY5LOoO"
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,PrivateChicken,5,Mon May 25 18:41:31 2015 UTC,You are truly a scholar sir. Once every few weeks would be a good length in between updates. It'd give the data enough time show any new trends.
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,chemistryundergrad,4,Mon May 25 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic! Loving the stats!  If you need help collecting stage statistics, feel free to pm me."
BuffaloWizards,377yh4,Azurillkirby,4,Tue May 26 04:40:57 2015 UTC,This is seriously really awesome!
BuffaloWizards,376qph,grimer30,20,Mon May 25 09:44:04 2015 UTC,"I have no intention of playing any more alpha/betas of Rust. Me and Pause got super burned the first time. We had this cool series, everyone loved and wanted more, and then they opted to redo the entire game then fix what they currently had.  I understand why they did what they did, but having a series pulled from under your feat like that as a content creator is a slow type of soul crushing. Fans demanding more and nothing we can do because the game is plagued with hackers that have been written off because they are working on a complete overhaul.  I told Pause I was completely cool with him doing it without me, but for me I won't even look at rush until the game is in a ""released"" state. I would rather focus on projects that we have more control of for producing content."
BuffaloWizards,376qph,Rurikar,4,Mon May 25 14:20:18 2015 UTC,"That's OK, I can always just play the game myself!"
BuffaloWizards,376qph,TPHRyan,3,Mon May 25 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's right! It hit 1.0 and stopped eating your laundry!"
BuffaloWizards,37447m,F4JPhantomII,5,Sun May 24 18:22:50 2015 UTC,I'm really enjoying the multiple POV editing
BuffaloWizards,37447m,terrabellan,6,Sun May 24 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed, its a great way to further cement the idea of the channel being mainly Buffalo Wizards. Also gives way to seeing Haunter work a lot of magic from more perspectives!"
BuffaloWizards,37447m,Clarkmeister,4,Sun May 24 20:43:29 2015 UTC,Just wait till we get TTT with the multiple perspectives!
BuffaloWizards,37447m,Yogstarjr27,2,Tue May 26 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm hoping for! Since only Rob is uploading TTT these days, having it cut to show the ""best"" perspectives for various moments would make the most sense."
BuffaloWizards,37447m,TinyLongwing,2,Tue May 26 14:08:57 2015 UTC,Aww the new TTT didnt have the multi perspectives!!!
BuffaloWizards,37462z,Noihctlax,35,Sun May 24 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"Clearly the suggested videos have spoiled our Buffalo Wizards High and My Little Buffalo dolls promotion, better get the legal team on it."
BuffaloWizards,37462z,DeadBones5,3,Sun May 24 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"Please, those are clearly Buffaloz dolls. You can't trick me!"
BuffaloWizards,37462z,dscyrux,2,Sun May 24 21:02:48 2015 UTC,Debbiebones doll confirmed?
BuffaloWizards,37462z,Makydog,3,Sun May 24 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"Oh that's just one of Rob's hobbies, he collects them."
BuffaloWizards,37462z,Phijkchu_arbok,4,Mon May 25 00:02:47 2015 UTC,It's often based on your own browsing history.

BuffaloWizards,370mf7,LordBroughton,3,Sat May 23 21:11:07 2015 UTC,Looking forward to this being a weekly show. Should be great!
BuffaloWizards,370mf7,chemistryundergrad,3,Sat May 23 21:06:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for reminding me!  I gotta get used to flipping my sleeping schedule every weekend now...
BuffaloWizards,370mf7,Tscenzurra,1 point,Sat May 23 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"Urgh, possibly the worst part of living in New Zealand is having to wake up at, unless my math deceives me, 3 am on a Saturday to catch this."
BuffaloWizards,370mf7,thirdtotheleft,1 point,Sun May 24 04:09:59 2015 UTC,"Still worth though.  If, on the other hand, you don't feel like ruining your sleep cycle, I'm pretty sure there are going to be episodes during the week. (Made from the stream)"
BuffaloWizards,370mf7,tamwin5,1 point,Sun May 24 15:43:29 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if all the segments from an episode will be uploaded before the next week. (I ask because I sadly will most likely miss the first two weeks for vacation)
BuffaloWizards,370mf7,Skipper2399,2,Mon May 25 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"I believe Rob's said Haunter's going to be working like a mad man to get them up before the following week, however, he emphasized that there's going to be no over arching story and week to week will be completely separate stories. That way if you miss one week it wont be a mad panic to catch up before the next one. :D"
