raisingkids,3e3tvq,ozyman,3,Tue Jul 21 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"I love board games, and we've made a huge effort to get our kids interested and find good games at their age levels. To add to the blogger's ""sucks"" list, I'll put forth that Hi-Ho Cherrio is pretty crappy, too. It's tilted against winning, and takes too damn long. A great replacement is the Sneaky Snacky Squirrel game. Gamewright games are all pretty good bets.  At around 3, we did ""My First"" Orchard, Squirrel Game, Feed the Kitty. Matching games, and also Pairs in Pears - we never played any of the ""games"" in the manual, but my kids did like the tactile little tiles and finding matches in the patterns and letters. Spot It Jr. is also approachable. CooCoo the rocking clown and hungry hungry hippos are pretty good, but not true ""board"" games.  My older two are now 5, and we have expanded. Tenzi is a great fun, easy dice game - we put in a pause after the initial roll and help them sort out their dice and decide which number to go after, and then go into the race. Others are: Pigs Up, Pengoloo, Zingo, Doodle Quest Junior, Richard Scarry's Busytown (cooperative!), Hiss, Robot Face Race  I think the reading barrier will really open up a lot of games for us. We also get pretty good mileage out of the tear out pages in ""High Five"" magazines - usually basic little board games, or matching games - fun enough for a change of pace or something to fill a few days until it breaks down. Sometimes to take the idea further we'll even make our own board games on long drawing paper."

raisingkids,3e03ir,ozyman,3,Mon Jul 20 22:43:57 2015 UTC,"We humans arrived at where we are, not by controlling our children’s behaviours, but by nurturing their development. We became the preeminent species on the planet, not by using CIO, or catching our children being good, not by star charts, and time-outs (“…from positive reinforcement”, as it was originally called), not by any means of reigning in what children do — but by caring for who they are.    This completely ignores all of history. Child abuse was not only legal until the late 19th century in the US, it was considered to be proper child rearing. We had to make laws to stop people from forcing 6 year olds to work in coal mines. We still fight to free children from sweat shops that make our clothes. Once public education became mandatory in the US it was found that incest-rape of children was insanely common in rural America because they finally had other people to talk to away from their family. Going back to medieval times, ancient Greece or the very first set of laws set down by Hammurabi, children were considered and treated as harshly as adults the majority of the time, and outright exploited the rest of the time.  It's hard to take someone seriously when they are this ignorant on the subject they're speaking on."

Things that don't fit a narrow view of attachment parenting aren't nonsense. I've found what's made raising kids easy is to totally let go of dogma and just do what works for each kid.  We let one of our kids cry-it-out as a baby to save my sanity and a wonderful child still emerged, spirited, friendly, kind and securely attached to her parents and caregivers. I don't feel like we got lucky or dodged a bullet, she just needed to be left alone at night and she learned how to put herself back to sleep. It improved her live and ours. We've used occasional punitive time-outs and a touch of behaviourism here and there, yet our kids don't fear us and our house is a place with lots of laughter, fiercely independent kids who do their chores (not always happily), happy parents and general peace.   Children thrive in all sorts of environments. The path we've chosen as a family has lots of love, lots of information, a touch of authority, and firm limits to acceptable behaviour. Seems to have worked so far. Just about as well as almost anything else would have probably. Humans are resilient and there is no one way of raising them that is best."

(where I live you do two years of kindergarten before grade one, one when you're 4 turning 5, one when you're 5 turning 6) The play based kindergarten that she attends really works on the soft literacy skills like storytelling and listening, talking about one's day in sequence, social and emotional learning with an emphasis on how our actions impact others, small group hands on experiments, a teaching garden where they learn plant and animal lifecycles (this year they raised caterpillars, made observations about them daily as they transformed from chrysalis to butterfly).  The teacher also sets up play scenarios for them to problem solve and act out. For ""math"" they play games with dice, Rush Hour Jr and Uno, plus they do lots of playing with unit blocks. They learn how to read calendars and charts, measure things, matching symbols, as well as ordering and patterning objects. There is also a huge emphasis on music, art, dance and movement.  Each child has a rotating job in the classroom. They sweep, wipe down tables, set tables, prepare a communal afternoon snack, learn to pour and clear their plates. They get 1/2 hour of free play in outdoor recess in the morning, about 20 mins after they finish lunch, and another 1/2 hour in the afternoon. They go outside unless it's below -20c. They also have about an hour of indoor free play.  She has never come home with a worksheet (her older sister, who was in a more academic kindy came home with worksheets pretty much every day) and they do not test the kids at all. Some parents are not happy that their kindergartners are not learning how to read, and that they'll get behind, but I love that my kid can enjoy kindergarten so much and learn those soft skills that are going to be so important in her life."

If he has diarrhea we don't dare make him leave the house.  If we are visiting a friend or family we try to take him to the most private bathroom we can find.

So, they asked the teachers what their preconceived notions of the children were, then tracked how those children fared throughout life after being left with those teachers as their primary source of education and guidance.

raisingkids,3dgl14,iambevin,3,Thu Jul 16 05:37:19 2015 UTC,"A backhoe is attached to the back of a loader or a tractor usually whereas an excavator is independent. A skid-steer means the the wheels are locked in sync and also cannot turn. To turn a skid steer you basically speed up the wheels on one side of the vehicle, causing it to skid around. They're usually very small and because they're capable of zero radius turns they're awesome in tight spaces. Skid-steers can also have lots of different attachments on the front, not just loaders.  Bulldozers have their blades low to the ground and are usually on tracks whereas loaders have buckets that scoop crap up and can load it into dump trucks (or wherever).  Hope that helps :)"

raisingkids,3csv98,Ontheneedles,5,Sat Jul 11 04:47:00 2015 UTC,"TLDR:   Under Greene's philosophy, you'd no more punish a child for yelling out in class or jumping out of his seat repeatedly than you would if he bombed a spelling test. You'd talk with the kid to figure out the reasons for the outburst (was he worried he would forget what he wanted to say?), then brainstorm alternative strategies for the next time he felt that way. The goal is to get to the root of the problem, not to discipline a kid for the way his brain is wired.    The CPS method hinges on training school (or prison or psych clinic) staff to nurture strong relationships—especially with the most disruptive kids—and to give kids a central role in solving their own problems. For instance, a teacher might see a challenging child dawdling on a worksheet and assume he's being defiant, when in fact the kid is just hungry. A snack solves the problem. Before CPS, ""we spent a lot of time trying to diagnose children by talking to each other,"" D'Aran says. ""Now we're talking to the child and really believing the child when they say what the problems are."" Before CPS, ""we spent a lot of time trying to diagnose children by talking to each other,"" D'Aran says. ""Now we're talking to the child and really believing the child when they say what the problems are.""  The next step is to identify each student's challenges—transitioning from recess to class, keeping his hands to himself, sitting with the group—and tackle them one at a time. For example, a child might act out because he felt that too many people were ""looking at him in the circle."" The solution? ""He might come up with the idea of sitting in the back of the room and listening,"" D'Aran says. The teachers and the student would come up with a plan to slowly get him more involved.  When an enraged second-grader threw a chair at educational technician Susan Forsley one day, her first instinct was to not let him ""get away with it."" But she swallowed her pride and left the room until the boy calmed down. Later, she sat down with him and Principal D'Aran, and they resolved that if he felt himself getting angry like that again, he would head for the guidance office, where he'd sit with stuffed animals or a favorite book to calm down. Forsley eventually learned to read his emotions and head off problems by suggesting he take a break. ""Is giving him a consequence—suspending him, calling his grandparents—is that going to teach him not to throw chairs?"" she asks. ""When you start doing all these consequences, they're going to dig their heels in even deeper, and nobody is going to win."""

All you get is defiance. Are you hungry? Are you frustrated? Are you tired? They don't know, they just want to hit. So you resort to saying we don't hit and if you do it again, then consequence.

raisingkids,3cghfp,Arthi_R,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:52:17 2015 UTC,Sounds interesting.  Could you give a short summary of the RIE principles or an example of applying it.  I will check it out when I get a chance & add you to our sidebar and master list on the wiki if another mod doesn't get to it first.
raisingkids,3cghfp,toomuchweightloss,3,Thu Jul 9 04:53:16 2015 UTC,"That would be great.   I'm not good at explaining, bear with me, but I believe the fundamental tenet behind RIE is that all of us, from the moment we are born, are thinking, feeling beings whose boundaries need to be respected, and who need to be allowed to discover and learn for ourselves.   So you create atleast one safe space in the house for the child, or multiple same-aged children, if you are a caregiver. You fill it up with safe objects, like plastic glasses and empty gallon bottles. And then you sit back and watch as the kid teaches itself.  Rolling over, sitting up, crawling, walking, all these milestones need not be messed with (as long as a doctor says it's okay, of course). By allowing children the freedom to do things when they are ready, we also allow them to develop to their full potential.   Also, it is a myth that children can be bored. They become bored when they have got used to us entertaining them. Provided a safe and secure place, children can occupy themselves for hours with just their surroundings.  I've personally seen a lot of success with this approach in the last month with my older child, and I've got my friends interested too. I think RIE as a parenting philosophy is kinder to the parent than other parenting philosophy.   I also see parallels with zen buddhism, in the suspension of judgement it espouses.   I also believe that the parent is able to heal their own trauma by providing a safe space for their child, and not just physically. We also provide a safe space where the child is free from judgement, free from the stress of measuring up to our expectations, and free from being addicted to praise. It's midnight here, so tomorrow I'll fish out Janet Lansbury's article, where she explains, that the child feels, ""I am enough"".   Indirectly, by suspending our judgement of our children, and by suspending our need for them to fill a role, we learn to be kinder to ourselves (I don't see it mentioned elsewhere, but I have observed this in my life)."
raisingkids,3cghfp,JoytotheUniverse,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:15:20 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to put in that there is a large overlap between RIE principles and Montessori ones and that you'll often find RIE practitioners on Montessori boards, which tend to be more populous/active."
raisingkids,3cgt80,SBRedneck,2,Tue Jul 7 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"Very common. Ferber talks about it in his book (which is a great, educated book on child sleep). Early in the night, it's nightmares. Later in the night it's more genuine night terrors which are harder to wake from and very disorienting. How you respond depends on how easy your child wakes from these experiences and which kind they are having. It's worth reading up on."
raisingkids,3cgt80,thaen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:30:23 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll look that up.
raisingkids,3cgt80,thaen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:00:41 2015 UTC,"On a real computer now:  Our daughter has had night terrors for a long while. The first when she was as little as 12 months. She would start whimpering in her sleep and it would escalate to these Poltergeist-like screams. It took us a while to realize that while it was happening, she wasn't even awake. We couldn't comfort her at all (and still can't); our presence just startles her and makes it worse.   When it's done (usually a few minutes) she is still asleep. She usually doesn't even open her eyes. But for all the world it seems like she is completely frightened out of her mind.  Nightmares are less frequent for us and just started more recently (she's 3.5 now). They usually manifest as her waking up very early in the night and scared, cold sweat, the works. Fortunately when she wakes from these she is scared but actually awake, so we can comfort her.  Sounds like you're dealing with night terrors. They suck. Not being able to comfort your kid when they are screaming is just the worst.  If they happen a lot, your Ped will probably recommend a sleep study, so keep them informed."
raisingkids,3cgt80,thaen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"Luckily it was that one time and not happened again yet. It was flipping scary, that's for sure. I am/was concerned that it happened at such an early age. I mean what do they have to be afraid of?"
raisingkids,3c6y2u,rkbot,4,Sun Jul 5 13:00:38 2015 UTC,"I have an ASD kiddo. Recently, we have been getting third and fourth  party information that he is getting called names and being made fun of.   In his sweet naive way, he doesn't realize what is happening and things they are saying ""stop it"" instead of ""stupid"". I want to teach him to defend himself by telling the kids they're not being nice. He also says ""leave me alone"" which I think would be great in this situation.   Basically, should I tell him how kids might make fun of him, or just teach him how to deal with it when he starts to notice. I want him to be proud of himself and his awesomism. And I really want to help him become a self advocate in anyway I can."
raisingkids,3c6y2u,Ontheneedles,3,Sun Jul 5 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe some role playing would help. Is there a book where some bullying takes place? Or just a picture online. You could discuss it and ask him what he thinks is happening, what does he think the ""bully"" is saying. Why does he think they are saying those things? What could the ""victim"" do or say in those situations? Does he think he has seen/experienced that situation? And then playing out the situation. I don't have an ASD child so not sure how appropriate this would be for your son but it was just something which came to mind."

raisingkids,3c2d1b,raspberry_and_lime,5,Sat Jul 4 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"So you can take or leave this, these are just my thoughts.  I grew up with just my mum, and I am a very independent, busy person.  If she's not around for a couple of days, I immediately worry, and I love the amount of communication we have - we don't always agree, but we talk most days. It is possible that growing up with 1 parents just sets into motion a different ""framework"" for relationships? Because the relationship with my mother is close, but people with 2 parents are never that close with either and they tend to think it's weird. Single-children single-parent people, however, totally get it. Maybe it's just more intense.  Anyway, the jealousy is a problem that you might wanna sort out mostly for you (assuming you're not letting it dictate your communication), but it seems that basically you feel like your dad has a new favourite. Which feels bad, right?  I see no harm in asking you dad if he won't come visit you, or up the telephone chats or something. It's possible that a) he has this other major relationship in his life, and you can't be no.1 anymore, an b) this feels okay and c) you can still ask for what you want/need and get your needs met.  What do you think? I'm interested in your point of view, partly because I am nosy and partly because it has relevance to me, and it would be good to see the same angle from the other side."
raisingkids,3c2d1b,shermangerman,3,Sat Jul 4 08:32:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to respond, especially since it's a situation you can sort of relate to since you've got a similar relationship with your mom. I'm not an only-child, but I definitely have a different kind of relationship with my dad than my friends who have both parents in their lives do with theirs. Since their separation, my mom has pretty much abandoned us (doesn't visit, doesn't call, doesn't pay child support, etc.). So my dad is really it for me in terms of parental figures and we've developed a pretty close relationship as a result.  I responded more in depth to the other commenter, but I think you came closer to saying what it is I'm feeling. Normally, when my dad calls me and tells me about how his relationship is going, I think it's great. I'm not really bothered by it or jealous of his SO. It's only when I come home and I have to deal with the reality that things are different and home isn't home anymore (at least not in the same sense that it used to be before I moved out) that I start to get upset. All of a sudden, it really started to bother me that my dad never came to visit because he used his vacation time to go visit his SO instead. It definitely isn't rational and isn't fair, but because of the circumstances of me moving out and when they started seeing each other, these issues have become really tied together in my head. So not only am I no longer feeling like the home I grew up in is home anymore, but one of the ways I have to deal with that is by having another woman in the house, who does tend to have most of my dad's attention when she's here.  I've brought all of this up to my dad, so he knows how I feel. He understands, better than I do I think, that I've made that transition from being dependent on him to being independent and that change is also going to have an effect on our relationship to each other. He does feel bad about not visiting me more often and did say he was going to try and visit sometime before the holidays, which I really appreciate. So I think everything is going to be okay, and once I get back to my home and back into my school and work routine, it will go back to normal. It's just definitely weird and emotionally draining to be at home now and having to cope with all of these changes at once. In the long run, I think they're positive changes, but not the easiest thing to go through."

I don't think this is necessarily the case. Although it is awesome for both you and OP. I grew up with just my mom and we were not close until after I was 30. We lived in the same house and would regularly go months without speaking. I think the longest I have gone without speaking to my mother is somewhere around 8 months. This isn't from anger or attempting to not talk to her, just indifference I guess. She is a busy person and neither of us felt the need. We talk more now. I would say at least once every other week or so."

It's a hard situation, no doubt. It's fine to feel jealous and to recognize that you do. But you recognize that this is a good thing for your dad. It's going to be ok. Feel your jealousy, cry about it or whatever you need when you're alone, then just keep reminding yourself that it's a good thing for your dad and you guys will find a new normal that will be different from how things used to be, but still great. One thing I've done is I have a standing weekly time when my dad and I try to talk on the phone. It's great to know that we both set aside that time (unless something really major is going on) when we'll get to talk, at the least. We talk more often than that, some weeks, but that's our set-aside time."
raisingkids,3c2d1b,Knotty_By_Nature,5,Sat Jul 4 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure how helpful I'll be but I see no one has responded yet so here we go. . .  You are a 20-something with jealously and separation issues regarding your. . .dad? First, I think it is great that you have a good relationship with your dad. Especially since your mom is out of the picture. I suspect your father provided all sorts of nurturing and support. He must be awesome.  But he's your dad. He is going to have romantic relationships that have nothing to do with you. And they shouldn't include you. And you, as a 20-something lady, should be considering having your own relationships (romantic or otherwise) that don't include him. Is that something you've had success with?  I ask about your own relationships because I think it is important for you to think about different types of love. You love your dad, right? Of course. Have you been in love before romantically? Even just a crush? Did the love you felt for the other person diminish the love you have for your dad? I'm guessing not. Parental love and romantic love aren't drawn from the same well. Your dad can love you as his daughter and fall in love with someone else and it won't affect the love he has for you.  I'm guessing a lot of your concern is actually coming from spending less time with your dad/suddenly feeling like a 3rd wheel. Well. . .You're an adult now. You won't be the center of attention. And that's a great thing! Your dad knows you're ready to be more independent. Your dad himself is ready to be more independent. Think of all the things you'll have to talk about when you both experience life on your own. You'll add value to each other's lives and not just be a default setting. (""Oh, it's Thursday and we always hang out on Thursdays."" vs, ""Hey, I haven't talked to you in a few days and I can't wait to tell you about X.""   If that all seems too simplified, or if I'm missing your point, I would consider seeing a therapist. If you truly have deep seated issues you'll want to work them out not just for the sake of your relationship with your dad but for any future relationship you have. Do you work? Many employers offer employee assistance programs that you can access for free counseling, regardless of the topic. It might be the fastest, cheapest way to start a relationship with a counselor/therapist you trust.   Either way, best of luck. Remember lots of people have had issues as they separate from their parents. And we all figured it out to some degree. I bet you will too if you keep acknowledging how you feel and behaving appropriately with your dad and his new love interest."
raisingkids,3c2d1b,Knotty_By_Nature,2,Sat Jul 4 06:05:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I do appreciate it, even though now that I'm rereading my OP, I think I did a pretty terrible job at trying to communicate exactly how I'm feeling.   But he's your dad. He is going to have romantic relationships that have nothing to do with you. And they shouldn't include you. And you, as a 20-something lady, should be considering having your own relationships (romantic or otherwise) that don't include him. Is that something you've had success with?   I'm not jealous of my dad in the romantic sense - definitely didn't mean to give that impression. I'm in my own long-term, serious relationship (more than likely with the person I'm going to get married to sometime in the next couple of years), so I absolutely get having a different focus besides your parent/child. My dad never really dated much when my brothers and I were younger, so I'm genuinely really happy to see him so happy.  Honestly, this is probably less of an issue than I think it is. I really posted this in a moment of weakness. I've only been home a few times in the last year, since as I mentioned in my OP, I live in a different part of the country. That's normally just fine - I've got my own life with my boyfriend there, and my family has their own lives back home. My dad and I call each other once every week or so, with the occasional text in between if something happens. So I'm not flipping out on a regular basis about not being close to my Dad or not being the center of the attention.  I think what got to me was I realized that my dad was using his limited vacation time to go visit his girlfriend and not me. Which is something I get...but it still kind of hurts? I've come home a few times over the last year (I'm in graduate school, so on school breaks), and I'm also transitioning to the fact that I don't live at home anymore (my room has been packed up and converted to a guest room, don't have too many friends who live around here anymore, etc.). You're right, everybody figures it out at some point, but I'm definitely still in that transition phase where I'm trying to figure out what this new relationship dynamic between my dad and I is going to be. It's just complicated by the fact that he's gotten a serious SO for the first time at the same time that I'm dealing with this transition.  I don't think a therapist is necessary - I promise this isn't something that I'm freaking out over all the time! - but I appreciate you taking the time to respond. It's helpful to get this kind off my chest."

I think what you're feeling is normal then. It's tough to find new roles as adult children and as empty-nesting parents. Don't expect so much from yourself. :) give yourself some time to adjust to your new roles. Maybe ask your dad to come over for a visit soon.   Good luck with everything.

Your dad getting a girlfriend is a Big Deal. Up to now it's just been you and him against the world, correct? But now there's the girlfriend, and that's new. And weird.  It will take time to adjust, but you will adjust to the new normal. Your dad is still your dad, he still loves you just as much and he'll still be there for you.

You're only in your twenties so your father is probably from geriatricity, but it's still going to happen one day.  I live very far from my father and my mother died a few years ago. My father keeps busy, and has a lot of friends and family who keep and eye on him, but I know that he is lonely. He had a romantic prospect a couple of years ago that he was very keen on, but it didn't work out. I wish he could find someone. I fear he won't, at his age, because not many elderly women actually want to take on an elderly man. They have their own families and duties and selves to consider, as I am sure I would.  There are statistics that divorced and widowed men are less healthy, and die younger, than married/partnered and never-married men.  So that's my perspective on it. I wish there was a kind lady out there who would enjoy being a companion to my father, and care for him."
raisingkids,3c2d1b,k9centipede,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're handling this (completely normal situation/reaction) very maturely. I don't see this elsewhere is the thread, but have you asked or made it a point to hang out with your dad one on one for dinner or a walk? I think this might help, for no other reason than its good to get one on one time with an only parent once you've moved out, it might go a long way towards a) keeping your relationship strong as you both grow and change and b) helping you feel more confident with these changes. The hang out should just be low key!  It might be a good idea for you to do something alone with his girlfriend once or twice. Getting coffee, afternoon shopping, etc. You can both get to know each other and feel a little more comfortable with the situation.  Definitely remind your dad about visiting you, although you chatted he might not entirely understand how important it is to you. Could you  invite his gf for part of the visit as well?  Lastly, moving out and growing into your new life as an adult is a really intense time and you may be feeling adrift regardless of your dad's relationship. It's really hard to grow up and find / build a new home and life while the old one changes and goes on without you. I think that everything you're feeling and doing is normal, and will just take time to get used to over the next few years, as long as you continue handling it well."

You should just bring it up casually that you'd like to see him more or go out to dinner one night with just him. Also try to be happy for his happiness.

raisingkids,3bibhs,arookieparent,2,Sun Jul 5 17:01:07 2015 UTC,"My perspective of a mom of a kid who starts school soon in another country is that it seems really early to start to require kids to read at 5yo.  Here, kids start school the summer after they turn 6yo - but some are allowed to start school and turn 6yo till new years the school year, others are allowed (with medical slip that it's better) to start school at 7yo. First day of school, kids are required to talk with proper grammar and pronounciation and should read/write their own name. During first grade, the kids learn how all the letters look, how to write them and read basic stories (as well as math and some basic science)  I don't think it's too late to learn how to read with 6yo and playing, asking and answering questions is more important at this young age than knowing how to read"
raisingkids,3bibhs,starly,2,Tue Jun 30 10:29:31 2015 UTC,"Why do I think that this is wrong, at age five I expect my child to be able to read at some basic level. Not complicated words but enough to converse.   Reading story books is a plus as well, it sets a tone for the child to have the passion for books. Sets a tone to aspire and become knowledgeable for the future.   It allows the child to be comfortable for themselves. There is so much learn at age five. And not dumbing them down."
raisingkids,3bibhs,Sambucca,15,Mon Jun 29 13:58:09 2015 UTC,"Research says that play based kindergartens are best and pushing academics backfires. Some kids are just not physically able to read at 5 (or 6 for that matter) and making them is like forcing all 12 month olds to walk. Some kids are very ready to read at 4 and 5 other are very much not.  There are many many many ways to promote and teach literacy to all kids at all skill levels without going down a pedagogical road of worksheets and flashcards and forced writing (boring for those who already know how, useless for those who aren't ready). My daughter's kindergarten focuses on literacy skills such as storytelling and retelling, acting out little plays, rhyming games. They are read to constantly and the kids that show interest in reading are thoroughly encouraged to continue down that path, and the kids who don't show interest are not forced in any way. My youngest kid knows a bunch of sight words but has absolutely zero interest in reading for pleasure. Forcing her would just make her hate school."
raisingkids,3bibhs,smokebreak,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"So much of this has to do with parental involvement.  I don't know many kids without disabilities who weren't ready to read at five, provided that they had strong involvement from their parent(s) at younger ages.    If a child arrives at kindergarten without being able to identify all 26 letters and the sounds they make, of course they're going to struggle with reading.  On the other hand, if the parent(s) have have prepared the child for kindergarten, reading is the next logical step.  On the other other hand, when I was a kid reading was a first grade task.  In general schools have gone really overboard with all this achievement stuff in the early years... which they've had to do in part because so many kids were arriving unprepared for school, and partly because our culture is so focused on college prep that the entire education system seems geared toward those kids who DO have high levels of parental involvement and are going to be going to college anyway."
raisingkids,3bibhs,smokebreak,13,Mon Jun 29 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know many kids without disabilities who weren't ready to read at five, provided that they had strong involvement from their parent(s) at younger ages.   I don't know about this. My totally typical 5 year old has zero interest in reading, has had very involved and literate parents, gets read to constantly and from a young age etc etc. She has some sight words and can fumble through early readers (dick and jane), knows letter sounds etc, but despises the exercise and is much more interested in the rocks in her pocket and running around that sitting with a book. (her sister was reading fluently at this age)  Luckily she goes to a play based kindergarten and loves going to school where they're learning about animal lifecycles, taking care of plants in a learning garden, acting out plays, working in groups and presenting their knowledge, learning how to regulate their emotions, learning how to play soccer and chess. There is about an hour broken up through the day of actual desk work where they mostly practice drawing. There's a focus on storytelling not writing, listening comprehension not reading. I'm not only fine with this, I'm overjoyed with her progress. She is simply not ready to read but is being put on the path of being a lifelong learner. Leave reading instruction for the elementary grades when it will come easily to most and spend kindy building those innate literacy skills and fostering a love of learning and inquiry."

He can write, and spell some things, but his interest in books is not as high as others in the family.  My niece, 7, has been reading since early 4.  She is going into the 2nd grade in the fall and has already read all the Harry Potter books, and continues absorbing any source of text around her.  My daughter, 2 (3 in Aug), is following in her cousins footsteps, reading (pretending) everything in sight, staying up after lights out, flipping through books in her bed, she'll likely be literate by 4 if i had to guestimate.

(except when my kids have friends over who I know are not allowed to be unsupervised in public) I'm confident that I know what my kids are capable of and I've been actively getting to know and building relationships with my neighbours. When my kids were younger I was out and about with them in the neighbourhood, walking to the park, walking/riding bikes to their daycare. They know which storekeepers we know, which neighbours are friendly, shortcuts that are good ideas (cutting through a school playground) and bad ideas (cutting through a busy parking lot when the high school gets out).  I guess mostly I just don't care if my neighbours report me. There's pretty much nothing that I'm doing that's illegal or dangerous. It also it helps to find other like minded parents. For us, it's the scores of new immigrant Lebanese / Jordanian families who simply can't fathom a culture where they're supervising their kids 24/7."

raisingkids,3av2zi,ozyman,8,Tue Jun 23 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"By law, all primary school students in the Netherlands must receive some form of sexuality education. The system allows for flexibility in how it’s taught. But it must address certain core principles — among them, sexual diversity and sexual assertiveness. That means encouraging respect for all sexual preferences and helping students develop skills to protect against sexual coercion, intimidation and abuse. The underlying principle is straightforward: Sexual development is a normal process that all young people experience, and they have the right to frank, trustworthy information on the subject.

In the states though I see it causing some cataclysmic rifts that's without taking into account the many parents' ideas on the matter. Kids go to school, learn the stuff, go home, and are instantly given the ""nope you're wrong"" treatment, or something similar. Our parents as a whole don't contribute enough to make this really successful, mostly cause they are all working multiple jobs, never home, religious, or tweaking. Not to mention every single parent truly believes they know better than anyone else when it comes to raising their kids lol.   I've got 3 of my own, and my philosophy is to answer every question honestly, and point them to the right information if I don't have it myself and stand by them as they learn. Gotta say though, some questions would be much easier to explain with just a ""no idea, go play"" response. Trying to explain the history of santa to a 4 year old is not the easiest thing at all XD"

He couldn't light it, so I brought out my fire paste from my camping gear, and had a primal ""i made fire!!"" moment. The other kids are still enjoying their limited electronics time. We start bringing out chairs, which gets the middle kid's (11) attention because he likes to help, and he brings out 3-4 chairs and a folding table for the goodies.

It's quiet as we are singeing the ends and trying not to be carried away by mosquitoes....  Then Game Time is Over and the rest all rush out and the youngest girl (10) is loudly narrating everything she's doing, which middle boy always loudly replies to. Kids are grabbing marshmallows and comparing their techniques and ""burntness"". They enjoy watching the blue flames dance around the sugar puffs and challenge each other to eat them hot. My boy, the youngest (6.5), climbs in my lap and wants what I'm having, as I'm  on my second smore at that point. I load a 5th mallow on my stick (I lost my first two, quickly joined by a few from the kids) and his face is lit up by excitement and the fire's glow. We do that until we've taken down a whole bag of mallows and 3 sleeves of crackers. A neighbor finally joins us after dinner and has a couple. By now, the kids are getting too comfortable with the fire and dropping more mallows than eating, so about an hour.  We throw our sticks in the fire and each kid takes in a chair or two.

Obviously if your child does nothing else all day than sit in front of the TV, you have issues - but as part of a range of activities, it's perfectly fine.   The day I hear people go into a moral panic over children getting too much 'page time', I'll actually take it seriously."
raisingkids,3aqt9k,TheBananaKing,6,Tue Jun 23 01:37:45 2015 UTC,"What? You let your kid watch tv? That's poisonous!  Joking aside, for my kiddo tv is like homework. He learns about how to converse by watching what the other kids are watching. Kind of. Haha"

raisingkids,3aqt9k,SpliceVW,3,Tue Jun 23 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"Right on. Between YouTube and Netflix my kids have been introduced to a wide range of music, arts, science and educational shows in addition to the fun stuff like Avengers or Justice League. They love watching a 20 minute video about glass blowing as much as footage of a concert or an episode of Dinosaur Train. They talk about it with me or my wife, they remember characters and plots and information for months on end, and my 2 year old can already identify about half the alphabet by sight, and a few numerals, too.  I don't think it's hurting them in the least. It's one more activity in their day. They also have memberships to our local aquarium and museum which they love to go to as often as we will take them. They have enough books to fill a couple book cases, and will sit down to retell the stories to me on a regular basis. They have friends they play with and love to run around with at the playground as often as we will take them.  They also know how to use a mouse and a touch screen to navigate a desktop or home screen/list of apps. They are learning about the realities of their environment and how to use the technology that is so ubiquitous in all our lives. It's all good. It's variety and breadth of experience that will serve them well as they grow and learn.  My son is also ridiculously cute when he sings Uptown Funk."

raisingkids,3aqt9k,highglyder,2,Tue Jun 23 15:08:00 2015 UTC,"It's all about moderation and content.  I'm currently reading The Big Disconnect by Catherine Steiner-Adair that speaks about technology within the family.  Unlike some other books on such topics, it's well balanced by recognising that kids do have screen time and that it's not inherently a bad thing.  She discusses what happens when adults allow tech to consume their own  and their kids' waking moments (sick days excluded), as well as the content that is now available to them and how it impacts their behaviour.  Things like 7 year-olds having a I'm Sexy and I Know It sing & dance off in the schoolyard.   When you get down to the science of screen time and it's effect on the psychological aspect as well as the physiological response within the brain, it's fascinating stuff."

raisingkids,3aixbu,Cbrantford,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"A couple of things to note.  ""Risky Play"" included completely typical playground experiences like climbing on things, jumping down from a higher level, going on slides and swings, and having private kids sized spaces.  Also, up to about 10 years old, supervising your kid makes them less likely to get seriously injured:   Research has indicated that higher levels of direct supervision are associated with lower injury rates in children up to 10 years of age [43–45]. A study comparing parent supervision practices for children aged 2 to 6.5 years attending an emergency department for an injury with an age/sex matched control group attending for an illness, found that the control group received significantly higher levels of supervision [43]. Another study interviewed parents of children aged 0 to 4 years who were attending a hospital for an injury, regarding the level of supervision provided in the hour before and immediately prior to the injury event [46]. Children admitted to hospital had significantly lower supervision scores than children who were treated and released from the emergency department, indicating an association between quality of supervision and injury severity. Interventions to encourage increased and active caregiver supervision are an important focus for injury prevention"
raisingkids,3aixbu,thereisnosub,2,Mon Jun 22 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Also, up to about 10 years old, supervising your kid makes them less likely to get seriously injured.   I think that there's danger and risk. Danger is letting your 4 year old cross a busy street alone, letting your 7 year old play by the bank of a fast flowing river or be unsupervised around water.   Risk is trusting your mature 6 year old to walk a safe route to school, to play independently in a nearby wood / park with friends, to ride their bike around their familiar neighbourhood, to use a sharp knife. Yes, it would be safer to supervise them or to keep them inside, but there is a lot to be learned from thinking independently without an adult to interfere."
raisingkids,3aixbu,JoytotheUniverse,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:44:03 2015 UTC,Well said. Risky play hones decision-making skills and helps children build confidence in their own abilities.

We got married, I didn't want to get married but I figured it was best for the tiny human. My wife and I make a good team. That is enough for me right now. We are raising our child in a 2 parent house and I think that it has a lot of advantages over single parent. There are certain things that I can't and don't want to teach my daughter. Their are things that my wife cannot impart onto my daughter that I can. It's not impossible for you to raise a child alone, it is just easier when you have help.

I think raising a child alone can be done, but I was raised by an alcoholic who was also co dependent so my childhood was severely lacking. I didn't want that for my child. I can only say this works for me and probably not for many people. If you have the means and are emotionally healthy I say go for it."

raisingkids,3a21im,twoVices,3,Tue Jun 16 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"They have two children together. They are legally domestic partners for  insurance/simplicity sake, but they are both essentially asexual and don't have a romantic relationship. They live in a large house with two master suites and each have their own room. They share parenting responsibilities, decision, finances, etc when it comes to their kids. They both kind of do their own thing. They're friendly with each other, and do ""family"" dinner a couple of times a week, but aside from that, they live fairly separate lives like roommates that share a pet (I know that's a poor comparison, but I can't find a better one)."

I want to hear about these experiences so I can make a very informed decision.
raisingkids,3a21im,SuperDadMan,2,Tue Jun 16 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"I have a few thoughts about this. I think that this works because those people are asexual. If you could NEVER see yourself getting attached to this partner through your child then it might work. See the movie Friends with Kids to see a Hollywood version of 2 people who made a kid and lived with it without being romantic and dating other people. Also just hilarious as the movie is really what it's like having kids. But also, not saying that everyone HAS to get married but would you be ok with your child growing up in a home where the ""parents"" weren't affectionate with each other? What they see growing up shapes and molds them for their future relationships. Just like I wouldn't advise having a kid live in a house where the parents hated each other, this may not be best either."

They spend whole family time, and the spend single parent family time just like most families.   I should note, the other reply says that this personally works because they are asexual. I said essentially, but they are not entirely so. My friend (the mom) occasionally has sex with her fwb outside the home, and her ""husband"" does too, although not frequently. They're both very independent people whose lives aren't don't revolve around sex, I guess.  I find their situation pretty fascinating, although I would probably prefer the reverse situation.

I've dated so many fantastic women who on paper are amazing and I know would make great mothers, but for some reason (I know it's a character flaw), I have a difficult time committing to a single person.  Fidelity has never been an issue and never will be, but I just can't see myself with one woman forever."
raisingkids,3a21im,WWLadyDeadpool,13,Tue Jun 16 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"I was going to respond to your post, but I read this response and just wanted to make the point...it's really important to get to the bottom of this.  The ultimate commitment is parenthood, and I know you know this because it's obvious, but you can't just decide one day to not love or be with your kids anymore.  I would definitely seek counseling and root out that issue to make sure it won't affect you as a parent.  That being said, I'm a single dad.  It wasn't REALLY by choice, and when I say that, I mean I wish that my children's mom had been the person I thought she was and that we were living happily together.  However, I have two wonderful children, and the only thing about it that I hate is the time that my child is with his mother.  Parenthood just isn't designed to be part time.  It would just be better for him if we were together and I spend a lot of time and energy trying to make up for that in my son's life so it affects him as little as possible.  But I AM happy as a single dad, and my children are happy.  This takes a lot of effort as a single parent.  However, with the right support (like close aunts or grandmothers for daughters to have available) it's definitely doable.    The reason single parenting gets such a bad rap is because of the risk factors.  In my situation, I address those individually to make sure this unplanned for reality doesn't hurt my kids.  However, in reality, most of these risks are associated with lower income, something that you seem to have covered.  Kids from single parent homes are also more likely to have psychological issues, but again, that's from a COMBINATION of factors that we just happen to see a lot with single parents.  If you've eliminated these factors, they shouldn't affect your children.  Personally, I'm about 6 months shy of my psychology degree and obviously, in my situation, I've focused a lot on the effects of one-parent households and remediating issues that can arise...And my position is, as long as you're aware of and addressing all risk factors, it's absolutely possible to raise children in a happy, healthy home as a single parent."

raisingkids,3a21im,geomu,3,Tue Jun 16 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"I would actually recommend old versions of textbooks.  Child development textbooks for psychology students are best, and you can get pretty much the same thing that is in the current $150 version for $10 on Ebay.  Here's one I definitely suggest:Book   In general, lifespan or childhood development books.  If you're concerned with possible issues single households, you'll likely be able to find more specialized textbooks as well as research articles on Google Scholar.  Elaborating on hating my child's time with his mother, here's the thing:  If you put aside all personal feelings and biases about who it's better for your child to be with, and assume the other parent would 100% make the same decisions for your child that you would, you're still left with some issues.  My son spends about 30% of his time away from my home.  He hates it.  He considers me his primary parent.  In EVERY split family situation, ONE of the parents is going to be that parent, and it's hard on the child to be away from them.  I also miss out on 1/2 of my son's experiences.  Theme parks, vacations, etc.  But worse than all of that is the heartbreak you feel when your house is not whole for 3-4 days at a time.    My point is, although I realize it's necessary to foster a good relationship with the other parent involved here, the only contention in either of our lives surrounds that one part of our lives that involves the other parent...So in your proposed scenario, I'd count not having a split family situation as a major blessing."

raisingkids,3a21im,Flewtea,3,Tue Jun 16 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"Just made a bunch of edits like right after saving this post, so if you see this sentence, you may want to skim over everything again to catch the places I added stuff.  We don't have kids yet, but hopefully this year, if everything works out.  Things might not-- we're in a bit of a gray area right now, more on that further down.  We started trying for a baby this January, and I got pregnant within a few months and then had a miscarriage.  My body is not physically ready to start trying for at least a few more months.  In addition to bio kids, we are intent on adopting together (foster system, not international).  We're interested in adopting teen boys because we know they have some of the hardest times finding good families.  Ever since my first boyfriend as an adult, I didn't want to remain monogamous.  Yes, the sex was a big part of it, but more so, I had a hard time distinguishing between the love I felt for someone who was officially my SO and the varying kinds of love I feel for other people in my life.  I didn't feel like my love was finite, that I could be in love with multiple people at the same time, and that this was inevitable, because I knew from my adolescence that the love I felt for my platonic friends was often intense enough to be ""almost"" a relationship.  Had a hard time articulating it.  Told guys I just wanted open relationships.  Was involved with one particular person for several years when I fell deeply in love with someone else.  I immediately came clean to both of them.  ""I love both of you.  I want to be with both of you.  Please can we make this work.""  Lots of pain.  Original guy couldn't take not being my one and only (though I was adamant from the beginning that that wouldn't happen), and left the picture.    Several years later, I'm still with the second guy.  I had some sexually traumatizing experiences mixed in with all this, and maybe because of that trauma, I just haven't been sexually attracted to anyone but my current partner for the first couple of years.  Didn't want to pursue anything with anyone else.    Current partner was adamantly against being one of my several partners at first, like totally against it.  It became kind of a nonissue when the first guy I was with was gone.  So we had a pretty regular, mono relationship for about a year.  And then one day out of the blue he goes, ""You know how we were talking about open relationships...""  So we decided to try that again.  I explained to him I just wasn't attracted/interested in anyone at all, but that philosophically I was still all for polyamory.  I encouraged him to read some books (good ones on Amazon, just search them... polyamory is a huge world!), blogs, anything.  Just to get a handle on what to expect.  He's a bit hard headed and did not.  He went ahead with exploring sex with some of his good girlfriends with whom there had been obvious sexual tension for years.  Unfortunately he still wore a lot of guilt and shame from mainstream romance culture, and went about doing things as if he were cheating, even though he had my enthusiastic consent.  He was sneaky, he was not honest to the other girls, it was horrible, horrible.  Lots of tears were had, lots of fights and drama.  It took at least a year for me to be fully open and comfy with him again after that.  That was two years ago.  Now we're looking into opening the relationship again.  We're using online dating.  It's been fun to help him make a profile and give him advice on how to flirt with different people.  I'm starting to feel more healed from my trauma and can now actually picture myself being emotionally and sexually intimate again, so that's something I'm going to be looking more into.  I'm also attracted to women in addition to men (and people in between), and though I've had sex with women before, I've started to crave womanly company very intensely, and I think that the next person I fall in love with may probably be a woman.  I love my guy.  We have a very intense relationship.  Things have been shaky since around the miscarriage a few months ago.  We both kind of have things on hold right now.  We are dealing with relocation and major career changes for both of us, so we're like, let's just live, put our relationship on a slight back burner until things are settled in a few weeks, and that's when we'll talk.  We'll sit down to have a Big Talk soon.  Things may get shaken up.  Maybe we'll break up.  I don't know.  We both feel satisfied with our lives and what we've learned from the relationship so far.  I don't see myself being with one person forever, so if this relationship ends up fizzling out, I think we'll both cope inordinately well.  But we have small business together and work together absolutely unbelievably well when it comes to creative/financial things.  I would like him to be my life partner, continue for us to be tied in finance/career/joint property, and at the same time go out and live our lives as well.  A lot of our friends have been popping out babies since we've been together, and I occasionally work with children/infants/pregnant ladies, so we talk about babies and parenting a lot.  We are ideologically aligned in a lot of ways when it comes to parenting, and we've even voiced that, even if we were no longer romantically involved, we both would feel really good about coparenting together.  We both really really really want kids very very soon.  I think the main thing is that, what with working together and living together for the past few years, we're just burning out from 24/7/365 intense contact.  We also have been living in a small apartment with way too many roommates for our entire relationship, and we're both strong introverts, so I think once we move into the new house and have our own bedrooms, things might change drastically.  Our current living situation is extremely stressful for both of us and makes it difficult for either of us to cope with like... anything.  We have spoken a lot recently about breaking up.  We've decided even if we break up, we'll go ahead with this house/move we've been planning, and transition organically into being platonic roommates.  Things are good.  I love that I am able to be honest in my relationship and not have to hide things like having doubts about our relationship.  Even if we decide not to be romantically involved, we have each others' backs and will support one another through whatever comes next.  And I think a lot of that is intertwined with the radical honesty that is integral to successful poly.    Another thing I wanted to add, one of our current roommates is a good friend of mine with whom I've kind of had a poly relationship...  we were in our late teens/early twenties when we hung out a lot, and we had tons of sex, said ""I love you"" a lot, looked out for each other, slept over at each others' places most nights... but we were firmly NOT in a relationship, ever.  We both had other relationships throughout the time.  What I'm realizing now is that we just didn't have the communication in place to establish a clear poly relationship, but that is in essence what we were acting on.  Anyway this guy is one of our roommates now, and we (my SO and I and him) always joke about orgies, etc., and there is definitely a sexual attraction/tension, but he has a girlfriend right now who would not handle that well, and I love her and respect her so it's all been very clean and I wouldn't approach him like that.  Still, it's nice to be living with my boyfriend AND a friend who I've been extremely sexual with, and both of them being cool with it, and being able to spend time with each of them in different bedrooms and seek out the energy and person I need when I need it.  It's opened my mind to the fact that I would really like to have a big house full of happy adults in love with each other, and who come together as a ""village"" to raise kids.  I truly believe in that ideology.  I may join an already established intentional living community one day.  In the grand scheme of things, we're not poly experts or anything.  The sidebar and posts in /r/polyamory are really truly great.  The community there will walk you through your confuzzled thoughts if you're first opening yourself to being poly.  Also here is an excellent TED talk I saw just the other day:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtdsZ8B7JQY  And here's a teaser for a trailer for a FFM poly family.

Because the last option has the potential for a lot of drama.  To me, the biggest issue is relationships after you have the kid.  Look at the complaints people have about step kids-some are legitimate, some just complain their spouse hasn't kicked their 18 year old kid out yet.  Besides those sort of conflicts though, going into it from a place of stability, after thinking about how you want to do things, I'm sure you'll be a great dad."

He acted cool to start but he got tired of the work pretty quickly.  According to my mom, he wanted kids, so maybe he was mad that she didn't want more.  A lot of people feel like the first thing they need to do with step kids is teach them some discipline.  Do you mostly date Indian women? If this is a cultural issue, do you think that's going to cause you problems?"
raisingkids,3a21im,kazetenshu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"I know this is a personal question, but do you mind elaborating on your experience as a step kid?  Did it have any residual effects on your adult self?    As far as the discipline goes, do you think the desire to teach some discipline is due to different parenting styles or do you think it's just hard to raise a disciplined child as a single parent?    I currently do mostly date Indian women, though that wasn't the case before.  I probably need to talk to more Indian people about this, but I don't believe it's an issue in our current, more progressive generation."
raisingkids,3a21im,Round_Feet,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone has different parenting styles, so, a lot of people think their SO isn't raising their kids right, or they should have a say, but that's a big change for the kids.  I can't say how bad he was though because my mother clearly hadn't talked to him about appropriate discipline, so he thought it was OK to hit us, we disagreed, and a lot of times we fought like he was the third kid in the house.  Dad's GF was about the same, too.  I moved out senior year, dropped out of HS, and at 29 I still didn't graduate college, so I'm sure a stable home life would have resulted in a better educational life, but that's also from having a screwed up mother, I'm sure it would've been just as bad if my parents had been married to one another.  You may need to decide how you feel about dating progressive women. Is there anything you think you'll lose by not being with a more traditional woman?"

I just know that she mentions this everytime we talk about determining how to celebrate holidays and birthdays, what food we choose to feed our kids, wither or not she will allow her kid to play football (american football). That kind of stuff. Doing it solo was not an intentional choice on her end to begin with, but due to drama, threats and restraining orders the father has not been a part of the kids life since it was about a year old."
raisingkids,3a21im,jules0072,2,Tue Jun 16 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"Having kids is so much work that you will need help, especially in the first year, where you will get no sleep if you try to do it by yourself (you get very little even with the help).  Can you make that sacrifice if you're on the way to a high-paying career?  Maybe your parents want to help, and that would make a big difference, but don't think you can do this completely alone.  One very important thing to note: your child will be missing the most important nutrition of her life: breast milk.  All the literature I've seen (and I read a lot while my wife was pregnant with our two daughters) says that children who are breastfed have significantly better health and life outcomes than those who receive formula.  Do yourself and future child a favor and consider your motivations for having a child.  If you want to raise a child in the best environment possible, you will wait until you have a stable home where she can depend on two (or more, with grandparents involved) adults who love her.  If you are considering this for selfish reasons, you will fail as a parent."

Even though I am a health professional, this is not something that men think about often.  You bring up a very critical aspect of raising a child and it's definitely something I should put more thought into.  Maybe that's an indication that I'm not ready to have a kid any time soon haha!  Responses like this is why Reddit is such an amazing place to ask questions.    You also brought up the idea of having kids for selfish reasons?  What types of reasons would constitute being selfish? One of the main reasons I want to raise a kid on my own is that I'm very opinionated about the end goals for my children and I don't want that to be colored by a mother that may not be on the same page.  But I suppose robbing a child of a second parent could be seen as selfish"

And what if the kids themselves don't want to conform to your rigid ""end goals""?  I don't think you having kids would be a good idea if you're just doing it to produce an end product. Children are people, not widgets.  ""I can't compromise with an adult"" does not lend itself to rearing children well.  Edit: Reading some of your other responses. Holy fuck, do not do this."

I want them to be good people that are productive members of society.  I don't want to have children for the sake of having children, or just to pass on my genes.  I've just seen a lot of seemingly good people be shitty mothers.  Fortunately I have great mom, but have an irrational fear of being involved with a sub-par mom.    And while I do appreciate you being honest because it helps me look at myself more objectively, I do not appreciate ""Holy fuck, do not do this.""

Rigid is ""I demand that my children become doctors, and I'll disown them if they don't"". Rigid is ""My son will become an NFL quarterback even if it kills him"".  No woman is going to interfere with your desire to have good children who participate in society. This shouldn't be one of your majors motivations to become a single father.  Can I ask why you do want children? ""I think I'd be good at it"" makes it seen like you're just doing it as something to show off to other people, or because you feel like you should.  My ""holy fuck, do not do this"" was in response to the fact that you seem determined to produce elite, globetrotting children who can speak more languages than they have friends. I can't imagine a more miserable way to grow up - and the fact that you even acknowledge this and ask if the tradeoff of your child's happiness for their cultural upbringing is ""worth it"" just baffles me.  I'm also a bit curious as to how much time you've spent around children."

Due to taking a fall wrong, my husband broke his thumb, suddenly propelling me into the necessity of commuting the kids to/from daycare daily. Yesterday we stopped for me to learn how to get gas for the first time--those pumps are fiddly--and had to wait for my husband to walk over and join us. When I explained what we were doing, my four-year-old scoffs.  ""MomMY, it's easy. You just open the blue circle, push the buttons, take the thingy and put in the circle and hold it, then it goes bang, you put it back and close the blue circle.""  I about died laughing, because yes, that's it, but not the part at all I didn't know (how to get the pump thing out--the one here, as I mentioned, is very stiff and needs to be moved just right to come out).

raisingkids,39k3gq,mdtTheory,11,Fri Jun 12 07:42:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly think a curriculum is unnecessary at this age and possibly even inappropriate. I think you should investigate the research surrounding introducing structured academics to children. Since you're scientifically inclined you might be interested in studies of long term academic achievement and it's correlation with early academic involvement. There is intriguing scientific evidence that introducing structured academics before the age of 7 is quite likely ineffective and possibly harmful. At 20 months particularly free play and exploration is the best way for your child to expand their understanding. Things like head start seem to be effective in leveling the playing field for kids who don't have high quality interactions with care givers, but attention, and interaction one on one with a bonded care giver is still the best avenue for learning in young children."
raisingkids,39k3gq,Craftywitchy,2,Fri Jun 12 13:05:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the well written and thoughtful response.  Perhaps I left a little too much up for interpretation; I thought it was reasonable to assume that curriculum for such a young child would be loose.  Perhaps 'curriculum' is not even the word I'm looking for.  I can see why you're concerned.     interaction one on one with a bonded care giver is still the best avenue for learning in young children.   Interaction has a very broad meaning.  I believe what you are saying is the most important component is that interaction exists and much less so what type of interaction takes place.  If so, that's basically where my wife and I currently are.  We talk, read, play games, run around, etc.  However, it seems obvious that one could take a step further by being conscious of what our child knows as well as what makes sense for our child to learn next and use that knowledge to guide the interactions with our child.  More specifically, we are looking for structure for -us-.  What makes sense?  A list of activities, if you will, that we could do together that my wife and I see as structured but our child sees as fun.  There is so much noise out there so I came here for some guidance.  Everyone wants to tell you what worked for their child, their grandchildren, themselves; or sell you a book, a subscription, etc."

raisingkids,39k3gq,Craftywitchy,2,Fri Jun 12 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"I think the type of interaction is actually very important, but that the best type is the kind practiced naturally between attentive parents and children.  That would mostly consist of talking, lots of talking, narration of your activities and observations while inviting the child to participate as a conversation partner.  Reading books to your child, singing songs and playing games.  Working on tactile amusements: painting, using play do, playing with water or sand or piles of beans, playing with blocks.  And imaginative play: pretending to cook while the parents pretend to eat, pretending to be animals, you get the idea.  And time to practice their play skills with other children.  Basically everything you're doing already. These natural feeling games and conversations are tremendously productive. I'd encourage you, if you haven't already, to read some of John Taylor Gatto's books. I know he's a bit radical for some people but he talks a lot, and convincingly I think, about the innate curiosity of young children and the natural resistance children (and many adults)  have to anyone meddling in our learning process. I'm not an ""unschooler"" philosophically, but Teach Your Own really changed how I thought about teaching and learning."

raisingkids,39k3gq,123middlenameismarie,2,Fri Jun 12 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"I think you have gotten some good suggestions. I would add that to decide what to teach you need to figure out your baseline- or a bit more about what your child knows. There are some developmental inventories out there and the AAP has a checklist for 2 yrs. I am not suggesting that you focus on every item on the checklist but it is so easy to focus in on one area of development and ""miss"" important things- this should solve that problem. Even taking notes about the language and words your child uses and comparing them over time should help you plan activities and monitor progress.  I also thought you might appreciate this site- http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/findwhatworks.aspx It reviews programs based on strict guidelines for research.

I remember my mom telling me about volunteering at my little brother's school when he was in kindergarten (he's 11 years younger than me), and that there were kids that didn't know any colors, any letters, how to count. Whether because their parents were shitty or were completely absent from the kids' lives, they started off school super behind, and probably remained there the rest of their lives. And then you realize something like Sesame Street can impart these lessons on kids, and all parents had to do was be able to afford a tv and actually turn it on to that channel. Really remarkable.

raisingkids,39273x,tomahachi_12,5,Mon Jun 8 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"One compromise would be a base amount of time, and any additional time must be earned. My parents did not give any ""base"" time and it all had to be earned.  My parents (this is back in the 80's, and my poison was Nintendo) instituted something of a token economy. Various additional chores (beyond what I normally did) earned ""points"".   There were some always-available things like shoveling snow during winter or picking up sticks/pinecones from the yard, or mopping the kitchen floor, and off-the-cuff chores made up on the spot were usually ""how many points can I get if I do x"".   I had to hand in 50 points the night before and I was able to have access for the next day only, and could be rescinded if behavior did not warrant the privilege. That being said, you should have minecraft installed on a machine that only you manage, and you provide her access to that machine for the specified time.  To be clear, I had regular daily and weekly chores that included scrubbing the toilet, vacuuming the living room, and making a side or a salad for every dinner. My siblings and I all had similar, but age-appropriate tasks that were written down and had particular constraints for completion. If regular chores were not completed, you couldn't hand in points until they were done, but additional privileges (TV, internet, desserts, going out with friends, etc.) were progressively taken away.   They key, however, is to be the adult, write down the expectations and give her a copy. Explain them and stick to them. Perhaps offer a review of these rules in a month or two with her and allow minor modifications if things aren't working or prove too difficult to enforce consistently.  You may want to make a guest wireless network on your router that you shut off to help you enforce the rules."

He's enabled by my sister and parents who will buy him fast food at nearly every occasion there is to eat. It's killing my budget (I can't afford to pay $6-7 for dinner for one person every night), and with more bills than I can imagine right now, it's getting really unfeasible, really fast.   I've tried to talk with my family about it, and while they agree with my argument (he's 10lbs overweight, not eating enough of the right foods), it turns into a fight when I'm ""starving"" my son when I refuse to get him fast food.   As of right now, he will eat the following:  *Chicken nuggets/tenders  *French fries  *Chocolate donuts  *yogurt  *bread (toasted only)  *pizza (cheese only)  *pancakes (homemade only, won't eat box mix)  *milk  *cookies (chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin, must be homemade)  *doritos  *Pretzels  *tortillas  *chicken quesadillas (chicken, tortilla, monterey)  *Vitamins, calcium chewies, and Barlean's Fish Oil for kids, lemon flavor  I got him to finally try Sunbutter, which he really liked. He's tried carrots and lettuce, but won't eat them on a regular basis.  I've tried to just make something for dinner for us, but it turns into a screaming banshee of ""I WANT WEN-DY'S"" for over an hour... and god forbid he misbehaves and the ice cream man comes by and he's told he can't have ice cream..  I'm nearing my wits' end, and I just don't know what to do. My parents are NOT willing to help more than agree at first and try to turn it against me later, and my sister isn't much better. My fiance has been really good with getting the kid to try new food, but he doesn't live with us and is here on an irregular basis.

However, after my second, who is so much pickier than my first, I have had to let a lot of stuff go. What I would do is try and sneak veggies into any meal you can. Try and switch out chicken nuggets for veggie nuggets. Sweet potato fries for regular ones and do it slowly. My second rarely eats vegetables but will gladly suck down any homemade juice I have made him which always has veggies in it. Try and make as much as you can homemade, even his favorites to break the cycle of fast food. It's addictive, we all know it. Like any junkie you have to wean him slowly. However, if your family is going to enable him they do need consequences. This is your child's life and it's serious. But ultimately it's up to you. It's your fight and when you pick a fight that means something you need to make sure to win it. I hope that helps."

For our daughter, we require her to try everything on the table.  That means at least one bite.  If she doesn't then she doesn't get dessert.   Maybe you can reserve the sweets for just dessert.  Start there.  Then once he used to only having sweets at dessert time, implement the you have to try it rule.  ""Just one bite of this and you can have dessert"".  He'll probably hate everything at first, but I've read a kid usually has to try a new food several times before they will start liking it, so the thing is to get them to a state where they have an open mind and will try things without throwing a fit.  Maybe try with each meal to have one healthy thing - I think cut up fresh veggies and fruit are a good place to start - sweet peppers, carrots, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, grapes, melon, blueberries, etc.  Have some vegetable or fruit at every meal and put it on his plate so he can get used to the idea."

raisingkids,38d647,sleepingshouldbeeasy,2,Wed Jun 3 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"Another article mixing useful ideas with harmful ones.   Child proofing and having somewhat age-appropriate expectations is useful.   Expecting toddlers to not make a mess and punishing them with time outs when they do is useless at best ... Confusing for a child and harmful for the relationship.   Toddlers are not ready for self-control. They are driven by curiosity, the need to play, explore, being close etc. their drives and actions happen TO them.   Also, punitive time-outs while somewhat efficient in obtaining temporary obedience and possibly satisfying a parents' need for fairness/understanding, are extremely harmful as they destroy the unconditional bond between parent and child.   A helpful time-out is one where the parent interrupts a situation to give the child full attention, listening and embraces their whole being with loving, approving attention, encouraging emotional self-expression and supporting whatever is alive and true for the child. This enforces the bond and helps the child deal with the situation/emotions at hand.   This is a time-out serving the child, not forcing the child into obedience of another's agenda regardless of the child's needs. It's important to know the difference."
raisingkids,38d647,obviousoctopus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:16:52 2015 UTC,"Time outs are a perfectly reasonable way to handle a tantrum. They are a natural consequence of the child displaying anti-social behavior. You can certainly try to avoid them with the strategies you mention, but it's just not possible to do it all the time. And just like a toddler isn't ready for self control, they also aren't ready for complex emotional reasoning. You cannot expect that they will learn to deal with their emotions if they are not taught that they should.   We try to be as patient and caring as possible, but sometimes the weirdest things set off a kid. Cookie not perfectly circular. Watermelon in the wrong tray. Toy not in the box. Really wants the scissors. Asked 18 times for a different snack because grapes are worse than apples today. Wants the crayon but not that crayon but a MARKER OMG DAD. MELTDOWN CITY.   In these situations it is perfectly appropriate to say, listen, the way you are acting right now says you are frustrated and can't be around me right now. You're kicking and hurting. I know you don't mean to so I'm going to help you out with a short time out. I'll be back in a few minutes to see if you're ready to progress.   Additionally, I don't buy that toddlers aren't ready for consequences in general. Simple time outs as a consequence for non-tantrum behavior that isn't generally socially appropriate (crying to get what they want, screaming, etc) seems appropriate to me. The message is simple: in the company of other people we do not do those things, so if you are going to persist in doing them, the consequence is no people will be around.   You're going to have to cite some evidence if you want to argue that time outs are generally harmful. They've been very effective for us when used as natural consequences for behaviors described above."
raisingkids,38d647,thaen,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:35:26 2015 UTC,"I think ""extremely harmful"" and ""destroys unconditional bond"" are a stretch. Constant sustained neglect and abuse over years is what destroys unconditional bonds between parents and children, not punitive timeouts for misbehaving toddlers in loving homes.  You hit someone you're removed from the scene of the crime. You scream and yell at me about wanting chocolate while I'm making dinner, you're not allowed to stay. I will validate their feelings, but people, regardless of their age don't get to yell and scream and hit. That's my line in the sand. Our fellow humans deserve respect, me included. It's not disrespectful to ask someone behaving inappropriately to leave. And yes, these time outs were usually (but not always) followed up by a discussion  or questions like ""me saying no to you wanting chocolate right before dinner made you mad. Can you think of a better way to handle this next time""   Arguments can be made that the more gentle ways are ideal, I know this. But I'm done with ideal when it comes to parenting and am perfectly happy with ""good enough"". My kids are well past the toddler stage but from all reports, and from my observations, they're very well adjusted little people. And yes, they were subjected to ""punitive time-outs"" back in the day. Funnily enough, now at 6.5 and 5, I can't even remember when they last were put in a time-out; it's probably been years, perhaps because they were socialized to learn appropriate behaviour."

I'm on my phone and will (lazily) reply with a link to an article instead of addressing your points one by one, which they deserve.   Please take a look and let me know what you think. I will likely come back and try to be more detailed.   Here's the link to the article:  http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/peter_haiman.html  Here's an excerpt specifically addressing the harmfulness of time outs:  Lifelong Effects of Frequent Time-out  For the frustrated and uncomfortable child, time-out offers enforced silence and the feeling of being rejected by one's parents. A youngster who misbehaves and then is given time-out feels hurt. This hurt, combined with the frustration that caused the youngster to misbehave, gives birth to anger. And discipline practices like time-out, which create hurt and anger, can harm a child.  Note: the article uses language like ""mis-behaving"" and ""tantrums"" (if I remember correctly) white which language I disagree. Imo the issue lies with framing normal and innocent child behavior as somehow bad or inappropriate. I will expand on this later though."
raisingkids,38d647,obviousoctopus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment. I read the article. Here's the thing, I don't disagree with what he's saying. He makes some good points.   Our house is a very peaceful place and we're all are very positive and rarely punitive. I guess that child centred parenting just doesn't jive with my overall philosophy of life. In our house we're more of community and family centred type people.    A youngster who misbehaves and then is given time-out feels hurt. This hurt, combined with the frustration that caused the youngster to misbehave, gives birth to anger.    I don't really care if my kid is angry or hurt because they acted inappropriately. I will validate my kid's feelings but in the end, their feelings are their own.  Take the example of hitting. My youngest as a toddler used to hit her older sister. We're talking about a 2 year old hitting a 3.5 year old, so both very young. It only happened for a brief period of time but it happened a lot.  Giving the hitter attention while the victim is cowering is not my idea of fair and taking that approach just created more chaos and competition for my attention in the aftermath of a hitting episode.   Our solution: The hitter is moved away from the situation (punitive time-out) and is basically told, ""Hitting hurts. You cannot be around people if you're going to hurt them."" and the victim gets attention. She is reassured and protected. After everyone has calmed down and the victim feels safe, I go and talk to the hitter, problem solve with her and figure out with her why she's hitting (in our case it was usually about wanting something that the other had that she didn't want to give up). Hitting is normal toddler behaviour, but acting out physically toward other people is unacceptable at any age.   Having it suggested that the occasional time out from positive reinforcement in an otherwise happy, loving and positive home is harmful to kids is doesn't make any sense to me. I believe in the resilience of character of little people. They are not so fragile that a bit of anger and hurt is going to harm them and I'm not so insecure to think that they will doubt my love for them if I discipline them.  I'm not saying that there aren't better / other ways to do this. I'm saying that this way was good enough, was simple for me to implement, and most importantly worked to stop the aggressive behaviour. After lots of experimentation on her part (with the same result of her not getting what she wanted and being moved away from the situation) and lots of problem solving on alternatives to hitting, I ended up with a 2 year old who would either come to me for help or work it out with her sister instead of hitting. I think that using time out from positive reinforcement in a positive loving household is just one of many perfectly valid approaches to socializing children."
raisingkids,38d647,Cbrantford,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:10:54 2015 UTC,"I can see that this is a topic close to your heart and would like to emphasize that I am not seeking to criticize your parenting practices or values. This exchange shows me how important your children are to you, and what I am hoping is to open more possibilities for you as a parent and possibly enrich your toolbox.   Having it suggested that the occasional time out from positive reinforcement in an otherwise happy, loving and positive home is harmful to kids is doesn't make any sense to me. I believe in the resilience of character of little people. They are not so fragile that a bit of anger and hurt is going to harm them and I'm not so insecure to think that they will doubt my love for them if I discipline them.   Yes, kids are incredibly resilient. The history of parenting practices (see Parenting for a Peaceful World by Robin Grille), and many of us being functioning members of society, are a testimonial to that.   I would like to suggest that punitive action as a behavior adjusting strategy is successful in the short run, but has serious drawbacks. And, I will offer alternatives.  First, the pros and cons of punitive action (time-outs, punishment of any kind, and praise/rewards of any kind, as withholding praise and rewards is a punishment to someone who desires them).  Pros of using punishment:   works quickly, the behavior usually stops right away it is efficient, doesn't take a lot of energy or time the recipient immediately knows that something's wrong behavior may change (in the short run) as the punished party knows that if they are caught, they will be punished again feel free to add more, I think these are the main ones   Cons:   does not address the reasons for the behavior, just makes it very expensive/painful. If a child is thirsty and keeps asking for water, and we punish them, they may stop asking but will still be thirsty. Similarly, ""thirst"" for attention, or exploration (climbing on things, touching things etc.), or play and fun (being loud, ""bugging"" a sibling or an adult...) are legitimate needs. Punishing their expression does not address the needs. And yes, there are legitimate needs behind hitting, too. it is not a natural consequence. A natural consequence comes from nature. Being tired after not getting enough sleep is a natural consequence.  Being punished for not going to bed is a man-made consequence, or punishment. Human children have brains more complex than the brains of the rats and birds used to establish behavioral psychology. Applying ""positive reinforcement"" to pets is a great idea. Programming ""automatic reactions"" in human beings is not the best approach, supporting learning and intelligence by understanding is better. Pets do not leave the house when they are 18, children do. Works only for as long as the threat exists. The lesson is, ""don't get caught"", along with ""don't trust the police."" Teaches that ""if you want to change another's behavior, hurting them is a viable option."" As you've noticed, children learn most from experience and observation. They are smart, resilient and wired for success. So, they'll focus on what works. Ultimately, hurting others works, but has a lot of cons :) Changes the relationship. The parent is now the police. Have you had a police car pull behind you? You know you're doing everything right, but there's a certain feeling present. They may or may not be running your plates. They may or may not pull  you over. And of course, you should never talk to the police. Or if you do, you start censoring yourself because you are no longer safe. When punished, one feels resentment, and does not magically have a stronger desire to understand and improve the situation. So, the learning potential is not very high.   But what could work better than punishment?  Well, that's a topic in itself, and I already produced a wall of text. So, again, I will lazily link to an article.  Before I provide the link, here are a few directions:   Question the ""inappropriateness"" of the behavior. What is the child really trying to do, from their viewpoint? Is this child developmentally ready to take control of their actions and make rational decisions? Some people still believe babies should not be fed when crying out of hunger, because ""it spoils them, they'll learn to manipulate the mother."" How many other outrageously ignorant beliefs from old times do parents still carry without questioning? Honestly look for the driving forces behind it. Is the child hitting? Why are they right to hit? Why is hitting the best option they have right now? What pain or suffering drove them to that? How do I address the cause, so that the behavior no longer arises? If they need to hit, can I give them a doll instead? (this is a practice suggested in Naomi Aldort's Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves)   Here's the link to an article addressing toddler behavior and offering multiple approaches.   http://naomialdort.com/articles14.html"

Since she started talking, and taking back, I've been mostly annoyed by her because of deep depression. In fact, this time last year I was in the hospital. Last night she asked to cuddle, and we had a nice chat and snuggle until her bedtime. I felt like I truly loved her for HER and not simply because I was supposed to.   My therapist is talking about discharging me soon, and all she's doing now is weaning me off therapy. I'll check in with her about twice a year, but I've made so much improvement that my appointments are 5-6 weeks apart now."

raisingkids,37vns7,sadcoffee,6,Sun May 31 00:00:29 2015 UTC,"This may be a natural part of development for a child but parents need to react swiftly and with proper disciplinary measures so the proper boundaries can be set early on.  Manage the behavior immediately, the feelings can be discussed afterward when the emotions settle and there is a teachable moment.      Bottom line, if something is truly ""unacceptable"" it needs to be managed accordingly.  Have a backbone and react like a true parent/guardian, not a friend, for the sake of the child's proper understanding."

raisingkids,37ppb0,cptmauli,2,Sat May 30 11:21:09 2015 UTC,"The article is meant to discuss child development with national experts and help parents determine developmentally-appropriate milestones.

raisingkids,37ppb0,cptmauli,2,Sat May 30 12:29:02 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the article disappoints in that regard. It doesn't give you some milestones with some guidelines how to judge when it can be expected that a child can do X (at least thats what I would have expected given the headline).  Of course each child is different, but the ages in the article are just ridiculous. How are they going to achieve independence if even at 14 they have to check in (by phone) at every step of their way?  In my opinion this is the exact opposite of free range parenting."
raisingkids,37ppb0,Jbird8282,2,Sat May 30 12:36:04 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. The ages were taken from national experts on childhood development stages. The sources are quoted. What I didn't include in the article is the developmental recommendation that no child should explore alone before age ten. You can find the recommendations on their website. The article is meant to help those struggling with letting go of the reigns and meeting these parents in the middle. My daughter is the 14-yr-old I wrote about in the article. We live in an urban area.  She has the freedom to explore the city but yes, I expect her to check in. Even when I was a child I was to call my dad when I got home from school. It establishes responsibility and encourages communication and common courtesy with who you share a home with. There's no way my daughter was ready to stay home alone at 4-years-old.

raisingkids,37oefj,kellyholmes,4,Fri May 29 03:17:58 2015 UTC,"I have a daughter on the way (my first) my wife already has a son. I would very much like to teach this. As it is now the parents are the enforcers. When ""so and so isn't being fair/sharing"" every 5 mins you have 3 kids running up to you and its getting old pretty fast. If kids had to work it out on their own I feel they would mature so much faster. But really I have no idea."
raisingkids,37oefj,Solex159,4,Fri May 29 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"This is what I have always done. Forced ""sharing"" doesnt make any sense especially when I translate it to adult world situations:   I am not going to share my restaurant table until I am done. I dont have to share my lunch at the office when someone whines. I take my time in the washroom stall if I need to.   You start with encouraging them to use new rules. Hover a bit when they play. When A is enjoying a toy, say oh hey you're having fun, go ahead, you dont have to give B a turn until you're really, really done. For every micro second B isnt grabbing, give compliment. Ask A if he/she can provide alternative to B so A can play longer with it. Be very clear to B that he/she has her own that she's welcome to hog forever. When A abandons the toy eventually, say hold on, are you sure you are ready? Thank B for giving A time to regret his/her decision. When trade does finally happen, encourage the heck out of both.   This only needs to be done a few times. With toddlers their attention spans are SO short you can practice ten times in a half hour. Start doing this with your son first. When the daughter comes your son will be your ally in applying these rules to the younger.   Dont worry, children are naturally sympathetic creatures when the feelings are allowed to be nurtured organically. Like adults, we can really only truly share when we feel like we have more than enough and are able to get more later. It's not scarcity that breeds competition, it's the feeling of suddenly enforced scarcity."

And the kid with the toy says ""yeah, sure."" And they do their best to remember to pass it on. If they forget and put it away or just drop it somewhere, I'll point it out to the kid waiting. The waiting kid knows that they will get the toy shortly so they'll amuse themselves with something else till the toy is available.  We've always done it that way, it would never cross my mind to make them give up a toy just because another kid asked. Even a stranger. If a kid comes up and asks for something I say the same to them ""X is playing with the toy right now but he will give you a turn in a few minutes when he is finished"". If my kid takes a longer time than is reasonable, I say to him ""that kid is waiting so patiently for that toy, do you think it would be kind to give him a turn now and we can play with this toy together?"" I can't remember a time that it hasn't worked.  It's obviously not always that smooth but that's the general gist. Sometimes they need reminding of how to ask nicely but they always give up the toy within a few minutes."
raisingkids,37oefj,another_single_dad,2,Fri May 29 07:56:52 2015 UTC,"That's how we do things, and I think its a nice balance. Kids shouldn't have to immediately give up a toy because another kid wants it. But, I do want my kid to notice and care about the feelings of others. So, after a bit, it is nice to purposely give the other kid a turn. I then praise him for giving his friend a turn, and praise the other kid dor waiting patiently."

raisingkids,370dgy,cuzmonster,1 point,Wed May 27 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"Ideally, children should be helped with their brushing until they are 7 or 8 years old. Younger children do not have the motor skills to brush their teeth properly. Hygiene and brushing habits are formed early in life and your daughter is at the perfect age to start a lifetime of great dental hygiene habits.   A 3.5 year old usually wants to exhibit some independence and should be allowed to brush their teeth, but mom or dad need to help brush the child’s teeth with her toothbrush or with their helper toothbrush. Instead of taking the toothbrush out of the hand of a child, it works well to have a second helper toothbrush to make sure all the teeth are brushed. Depending on the child’s attitude to brushing, you may also have your child use your toothbrush to help you brush your teeth too. Make it a game, work together, have them do your front teeth.  Use an age appropriate toothbrush for your child and use children’s toothpaste.  It is very important to show and personally demonstrate your interest in oral health and hygiene to your children."

raisingkids,36pfee,ma3roof,11,Thu May 21 02:00:06 2015 UTC,"Adjust for her age but you can start with explaining your emotions, and that you let them get out of control. You don't have to give details but be honest, it can be as simple as ""When Joe spoke to me it made me very very angry.  So angry it made my body act before I could think. I don't like that I behaved that way, especially in front of you. I'm sorry if I upset or scared you. How do you feel about what happened?""   I'm sorry if this is oversimplified but I have a two and a half year old and my mind is stuck in that phase.  I was just reading something about how it's important to emphasise that it's not the child's fault even in situations where it is obvious to you that it wasn't that fault. I don't have a source to back it up though, sorry. But it's worth mentioning I think.   It's OK that you aren't perfect, you are human, you are not a bad person for doing this in front of your daughter. But it is important that you talk to her about it, and this talk (which may be several talks over time) will frame how she views dealing with her own emotions during conflict, and it will help her resolve any fear or anxiety created by the violence.  You can use this as a way to teach your daughter about the importance of self control, or using words and not violence.  Good luck, let her ask questions, answer then as honestly as you can, ask her how she is feeling about it. Try to take responsibility for your actions versus blaming him. She is focused on you, you are who she cares about, she may be worried for you or conversely have some fear of you. Assuage her fears and validate her feelings.   I hope this is helpful."

That situation sucks. I'm sorry you had to deal with it, but you dealt with it, and that's important. I hope her mother is safe and well too.   Everyone acts in the moment, sometimes for a good reason and sometimes not. How would you want your kid to act if she socked someone? Someone who didn't deserve it? Someone who did? And how do you know the difference? I think that's the behavior to model here.   Important things to cover might include 1) physical violence is never right, unless you have to protect yourself or someone you love, 2) you love her, and 3) you felt like you needed to protect her. Maybe ask her if she felt scared, if she thought she needed to be protected. If she has a different take, then this is a good chance for a conversation about her impression of mom's boyfriend. Maybe also tell her she can always call on you, an adult, or the police (911) if she feels in danger, and eventually when she's ready she can learn self defense and protect herself too.   If (a big if) the relationship with mom's boyfriend is important/if she is at all sympathetic with him/just if you want to, you might apologize to your daughter for losing your cool, and apologize to him with your daughter there.  This can show her that everyone acts out sometimes, but we can make it better and try harder in the future."

raisingkids,36pfee,Lupicia,3,Thu May 21 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"Good luck! I read somewhere that little kids think in terms of magic, not reality, so she might be worried about some weird things, like she might be worried you would hit other people or even her.   If you go with the message that you screwed up and hitting was wrong, I'd say equally go with the message that people sometimes make mistakes (even great daddies), but we can say sorry and then do something to make up for it, if they let us.

Doing this early will give you time for a run to the store when you identify what you forgot to pack.   Research what you can do in the area and have a few options each day.

raisingkids,35wyot,msandovalabq,8,Thu May 14 10:38:48 2015 UTC,"I never have the popular opinion on this sub but I'd like to question the first three points made in the article.   First, it's stated that sex feels good so you should just do it with any willing person. I've noticed there's an self fulfillment trend taking hold in many parts of the world and I'd like to propose the unpopular but potentially more gratifying ""self discipline"" idea. I'm a person of faith but even to those who aren't, where's the romance, or even the satisfaction, in getting what you want without having to work at it?   Second, the thought that you have to engage in sex to know if you're sexually compatible with a person. I have a big problem with this, not because of when a couple has sex, but rather the idea that sex is central to a successful relationship. Full disclaimer, I've only been married for 3 years. However, in that time I've not once felt that my entire relationship hinged on our sexual competency. Sure, sex feels good and is useful for starting a family but it's not the most important aspect of a relationship. Commitment to each other and a willingness to support your spouse should be above all else in my opinion.   Lastly, the concern that your partner deserves a ""well practiced"" sexual partner. Since when did we, in good conscience, marry for benefits? Along with that, why would anybody crave a more experienced sexual partner? I'd rather discover sex with another person than know we've both been around the bend too many times to count. Purposefully having as much sex as possible before marriage could also create associations that you'll regret later on. What you might have liked about one sexual partner could be the opposite of your future spouse which might cause the most important sexual relationship of your life to suffer.   I'm not trying to say abstinence is an effective method at preventing pregnancy. That's been disproven time and time again. I'm saying all of this from a perspective of personal satisfaction; I feel that waiting for what you want is more beneficial than instant gratification.   Let the downvotes commence."
raisingkids,35wyot,Beersyummy,3,Thu May 14 13:31:05 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the anti-abstinence stance. It's perfectly acceptable to wait until you're married to have sex. People paint this picture that your marriage is doomed to fail unless you're 100% sexually compatiable and, that's just not the case for everyone. Like most things, sex is something that will change and evolve in your relationship and you need to deal with it like anything else.   I love how open-minded some liberals (of which I am one) that demands their viewpoint be taken into consideration, but completely demeans the other viewpoint of the other person.   I personally have no problem with abstinence being taught ALONGSIDE other sex-education priniciples. Some people might want to remain abstinent until they're married. I'm not one of them, but it's a perfectly acceptable sexual choice."
raisingkids,35wyot,maelspln,3,Thu May 14 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"If I may chime in, here are my non faith based (just because I wasn't raised with any kind, not as commentary on your!) interpretation of the points she was making.  First, I don't think that she was necessarily saying that just because sex feels good that everyone should go out and have all the sex they want. More that sex is a natural part of human nature, not just to make a family. I'm on my phone but otherwise I would go find some backup (lazy, I know.) Sex is an important part of life and by acknowledging that simple fact it frees up a lot of things. So when she says it feels good and it is perfectly acceptable to do it with someone on the same page, she is removing the social stigma that has portrayed it as a bad thing. I read into it that sex acceptance is what leads to healthy decisions.   Second, sexual compatibility is important. She mentioned that she is a sex researcher, there is a lot of research that supports the fact that more sexually active couples experience greater satisfaction with their relationship in the long term. So while going into a relationship that is ""forever"" without having first tested the water, is iffy. Of course compatibility can be found after the fact, so this one isn't 100%. As a liberally sexual woman . I know what I like. I know where my boundaries are and what it takes. I wouldn't ever want to settle in without exploring all of that. And honestly I don't think it is possible to explore it all with only one person. Also just because one has a sexual past doesn't mean that there have to be regrets, if there are associations made it is by people that don't have the same morals. That doesn't mean that anyone has to judge themselves with the same moral compass. Luckily morals are subjective.  Third.... Marriage has always been for benefit. It just has different benefits over time. It used to be a means to attaining land power or alliances. The idea of marriage being for love is from the turn of the 19th century. So that being said I appreciate being able to be in a sexual relationship with someone that I don't have to teach, or enlighten. It's a rewarding this to be evenly matched and have wonderful sex, or switch it up and make love or get down an dirty. So I  like the fact that my partner and I have been around the bend. It doesn't make us bad people, just more well rounded as partners. I am in complete disagreeable with the second part of this point, mostly because having had quite a few different partners I can tell you that while it is different with each one, finding compatibility is what makes ""the most important sexual relationship"" not suffer. Knowing what compatibility is where experience really plays a part.   You aren't wrong, I just read the article differently. Sex isn't bad. That's her main point. It is part of getting to know a potential partner. Sexuality is a part of every aspect of human nature, acknowledging  that and teaching our children to respect it and themselves we can set the tone for acceptance and responsibility."
raisingkids,35wyot,msandovalabq,1 point,Thu May 14 18:16:54 2015 UTC,We definitely have different viewpoints on the matter but that's the great thing about discussion. I respect your opinions even though I don't personally agree. Your correction stating that marriage has benefits is absolutely correct. I guess what I meant is that I feel marriage should be a selfless act rather than seeking gain. This might be more of a personal opinion that doesn't follow tradition of old but so be it.   I'd be interested to hear why you believe morals are subjective. This was your only point that I really disagreed with and I'd like to hear your viewpoint.
raisingkids,35wyot,maelspln,1 point,Fri May 15 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I have found that my moral are vastly different than a lot of others. And if there was an objective moral system, how could that be? I have a strong sense of what is right and wrong. This is based on how I was taught, on experiences I've had and societal input. Do I feel that in general it is wrong to kill and steal? Of course! But, there are some situations where I would have to adjust that, if it came to the life of my children, I'm sure I'd do anything that on a normal day would repulse me.   If morals were objective I think that a lot of the struggles I've had would have been lessened. If my take on woman's sexuality and how I should be able to comport myself were up to objective morality I would have no reason to fight against expectations because I would be wrong. I would be objectively wrong and if morals were set forth as objective, it would be instinctual to adhere to that rule set. Real life obviously indicates otherwise. People do things everyday that they feel are ok but others feel differently.   The interpretation is where the subjective manner comes to play. We both read the same article and yet had almost opposite interpretations based on our individual moral compasses.    I'm on my phone so I hope this is coherent! Haha   I also so enjoy reddit for the discussions btw!"

That's been disproven time and time again. //   Erm, I know of only one or two claims in the entire course of human history for when abstinence has failed to be effective. All those cases are related to interactions with the divine.  I think what you were trying to say was that people have failed to remain abstinent from sexual activity time and time again. Some people fail to abstain from all sorts of things, cold-blooded murder say, but that doesn't mean that abstaining isn't the right thing to do - others failure to do something doesn't mean that in general it's not the best course.  Sure you can say that abstinence education isn't effective but you can't claim abstinence from sex isn't effective at preventing pregnancy and preventing transmission of STI/STDs."

raisingkids,35wyot,mughmore,1 point,Fri May 15 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"To your first point, when she goes on about the visiting teacher's story and how he finished with ""The girl that says no is the one you want"", and the author turns it around and says ""Silly me! I have been teaching my son that if a girl says no, you exit politely and get the hell out of her space."", it seems she's completely taking it out of context and sensationalizing it. I think it's fairly obvious the guy's point was that he was forced to actually try to know the girl, instead of just having sex and moving on, as he had before.  Your second point, too, is fairly spot on. The idea of ""sexual compatibility"" as this grand determining factor for the successful relationship is just insane. As if you can wholly love someone but then you have sex with them and it doesn't blow your mind, so you don't love them anymore? You can just sign off from the relationship and wash your hands of it because you're not ""sexually compatible""? It's insane. It speaks to the kind of love-at-first-sight culture we live in where so many people get divorced so soon after getting married because the reality of the marriage didn't live up to what they thought it should be, and they or their partner don't want to buckle down and do the hard work to fix the issues and grow together as people, and instead just move on and say ""it wasn't meant to be"".  The idea that your spouse deserves a well practiced sexual partner is bizarre to me as well. Why not explore this newfound territory together, so that you can be the perfect sexual partner for them? Just because you have sex with thirty people before getting married doesn't mean you're going to be amazing in bed, because each person has different tastes and wants and desires, so it's all exploration anyway. You can have continuously improving sex with one person, or you can have awkward sex a bunch of times with other people.   I also agree that abstinence isn't effective or perfect or anything, but I think it should be presented as an option, because it works for some people. We should teach our children all the mechanics of sex, and not to be ashamed of things of that nature, absolutely, but we shouldn't encourage them to be one way because that's what we think is good, they will need to find out what works for them, and we should just give them the tools they need to be safe in whatever choices they make.  That being said, that class sounds a little insane."
raisingkids,35wyot,pbhj,2,Thu May 14 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"Re saying no, the guys point was surely that the one you want is the one that is prepared to have a relationship with you that isn't founded on just fulfilling an immediate sexual urge but is instead about you in particular. That seems a more valid position.   A person with normal comprehension would not misunderstand that the story-teller in teh OP definitely means the person says no to just fucking instead of having a relationship first. The author repeatedly miscategorises this as some sort of support for rape or at least continued unwanted behaviour:   Honestly, I’m sure that after my son’s no-means-yes sex-ed class ended, I was yelling and swearing at the visiting teachers partly out of sheer guilt. //   This person clearly is not playing fairly, she is wilfully misinterpreting the situation to present a straw-man; you can't trust this person to present honestly the situation.  The authors view, using the same logic, would be categorised as ""if they won't fuck you as soon as you meet them they're worthless discard them"".   His father warned him: “Tomorrow, you can’t expect the adults in the room to act rational. They have their emotions tied up with this, and whatever evidence you bring isn’t going to convince them. Just be prepared for that.” //   Ha ha ha, she should read that."

The tweets are honestly a bit scary given that this is supposed to pass as some form of education. Instead the class comes off as some BS thing that would be shoehorned into the end of a bible summer camp. A mentality of ""less talk about, the better"" clearly influenced by people and their hyped up zeal to enforce religious and moral views onto others, systems of equality be damned. And this does no one any good. If your moral/religious convictions seem to mandate you must maintain an air of willful and deliberate ignorance, that's fine. I can't make you not be stupid and ignorant. But by no means does that mean everybody else has to be."

My anally-fixated five-year-old with Aspergers said something suspicious at an after school care program. I thought we had a good relationship with the program director, but instead of contacting us directly to discuss it, she called child protective services.   They were apparently supposed to call me directly, but failed - they misdialed the number and gave up. So it came about that I, as a previously bereaved parent, got a call from a police officer who said he needed to talk to me about my daughter, while I was standing on top of an elevator car ten stories up (I was an elevator repair technician). I nearly lost my balance and fell - I was so sure that that was the call that every parent dreads and that I'd never see my child again.  After a gruelling afternoon with some hardened but sensible police officers, we were free to go. If it had been down to CPS, I'd probably have had my child taken away from me. We never received an apology for their bungling of the case from CPS - the twenty-year-old social worker responsible glibly said ""I know how you feel"" when I described how horrific it had been for a bereaved parent to endure. The after school care operator was unrepentent too and it made for an awkward few years - she claimed ""We have a policy"", but clearly she believed I was capable of sexually abusing my child."

Every kid is different, but what has worked for our boys is when you're saying something that's important, make sure you have eye contact, hold their face gently and calmly speak to them without anger or intensity. Be calm and pleasant. Gently smiling. Remember any emotion on your face is amplified by the little one so if you're angry they'll avoid making eye contact because it's intense. They're years away from managing their thoughts and emotions effectively so don't add to the complexity. They may be able to repeat what you say but it doesn't mean they've internalized the info.

For the bedtime routine, my husband reads him books on our bed before I tuck him into his crib in his room. This particular night, my son got under our covers (again, he had been sleeping in our bed the week before) and said, ""sleep, mama-daddy bed?"" My instinct was so say, ""no."" Because that's not part of the routine and it was bedtime and I didn't think he could handle not being caged by his crib. But then I remembered the theory of ""why not?"" It was Friday night, he asked so nicely, and I could always move him into his bed if it turned into an ordeal. So I tucked him into our bed, sang him a song, and closed the door. To our complete surprise and amazement, he went right to sleep and was snoring away when we checked on him 15 minutes later. He didn't crawl out or try to play or anything. Now we think he might be ready for a ""big boy"" bed, because I've been able to replicate our results a few more nights AND with naps.

I especially loved the one of her jumping on the bed.   BUT  Wyatt did not have consent from his daughter to publicly display these beautiful and intimate images of her body. Wyatt did not do his parental duty to prevent his precious gift of photography (that rightly belongs to his daughter) from falling into the hands of sick people. Wyatt advocates for freedom of expression and innocence, which I totally agree with. But as a parent I would hold these dear to me, close to my heart. I would share them with pride and joy with my precious one and say, this is your body and it is beautiful. I would ask if I may share them once they are grown up adults. Then I would wait for that day. But he chose to profit or at least make his point now. His role as an artist seems more important than his role as a father. Would his artistic talent be as much in doubt if he had only posted pictures of her clothed, while saying another private collection will be revealed when his daughter is grown if she wishes to share? I think that would have been the best way to handle it. Not because of shame from others. But because of respect for his daughter.   In conclusion.   Wyatt is a good artist but he's made a poor decision as a father."

raisingkids,33radx,whatsthesoupdejour,5,Fri Apr 24 21:38:35 2015 UTC,"We've cloth diapered since #1 came home from the hospital, and I can confidently say that you do NOT need to wash them every day. In fact, washing once per day probably wouldn't do a great job of cleaning your diapers anyway, since you need to have a ""critical mass"" of diapers in the wash at the same time for them to run up against eachother and get truly clean - the six or so you'd use in a given day wouldn't be enough. We do one big diaper load once per week (for a 2.5 year old) and that works well for us. Hot water is a must, though, and depending on how good of a job your washer does, you may need to do a pre-soak and scrub of any particularly nasty ones. We have an HE machine, but I've heard that conventional top loaders are actually better for washing diapers. In any case, you shouldn't have a problem.   There'll be a lot of awesome info on the cloth diapering subreddit, as another poster already mentioned, but very quickly, my top cloth diapering lifehacks are:   1) buy a super sturdy tub/can to store diapers between washings. We use one that's intended as an apartment -sized compost bin, and accordingly does a good job of containing the smell. You can store the day's worth or dirty diapers in a lined cloth bag like these cute ones from Kangacare, but do yourself a favour and banish the contents to a bin in the laundry room at the end of each day. Use vineagar spray and/or baking soda to deodorize periodically as needed until wash day.  2) In my experience, no cloth diaper/liner combo will be adequate overnight for a well hydrated toddler who sleeps 10 hours or more. After trying about 5 different things and being woken up by a wet and wailing baby 5 different times, we gave up and use a 12 hour disposable overnight. YMMV, obviously, but all of my cloth diapering friends do the same overnight, as far as I'm aware.  3) again, just my experience, but snap closures on diaper covers are WAY better than velcro closures. Toddlers know how to open velcro, is all I'll say about that. Our favourite brand ended up being Rumparooz one-size, and they fit our son really well on the various size settings from 1 month old to now, but whatever brand you choose, for the love of God, get the snap closures.  4) avoid zinc based bum cream with your clothies - the same properties that make it a great barrier cream for sore little bums also mean that it leaves a waterproof layer on the surface of your diapers, even after washing. Obviously, you don't want the thing you're counting on to absorb liquids to suddenly turn waterproof :-(   That's it for my top list of advice, but feel free to PM me any questions. It can be daunting starting out because there's so much choice, and unlike disposables, it's a long term investment, but once you find a system that works for you, it's surprisingly easy. I'm no expert, but happy to share what worked for us!"
raisingkids,33radx,KikiCanuck,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. Just wanted to chime in and say that I washed mine every three days. That meant I didn't need to buy as many as I would have if I went a whole week in between washings.   I have a friend who cloth diapers twins, and she pays for a diaper service to do the washing and bring clean diapers each week. Might be worth checking into in your area.  I used fitted diapers (best bottoms). My son was large, so we just used size med & large. I have another friend who uses them on her daughter, who is small. She is almost 1, and still using a size small. So they will probably get away with using just small and medium. I rented newborn diapers for the first month, so if that's an option in your area, it gives you a little time to see how big your baby is and help you decide what size they will need.  All in all it wasn't as hard or gross as I thought it would be (although I did buy a diaper sprayer for $50 so I didn't have to stick my hand in poopy water to rinse them).   Good luck OP with whatever you decide!"
raisingkids,33radx,lecoueroublie,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"Good point, we did a service for the first 4 months with our son, too. Not sure how widespread they are outside of major centres, but a great option if it's available. Some services will also offer ""wash at home"" trials of different brands and styles of diapers so you can try before you buy and get a sense of what works for you.  As for frequency, we used to do once every 2-3 days too, but now that my son is older, he doesn't dirty as many diapers in a day, so we only hit critical mass after 6-7 days. He also figured out how to use the diaper sprayer attached to the toilet (hopefully that day will never come for you) so we had to scotch that as well."

I'm not sure if it's available outside Canada, but it's basically just olive oil. And honestly, when we're traveling or at the cottage, we'll sometimes just use a small container of olive or coconut oil, which seems to work just as well for our son. The Weleda diaper care line is also amazing, and pretty widely available, but a little more expensive than our go-to.  We've never had to (touch wood) but friends of ours whose kid is prone to diaper rash have had to switch her into disposables for a few days at a time so they can use the super thick zinc formulation on really bad rashes."

We use it to scrape the poo off the nappies when we need to. Then it gets cleaned and returned to its place on the window above the toilet where little hands can't reach! Sounds gross, I know, but it saves us heaps of money on buying flushable liners.  We're in New Zealand and use Itti Bitti d'lish all-in-one nappies. There's small, medium and large.

I wouldn't be cool with a six-year-old walking alone by themselves - mainly because there are busy roads to be crossed and at that age, they lack both the maturity and the physiological ability to judge the speed and direction of traffic.  My daughter's been walking the dog since 9. Goes to the playground alone at 10. Nobody calls it 'free range'. It's just normal, and this has been commonplace in small towns and any half decent neighbourhood for as long as I can remember. No cop's going to pick up your child unless she/he is taking part in graffiti or shoplifting.    Sure, sometimes kids don't play fair at playgrounds. It's normal, when that happens, for any adult that happens to be there - and there'll always be one or two - to say something. If the younger kids aren't getting a look-in on the flying fox, or kids aren't queuing and don't appear to be resolving it themselves, parents are going to intervene. They don't say ""Where are your parents?"", they say ""Oy, that's not very fair, is it?"". Sometimes it's me; sometimes it's undoubtedly other parents correcting my kid. And the kids listen. They know that they've done something wrong, and when it's bad enough that someone other than mum & dad have taken notice, there's a fair amount of shame than that.  Any child who doesn't have a problem with acting out in public and being corrected for it - well, they're on their way to youth court. It's not a matter of those parents not being there right at that particular point when it gets that far - it's a matter of those parents not ever being there.

raisingkids,33ixpw,roofuskit,0,Thu Apr 23 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that a society where everyone is self serving is unhealthy.  I disagree that not being available to take responsibility for someone else's child means you are self serving.  People are more likely and more able to organize into groups based on similar interests and desires, and more willing to seek out solitary entertainment.  But just because you have more control over who you hang out with and have more structured schedules, doesn't make you self-serving."
raisingkids,33ixpw,Jbird8282,5,Thu Apr 23 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"Walk their routes. Walk with them to and from school or the neighbors, store, whatever. Do this for a week or 2 so that both you and your kids know the route and area, and so you, the parent, know how much time it takes. This way, they feel comfortable and empowered and you can set reasonable curfews.   A great example would be the difference between 2 owners and their dogs. 1 owner uses a leash, the other doesn't, both dogs remain at the side of their owner. What's keeping them from running off? If you see the one with the leash, you would almost immediately say the leash, but what are your thoughts on the one without a leash?   Really, its the balance between the 2, and transitioning to a short leash to no leash. We need to be able to empower our children to make sound choices without limiting their ability to grow.   As a community we should also stop being so damned paranoid and sensitive. If you see kids by themselves, why not try and be sociable like saying ""hi, how you kids doin?"", make sure they are safe and not lost then carry on. How can we expect our children to grow up and create a better world for themselves if we refuse to set the example."

raisingkids,33ixpw,InvitedAdvert,3,Thu Apr 23 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"We have ""free-range"" kids in our neighborhood.  I call them ""feral kids"" because I'm starting to think they don't have parents.  I've never seen them.  The kids are like, 6 and 8.  They come over to play with my 4 and 2 year olds and have no respect for other people's things.  They try to take my kids' toys all the time.  And they pay no attention to traffic.  I was walking down the road with my kids when the Feral kids joined us.  They were riding their bikes in the middle of the road and my 4 year old kept trying to do the same thing.  I had to constantly remind him how to be safe.  It's frustrating because my kids want to be footloose and fancy free like the Feral kids, but since I follow them around they have to obey the rules.  I feel like their parents are just using the neighbors as free babysitters.  I try not to be a helicopter parent, but I think some ""free-range"" parents are just lazy."
raisingkids,33ixpw,ivix,3,Thu Apr 23 13:04:06 2015 UTC,"What you need to do is tell these kids that you need to speak to their parents and that they aren't allowed to come back and play with your kids until you've met them. Invite them in, have some tea or lemonade maybe some cookies or biscuits and talk to them face to face like human beings. Explain the rules you have that they aren't following. Tell them you'd love to have them around as long as you get support from them (the parents) on their kids following these rules with your kids. If they can't get on board, let them know in the nicest way you can that their kids won't be welcome back. If they say yes you guys just exchange numbers, and now you have a direct line to report home when they aren't behaving at your house. This way if you have to send them home for not listening then you can call ahead and their parents will be waiting to back you up.  Do not overreact and call the police as someone else suggested. That's a fast track to these kids and their parents resenting you and rightly being a pain in the ass as a result.  Edit: alternatively it might be more comfortable if you have the kids take you to their house with a plate of treats in tow. It might go better if they don't feel summoned."

However we do have a helicopter mom on our block who always supervises her son - she watches him more closely at age 11 than any of the other kids were watched at age 5.  I assure you I would have been pissed if she took it upon herself to ""babysit"" my children, and I wouldn't be the only one (certainly not the loudest or angriest one - one of my neighbors tends to go mama bear).  Not that she would do such a thing - she's perfectly lovely.

They’re just memories of being — long walks or bike rides with them down to the lake, family dinners together, and also the moments when they’d stop hassling me and give me space, let me do something new on my own, like the first time I got to go to the mall without an adult, or the first time I got to spend the night at a friend’s house, or, later, go with friends to a movie, or on a date. Later, there was the adventure of going off to college, of traveling abroad on my own for the first time — the thrill of that, of feeling autonomous and alive in the world. It was like hearing my own heart beat for the first time. Those are some of the happiest memories.   This. So. Much. My memories are filled with sticks in creeks and the guilty pleasure of going just beyond the forbidden boundary. And when I was 19 and suddenly in a foreign country without a cheap way to call my mom, the thrill was a little frightening but gave me such confidence."

I spent four weeks—every single morning for four full weeks—either in the classroom, waiting for the teacher to tell me to step out for 10 or 20 minutes (it felt like waiting in a doctor’s office for very bad news), or, once I was given the go-ahead to leave for an hour or two, camped out in the local café.

raisingkids,33780t,meownikki,27,Mon Apr 20 04:30:59 2015 UTC,"At her age, your best bet might be (I'd like to emphasize MIGHT - I am not a child psychologist!) to simply follow her unintentional lead, and not treat it as the huge deal it is. For the example you gave, you could easily follow with ""I have friends that I miss too, XYZ moved away and now we can't see each other! But that's okay, there are lots of great people around to play with. And you'll be able to talk to her more once you can read and write, too!"". Connect with her on the other part of what she said, and use that to change the subject.   Going out on a limb, it sounds like the main problem is that you are more intellectually aware than she is of how wrong her uncle's actions were, and that's leaving you flustered. Being that she is getting help from someone (assumedly trained) in giving it, it sounds like a good idea to go with the flow and don't overemphasize it.  If she's actually looking to talk to you about that dark experience itself, that's a whole other can of worms and I don't have much to offer, unfortunately. Aside from ""I don't know much about that, but I bet <person who is helping her with it> will have some great answers the next time you see them"". And maybe contact that person yourself with the parents and get their advice.  My heart goes out to you and everyone involved, that has got to be heart-breaking."

raisingkids,33780t,Chocobean,9,Mon Apr 20 08:42:15 2015 UTC,"I've not been in your or the girl's family's position. But she will be seeing a psychologist right? Ask her family how you should respond.   My instinct when dealing with my 3 year old is that your own emotions are absolutely everything. If you become angry or sullen or embarrassed when she talks about the abuse, she will pick up on the fact that what has happened to her is infuriating, depressing and shameful. It is, for the uncle, but the child will likely interpret it as those emotion being caused by her.  I would remain neutral and say something like, ""yes, I heard from you mommy. And I agree with mommy (or daddy), she takes very good care of you and know the best for you."" Re-affirm for her that she has her loving and wise parent, that she is currently safe and that sharing does not make you uncomfortable.   Good luck. :( sad business. I am glad she is safe now."

raisingkids,33780t,Zutti,3,Mon Apr 20 08:37:41 2015 UTC,I think one of the key factors to remain calm and not show any kind of negative emotion. I also don't think you should be falsely cheery. I would probably just tell the small child and a very calm time that Uncle so-and-so should not have done that and it isn't her fault.
raisingkids,33780t,damnilovelesclaypool,2,Mon Apr 20 11:40:42 2015 UTC,"I would NOT tell her that it isn't her fault.  Obviously it's not, but she's too young to even think of that possibility. Even mentioning the idea could get her to start thinking about fault and the implications of that. Even though, to an adult, it is clearly the uncle who is in the wrong, it is very difficult for a 3-year old to assign fault to adults.  The child seems to be open to talking about it, so be matter-of fact. It happened, no she's not allowed to go there any more, but there are plenty of other fun things to do, so it's ok! You're not at all saying that what happened is fine, just that in the current moment, she can do plenty of other things. Establishing normalcy after an event like that is key."
raisingkids,33780t,NinjaWombat,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:05:08 2015 UTC,"I am not a psychologist but from what I have learned as a parent, children are very self centered and internalize things very quickly, hence the advice not to call a child good or bad but to call the behavior good or bad. Not saying that she is capable of grasping the nuances of wrongly internalizing fault in this specific instance, but young children have a difficult time of distinguishing between ""this thing that happened/that I did is bad"" and ""this thing happened/I did this thing, so I am bad."""

raisingkids,33780t,istara,3,Mon Apr 20 14:43:33 2015 UTC,I vehemently disagree with your statement that things will never be normal again. That kind of thinking permanently victimizes the child. The problem with telling a child that young that it isn't their fault is that it may implant the exact opposite thought.
raisingkids,33780t,NinjaWombat,2,Mon Apr 20 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It is possible that she hasn't been significantly harmed by the behaviour because she wasn't physically ""hurt"" (in terms of pain) and has no concept of ""wrong"" (in a sexual sense).  Later on, as she grows up and the subject of sexual abuse comes up, and she remembers that Uncle Perv did that, she will likely frame it in a new context of wrong/being abused. That's when support may be needed.  Right now her innocence is a kind of shield against trauma and I would just maintain that."
raisingkids,33780t,Zutti,0,Tue Apr 21 06:28:42 2015 UTC,"Dude it's great that you disagree - we're both people and are welcome to our opinions. But unless you've got some kind of a clinical background that you can say with confidence your idea is better than mine, maybe we could keep the conversation friendly in tone?  Therapy is great and all, but unless you've been a victim of sexual abuse yourself I don't know that you can sit there and vehemently disagree with me. I'm not saying the child will be damaged the rest of her life, but things will never ever be quite normal. No amount of therapy takes that experience away. It just helps you integrate that experience in such a way as allowing you to be as healthy as possible."

raisingkids,33780t,Zutti,2,Mon Apr 20 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to attack you. Your wording was very aggressive (eg vehemently disagree instead of just disagree). Being a bitch has got nothing to do with it.  I think everyone posting here has one simple goal in mind - to try to help this child who was a victim of something horrendous. We may have different ideas on how to best go about that, and the exchange of ideas can and should be a very healthy thing. I'm truly hoping that a professional child therapist can weigh in here with their experience and thoughts.  To my mind, you can never undo what has been done to this child. As i said you can help her integrate what has happened into a healthy self perception and world view. I don't think normalizing the event is the way to go about that - acting like nothing has happened, or that it isn't a big deal. It's a big deal. I act like nothing has happened when my kid bumps his knee on a chair and doesn't know whether or not to cry about it.  In this case.. well while the child psychology aspect of it may differ to some degree we know the typical response from victims of sexual abuse or sexual violence is one of guilt and shame. They tend to blame themselves, and I personally don't think ignoring that aspect and hoping it doesn't develop that way is going to address what is likely to become an issue down the road. I'd rather tackle it head on in a calm, loving fashion."
raisingkids,33780t,NinjaWombat,2,Mon Apr 20 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that using the term ""vehemently"" to convey the degree to which I disagree is aggressive.

I came out as gay, and was doing poorly in school mainly because of depression. My parents were religious and whether they want to believe it or not, their love was far from feeling unconditional. They tried and tried to get my grades to go up for me to succeed and graduate (I did). Some of these techniques include taking EVERYTHING out of my room and trying to strip me of the online identity and friends I had. With the extremes of looking up people on my personal skype to find out of they're actually adults and or homosexual.   One day, considering I had no laptop to do homework on, I used my fathers. And in this opportunity, contacted my friend. This friend of mine does not know I am doing poorly in school, thus not knowing the circumstances as to why my parents did what they had. I talked to him about what has happened.   He responded with empty words saying that I should burn the bible that my parents gave me and I had to get out of there as soon as possible, as they are toxic people. He said what he did because in his mind, (which in a way he wasnt wrong) my parents were repressing my sexual orientation with the bible.   Fast forward to the next day, I forgot to sign out and my father met me in the other room with a print out of the conversation and yelled at me. Saying how bad of a friend he was. And from that day sense kicked him out of the house until he says sorry for what he did. My friend is independent and won't say sorry for something that was between HIM and I. Especially after he was completely insulted as friend for just trying to be there for me when I messaged him online.  They keep trying to do what they always do by using the ""when you're a parent you have to make tough decisions"" trump to make up for their lackadaisical parenting skills. I just want this to end so we can be complete friends again... having to wait to get a car or a house of my own for us to visit on another is unbearable. One side wont apologize. One side won't budge without one."

Then ask your daughter to collect items that make her happy, calm and peaceful to put there and let her know she's always welcome to go to that place when she needs to find her peace.   I wonder if she's not also feeling powerless, because she can't control the things she wishes she could, like visiting family and old friends. Depending on the distance, could you do things like Skype more often, write letters, look at pictures? Pictures could also help with feelings of homesickness and nostalgia. How is she doing on the other end of the change? Getting out into parks/activities where she can meet new people, keeping busy, etc.?"

He learned about it and would enjoy it with me. Now looking back on it he prolly didn't really like everything I found interest in. But he stuck through it anyway because it gave us not only something to bond over but to enjoy together. to give some examples I really got into D&D/RP games. He learned how to DM them all so me him my brothers n friends could all play together. Another, I got into cross country in High School he started to run while I was in class n got rather fit so on weekends he could run with me. Even if you don't like it.

raisingkids,331oeb,D_Lo_2590,8,Sat Apr 18 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"My parents we're terribly positive either, but the one thing they did do was prepare me to be an adult. Even just basic, often overlooked things like self-reliance, self-soothing, learning how to cook and clean up for myself, etc. I know 30-and 40-somethings that can't cook a decent healthy meal, can't take responsibility of their living spaces or relationships, can't even be in a room with themselves without constant stimulation. Might have to do with my job, but still, it's common. My parents taught this as more of a hey, you're not special and you're old enough to care for yourself (debatable as a preteen), but still, at least I didn't have any rude awakenings about the cold, hard world.  Personally, my favorite thing is asking children questions. It's a great way to be positive and proactive as a parent. So much of parenting becomes dictating, and this helps them feel like they have a voice -- and your ear.   It's especially useful to give them appropriate, pre-approved options when they are younger. This really ranges, but a good example would be asking ""Would you like to eat green beans or peas with dinner?""  so that ""What kind of side dish do you want with dinner?"" doesn't get a response of ""jelly beans!""  Begin this kind of dialogue early, and it becomes effortless (or at least not-so-awkward) as they grow up to ping them on any subject: emotions, job prospects, etc., and at the same time, they know that they can rely on you to listen and better support their choices."

Not always easy, but easier.   Take time to play and interact with them; take some sort of interest in the things they are doing. This starts early and pays off quickly (baby smiles are awesome, big kid hugs rock!).  Read. Read. Read. On the couch, at the table, bed time, etc.   Take them outside, learn about things together (blow bubbles, home made cardboard tube swords, paper airplanes off the roof, etc). Parks, nature centers, music, kid museums, etc. Get them engaged in stuff.  Love them a bunch and have fun doing it. It's not always fun, sometimes it really is hard, but it's often pretty rewarding."

She was a nurse and pretty strict, so there was no faking sickies and I can remember having to go to school in agony when she didn't consider me sick enough. But every now and then she'd surprise us. Once there was a heavy snowfall on the mountain, so we skipped school and played in the snow all day. Other times she got us out of bed in the middle of the night to see a house being moved on a truck, or this huge concrete vat several stories high being taken down to the port. Just random stuff that she thought we'd find exciting or interesting. It didn't happen often, but kept a sense of magic and anticipation in an otherwise pretty miserable childhood.  I want to say congrats, and to let you know that you'll screw up too now and then, and that's okay. Sorry is an important word for parents too. Whatever you do, don't try to be perfect; you'll only disappoint yourself. Just have love, forgiveness and aim to be 'good enough'."
raisingkids,331oeb,Craftywitchy,4,Sun Apr 19 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Think about discipline and discuss your philosophy and plans for discipline with your partner before you need it. In the heat of the moment when you're upset and on the spot is not the time to start thinking about how to handle a problem. That's the moment when lots of parents just spank or yell because they don't know what to do. There are lots of books, plenty of people will be happy to tell you what to do, but you really need to think long and hard about your own values and expectations and be prepared. Obviously a baby doesn't need discipline, but that little angel will be being into mischief before you know it, be prepared.  Being a parent is difficult but it's worth it. Nothing teaches you humility like taking full responsibility for another life. You're going to make mistakes, we all have parenting moments we're not proud of when we were distracted or angry. We do the best we can and we try to do better next time. You're thinking about this ahead of time and that puts you in a better position than a lot of people. In the end you love 'em as hard as you can and hope for the best.  Good luck and hang on, it's quite a ride."

Every week each of us had a specific day to make dinner and a specific day to clean up the kitchen/dining room. We eventually had extra restrictions put in place, we could only make a specific meal once a month and specific meals could only be made once a week. This helped to teach us different recipes and we didn't end up eating the same thing multiple times in a row. We also had to make balanced meals (veggies, carbs, optional meat). When we moved out we already knew how to cook healthy meals for ourselves which was really great, and the confidence of being independent."

This is ignorant and non-constructive.  To stop a temper tantrum in its tracks, do this instead:   Pay attention to your child's needs. Like, the need for food, water, rest, play, exercise, attention, affection, exploration etc. If the child has a need that is not being met for some time, their emotions will start coming to the surface. This is not a prompt to ignore the child or punish them for being emotional. This is a prompt to meet the need! Meet the child's needs earlier. This is how you stop ""temper tantrums"" or ""emotional disregulation caused by unmet needs"" as I'd prefer to call them.   Example: your child is in the restaurant. The child wants to play and move and and sing. They have a need for play and exploration. Keeping them in a confined environment where they can't use their voice and can't move around will make them feel annoyed, uneasy and possibly anxious. Which may lead to a meltdown. How do you avoid this?    take them out for a few hours of play before the restaurant and tell them about the transition ahead of time engage them in play in the restaurant take ""breaks"" from the restaurant, go outside, run and scream together go to a child-friendly restaurant, with space for play   Treating an emotionally disregulated child as an enemy and applying pressure on them to make them ""behave"" is harmful. Please try to seek the reason for the behavior and address that. This is where the key is."

Granted, I only have a two month old, so what do I know?

raisingkids,32ojn2,OsakaWilson,6,Wed Apr 15 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"I'll assume that by OP you meant the post I replied to.   Kids need to learn to communicate what they want without tantrums. Giving then everything they want, or need, when they throw a tantrum is rewarding them. My kids have gotten nothing, ever when they do not communicate with respect and without manipulation. They attempted tantrums a few times and then completely stopped and never did it again. Restaurants are not a problem at all. They realize that it requires some waiting and nothing will change that. We give them something to draw or talk with them. Kids who are not allowed to manipulate parents can be quiet and entertain themselves.   We take care of all their needs, I'm not arguing against that, but sometimes they have to wait for it and they can. That is unless you teach them that they can get what they want by misbehaving. Expecting them to treat you with respect and not attempt to manipulate you is not seeing them as the enemy, it is teaching them to be a decent person. Teaching them to behave when the situation calls for quiet and patience is certainly not harmful, as ObviousOctopus suggests. Teaching them to misbehave by rewarding it, definitely is. Of course ObviousOctopus didn't come out and say, I reward bad behavior, but described giving in to it fully and characterized not giving in as harmful.   When we refuse to comply with manipulative behavior, we are still there for them, check in to see if they are ready to communicate in a mutually respectful way and talk about how they feel and what they want to express. We validate that they feel the way they do and steer them toward accepting it and moving on to something more interesting than dwelling on it. And like I said, after a the first few unrewarded tantrums, there have been none and our kids are far more happy spending their time playing or otherwise entertaining themselves than they would be if they were constantly using their unhappiness to control us."
raisingkids,32ojn2,Wisecow,3,Thu Apr 16 00:30:58 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with the above and additionally note, it's not even just the personal manipulation. My goal is to prepare my child to the best of my abilities to go out into the real world someday.   Now I don't think I need my 3 year old to go out and get a job to prepare him, but I believe it will be easier for me to teach him while he is young that sometimes you just must be patient. Sometimes you just need to sit in that chair at the restaurant. The world doesn't bend around you.    What it sounds like /u/obviousoctopus is suggesting is that you should, in fact, bend the world around your child by catering to them to avoid making them mad. That seems potentially more long term damaging than just beinga bit firm with your child a few times."
raisingkids,32ojn2,obviousoctopus,2,Thu Apr 16 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"""Bend the world around"" carries a lot of negative connotations. I never mentioned fulfilling a child's every desire.   A healthy relationship between the parent and a young child, is one where the parent provides for the child and takes care of the child's needs.  A relationship where a young child is forced to take care of the parents needs, is unhealthy, or, dysfunctional.  A child being forced to sit at a restaurant in order to please an adult, is an example for a child being forced to take care of the parent's needs against the child's will.  Preparing a child for the ""real world"" involves supporting the child in engaging with their environment at the level of the child's readiness and abilities to understand and adapt.  Forcing a child to do something they're not ready for, is counterproductive and harmful.   In similar terms, it's not a good idea to  expose a child to poison in order to prepare them for a polluted environment. It will not make them tougher, just poisoned."

It doesn't sound that way to me. It sounds like anticipating your child's needs and taking care of them before the situation develops into a tantrum.   All I know at this point is from my own experience, but I know that if my parents didn't yell at me and reprimand me as often, and instead would have just listened to me and treated me as a person, I would have been a much happier and emotionally stable person, and I probably would still be in contact with them."
raisingkids,32ojn2,obviousoctopus,2,Thu Apr 16 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also, a child treated in a healthy manner develops habits to anticipate their own needs, to take care of themselves, to plan for and create the life they desire.   Not rocket science but contrary to old parenting approaches which focus on obedience and ""appropriate behavior"", forcing the child to become a caretaker for the parents' emotional needs and expectations,  robbing the child from discovering their own.   Children should be self centered. They are learning themselves and the world. Forcing them to be something else is naive and hurtful."

raisingkids,32gdoc,Cbrantford,19,Mon Apr 13 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"I'm 28 years old. In my lifetime crime has dropped rather significantly, and I remember basically being given free reign of the neighborhood when I was about 5 or 6. This seems ridiculous."
raisingkids,32gdoc,Lostonpurpose87,6,Mon Apr 13 20:15:07 2015 UTC,The parents should be suing. The police had no right to kidnap children off the street. These were not helpless abandoned children. They have a home and without real reason have no right to simply remove children.
raisingkids,32gdoc,HiddenMaragon,7,Tue Apr 14 12:16:18 2015 UTC,"Why do individuals think it is their responsibility to stick their noses into other people’s business?   From what I understand the children were playing in a park with their parents' permission.   This is something that children have been doing for decades.  I did it and my children did it.  It was part of growing up.  No one was being harmed.   Maybe the individuals who feel something is wrong should consider that there is more than one way to raise a child.   If they feel that a child should not play at a park without parental supervision,  that is their choice for their children.   Another parent may have a different point of view.   Each of us might consider respecting the values of others and not forcing our own point of view on strangers."
raisingkids,32gdoc,cleardaynow,-6,Tue Apr 14 05:48:45 2015 UTC,I read about this before. Do those parents not worry that something could happen to their kids? It says that they are supposed to be home by 6. What if something happened hours earlier and you wouldn't know that something did for hours? I am all for parenting your kids how you see fit as long as you know the consequences of it.
raisingkids,32gdoc,palmettomom2609,22,Mon Apr 13 18:10:16 2015 UTC,"Crime is down since 20 years ago. Would you be so worried about your kids playing at the park that you wouldn't let them go to the park? So far, the only consequence is CPS keeps getting involved. The kids are perfectly fine."
raisingkids,32gdoc,greenwizard88,10,Mon Apr 13 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in this case we have two incidents of other people calling the cops because they saw kids playing, and zero abductions. I know which one I'm more concerned about."
raisingkids,32gdoc,st3ve,9,Mon Apr 13 19:37:11 2015 UTC,"and zero abductions   The way I see it, the police basically abducted these kids from the park and held them for over 5 hours just to teach [the parents] a lesson. Ridiculous, yeah?"
raisingkids,32gdoc,syr_ark,2,Tue Apr 14 01:01:10 2015 UTC,As soon as my kid's old enough to cross the street on his own I'll just equip him with a phone watch that has Liam Neeson on speed dial.
raisingkids,32gdoc,st3ve,3,Tue Apr 14 01:06:40 2015 UTC,My kids are still little so it's hard for me to imagine it now but I'm sure I will feel differently when they are older. Like I said how anyone wants to parent is fine as long as they recognize that there can be consequences. This goes for those who do free range parenting to those who helicopter. It's always about balance that gives the best results.
raisingkids,32gdoc,palmettomom2609,2,Mon Apr 13 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"It should be, but when CPS and the police keep getting involved it really doesn't seem like parents have a choice. Parents are scolded and blamed and bullied into conforming to the white, middle-class, helicopter parenting style by society right now. It's no longer about protecting children when police and CPS are doing things just to teach parents a lesson."
raisingkids,32gdoc,altrocks,31,Tue Apr 14 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"It's not my job as a parent to worry, it's my job to raise competent humans. Shit happens. Sometimes bad shit, but stuff like abductions are so very rare that it's actually an illogical thing to worry about. This isn't just throw 'em out there and let them fend for themselves, it's about teaching kids from an early age how to deal with likely scenarios and teaching them to trust their gut instincts.  My 6 1/2 year old gets lots of freedom to play in our neighbourhood. She rides her bike around the block and to the park. None of her friends are allowed to go to the park with her without and adult and she doesn't really play there alone because, in her words ""there's only babies there"". She walked 1/2 way to and all the way home from kindergarten last year, by herself. She knows not to go anywhere with anyone. She knows that she can ask adults for help (say if she falls off her bike) and she knows her neighbourhood very well. I'm not naive enough to think that she couldn't be tricked by a predator, but I guess we're playing the odds in a way and for us as a family it's worth the tiny risk to have a confident independent child who can enjoy the wonders of being a child and exploring.  I'm looking forward to her 5 year old sister being able to go with her on adventures. She's not quite responsible enough yet, there but she will be soon. Children are amazingly competent, but they really do need to be given the chance."

raisingkids,32gdoc,palmettomom2609,3,Mon Apr 13 22:38:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks but if that's their opinion then there is nothing I can do to change it. I frankly don't remember how young I was but I know that I did get to spend time outside alone, as I let my 2 young children do in our fenced in back yard. Like I have said earlier, I have 2 young children (4 and 1) and I don't know how I will feel when they get older about them roaming around and I will cross that bridge when I get to it. There are plenty of children in our neighborhood that do it and it doesn't bother me, that's their parent's choice, as is everyone's. Also like I said before, everyone's parenting choices are that, choices, that all come with positive and negative side effects. This goes down the line to all sorts of things. Whether you let them roam or not, what kind of food they eat, whether they go outside at all or live inside. All of these choices have effects to them. For those of you who do let you children have freedom, that's great! I'm glad that you live in a community safe enough that you feel comfortable doing that. I am not judging anyone by this at all. How you feel and how I feel may be the same, may be different. It doesn't matter to me."

raisingkids,32f2fa,barnetto,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:14:47 2015 UTC,"When our kid is born, we'll be starting it on French. I speak maybe at a B2 level? We're trying to hire a French speaking nanny for the first 2 years, and if that isn't possible then I'll still be speaking French to kid and kid will start at a French immersion daycare at 2 years old.   The plan for keeping up the language once kid starts public school is a bit more up in the air. I expect kid to speak more grammatically correct French by the time they are 5 years old than I'll be capable of. I'll keep encouraging kid to speak to me, and speak to kid. I'll get books/dvds in French for kid. And there is a meetup group that meets for French speaking children to play together on a fairly frequent basis. And one of the grandparents has been told to communicate in French with kid.  I'll travel to France every 1-2 years to visit family there, but I can't stay long (up to two weeks) at a time, so I'm not sure how much good that will do. My parents used to do cousin swaps. Family would send their kids here for the summer. I might be able to arrange something similar. Their kids come for English immersion, my kid goes for French. I think the arrangement worked better for my cousins since my brother and I were raised monolingual English. If my kids are basically fluent when their kids visit the benefit might not be there for them unless they interact a lot with my monolingual husband and we get them out to meet English speaking kids.  There is Spanish immersion in some of the local elementary schools. The other grandparent speaks fluent Spanish. There are two private schools that do French immersion.  I feel like I should blog as I go along, but I'm not sure how much it would benefit others who may not have access to the same resources."
raisingkids,32cg3z,Wolf_Mommy,5,Sun Apr 12 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"To me, it's this line right here: ""It's going to be a major struggle when she's just slightly older and realizes I don't have control over her at all""  Yes, that is a problem, and I think that there are healthier ways of looking at discipline. It isn't our job to control our children. It's our job to teach our children how to control themselves. That respect has to come from inside, and it also has to be reflected toward themselves.   For me, honest communication about the effects of her behavior and setting boundaries works the best. When she pushes those boundaries, she loses privileges because she has lost trust. She is a little younger than your daughter, but I see this working even better as she gets older. We also use a lot of positive communication when she does helpful, mature things, and this helps to balance as well."
raisingkids,32cg3z,pomders,5,Sun Apr 12 20:30:33 2015 UTC,"I don't have any good advice, and obviously some children are different than others. But I think there are some alternatives to spanking, but probably not as simple as just ""use redirection"" or ""use time-out"". Alternatives may be more core to your whole parenting style and relationship with your child. There are some books on this subject, like  http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/1451663889/ref=sr_1_3/190-8841300-1010345?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1428877422&sr=1-3&keywords=kids+discipline  I encourage you to give it a look. How old is she now? If you set patterns early, they just get tougher to address as they get older, as you mentioned.  Personally, I agree with Louis CK, at least in that I think it teaches kids that it is okay to hit people.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5mlRkHOtkM"
raisingkids,32cg3z,bearsinthesea,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"That's terrible, no parent wants to hear that. I know it can be a struggle, because I know parents that came from abusive homes, and they often don't know when they're getting close to the line, or just feel like yelling is natural. It is not easy to change instincts like that. Something I found helpful is to hang around with parents that have a different approach, and watch how they handle things. Also, our montessori school has parenting classes that are interesting."

raisingkids,32cg3z,bearsinthesea,3,Mon Apr 13 00:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of Barbara Coloroso's The Kids are Worth it. It's about teaching inner-self discipline. These are her basic thoughts on discipline vs punishment:  ""Discipline and Punishment—Why one works and the other only appears to work: Punishment is adult oriented, imposes power from without, arouses anger and resentment, invites more conflict, exacerbates wounds rather than heals them; is preoccupied with blame and pain; does not consider reasons or look for solutions; does something to a child; involves a strong element of judgment; and demonstrates a parent's ability to control a child. Discipline is not judgmental, arbitrary, confusing, or coercive. It is not something we do to children. It is working with them. It is a process that gives life to a child’s learning. It is restorative, and invites reconciliation. Its goal is to instruct, guide, and help children develop self-discipline—an ordering of the self from the inside, not an imposition from the outside. •The process of discipline does four things the act of punishment cannot do: 1. 2. 3. Shows children what they have done. Gives them as much ownership of the problem that they can handle. Gives them options for solving the problem. Leaves their dignity intact. 4. •For mistakes, mischief, and mayhem that unintentionally or intentionally create serious problems of great consequence, the Three R’s—restitution, resolution, and reconciliation—are incorporated into the four steps of discipline. • R.S.V.P.--Consequences need to be Reasonable, Simple, Valuable, and Practical."""

raisingkids,32cg3z,twoVices,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"here's my thoughts.  kids are really smart.  they will try to get away with anything they think they can get away with.  what this means is that you have to be ever vigilant but most importantly: BE CONSISTANT.  it is so draining to keep after a kid who ""won't"" clean the room or play nice or whatever. a kid who is ""being a brat"" is actually testing boundaries, and you must act accordingly so they 1. behave better in the future and 2. quit being a brat.  you and your kid need to be on the same page.  since you're in charge, that means you need to clearly understand what you expect so you can effectively communicate it to them.  this means repetition with your child.  this means separating him or her from stimulation while you both discuss it.  eye contact, non-threatening posture and physical touch (like holding his or her hands in yours) are all ways you know he or she is listening.  welcome questions.  have him or her tell you in their own words.  ask them to tell you what their plan is for when this happens again.   finish with love and praise.   this is the point of time out, in my experience.  it forces the child to stop what they're doing and interrupts their pattern of brattiness, and allows you a minute (literally. not more than that usually) to breathe and remove emotion from the discipline.  being in the corner, standing still, tall, and quiet for a full minute is often a challenge enough.  since you set fourth the discipline, you have to stay on them so if they start fidgeting or talking, the minute starts over.  while in the corner, suggest repeatedly that they take a deep breath, and you do the same.  you should notice that you feel better even after one deep breath.  make them do this a few times and share how it makes you feel better, and ask if they also feel better.  if they're still being resistant, do a few more deep breaths.  this works like magic for me and my kids.  to show that you mean business about corner time, watch them the entire minute. if they aren't standing how you like, gently show them physically.  we go for standing straight, nose in the corner, hands at sides, deeply breathing. there will probably be some scuffles the first few  times you use corner time, so you have to outlast your kid and stick with the discipline until they know you mean business and finally comply.  I'm telling you, separating them from stimulus and deep breathing brings about change.  finally, they need to know why they are practicing discipline in the first place.  ask if they know why they are in the corner and if they say no (especially if you know they know what's up) explain calmly and briefly.  ask them to think about something specific while they are cooling down in the corner.  you can work in ideas like empathy, compassion,  honesty and fairness.  once they are used to corner time, you can ask them a question that they can work out in the corner.   the amount of time in the corner isn't arbitrary.  they should only be in the corner long enough to practice discipline and for their mood to calm, if needed.  check in with them, asking if they are feeling calm.  if not, more deep breathing will help.  it's not given as punishment, but as a viable way to calm down and be receptive to discussion.  you'll be able to tell if he or she is calm or still feeling upset.  don't end corner time until you're sure your kid is calm and understanding of the situation.   end with love and hugs.  (ps I got the shit beat out of me when I was a kid.  I don't think my mom could have handled raising 4 little kids on her own another way (dad died when I was very young).  I've struggled with anger issues my whole life and feeling rage bubbling up towards my kids makes me feel sick.  I don't care about blame.  I just know that there's a better way than hitting.   especially how tough this method can be, you begin to realize that hitting is just the easy way to break a kid's will, not actually teach anything.   anecdotal: my son is 15 and successfully working on an advanced curriculum, including latin, pre-calc, and humane letters despite struggling with adhd.  I don't know if ""practicing discipline"" was helpful, but I know for a fact that consistency and following through, as a parent, certainly did, and does.   I couldn't be prouder."

raisingkids,32054b,vgarrett,6,Thu Apr 9 14:52:39 2015 UTC,Why Long Beach? Could he try becoming a firefighter locally and then move after a couple of years?
raisingkids,32054b,TheCheshireCody,3,Thu Apr 9 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"I suggest you read up on being the parent of a child with addiction, how it affects you, your family,  and your decision making process. Co-dependance can be very dangerous and detrimental to your whole family. Perhaps research is .something you and your son could do together. If he's willing to do rehab, maybe he would be willing to read up on being a person with addiction and how to live with and plan for an independent life. It won't do anybody any good for you to set him up in Long Beach if he has no reliable way of sustaining himself (which I'm reading into the situation, I don't mean to judge your son).  If he is struggling to stay sober or to keep healthy routines then in my opinion living on his own far away with no support structure could be a very very bad idea.  Talk to him about why Long Beach appeals to him, if it truly is where he wants to go then he can go there when he is stable. I agree with the other commenter that becoming a firefighter in Boston is a great first step.    Also, he made need some time alone if he has burned bridges with friends and loved ones. It sounds like he has a lot of guilt over his actions or behavior, perhaps there is shame as well. I assume he did therapy in rehab,  did he find it helpful? If so perhaps he could continue to work through that and to help build a new support network.  This would also be a step towards independence and rebuilding his life into the life he wants to live."
raisingkids,32054b,cleverink,3,Thu Apr 9 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"Realize that becoming a firefighter is a pretty competitive job market in a lot of places. Get qualified locally first. A good first step would be getting his EMT certification (a fairly cheap and 2-3 month class), which is a foot in the door to getting his paramedic certification (a 1.5-2 year program), which is highly desirable in a lot of fire departments."

raisingkids,31zvrz,deathdonut,3,Thu Apr 9 16:04:26 2015 UTC,"I have noticed the term ""strong willed"" popping up in the literature and was immediately suspicious, since it seemed like a rosy way to describe a child who won't follow directions (which every child will do from time to time, regardless of the ""strength""of their will).

He is so focused on 'x' he can't be reasoned with, calmed down, bribed or redirected.  I have learned that consistency in language, simplifying the environment, and providing space (but still in sight) helps to manage behavior.  Anxiety can play a factor in strong willed children.  Reducing the amount of stuff in his environment (limiting choices) really helps him."

It is true that some schools don't give out much homework at all, however, many schools do give homework that requires much more time than 10 or 5 minutes a day. I don't think any student will have a problem completing that much homework.  The problem is with students who are given more homework, and find it difficult to get it done. Perhaps they feel the workload for them is too much, so they just give up and have zero motivation.  I'm looking at running workshops for these children to teach them effective study techniques and provide them with motivation to study independently.

raisingkids,31ky9t,Cbrantford,3,Mon Apr 6 01:47:44 2015 UTC,I've been pretty impressed with the newer playgrounds they are building in Seattle. Some of them are downright outdoor climbing gyms. Giant domes of criss-crossed ropes. Bridges that are basically just bare bars. It's good stuff - nothing like that bland playgrounds I didn't even find interesting when I was a kid. They are labeled with appropriate ages. Impressive.
raisingkids,31ky9t,thaen,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. My daughter 'beat' the one across the street before she turned two (although she still can't reach the monkey bars, thats fine with me).   I keep driving her around town to different parks for a challenge. The bigger the challenge the longer she will play. The more she plays the better she sleeps and the happier I am. Win-win."
raisingkids,31ky9t,heavenlybubbles,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. When I was a kid playgrounds had gravel instead of mats or bark mulch. One of my favorite toys was a giant truck tire on an axle. You held on to a set of handle bars and ran on top the the tire like a treadmill. If you stopped short you had a nice 5 foot fall waiting for you. My brother and I used to pretend we were knights and have sword fights. Which basically meant finding two big sticks and hitting them together as had as we could until they broke into tiny little splinters.   Playgrounds these days are safe and sterile because we're all too worried that our precious little darlings are going to end up with scraped knees. Good luck even finding a merry-go-round on most modern playgrounds.  Now that being said, littering the playground with saws, hammers, and nails might be a bit far on the other end of the spectrum for my tastes."
raisingkids,31ky9t,CapnStabby,10,Mon Apr 6 04:18:58 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm showing my age, but back when I was at school some of the monkey bars had concrete under them. A friend of mine was pushed from them when she was six, fell on her head and died of her injuries in hospital that night. So, there are some very good reasons for having playground surfaces that are proven to be safe - it's not just about scraped knees.  That said, a lot of modern playgrounds seem to be very formulaic. My kids get bored because they're identical from one town to the next. I guess it's easier to pass safety regulations that way. Sometimes we drive more than half an hour for one that's been built out of wood as a one off as it allows for a lot more imaginative free play - it's a huge flowing turreted castle with vehicles built into it."
raisingkids,31ky9t,heavenlybubbles,3,Mon Apr 6 09:21:41 2015 UTC,"That's a terrible story and concrete is a horrible thing to put under playgrounds. Some in our town have this rubberized springy material under them and while it's certainly safe to prevent those types of tragic injuries, all it does is allow the kids to basically jump from the roofs of the structures, something that they'd never dream of doing on even a wood chip surface. I'd bet that those springy surfaces causes more injuries in the long run."
raisingkids,31ky9t,CapnStabby,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"The kids in my neighbourhood park jump off the 8 foot play structure onto the sparse woodchip surface all the time (they play a game that is similar to parkour). I don't think children think about consequences, if they're going to do it the play surface isn't going to stop them (or increase frequency). As long as they don't jump on my toddler, I don't say anything. We did have a broken arm last year -- kid was back the next day doing the same thing in a cast."
raisingkids,31ky9t,TopRamen713,2,Mon Apr 6 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear about your friend. There is certainly some merit to replacing concrete and gravel with rubber and mulch. I guess my issue is more with the equipment itself. Like you said, it's formulaic. It seems like every park has the same structure with a ladder and pole on one end and a slide on the other. You can only go down the slide so many times before it gets boring. Eventually kids will look at something like that and think ""I wonder if I can run up the slide."" or ""I bet I could jump off of that."" And that's good. Kids are creative and good at finding new ways to play with things. Five minutes ago that stick was Excalibur, but now you're bored with that game and it's your balance beam as you walk the tightrope.   But modern playgrounds are so basic they almost work against that instinct. This is a slide. You slide down it. Nothing else. I'd love to see more castles and less 'climbing structures'"

She still sometimes throws a fit when she doesn't get what she wants RIGHTNOW!!!, but we just verbally acknowledge her feelings, then restate the limit. We may offer a suggestion or two for a distraction, but then otherwise let her work out her feelings. She's usually settled back down in under 5 minutes, maybe 10. But we're already seeing some improvement in her acceptance of our ""we cannot do that right now""s.  I'm probably the most frustrated with the interrupting though. If my husband is telling me a story at the dinner table, and she wants to be heard, she'll just start yelling and talking over him. I always tell her ""daddy is speaking now, let's listen to him. When he's done, we'll all listen to you."" And have suggested she try raising her hand, or putting her hand on my arm to let me know she wants to say something, while I'm having another conversation.

raisingkids,315gn4,mcfg,3,Thu Apr 2 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"I couldn't imagine doing math like the second example.  It splits one math problem into 4 math problems, then at the end I need to remember to solution to each of them, and add those up.  It seems a bit cumbersome.  The way it goes down in my head:  ""two minus two equals zero...ok cool, no borrowing so don't have to worry about that.  Three minus one equals two.  The answer is two and then zero, 20.""  The ""classic"" way involves 5 less math steps and 3 less numbers to be remembered.  I do have to say that I do love the way the common core integrates math and reading (my daughter is in K) together as a unified subject.  That really makes sense vs the old way of them being treated as almost unrelated and completely independent subjects of study.  She can also read already, which is fantastic and makes bedtime so much more fun for both of us."
raisingkids,315gn4,Aypse,5,Thu Apr 2 16:56:56 2015 UTC,"I think the way they describe -- which is how I do mental math, too -- is more reflective of how we do subtraction when we make change. If I sell someone something that costs $7.50 and they give me a $20, the natural thing to do is to count upward from $7.50 to $20 with the change. Two quarters makes $8, then two dollars gets us to $10, then a ten. So $12.50. I find those partial sums easier to remember than your digit-by-digit partial sums, because the digit-by-digit one requires you to recall the values at that digit place in each of the numbers, whereas ""my"" method takes the output of the previous step as its input.  The same algorithm works when doing figuring out a negative number in two's complement notation in binary, for what it's worth. Which probably isn't much."
raisingkids,315gn4,Zombie-Process,2,Thu Apr 2 22:42:00 2015 UTC,"How many steps would you take for 271-185 in your head? Because using common core method my process would be 185+15=200 / 200+71=271 / 15+71=86 / so then 271-185=86. It seems like to do it the classic method in your head would take more steps, not less.    TBH before this post I knew zero about common core. It is after my time, and my daughter is still too young.

raisingkids,315gn4,M80IW,3,Thu Apr 2 23:45:58 2015 UTC,"Sure - when it's a simple problem like 32-12 with no borrowing, you probably just subtract in your head.  But for more complex equations where a lot of borrowing is involved...say $35-$17.68, assuming you don't bust out the phone calculator you probably do something similar to rounding up to $20, then rounding up to get the 70 cents, so you know your change will be ""around"" $15.30. From there you add back the 2 cents and the $2 to your change to get your actual change, $17.32  I dunno, that's how I do it at least. I guess if you're really good at borrowing in your head you might do it differently, but I can only carry a maximum of 1-2 numbers before I get frustrated and reach for the calculator."
raisingkids,315gn4,TitoTheMidget,3,Fri Apr 3 03:08:04 2015 UTC,"I challenge anyone and everyone to find a source that ties this to the common core that isn't a conservative mouthpiece.  Common core is a set of standards for what kids should know.  It has nothing to do with how problems are solved.  The standards care that you know how to find the correct answer, not the process by which you come to it.  This image is popular among conservatives because it does what it's designed to do, which is frighten conservatives and reassure them that the government can only make things new and scary. It's intended to reaffirm their bias, and it works smashingly. This is why you'll almost exclusively find it passed around like a forwarded email. Lots of shock and awe but not a single source.  You don't find a source, because common core doesn't suggest a singular method like this."

raisingkids,315gn4,Zombie-Process,-6,Fri Apr 3 14:11:47 2015 UTC,Common Core math uses terrible questions to try to explain something that can be done quicker another away simply due to the question used. It needs to find more logical questions to explain the method.
raisingkids,315gn4,Ledagood,2,Thu Apr 2 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"Your beginning examples are always overly simplified because you want students focusing on the process and understanding how it works, not worrying about the huge and/or complex numbers they're dealing with. It's not different than teaching kids to do basic addition and subtraction by using a handful of apples or oranges. You can just COUNT how many are left and you don't have to figure out how many should be left, but it illustrates the process in a simple way that can later be applied to more complex and practical applications."

But she's got a wicked defiant streak in her. She yells and yells and yells when things aren't going her way, which usually lead to TimeOuts - but she will defy TimeOut, try to leave, and start to get physical if you try to put her back (hitting and kicking). She will make demands by yelling and screaming - which I inform her will not be met. But nothing really seems to work.  I know the yelling is partly to get more attention (weird how you get more attention by yelling when you have two siblings your age) and we try not to respond, but it can be very problematic especially if we're running solo (i.e. hubby is at work or vice versa).  TK;DR: what do you do when timout doesn't work?"

We worked out the best thing to deprive them of if they misbehave, and it works a treat.  'You're going a break if you do X one more time'... where 'going on a break' means no computer time for however many days is fitting the issue.  This works great for our three boys, but our youngest is only five, and she isn't quite as enamoured with those games yet, so it becomes things like 'you don't get a story at bedtime tonight' or other things like that... things that we have no issue with following through on.   Work out something that's easy to deny, but very much wanted by her... see if that works. It'll take a few rounds of actually following through with it for it to have any initial effect probably."

He's always been that way...gets easily frustrated, upset when he perceives he's done something wrong, taking things personally.    The way I handle it is to just sit in my recliner and hold him when he's upset.  When he runs off, I go find him and talk to him about what's bothering him, and help him to deal with his emotions.  And since about the age of 4 1/2, he's responded positively to that, and he gets less frustrated and is better able to handle his frustration.  But like I said, this is after years of helping him learn to manage his feelings and assuring him he is loved (which is hard for a child who's not the baby anymore.)    Some kids are just more sensitive.  Mine had a hard home-life change at the age of 4, so that might have prompted me to baby him a bit more than most parents would, but he's turned out to be a very personable kid who everyone loves because he's so thoughtful...there are ups and downs to this type of personality.

Im not one to discipline with spanking, hitting. Usually, i end up raising my angry voice but I HATE that. Time outs are a good idea, but I never have time for that. We need to eat or clean up because we actually have to go somewhere and have no time for time outs. I also assist a preschool class at times, and I'm great with the kids UNTIL it comes to have control over them. like telling them to stay in the circle at story time. Im too nice, I have no authority. Any advice is welcome!"
raisingkids,2zwerb,chaletdesamis,2,Sun Mar 22 14:33:31 2015 UTC,"I think the key for time outs (since you are interested in the idea) is to introduce them when you have plenty of time to spare (not when about to go somewhere). Kind of like you set things up one day to plan on having a timeout so she can get used to the idea and realize that it's no fun having one. That way when you do have somewhere to be, hopefully the threat of having a timeout is enough to get her to do as she's told."

Time outs are OK when you have time but maybe a hated chore when you don't? So if little one hates say, folding clothes, well because they acted up they must fold clothes. If it's the kids you are sitting for then when snack time comes, they must help serve/clean up so while the other kids are playing they are working. Show then what they must do and walk away. Your kind nature will make it hard for you to see pouty faces and tears that come along with punishment."
raisingkids,2zwerb,msmagicdiva,3,Sun Mar 22 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"time to get firm, not mean   Well put. Disciple doesn't mean being mean or cruel. It means there are rules that we follow and consequences for not following them.   I think the most important thing, though, is anticipation. You have to think ahead and know what the kids are going to resist and figure out ways to ease them into those activities or set aside plenty of time to get them done so there is less pressure."

Have you told him what you expect him to do and made sure he understands the steps he needs to take to get it done?  If you have explained what he needs to do, and he understands the HOW, then ask him what's holding him back and work with him on it.  I see 4 possible issues here:   Your expectations might not be clear.  Your post is not very clear.  What is ""looking into college""?  You need to be specific, if you want him to pick ten colleges to visit, tell him you want him to pick ten colleges to visit. He doesn't know how.  Believe it or not, we aren't born with the knowledge of how to find and apply for part time jobs or narrow down college choices.  Does he need help making a game plan?  Are you making too many assumptions about what he should be able to figure out on his own? There could be a reason he's dragging his feet.  Maybe he's anxious.  Maybe he feels overwhelmed.  You say you badger him, but do you try to find out what's going on in his head? Are your expectations realistic?  It sounds like he has a lot going on with school and extracurricular activities.

raisingkids,2zk7zi,BorgerBill,2,Thu Mar 19 13:13:05 2015 UTC,"Hello!  This is a product that I am interested in both as a father to two young children and as an engineer. I appreciate what you are trying to do, and how you are trying to do it, so I am going to give you as much feedback as I can. This is written in a stream-of-consciousness style. I'm sorry.  First Impressions:  Having only seen the video once, let me say this:   I am still somewhat confused by what the little bot can do. I got the RFID cards with commands, but there was a point when there was a hill or something that enhanced commands would overcome. The cards looked the same to me, and the bot did not seem to conquer the hill. I was left confused. There was no clear progression from young child with cards to programming. I saw older kids with something in their hands, but couldn't decide if this was the same bot or something else. I'm getting that the children will add parts to the bot over time, but I don't think I saw that happening in the video. I did see a claw at one point, but can't be sure where it came from; was it part of the progression, one of the iterations of the design, or an optional feature?   Ok, now I'm going to watch the video again. (I consider the video the single most important part of the Kickstarter page.)  Second Impressions:   Production quality of the video is very high. I looks engaging and is well done. Song at the beginning is cute. Makes me relaxed and ready to learn. Trying to read the thought bubbles while listening to the narration was disconcerting. I was missing information. I felt rushed. Don't forget that I am not just reading words, but assimilating them. I'm looking for confirmation of the words in the video that follows, so don't move on so quickly. Don't have the interesting part of the video under the words. Put it after. The Level One part ended badly. Ok, so there are cards with the notes on them. I assume they are presented to the bot in order, and then ""Go"" results in a tune. That's a fine thing. However, the sound effects are too underwhelming for this to be the first action we see the bot perform. ""Of course it's your real voice, bot! Anyone mocking this up would have made you sound much cooler!"" Level One should have been that boy having so much fun at the beginning. I assume he was pushing the bot around with the cards. He was having fun! ""What can you do with the bot? Almost anything!"" seemed like the wrap-up to Level One, and the ""anything"" was that sound effect. Not good. I think you meant it as a segue to Level Two, and that needs to be made more clear. The Level Two almost looked like it would connect the cards and behaviors, but, instead, the bot says something about getting some wheels. Again, on Level Three there is something about overcoming challenges, but rather than climb the hill, a claw pops out and the hill is moved. If that is supposed to be a pile of something plow-able, rather than terrain, it needs rethinking. Plus, where do the cards come in? It said, ""Teaching me is a great way for us both to learn"", but I don't see any teaching, yet. Ok, then the wrap-up with the ""call to action"" to tell your friends? It certainly needs to be stronger than that. Always tell people exactly what you want them to do, which is pledge.   Ok, essentially, while the video is slick and sets the right mood, I did not come away with an understanding of what the bot does or how the kids work with it. The group shots where really too static, and the bubbles bothered me.  Now, I'm going to read the page.  Third Impressions:   The graphic with the circuit board implies that is what the child will be doing. I don't think you meant that. I'm pretty sure you will scare the straights right away. You should have used a mock-up of the bot. We are now getting somewhere with the ""Plobot activities (draft)"" graphic. I don't get where Touch Sensors falls in the categories. Training cards are light blue, Challenge Cards are purple (I guess sensors are challenges), but Special Go is green while Special Stop is red. Is this all of the cards? I would break this graphic in the three levels, and go in depth on the commands underneath, especially the Challenges. Do you just wave the card and now the bot is a line follower, or does the child have to make it a line follower by just by using the cards? Why only three notes? Also, I now get some sense of how to robot evolves physically. Does everything come with the bot, and it gets pulled out of the box when the child is ready, or do I have to buy them all separately? Also, I see the 3D rendering notes. The video has something in it; can we not get a pic of that bot? (Aren't 3D renders only disallowed by Kickstarter nowadays?) I like the different tops for the bot. Maybe you can have the model available for download so folks can 3D print something specific for themselves. ""Every level comes with..."" seems to answer the question about the upgrade progression and where the parts come from. Hmm, let me check the pledge levels and see what, oh, there we go: $35 for Level 1, $50 for Level 2, and $30 for Level 3. Ok, thoughts:   The fact that it doesn't move first thing out of the box is a little painful. That is a sticking point for me. You are really going to have to sell me on all of the other behaviors and how really engrossed Little Johnny is going to be with the notes A, E, and G, and the red, green, and blue lights until I spring 50 more bucks for the wheels and motors. $85 up front for the bot to move is too steep. That was the first thing I saw in the video!  I'm really stuck here. This is where I click away. I think this might be an example of the phenomena of ""Anchoring"" where I got $35 into my head and then found out it's really $85. It would probably be better to get $115 into my head then find out I can get what I want for ""only"" $85.  Overall, I'm finding this a bit pricey. Is the plastic really digging into your budget? The arduino, RFID reader, motors, cards, even the box, seems pretty standard. Why so much? My personal price points would be $39.99, $19.99, and $24.99, or thereabouts. This is for what I can see. I haven't seen an ""arm"", yet. Maybe it's supremely cool. But the claw, a magnet, some balls, and some cups? Also, I would pay more for Level 3 because it will come some time after we got the bot up and running (I mean that literally). So, it will be less painful by itself in the future.  I guess I would rather see:   Level 1: wheels and motors; most expensive Level 2: lights and sound; least expensive Level 3: grasper and magnets; medium expensive   I have no skill or education regarding pricing. I am simply recording my reactions for your edification.  Ok, running out of steam (Yes, I agree, thank zeus!).  ""limitless sensors"", ""build any project"", and ""open-source flexibility"" are all music to my ears. You could explain how. For instance, right now it seems like the micro-controller is buried inside somewhere. How can we get at it? Are there headers somewhere? Is the software open source, or are the schematics and gerbers available, too? Ok, just got to the FAQ and questions are answered. Sounds great!  Final thoughts:  Having gone over the page with a fine-toothed comb, I really feel like this bot could be great. It's just that the page left me out in the cold with only a little confusing information.  Show-and-tell me more details, more examples, use the mock-up more to show real life use. Either fix the pricing model or sell me better.  Also, re-reading this, I see now what is happening in the video. I shouldn't have to go to this level of effort to understand it, though.  Good luck!"

But you have to keep in mind that however you teach, the standardized tests are real and they matter. Students' scores directly lead to government funding for schools and teacher evaluation. So no matter what you do you have to cover the material that will be on the tests. So that limits what you can do in class, but it doesn't necessarily prescribe how to teach it.  Short answer to your question: I don't know, it's complicated."

raisingkids,2z3byx,dave723,3,Sun Mar 15 04:09:13 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of these childhood developmental studies are oversold in the media. From the article, there is a descriptive longitudinal study that followed children and found that those who were asked to do chores at an early age had some higher measurements to do with self confidence.  The conclusion from that is not that the setting of chores was responsible for the outcome; as it was a descriptive study all you can infer is that the chores were associated. It may be that households that tended to set chores early had other common factors that were more important - maybe to do with discipline, or time management or whatever. You cannot draw the conclusion that setting chores is responsible for these benefits, which is what the title of the piece implies."

Now that I am all grown up I realised they were probably scared shitless most days.   One thing that doesn't shrink though, is their love. Even in the tumultuous teen years it never felt small; the struggle was that it seemed crushingly weighty, so massive that I had to escape to have enough room to breath. And it will probably continue to feel massive, in a good way now, as they literally start to shrink in size as well as abilities and health, even when they are gone."

Let them play pretend on their own or ""read"" a book if they are too young.

This will be hard and tiring, but it shouldn't take more than a few days for him to get it.

Disclaimer: Then he got hand, foot, and mouth disease and started waking up every three hours screaming in pain. The only way for anyone to get any sleep was for me to cuddle him back to sleep. After that he reverted and needed help going back to sleep every night. We are still trying to get back to where we were. Our current deal is that someone puts him to bed, goes downstairs for five minutes, then comes back to ""check on him."" We read him a chapter of a book, pick him up, sing him a song or two, then put him to bed and go downstairs again for half an hour.

Except as provided in §A(2) of this regulation, a finding of indicated child neglect is appropriate when there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that the following four elements are present:  (a) A current or prior failure to provide proper care and attention;  (b) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the failure to provide proper care and attention;  (c) The failure to provide proper care and attention was by the child's parent or caretaker; and  (d) The nature, extent, or cause of the failure to provide proper care and attention indicate that the child's health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.  (2) Neglect—Mental Injury. A finding of indicated child neglect with mental injury is appropriate if there is credible evidence, which has not been satisfactorily refuted, that the following four elements are present:  (a) A current or prior mental injury caused by a failure to provide proper care and attention and characterized by an observable, identifiable, substantial impairment to the child's mental or psychological ability to function, which may be shown by the need for specific psychiatric, psychological, or social work intervention;  (b) The failure to provide proper care and attention to the child was by a parent or caretaker;  (c) The alleged victim was a child at the time of the failure to provide proper care and attention; and  (d) The nature and extent of the failure to provide proper care and attention indicate that the child's health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.  B. Unsubstantiated Child Neglect.  (1) A finding of unsubstantiated child neglect is appropriate if there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of indicated child neglect as described in §A of this regulation or ruled out child neglect as described in §C of this regulation.  (2) A finding of unsubstantiated child neglect may, but need not, be based on the following:  (a) Insufficient evidence that the individual alleged to be responsible for the child neglect was a parent or caretaker;  (b) Insufficient evidence of a failure to provide proper care and attention;  (c) Lack of a credible account by the suspected victim or a witness;  (d) Insufficient evidence that the child's health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of being harmed; or  (e) An inability to complete the investigation due to such factors as not having access to the child or the individual alleged to be responsible for the child abuse or other relevant facts regarding the alleged child neglect.

Since it does, there are three outcomes: they bring a gift, they don't, or they make their gift a contribution to 50% charity / 50% a single, more expensive item. Seems like it hurts no one, helps you avoid clutter, and only increases the amount of money that was ever going to go to charity due to a child's birthday party in the first place.

I know people who do charity parties, but it is usually a charity that the child chooses (animal shelters are popular, as is disaster relief linked to a current event in the news).  And the child does the collecting, usually in a handmade decorative box he makes for the purpose, and then the child gives or sends the donation to the recipient.   The website cuts the birthday child out entirely, and puts the guest in the uncomfortable and awkward position of arriving at the party with nothing to give. Everybody hates 'no gift' parties and some people feel obligated to bring gifts anyway."

If we're trying to normalize kids being competent people who can do simple things like safely walk around their neighbourhood then the last thing that you want people to do is to ask children not in distress if they're okay.

raisingkids,2xx0ax,ChangedDaily,3,Wed Mar 4 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"Ya my then 5 year old walked home and half of the way to kindergarten by herself last year. It was about 1km. On the way there I'd walk with her to the corner then go in the other direction to drop my younger one off at her daycare as she walked the rest of the way by herself. I don't know what to say. She was and is super responsible, hadn't had a tantrum for more than a year and had been walking that route since she could walk. I could think of no reason why she couldn't do the walk alone. It was a huge confidence builder for her.  This year my kids both are in a different school about 1.8 km away.  The commute involves either a 35 minute walk (20mins for me alone) or a ride on public transit. My 6.5 year old could totally do this on her own, but my just turned 5 year old is still impulsive. So I walk with them for now. As soon as the younger one shows that she can do this on her own they'll walk / bus together without me.   I just can't believe that this is an issue and it's totally annoying that teaching your kids independence has been labelled as a fad ""parenting style"". Screw that. This is normal childhood."

They raised me to be a responsible kid. I was walking to school alone since I was about 9 and once I was 11, caught a bus alone to a school a few towns over. It depends a lot on the area and the child themselves. My youngest brother is turning 9 but he isn't as responsible and there is no way that my parents would let him even walk around the corner on his own. Parents need to be able to judge these things based on their children and I don't think there is anything wrong with what these parents did provided the children are responsible and aware."

I would add that the assumption that boys and girls are no different does both genders a disservice.  But in this case the boys get the shorter end of the stick.

They need to play, be physically engaged with nature, see things for themselves and of course make mistakes. That's what parents or guardians are for.

All your son can really do us accept that this is her problem, rather than his. He didn't do anything really wrong, she's just not going to see it that way, and occasionally we run into people like that and have to work around them.

I can understand why two moms from different generations would bump heads, my mom and grandmother fit THAT mold. I'd be looking for people in the same age group. Potentially 'co housing' as /u/AlternativeName mentioned in their reply. Hopefully the friends I was co housing with would have kids of their own along the way too!"
raisingkids,2xfatm,AlternativeName,3,Sat Feb 28 17:40:54 2015 UTC,"My personal experience is two-fold;  both in how I was raised, and how I was involved with my friend's son.  Growing up I spent a lot of time with my aunts and uncles, I would spend most weekends with one particular Aunt and Uncle and on other weekends I would spend Saturdays with a different Aunt.  Not to mention frequent interaction with the rest of my family (Other aunts, uncles, grandparents)  I can't even begin to describe the enormous benefit to my life that my large, and interactive, family situation provided me.  Not to mention my parents were able to ensure that they had fresh batteries for the rest of the week.  Being a parent is hard work and if you don't take time for yourself you will quickly burn out and you will not function to the best of your ability.  As an adult I had very close friends move into a spare apartment I had at my house and in that time my awesome little nephew was born.  Our living areas were distinct, but the doors were always open and it was one of the best situations of my life in that 2 year time span.  It was wonderful for me to parent with training wheels on, my wife and I gained so much practical experience and insight into the parenting game.  We were also a huge benefit to my friends who never had to figure out a sitter, never had to be nervous about the caregivers, or wonder when they could squeeze the next shower in.  For my nephew, our ability to mold, shape, and influence him can't be understated, there are just some things that his parents can't make him do that he will do for his aunt and uncle.  Now that I've gone on a tangent about my awesome experiences here is my advice:  Check out co-housing  it's not quite like living in an apartment building or condo complex nor is it like living on a hippy commune, it's somewhere in between.   I think the whole village thing is the only way to raise a child, but you need to be mindful of your village and if you want those people influencing your child.  Also, the people have to be willing there are some out there that want nothing to do with your child and anything that goes along with having a child in their presence."

I can't imagine a better way to experience child rearing than with a co housing situation like you had with your nephew. I would obviously only want to co house with people who loved kids and would be willing to put in a chunk of their time for years to helping. If possible I'd aim for doing what you did for your nephew, then trying to have kids of my own."
raisingkids,2xfatm,waggytalk,2,Sat Feb 28 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"When I think of that saying I don't really think it means that the parenting burden should be shared equally over a large group of people. I don't think it's stating a should, it's stating a current reality. Parents are not the only person raising your child. When your child is having a tantrum in public, and no-one says anything to you or the child about his behaviour, the child learns something from that. When your child goes to school/nursery/homeschool co-op activities - all kinds of interactions you have no control over teach your child all kinds of things you have no control over. When you are walking down the street and you cast your eyes away from the homeless people begging for change, your child is learning things from you and from them. When you sit your child in front of the TV your child is learning things from all the people who were involved in the production of the programs and advertisements. Your little family bubble is not your child's world and it never can be - you can't keep the world out - you can't pretend it's not there and it's values don't matter.  It's saying, you can't just say ""if you don't want your kid watching violence on tv, turn it off"" - because your kids friends will all have watched violence on tv and even if he doesn't watch it directly he'll absorb the culture on the playground. Its saying ""if you don't like the sexualisation of little girls, don't buy your daughters skimpy outfits"" but your daughter's peer group is going to have a worldview shaped by a society that expects her to understand and engage in sexual behaviours and sexual manipulation at ever younger ages.   You can't control it at the level of your child so if you care you have to address it at the level of your ""village""."

raisingkids,2xdbmg,coyotebored83,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"""click for transcript"" didn't work for you? Here's a copy & paste of the transcript, although the formatting on the actually website is nicer.  We all want our kids to learn about consent. We want them to know that “no” means “no” and only an enthusiastic “yes” means “yes” as they grow older and get into sexual relationships. But I think the things we might be missing is that we’ve been undermining the idea of consent since they were very young. And so, even when we get to the point of explicitly teaching them about it, it’s really not that strong of a teaching because all of our other interactions with them have possibly undermined the idea of consent.  So, I would like to talk about four ways that parents sometimes teach kids that consent doesn’t matter.  The first is tickling and other types of roughhouse play. Now, I think that tickling and being silly and pretending to eat my kids’ feet is one of the greatest parenting skills out there. So, I definitely don’t really think that tickling is bad or roughhousing is bad.  I think the important thing is that the minute your kid says “no,” you stop. Even if you know they are kidding, teach them that “no” means the other person will stop. They’ll learn both that their “no” matters, and they’ll learn that if someone says no to them, that they should immediately listen.  Now, with my kids I know if they say no and I stop, they’ll come and put their foot back in my mouth, because they don’t really mean “no,” they want me to keep chewing, it was just a game. Or they’ll pull the shirt up again and ask me to tickle. And that’s fine, so we keep going on. But I do immediately listen to the word “no”.  The other thing about tickling is that sometimes kids don’t say “no”. They think that, you know, you’re having a lot of fun at it and that they’re supposed to like it. So if you are tickling a child and then you stopped so that they can catch their breath, first of all, let them catch their breath, and if they really still want you to tickle, they will indicate that. They’ll lift their shirt back up so you can get their belly, or they’ll nudge you, or my daughter will say “Mommy, do it again!”  So, I think it is important to make sure that rough-and-tumble play or tickling, those types of physical games, that is really important that we make it very consensual and teach them that “no” means “no.”  The second way that we sometimes teach kids that consent doesn’t matter is by contradicting their feelings. I think this is a huge problem because it just comes so naturally. I’ve talked about this before where a kid says “I’m cold” and we say “No you’re not, it’s hot in here” or “I’m hungry”, “No you’re not, you just ate.” “I’m tired”, “No you aren’t, you just got up from your nap.” I think that we, in our minds as parents, we know “What? Why are they saying this? She can’t be hungry, she just ate.”  But by saying so, we teach them not to trust their own instincts and their own feelings, and then these are feelings that we want them to trust when they’re in their twenties and they’re in a situation that they are not feeling comfortable with, we want them to trust their gut reaction.  So, instead of contradicting kids, we can just ask them an open-ended in a neutral way. So, when your child says “It’s cold in here”, you can say “Is it? I’m kind of hot in here.”  Here’s another big one. “I hate grandma.” That’s the type of thing that really triggers us to be like, “No you don’t. Don’t say that. That’s my mother. You love grandma and grandma loves you.” You can immediately start spilling out all of these denials of their feelings because we don’t want them to hate grandma and we probably know that they don’t hate grandma.  But the thing is, that contradiction of their feelings isn’t helping the long-term goal of having them trust their feelings. So, once again, an opened an open-ended question like “You do? I think grandma really loves you,” or, “Last week you had a lot of fun with grandma. Are you sure?”  The third way that we sometimes teach kids that consent isn’t important, is through forced hugs and kisses, and this is all in the guise of teaching politeness. We want them to give Uncle Joe a hug and a kiss when you see him because he is their elder and it is important to respect him in that way and because he wants a hug and a kiss, regardless of how your child is feeling. And the idea being that if they don’t go give Uncle Joe a hug and a kiss, it reflects poorly on you, that your kids are rude or standoffish or whatever. And we worry about that as parents, and so then we end up, you know, whether it’s by force or coercion, getting our kids to hug and kiss someone that they don’t want to.  This is a huge red flag. You know, we don’t want our teen daughters or teen sons to be in a sexual situation where they are feeling like they don’t really want to continue. But they feel like they can’t say anything because they have come as far and it would be rude to stop, or that type of thing. This is exactly the problems that we get in young adults with not asking for consent but also not being able to give it because you don’t feel that you have that place to say “No, I’m not comfortable with this. We need to stop right now.”  So, it’s very important not to make your kids hug and kiss or shake hands or anything like that, you know. You know Uncle Joe, you saw him last year and if Uncle Joe asks for a hug and kiss, you can say “Do you wanna give him a hug and kiss or just wave hi?” And then have a wave hi or blow a kiss, whatever is comfortable in your family for some type of non-touching related greeting.  And also you don’t have to force your kid to greet someone that they don’t want. We often are forcing our kids to hug relatives that to them, they don’t really remember–very distant relatives. And then we wonder why sexual abuse is frequently a family member and why the kids didn’t tell Mom and Dad. Well, they have been taught their whole lives that they should respect their elders, that they should be giving physical affection to family members. So, it becomes very hard for them to then say “I was touched in an inappropriate way.”  So, this one has a really big implication right now for child sexual abuse. You really want your kids to know that they can say no and they never have to be touched in the way that they don’t want to be touched. And also for when they are older, so they feel like whenever they get that feeling in their stomach that “I don’t wanna do this next thing, I don’t wanna be touched in this way,” that they know that they can say no.  Alright, and the fourth way that we sometimes teach kids that consent doesn’t matter, kind of plays off the last one, and that is just generally respecting your elders. Right now on Pinterest, a very popular article is getting pinned a lot about the interrupt rule.  And this is a rule that kids, if they instead of coming and interrupting you when you’re on the phone or you’re talking to another adult in person that you teach them to put their hand on your shoulder, so that you know they need them and you can put your hand back, acknowledging that. “I acknowledge that you need me; I’ll be just a second.” It’s to teach your kids not to interrupt.  I don’t particularly have anything wrong with that rule. Interrupting can be rude and it’s very polite to interrupt in a non-verbal way if you can. And it’s also important to teach kids the difference between an emergency that they would need to just burst in and start screaming about and “I want a juice box,” which maybe want them to wait a second because you’re on an important phone call.  So, I don’t have a problem with the idea of teaching your kids the etiquette of interruption. However, the article talks about never interrupting adults, because you need to respect your elders. And that terminology really rubbed me the wrong way. The idea that because someone is older than you that what you think matters less, is nothing but a power play.  It’s teaching them that the person who is older, bigger, stronger is more important than what they want. And then we wonder why we sometimes have adults that are in abusive relationships. When really we’ve modeled for them that size equals power, age equals power, you know whatever characteristic there might be, equals power, and that means that your ideas are less than that person who has the power.  The other thing being for me is that respect is something that’s earned. It’s not just automatically given and I don’t mean that you should be completely rude to someone until they have proven that they are worthy of your respect. I’m also teaching kindness towards everyone. But this idea that someone, just because of their age, automatically should be deferred to without trusting your own thoughts and feelings about that person is just false.  So, once again, I’m not against the interrupt rule and teaching etiquette about interrupting. But I am against using the reason that “Respect your elders”, it’s kind of like using “Because I’m your mom and I said so.” It’s not teaching them anything, if anything that it’s teaching them that power is the most important thing in the world. And if you have power, you can force it on other people. And that’s really not what we wanna teach, so, I think respect your elders is just kind of a lazy shorthand that doesn’t do what we are hoping that it will do.  So, those are four ways that we sometimes teach our kids that consent is not important, that you might not be thinking of. So, addition to explicitly talking about consent as it applies to sexual relationships as your kids enter the teen years, think too how you’re treating even your one and two years olds, and how you might be undermining the concept of consent even at that age. And I think you’ll have a kid that is much better prepared to hold their own and trust their instincts and say no when they mean no when they’re teenagers."

About half of the time, I play the apps with her, and enforce certain rules, working from left to right and explicitly voicing the letters in Endless Alphabet for example.

raisingkids,2x0mb4,ozyman,5,Tue Feb 24 18:44:37 2015 UTC,"TL;DR   When Should I Start?  As soon as your kids start asking about money, since studies show they’re already sizing other children during their preschool years. The child-development Ph.D.s who work behind the scenes at Sesame Street determined that preschool-age kids can distinguish between wants and needs.  If not then, do it right after the tooth fairy comes.    How Much Should Allowance Be?  Start with a dollar a week or so per year of age, and divide the money among three containers: save, spend, and give. This is a rough approximation of an adult budget, so it’s literally foundational.  But Why Even Bother?  Allowance is instructional, and money is a tool for learning. We don’t yank kids’ books or art supplies when they don’t finish their chores (or don’t do them well, or whine while doing them), so we shouldn’t take money away either.  Most parents link chores and allowance. If you do, there will come a point when your kids have enough money and decline to do chores. What are you going to do then?"
raisingkids,2x0mb4,another_single_dad,11,Tue Feb 24 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"I don't like the three containers approach.    Forced giving isn't a gift; it's a tax and the kid's probably going to stop ""giving"" as soon as you stop enforcing it. Instead, you should work to cultivate the core values of humility and charity so that the child eventually decides to give of his own accord.  Similarly, forced saving doesn't create discipline. The child is liable to stop saving as soon as the enforcement wanes. Instead, you should try to teach your child why it's important to delay his gratification. With that in mind, I offer my son a handsome interest rate on his savings. He spent the first two years flat broke, but he eventually figured it out and he's now spent the past two years with more money than he knows what to do with. He's 9 years old and he already knows how to live off his interest while protecting his principal."

After his last birthday, I informed him that the rate will decrease by 1% each year, so that by the time he's 18, he'll somewhat close to the real world.   At some point we'll have to talk about investment accounts vs. savings accounts, but for the time being, I just want him to get used to balancing his short-term wants and his long-term wants.

I sing lullabyes and rock my daughter to sleep every day at naptime. It's the highlight of my day. And it hasn't ruined her. On the contrary, it's set a routine. So I can put her down no matter where we are. And as she's grown, she doesn't really need it. Plenty of days I put her down with barely a song sung. I can even put her down awake, and she goes asleep on her own. I do it because it's enjoyable and makes her feel secure and bonded  to her mom."

Sometimes it's hard to hangout with a mom you don't know well and that's all you know you have in common. Or maybe she's a full time mom who doesn't have time to do anything else so that's all she has to bring that's consistently new to the conversation.   Even with my non mommy friends I often speak a lot about my child. Do they want to hear everything?  Probably not but they are good friends who listen anyways and I acknowledge that that's usually the main thing that has changed a lot since we last spoke.  In return I listen to them and their stories no matter how exciting or mundane they might be.

The author clearly has his heart in the right place but he's totally and utterly lost. The adult world does NOT equal the working world. being an adult doesn't mean a person who has a well paying job. And honestly, how many adults actually enjoy their work? Why are adults like the author expecting the kids to look forward to something they themselves clearly despise?  If the author can realise what being an adult truly means--a person with a fully grown physical body and fully formed mental capacities who is able to freely make evey decision about his own life--then yes school is absolutely about raising kids to be an adult. If he can only see adulthood as this sad sad permanent worker bee life, then OF COURSE that is not what school should be."
raisingkids,2wk9pr,Chocobean,5,Fri Feb 20 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"I found this article very interesting, especially as an advisor in a federally funded college program that serves underrepresented secondary ed. population groups. I think you hit the nail on the head as far as this author's blind spot. The anecdotes are certainly illustrative of teenagers, however the author's perspective of human motivation is not well developed. And, perhaps, there is some romanticizing of youth. It is at the same time rife with anxiety, not only from adults but peers and internally as expected in any time of change. Anyway, the author doesn't mention intrinsic motivators like autonomy, mastery and purpose, which really take time to uncover. This is the angle I tend to take with students. The adult world is where you can master and share your own original passions."
raisingkids,2wk9pr,aibee,2,Fri Feb 20 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Wow. This was painful to read. Talk about conceited - the author clearly has a singular view of success.   Finally, nearly two-thirds of the students reported that they would rather have a ""fun job for their favorite team or band"" for $30,000-a-year salary.   Shame on them, not wanting to become adults! Everyone knows that an adult works a job he hates, comes home to a spouse they don't even like and saves for his childrens' college education.   What does this mean for me as a teacher? For starters, I have to stop basing some of my lessons on the assumption that they are consciously interested in joining the workforce   So, what, exactly? People who would rather do something they enjoy for a smaller salary aren't a part of the work force?  I agree with some of the points the author has made about not handing teenagers rights without responsibility, but I just can't get behind the premise of this article: people have different priorities than me, and I think that's a problem."
raisingkids,2wk9pr,CynicLibrarian,2,Fri Feb 20 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"Well you have to understand the background of the author as a teacher in the US doe.

There are 6 people in our household..It's honestly easier if I just do the laundry daily.
raisingkids,2vwjmd,st_claire,2,Sun Feb 15 02:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so that's probably it. Asking about ""garbage"" lets him save face a bit. But really you shouldn't worry about talking to him about things like masterbation, it's totally normal and healthy for a kid his age to be doing. And having an open dialog about things like sex means he is more likely to come to you with questions later on.   You should really try to get him doing laundry, changing his sheets, etc... though. While it may be easier to just do it yourself, it's doing him a disservice as it won't prepare him for life on his own later. Maybe you can give him a timeslot to do his laundry in, like Saturday afternoons for example? At the very least, you can easily have him put everything in a hamper and fold and put his clean stuff away, and strip and remake his bed, etc... But I really do encourage you to try to find a time he can use the machine himself so that the whole process from start to finish is his responsibility. I've seen way too many kids get to university and not know how to do their own laundry.  Also remember that many hands make light work. You're 6 people, so you can all share chores (obviously younger children can't do all chores but certainly they can do some), and you might find that, after the initial extra work of teaching them how, your workload around the house actually gets easier :)"

raisingkids,2vwjmd,st_claire,2,Sun Feb 15 03:23:03 2015 UTC,"Just another thought to add to all this. Sit him down, chat about the stank, talk him through all the stuff he needs to do to keep himself and his rooms clean and then point out that if he doesn't do it, you will and you generally leave his room to himself so he has his privacy. You don't want to impinge on his privacy by doing a major clean of his room but if he CHOOSES to live in squalor then he will leave you no option but to clean every nook and cranny in there.... Might be a good incentive for a 14yo!  And to piggyback on the chores thing. Definitely get him doing regular chores. He should be able to cook a meal from start to finish, bake, do laundry, iron, clean a bathroom / toilet, loads of other stuff at 14. My mum had all 4 of us doing chores on a Saturday morning. We'd have a job each; dusting, hoovering, bathrooms, random stuff too, we'd all rip round the house, get it done and head off to do what we'd planned for the day. Easy."

raisingkids,2vgeod,MarianneDashwood,2,Wed Feb 11 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"I agree.

I have the same experience you describe-- when I was small, I lived on Oscar Meyer bologna and pepsi.  My kids eat a very diverse diet, including a wide variety of ethnic foods that I would have never eaten as a child.   Lastly, I think the author also fails to recognize that there has been a huge uptick in the number of children with autism spectrum disorders and sensory processing disorders. Children who are not neurotypical may have such sensitive noses and taste buds that bland foods may be all they'll tolerate-- that's not a sign of bad parenting or parents' refusal to stand firm during family dinner; that's a sign of parents who are accommodating the needs of their children."

You would explain that some people have sadly abhorrent and dreadfully wrong beliefs.  You don't believe in god.  So the angle you should take is that in your opinion, people who believe in god perhaps haven't had the chance to review the evidence, or have been misled into believing things that there is no evidence for, or are too frightened to consider a world without god.  You can treat them with compassion and sympathy, but don't create a false equivalency to your logic, science and reason-based worldview."
raisingkids,2up9cn,follier,5,Thu Feb 5 05:31:58 2015 UTC,I think the atheist parents' job is to let their kids have a choice to find a religion  or don't.    Religious kids don't get that choice.   That's what it's all about.
raisingkids,2up9cn,SpanishInfluenza,3,Wed Feb 4 08:24:53 2015 UTC,"…I would never indoctrinate my children by teaching them there is only one right way to think about the big questions of life…   But that is indoctrination.  It is positive and inclusive, but it certainly also favors and instills in your children your preferred perspective.   My perspective is that, try as one might, a parent cannot be present in a child's life without indoctrinating them into some set of core principles.  So if you want your kid to truly have a choice in what to believe, what can you do?  The only answer I've come up with is this: You can grant your child the ability to step down from the machinery of unavoidable indoctrination by making the questioning of core principles a key part of the indoctrination.  That way, they have the means to embrace a different worldview than yours without going through the trauma of tearing asunder the belief system they had constructed to that point.  In fact, it's sort of a trap: If you've indoctrinated your child to question their core principles, their rejection of your teaching can only really be accomplished by questioning their core principles — which, of course, reinforces your lesson.  In the end, I doubt this is operationally different than the author's intent to avoid indoctrination.  We're both going to do our best to teach our kids to keep an open mind about others' beliefs, even if we've rejected some of those beliefs ourselves.  It's just a different perspective: You can't not indoctrinate your child, so at least give them the means to dismantle their indoctrination. (Though, in a way, not really.)"

raisingkids,2uk6sb,Darlingniki1,10,Mon Feb 2 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"I get it, it's hard to watch someone else appear to not appreciate their child when you are so completely devoted to yours and are acutely aware of how little precious time you get while they're young. But you really can't know how much she loves her daughter, and if she says she needs a break, she probably does. It's good, however annoying, that she's asking for help. And it's good that you're setting clear boundaries with what you will and will not do. I hope you can each handle each other's styles, be there for each other and maintain the friendship!"

raisingkids,2uk6sb,MrsChimpGod,4,Mon Feb 2 22:18:35 2015 UTC,"It's funny how people can change inwardly if you can get them to change how they act publicly.  Social pressure is one of the best ways to change how they ""act"" and you might not have to be heavy handed about it.  Just set a good example and ignore her whenever she makes a comment.  If that doesn't make headway, you can always make it slightly more awkward for her.  Once she stops talking like her kid is burden, the theory is that she might stop acting like it as well.  Sort of the parental version of ""fake it till you make it""."

If you don't want to watch the kid then just say no, you can't.  Don't make her feel guilty for needing a break because I bet she already feels bad about it, whether she shows that or not.    I can not be a good, loving mother when I'm consumed with anxiety and completely overwhelmed.  I do need a break sometimes because I love my child and I need to refresh in order to be a good mom."
raisingkids,2uk6sb,chiefredmayne,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"I had a friend like this. She would constantly ask me to get a sitter for my son, so that I would go out with her so she wouldn't be lonely. 97% of the time I would say no. Than she gets in a committed relationship and decides he's more important. This guy basically did me a favor because it's been 1 and a half since we've spoken. If your friend lives at home with her mom than why isn't grandma watching the child?? Just curious. My best advice is to have a sit down chat with this friend and tell her that it's not right for her to use you. With someone like her it's best to be as blunt as possible. If she stops talking to you than she wasn't really a good friend to begin with. Good luck!"

Plenty of people told her to love them more; she knew that was how she was meant to be; something went wrong along the way and she didn't feel anything.

Write on the glass with erasable markers so you can change the info as your child grows  13) Use a disposable coffee lid to keep popsicles from turning into a huge mess  14) Instead of having to cut each piece of food into tiny bites with a knife, use a pizza cutter  15) A fan keeps their forts cool AND upright  16) Turn old drawers into bookshelves to save room.  17) Cover a pack and play with a fitted sheet, and your child can stay cool outside without being eaten alive by bugs.  18) Tie a sheet around a table, and your child has a hammock.  19) Use a pool noodle under a fitted sheet to keep your child from falling out of bed.  20) A pool noodle keeps little fingers from getting caught in the door  21) Use an upside down crazy straw in your child's drink so they can't pull it out.  22) Soothe sore gums during teething by freezing a pacifier in an ice try with their favorite drink.  23) Put a sign below the toilet paper so they know how much to tear off  24) Use a hot glue gun to seal bath toys. They’ll never get moldy inside again!  25) Empty soap bottles become water balloon pumps.  26) Cut open a lotion bottle to make a longer faucet so small hands can reach the water.  27) Get your kids to love food they'd usually ignore by adding sprinkles  28) After cutting apple slices, put them back together with rubber bands to keep them from going brown by lunch time."

raisingkids,2u7ieb,ozyman,6,Fri Jan 30 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"Ispa’s study, which included more than 2,000 mothers and their children,[...] found that mothers’ tendencies to display controlling behaviors predicted the extent to which the children viewed their mothers positively or negatively when the children were in fifth grade.  She said that these results did not differ by ethnicity or gender of the children.  “Mothers who are very directive when their children are toddlers often tend to still be controlling when their children enter adolescence,” Ispa said. “With small children, mothers mostly use physical controls, but when children are older these directives become more verbal and psychological, such as by restricting what children are allowed to say or by not allowing them to speak their minds. It’s not surprising that their children begin to view them in a negative light.”    “Many times, parents think that employing these controlling behaviors is the ‘right way’ to raise children, but our research shows that really does not work,” Ispa said. “Allowing children age-appropriate levels of autonomy to make safe decisions is very good for kids, and they usually will make wise decisions when they have been taught about safe choices as well as consequences. A good place for parents to start would be to have open discussions and allow their children to express their own points of view. When giving children instructions, explain reasons for decisions rather than simply saying, ‘Because I said so.’”"

No, they don't need the hep vaccines, or pnuemocaco pnemonia (or whatever it is called). And the flu vaccine? seriously? In 99.99% (maybe I exaggerate) it is not life threatening. Or even that much worse then a cold.  Some things are more 'risky' to avoid the vaccine.

So I say in all sincerity: knock it off with pushing the science already!  Teach them to think first. Literature and history to teach them to reason, reflect, analyze, and think deeply, math for logic, arts for creativity.   You do of course want to give them a decent foundation in the various sciences, and I would prefer the goal to be science literacy in high school.

I think that the way to get kids loving math and learning higher concepts in the early years is to let them play fun games with numbers and throw out the worksheets and grades.  My 4 year old in JK plays over/under dice games at school, complete with betting. The grade 1s play Yahtzee and they've not only been learning more addition, but also have started to figure out probabilities and other higher math concepts. I'd much rather that they be doing these fun activities where they learn in spite of themselves rather than worksheets.  I also recommend http://bedtimemath.org/ for fun math games / problems to solve with kids (kind of like reading to your kids every day, but for math)"
raisingkids,2tz5is,Cbrantford,2,Wed Jan 28 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed! My 6-yr-old son is great at math, although I don't think he's ever done a worksheet (he doesn't attend school, and while we homeschool, we don't do ""school at home""). We do lots of board games here.   At the end of his Kindergarten year, I came up with a list of things he could do, based on what I've seen him do for fun or in games or in the car:   How to count to a trillion How to count money, and make change. No problem doing this unassisted when playing Monopoly, and he figures out his own mortgages (we have an old set so it doesn't tell you the 10% payback amount that some of the new versions do). He can double the rent on his properties in his head, too. How to multiply single digits, 10s, and 100s. A tiny bit of division - like dividing something by 2, 3, or 4 Basic fractions - 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 Measuring feet, mm, inches Telling time. Figuring out how many more minutes until something. Addition of small & large numbers. So he can add 1000 + 48 no problem, and 41+48... both of which he does just in his head.  Adding & subtracting negative numbers.   He does a lot of conversational math without realizing it. Watching the GPS estimate how many minutes left, and asking what time our event starts, and figuring out how many minutes early we will arrive.  He found out a friend's birthday was on the 27th and his is on 19th, and he immediately replied, ""Oh! You were born 8 days after I was born!""  A lot of what he does, I realize I didn't figure out until 4th grade. I wasn't exposed to it, though. He does seem to have an aptitude for numbers. I remember the tedious repetition and review of information I already knew. Even though they'd try to make it ""fun"".   I dislike Monopoly, but I put up with it because he loves it and there's so much opportunity for math in it.   He's also counted how much money is in the entire set. Once he added up how much it would cost to buy every house for every property. He painstakingly did this using the information on the cards, and the money as placeholders as he went along. Then when he'd run out of money, he'd write subtotals on the board and restock the bank so he could continue adding. He did this for hours. For fun, because he wanted to. I kept my mouth shut and got other things done, bored at the very idea of what he wanted to do but not wanting to let on about it."

Also, found this suggestions elsewhere on reddit:   For a two year old: Candyland or Snails Pace Race  For a three year old: Richard Scarry's Busy Townor Orchard  For a three and a half year old: Monster Chase  For a four year old: Animal Upon Animal or My First Carcassonne  For a five year old: Rhino Hero or Monza or Whoowasit  For a six year old: Catan Jr or Toc Toc Woodsman  For a seven year old: Mice and Mystics or Forbidden Island or Sushi Go or Carcassonne etc   The only one of those we played was Animal upon Animal which my daughter didn't really like (also candyland).  Have you played any of those?"
raisingkids,2tz5is,ozyman,2,Tue Feb 3 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"We've played Candyland (don't like it), Snails Pace Race (I like this for littles), Richard Scary's Boardgame (there are 2 of these, one is just a remake of Candyland, the other I've never played)  Catan Jr is great, but I wouldn't wait until age 6. My 6-yr-old now plays adult Settlers of Catan. 3 & 4-yr-olds can play Catan Jr with some assistance the first few times until they're familiar with it and to play without adult help.  3-yr-old games we liked (some of these are physical, and/or you don't even have to take turns):   Puppy Racers Hungry Hungry Hippo Fishing Game Arch Rival (says 8+ but I have no idea why, I think it's a great game for all ages 3 - 99) ABSeas fishing bingo (as soon as your kid knows alphabet letters) 1, 2, 3 Go Memory  Dominoes Hullabaloo (need to know colors/animals) Hi Ho Cheerios / Sneaky Snacky Squirrel / Shelby's Snack Shack (best of these 3 similar games) Snails Pace Race Elefun Uno Thomas Train Math Game Peanut Butter & Jelly game Storybook Game   A lot of these games can be introduced at 3 but enjoyed even more or played at harder levels at ages 4 or 5.   Other games we like that probably don't work for age 3:   Sequence for kids Set Chess (start by teaching ""playing"" drills like pawns vs. king) Enchanted Forest Star Wars Stratego Blokus Monopoly Deal (once they can read) Clue (once they can read, but skip Clue Jr as it takes writing skills, which defeats the purpose of a junior game IMO) Cribbage Fluxx (must read) Ticket to Ride  Pentago Mastermind Jr    I'm a big fan of rule modifications if adults are playing children. For example, Clue we play with a rule modification so that the younger players play the ""easy"" way and get to see every clue card shown, while the older players only get to see the clue they are shown on their own turn. That helps even the game out with mixed ages. ;)   Come to think of it, at age 5, the majority of the games we played with modifications when it's my son & I or mixed age kids. That's one of the things I love about knowing a game well, is knowing how to level the playing field, so that older ones can actually play a real game, but younger ones have a real chance of still winning. And as skill levels increase, the advantage to the younger players becomes less and less until it's gone and they're playing the real game setup/rules.   When we play Pente, for example, I let my son start out with 3 pieces on the board instead of 1. I did that with my husband when he first started the game. Probably a year he played with 3 pieces at the start, then we switched to 2 once he was regularly beating me, then finally he started playing with just 1.  With Chess, I used to play against my son without my rooks & queen (and he got all his pieces. Then without my queen. Now I play with all my pieces, but he often wins anyway. In Stratego, I show him where my bombs and flag are located (I turn around those pieces)... I still beat him the majority of the time, but he has figured out how to effectively use his spy to capture my highest piece, and he at least has a chance of winning while I play a ""real"" game with him. The advantage over leveling the playing field means that they learn good skills from observing your play, versus ""letting"" them win. I of course explained the idea of handicap to my son and he's aware of when we're playing with one. It's also fun to see him play his friends and decide to put himself at a disadvantage in order to level the playing field."
raisingkids,2tz5is,sprgtime,2,Wed Feb 4 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"We play the full Settlers of Catan with our 6 and almost 5 year old. They can both play just fine (the almost 5 year old is not a good strategy player and just tries to get development cards and build roads every turn, also she can't read, so she does need some stuff read to her.) We also usually only play to 8 points.  Other popular games in our house that both of the kids play with us and against each other are Jenga, Uno, Rummycub (rummy tiles), checkers, Spot It, Go, chess (kids are learning in school), a handful of real card games and Tangrams."

raisingkids,2tz5is,ozyman,2,Tue Feb 3 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"Ok so they use poker chips for the betting part. Let's say they're playing ""roll to 6"" One kid rolls and gets a 3. They then record that roll (either with notation 111 or if they can, they write the 3). They then have to figure out what number they need on the next roll to add up to six. They then record what number they're going for, in this case, a 3. The kids then bet a chip on whether the next roll is going to be over/ under or the exact number. The winner takes the chips. It's cute, they love playing it and it really does teach these young kids good number sense."

He's an only child, he didn't have any daily interactions with other kids - and was very high-strung socially, often getting locked up and upset if interactions didn't go the way he expected.   After just a few months, he was far less brittle, and had gained a huge amount of resilience and social fluency.   He's sometimes a little annoyed at always being the youngest in his class, but at the same time he can't stand kids younger than himself...

Encourage and show your enthusiasm, but don't make a big deal of things that aren't going well. Your kid is in control and if they feel pushed instead of leading, it often backfires.   If you don't already - dump his poop from the diaper into the toilet. Let him watch you flush it. Do it a bunch of times - like every time he poops, if you can. Be matter-of-fact, not shaming. ""This is where poop belongs, so I'm putting it there""  Many kids respond well to playfulness. You could try playing up ""sneaky poop"" and see if he likes the idea. ""Oh, that sneaky poop got in your diaper again! It sure is sneaky/fast! One day we'll get him right into the toilet. Haha, sneaky poop, I've flushed you away again!"""

If he insists on going in his diaper still, I might treat it as we did for all potty training and start the sticker chart up again, and once he uses a toilet for that so many times he gets a reward.  Truth be told my daughter was not interested in pleasing her parents when it came to potty training, but it was my mother that made potty training fun for her. (We did all the standard things like sticker charts, rewards, hell even bribed her with mini m&ms but Grandma just made Trying things ""fun"").

raisingkids,2t9pdp,Aliisonify,5,Thu Jan 22 07:47:11 2015 UTC,"Reading your post I draw a few conclusions:   By discipline you mean punishment. You expect that punishing/hurting a child will make the child better. You believe that a 4-year old's actions are based on choices and can be judget as ""good"" or ""bad"".   Many adults believe the above based on common parenting practices based on lack of awareness of child development and child psychology. The dominant parenting style is very old and tends to repeat itself if left unquestioned.  Punishment works in achieving temporary compliance at the cost of losing trust forever. If the child is punished, he will likely become more stressed and confused, and will ""act out"" more. He will also become more secretive and will know that the adults are not on his side. Therefore, he will likely not ask for help or advice and will avoid being vulnerable and open as these may lead to vindication and punishment.  In the long term, discipline/punishment does not have a positive effect in and has many negative effects. A child fearing their parent grows with neuroses which could lead to anxiety disorder, rebellion, bad memory, bullying etc.   A 4-year old's actions are happening mostly spontaneously. At this age the ability to choose and will one's actions is still very much in development. If the child acts strange, that is because he is under a lot of stress, feels confused, feels anxious etc., which makes him less aware of his surroundings (the fire), less responsive, more likely to engage in conflict, more likely to withdraw in fantasy (""these are my sweaters"") and dissociate from reality. These are all symptoms of a child who needs attention, listening, parental presence, HELP.  Hurting someone who is already hurt and needs help is not help. Hurting someone does not make them better, it just makes them hurt.  Some reading if you really want to help:  Unconditional Parenting by Alfie Kohn Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves by Naomi Aldort << this one has a lot of suggestions for ""difficult"" children."

raisingkids,2t9pdp,AngMoKio,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"Corporal punishment in the home:       Domestic corporal punishment (also referred to as corporal punishment in the home or parental corporal punishment) is the use of physical force for the purpose of correction or control of behavior from parent/guardian to child.   It typically involves the corporal punishment of a child by a parent or guardian in the home—normally the spanking or slapping of a child with the parent's open hand, but occasionally with an implement such as a belt, slipper, cane or paddle. This form of punishment is associated with and used in the authoritarian parenting style.

raisingkids,2t9pdp,autowikibot,2,Thu Jan 22 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"Well by discipline what is usually done for him is being put in time out for 4 minutes or if he has done something worse then he just gets a pat on the butt. No one here beats him and we know better not to beat him because he is only a kid. And the few times we do put him in time out we tell him why he is being put there and tell him what he did wrong then give him a hug and tell him we love him. So he doesn't think he is being punished for no reason.  We only started doing these things recently when I started going to parenting class and we watched a video on defiant children vs a willful child. Best ways to handle them when they act out.  My parents and I do our best to always do these things when we watch him and he isn't use to it because it isn't something that is done consistently at home. However he does listen to us and will begin to act better for example he realizes that throwing his cars at his brother is wrong and we put him in time out and explain what he did was wrong and reassure we aren't mad and that we love him, then he tells him brother sorry and will begin to play right. But if he does the same thing with his mom and I'm around and I see I'll try the same tactics but since his mom is there and he knows she is technically the one in charge of him he won't listen to me. I'll say hey that's wrong, remember last time? Do you want time out again? And he will smile and say no because mommy is here and she doesn't put him in timeout.  That's the hard part is getting her to get involved. So naturally when it's just her and the kids at home things happen and messes are made. She pretty much allows all of those things to be done because she never keeps an eye on her kids. It's frustrating as her sister to watch her be like this, and lately she is saying she wants a third child and I'm like why do you want another one when you barely even watch the two you have now. It's hard."
raisingkids,2t9pdp,obviousoctopus,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"The issue with punishment-based parenting is that it does hurt the child and that it does not teach the child WHY. It is a very old approach and creates a lot of unnecessary trauma without offering long term benefits.   It cripples the parent-child relationship, erodes the trust and causes a lot of issues including the possibility of aggression and diminished learning ability.   It is very very old parenting ""technology"", the equivalent of using buggies for transportation and blood letting (without sterilization) for medicine.   Yes, it was used on many people and they turned out ""OK"" -- where OK means without visible defects apart from the common belief that it is normal to use physical and emotional violence on children.

When I had my boyfriend over her son started hitting him and cursing using the F word and B word when I was asking him to stop. I asked her if she could please control her kid and she just laughed and said for me to tell him to stop.   The most I've seen her try to discipline her son is if he messes up something that's hers or something she cares about. When he almost made a fire she laughed at it too.
raisingkids,2t9pdp,prosthetic4head,3,Thu Jan 22 19:54:23 2015 UTC,Hard to tell but it looks like she never disciplined the child.

If they ever work to get him out of doing whatever he's throwing the fit about, that has to stop, obviously.    So here's what worked for mine, though he was 6 when he finally got himself under control:  We worked on and talked about how he was feeling a LOT.  Being able to say that his feelings were hurt or that he was mad because it was unfair or whatever it was that set him off, seemed to help him understand that his reaction was unwarranted.   We gave him tons of tools to calm himself and we modeled them and had him practice them.  Things like deep breathing, counting to 10, walking away, talking to adult, and to identify the emotion he's really feeling first (it all comes out as anger, but the real feelings underneath are important).    We stopped yelling entirely.  We weren't huge yellers but sometimes you just hit your limit and it happens.  We didn't have that ""luxury"" anymore and we'd say, ""I'm going to count to 10 and calm down before I try speaking to you"" (modeling!!) when we were really mad.   We explained the consequences of destroying things or hurting people instead of calming down by taking a walk, yelling into a pillow, counting to 10.  For him it's losing screen time (and for grown ups it's jail time so be thankful it's not worse).  There is an obvious correlation between my kid's ability to control himself and his screen time.  I have to monitor it very closely lest he get addicted.   Lastly, and good luck with this one, lol, he had a run in with a bigger boy with rage issues and got beat up pretty good.  When he saw/felt how ugly and scary it is on the other side of his fits, he actually wanted to change his behavior.  Maybe you could video tape him.   It sounds like you've already tried a lot of stuff.  If you were actually consistent with those strategies, do not model explosive behavior yourselves, and especially if he's explosive outside of your home, it's probably time to get some outside help. My kids' school counselor has lunch with kids who struggle with controlling their anger every week and my friend's kid is making progress so maybe you could start there and move on to doctors if things don't improve soon.

Have you met with anyone about this?  It's ok to seek help, that's one thing I'd really like for you to know.  Sometimes, kids have issues transitioning from one activity to another.  That's definitely the case with mine.  If he's into something, and I immediately ask him to do something else (put down the phone game and go brush your teeth, for example) he will melt down.  I've had some success with giving him 5 minute warnings, (In 5 minutes, we're going to put down the game and go brush teeth) and getting him to agree to it before the actual transition.  I'm studying to be a child psychologist, but I don't want the following taken as professional advice, because it's not...But I would like to just point out that both of MY kids seem to be the type who get into their own little worlds and do NOT like to be jarred out of those worlds by external demands.  My daughter was also like this, however at 13 she has grown out of it and learned to be more flexible. What sucks about this issue is that your child makes himself look like an ass, and makes you look like an asshole of a parent in the process...and it's embarrassing.  Because you're not that parent, and he's not that child.  Just continue communicating, and make sure your expectations for him are outlined.  Another thing I do is breakdown his schedule BEFORE he starts getting into his world: You get to play your game, but in 20 minutes we HAVE to brush your teeth and go lay down.  Physical violence is never ok, destroying things is never ok.  I would strongly suggest seeing a counselor, just you and your wife, and talking out this issue...I know you probably don't want to drag your 95% of the time awesome child to counseling, and I don't blame you, but you could likely get a lot of help from a few guidance sessions where the issue and possible strategies are explored...just let the counselor KNOW that you don't intend to bring your child in at first, you want to see if you guys can find ways to help him without putting him in a counseling position.

raisingkids,2smr7a,txtineffect,31,Fri Jan 16 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"i have to say, i'm not shocked that the kids were called in -- the world is home to some sociopathic assholes hiding behind their curtains looking for people to baselessly report to the authorities. those people have always existed.    and i'm not terribly shocked at least at the initial response of the police -- when a call like that comes in, they can sigh but then they are obligated in some sense to take a drive over there and maybe ask the kids a couple of questions.  if the answers they get don't sound quite right (news flash: kids don't always tell the truth) then taking them back home to their parents is certainly an appropriate response.  where things go off the rails is when Montgomery County CPS gets involved.  who in the hell at the station house thought this interaction merited a call to CPS?    i expect the fundamental problem here isn't that some asshole called the cops (assholes always have) or that the cops showed up (they should when they're called) or even that the police exercised bad judgment -- but rather that there is no room for the police to use their good judgment, have a laugh with the parents about the kind of person that called them, say ""have a nice day"" and let that be the end of it.  the cops are obligated to file some report to keep the paper trail of what they do, and a procedural condition of them having a reported child interaction is (thanks to some overzealous childrens' rights legislation that was i'm sure well intended) to place a call to CPS.  tick those boxes or get a disciplinary hearing.  CPS then has to do its thing -- which, because of the nature of their work, is going to involve trying to get ""the real story"" out of the kids when mom and dad aren't around to ""intimidate"" them.  chances are the CPS folks (who have seen real neglect a few times, one can be fairly sure) know very well that this is bullshit but they too have their procedural boxes to tick to remove the jeopardy of personal liability.  in the end, what you have is less a breakdown of social trust under the weight of a runaway cult of incredible narcissism at the neighborhood level and more a buildup of the cult of procedure.  it's no longer possible for people in official positions to simply exercise their good judgment and some common sense in ignoring a call reporting these kids -- everyone has become intolerably accountable, thanks in part to the cult of liability (itself an outgrowth of that same cult of narcissism) and in part to the Age of Data in which everything is recorded and nothing simply goes away."

I'm glad I live in Quebec, where you will not be bothered by CPS or the police, should you decide to let your kids unsupervised in the neighborhood. But still, I find it sad that there's no kids playing outside anymore.  I grew up in Montreal, in the very urban residential neighborhood of NDG (and back then, the houses weren't worth close to a million bucks). I was free to roam the neighborhood at 7 during summer days. I took the metro to and from school at 10 years old. And these things were considered perfectly normal.  Now, we live in a much, much safer world.  Fuck, if we got lost or felt in trouble, we had to locate a house with this sign in the window and go knock. Nowadays, a kid can stop ANY adult on the sidewalk and just ask to borrow their cellphones. And Mom and Dad will answer their own cell phones.  So either we think our own kids are much, much dumber and incapable than we were; our we think our parents were completely irresponsible.  I don't think neither of those things and I intend to let my daughter (who's only 3 now) go to the park by herslef as soon as she's of elementary age."

I'm in total agreement that kids are far too restricted and I want to give my kids more freedom but 5 year olds are still pretty irrational and unreliable in my experience. I also find myself held back from giving my kids more freedom because no one else does it. Not because of peer pressure, but because I think the kids are safer when there are a bunch of other kids around, they look out for each other and there is safety in the group. Right now if you send your kid to the playground on their own they might actually be walking alone down the street while every other kid is driven by mom or dad and I actually do think that is a little dangerous in a way that a pack of kids from the neighborhood going together isn't. I don't know the answer, it's something I struggle with now with kids who are almost 9 and 5. I want my 9 year old to have some independence but that would make her different from her peers and she's reluctant about it. It's tough."

Going through all the difficult stages of infancy (lost sleep, colic, etc.) and toddlerhood just reaffirmed that feeling.   I never wanted to go through any of that again, and I've never regretted my choice to stop at one, especially now that my son is grown.  As to why the ""done after one"" choice seems to offend some people, my feeling is that those who are offended are the parents who have had two or more kids because they were told they are ""supposed to"" and now have life so much harder than before.  So they resent parents who have one child because in their minds, they ""have it too easy"" or something equally ridiculous.   That often includes the in-laws, as it seems to be in your case.

I think many younger people are dismissive of this issue today because they don't realise how damaging it can be.   In an era of much higher awareness (and even incidence) of transgenderism and non-conventional gender identity, it is absurd, cruel and damaging to force this pink/blue dichotomy on children.  I requested no-pink before my daughter was born, and all my friends complied.  There is lovely ""gender neutral"" stuff out there, and I also welcomed blue.  Once she was born every single gift I got from people who didn't know about my no-pink-preference was pink.  Every one.  I remember seeing a telescope toy in Toys R Us.  There was a pink one and a black one, both priced the same.  The black one was a superior model with much higher magnification. Parents were essentially buying a shittier, cheaper item for their girls and the manufacturer could get away with it because they knew they would sell pink to girls regardless.  There is nothing wrong with pink per se. It can be a lovely colour. But as a limiting gender marker that brands your child at birth into a rigid social gender construct it is just damaging and wrong."

I avoided pink - I didn't ban it - because I wanted her to be surrounded by a range of colours as an infant. I have seen children's rooms which are literally a saturation of all pink or all blue decor, bedclothes, toys, clothes and I don't think that's very healthy.  Or that it even looks nice.  At least mix it up a bit and find complementary tones.  People do build strong associations between colour and things. In the UK where we all wear school uniforms, many people end up rejecting (or conversely embracing) a particular colour for years afterwards because it reminds them of school.  That's relatively harmless, but rejecting anything blue/pink because it's ""not for your gender"" is harmful."

She got plenty of dolls, barbies etc. But she also got a little play grill and a kitchen. She used the grill all the time pretending to make me steaks and hamburgers (ok maybe a sign I grill to much).  She has been in wrestling, martial arts and gymnastics (started at 8. now 12). she likes to dress up and do her nails. but she will also get on the pull up bar and do a bunch or a bunch of situps.   When she was  she was on a T-ball team (6-9 yr olds. boys and girls) she was one of the few that didn't need the T (they got 3 pitches then had to use the T). All season the coach kept saying how he hated having girls on the team and would try to not play her (even though she was one of the best on the team). She decided to quite right before the last game and wanted to try Gymnastics (ugh..wish she didn't).  She is a tough young lady but also girly. She enjoys hunting and fishing.   My son (8) has been in wrestling, martial arts and gymnastics. He played with my daughters barbies more then she did. He would put them in his tonka truck sand drive them around. usually they would end up in wrecks.   He LOVES pink, he helps me in my flower garden but also one of the toughest and roughest kids in his wrestling team.  give the kids both toys. they will play with them all."

Going from the staunch line of 'nothing gendered, no pink, screw it' stance with a girl, to discovering the ground where they can be a girl, and the boys can be boys, but it doesn't mean you drop your ideals of boys and girls being shoehorned into roles... they can love princesses (god knows our daughter does)... but they can also love Hot Wheels, and lego, and Batman... and absolutely they can like pink if they choose (like our eldest boy does)... they can love any and all bits of it all.  I like him, he's got that 'yeah, ok... I tried, I really did, but then this happened, and I saw things in a different light' ideal.

raisingkids,2sfcos,lolhaibai,2,Wed Jan 14 22:46:19 2015 UTC,"My daughter is 8 months old and I give a lot of thought to several of the points in the article.   Personally, I think the LEGO ""controversy"" is drastically overblown and not really a negative.  Lego has a lot of sets in hopes of appealing to a wide base of potential customers.  They offer a girly line with houses and unicorns because they hope some people will like it and buy it, not because that is what they think girls need, or to imply that these are the only LEGO toys girls can use.  I'm sure LEGO is just as happy when I buy my 9 year old niece LEGO Boba Fett's Slave I for her birthday (which was at her request).    I do struggle with is the male/female dynamic, specifically in relation to setting an example, and I think there is a fine line to walk with respect to ""gendered"" colors and toys.  I don't want my daughter to feel like she has to play with dolls and houses and toy kitchens.  But I also don't think I can get behind the author's active discouragement and hiding of all things girly.  It seems to me to be a strange message to emphasize that boys can like pink, while seemingly preventing or discouraging our daughters from doing so at every opportunity.  It seems like many of the people who would be vocal proponents for a young boy who wanted the Barbie Dreamhouse, would simultaneously be an active critic of a parent who purchases the same toy for their daughter.  Defying stereotypes is laudable when done to promote self expression, but is not an end in itself, and certainly should not to be encouraged when it inhibits genuine self expression.   In my mind, when a little girl feels as prohibited from asking for a ""girly"" toy as a little boy might have felt 20 years ago, then we are treating defying gender norms as an end in itself, and to some degree are missing the point.  It seems to me through the points that the author of the article acknowledges this issue himself, and seemingly comes to a similar conclusion about the hypocricy, and opts to try and refrain from being as active in deterring ""girly"" behavior, which seems to me to be a reasonable conclusion.    Personally, I will do my best to allow my daughter to feel free to chose any toy she wants regardless of branding, but I want her to be comfortable playing with girly toys if she likes, without feeling bad about it.    And with respect to the example we set as her parents, I definitely need to continue to devote attention and consideration to, specifically because of the dynamic present in my home.  My wife to some degree enforces gender norms in what she will and won't assist with.  Yard work, taking trash out at night, carrying bags, and many other things are all but off limits.  I think we will need to address this going forward, not because I want to do less, but because I want to set an example where no task is viewed as off limits or outside of the range of what is acceptable for my daughter."
raisingkids,2sfcos,DreamtimeKids,2,Thu Jan 15 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"Brilliant writing - thank you! I really dislike the way we wander into toy shops with our kids & get an aisle that just screams ""PINK"" (for girls) offering ridiculous caricatures of adult female figures & one that screams ""DEATH"" (for boys) offering merchandise emblazoned with skull/crossbones & destructive, menacing toys brandishing weapons. The clothing is largely the same, with hideous messaging.  Still, my daughter loves the ""boy"" Lego, and my son has a rainbow loom set ... :)"
raisingkids,2sfcos,GunnerMcGrath,0,Fri Jan 16 08:54:03 2015 UTC,"I don't have any references for this right now.. but I have accepted that my boys are going to play rough and pretend to do combat because that's actually how they're biologically wired. Boys like to be rough, and they learn empathy through rough play. Boys who are constantly nagged to always be gentle and never experience what it's like to accidentally hurt their friend and experience the consequences of that don't develop empathy as well.  I probably shouldn't state this as absolute fact, but it's what I've read and it makes sense to me. I am a man who grew up on transformers and GI Joe and ghostbusters, built toy swords to play with at school, and thinks games like Call of Duty are the best... but I also dislike sports, and am decidedly gentle and un-violent, and have never had any sort of issue despite being exposed to violent cartoons and books and comic books since I was old enough to pick my own entertainment, though I also spent many nights watching the A-Team and Knight Rider and Star Trek with my dad, another really sweet, gentle guy without a violent bone in his body."
raisingkids,2sfcos,istara,6,Wed Jan 14 22:49:38 2015 UTC,"There are certainly gender differences, but it's definitely a spectrum which is why it's so risky to box children on one side or the other.  No one would deny differences: in fact a great book is Cordelia Fine's ""The Gender Delusion"" where she accepts that there are differences (despite critics that have misread her and accuse her of denying them) but that the differences are far more exaggerated than they should be.  The research into mathematics scores are particularly striking: how much girls are underperforming in many western countries, compared to other countries, because they are expected to do badly.  The book mentions many experiments where students about to take an exam are told beforehand: ""of course you probably won't do very well"" or ""you should find this quite easy"" and it actually affects their results, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy."

I have kids regularly asking ""is this graded"" because they want to gauge whether or not it'll be worth doing, even as practice. Cutting any slack usually ends up meaning most kids do even less than expected instead of what is asked, which is less in the first place. Some kids are bored, but students should be held responsible for part of finding a way to make school interesting. If I say the topic of their essay can be ANYTHING, some kids will still bitch and moan about it because ""it is too hard to think of something"" which in my opinion is lazy."

Albert spends lots of time with her and they fall in love. Then Sylvia is sexually assaulted in the woods by a masked assailant, but Mr. Webb, fearful of the townspeople's reaction, insists she keep it a secret. Later, Sylvia collapses at school, and Albert and Laura take her to Doc Baker who discovers that she is pregnant. When Sylvia and her father refuse to explain, Albert comes under suspicion.   and   James remains comatose after a successful operation to remove the bullet. Charles refuses to accept Doc Baker's prognosis that James will not recover, because he believes God has told him James will be healed. When his family and friends question if he is losing his grip on reality, Charles takes James away into the woods, and builds a shelter and a stone altar.

After we split up she 'found religion'...I was raised religious and am an atheist.   People at Christian schools are nice enough, but they are deluded about education.  YES, there are some good Christian schools...but what it came down to for me was what they taught about science.  I spoke with the 8th grade science teacher at the school that was proposed, and their science resembles a Sunday school lesson.  They taught that the earth was 6500 years old, that dinosaurs and humans walked the Earth together, etc.  They taught that all the 'scientists' were wrong about the ages of bones, ancient civilizations, etc.  When I asked about evolution, they said that they only mention it once when the students get into the 8th grade (in other words, no mention of anything except God created the Earth in 7 days from K-7) and when they do mention it, it's as a theory that is incorrect, to prepare the students to fight the 'worldly' ideas of how the universe formed.  This was the last straw for me...Evolution IS a theory, and it may not be 100% correct, but regardless it IS the accepted scientific explanation today and it needs to be taught properly.  Needless to say, I did not allow my son to be registered there.  Let me also just add, my daughter is IN the 8th grade in public school and her teacher scoffs every time they cover evolution and teaches them that it is wrong also.  I live in a small town, so I just let it slide, my daughter knows better, but my point is that this point of view isn't just in Christian schools...but at least in Public schools this view isn't mandated and her next teacher will teach her about it."

raisingkids,2s7m8v,medialunas,1 point,Mon Jan 12 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"I would share your atheism as much as you can with your child, encourage them to question and make up their own mind.  When you visit the school, be explicit and up front about your atheism, and the fact that you don't plan to have any religious activity at home.  Hopefully they'll decline your child a place.  If not, then they're probably pretty tolerant and open minded/progressive.  If your husband is a christian, he can't condemn you for being honest ;)"
raisingkids,2s7m8v,istara,1 point,Tue Jan 13 02:47:31 2015 UTC,"I went to this (CLA) Christian school from kindergarten through eighth grade.  If you look at CLA's enrollment distribution you can see that they have way more kindergarteners than any other classes and the class sizes get smaller and smaller all the way through 12th grade.  I'd say the quality of the education drives that.  My parents gave me the choice to attend CLA for high school or go to public school.  I chose public high school because they had more, better, and bigger programs.  Public high school was a slightly better preparation for the real world than CLA would have been, but I treasure many of the friendships that I made over the years at CLA.  CLA seems like a more closeknit community.  Many people absolutely hated their junior high years, but I always kinda felt like a big fish in a small pond so I rarely felt out of place in junior high.  I may have paid the price for that somewhat in high school, but I don't think CLA had much of a negative effect scholastically on me.  I also taught at an inner city school partway through college, and I'll say that the most important thing that affects a child's scholastic outcome is parental involvement.  If you think you'll actually be more involved because you're worried that the Christian school isn't teaching what you want them to learn then the extra time you spend furthering their education will more than make up for any lack of science education at Christian school.    As far as critical thought and backlash goes, by the time junior high rolled around I often raised questions at school about the accuracy of the Bible and the amount of backlash was the same as when I made some similarly unpopular line of questioning in science class at the secular high school.    tl;dr  You're not going to screw your kid up by sending them to Christian school.  You'll screw them up in some way that you can never guess now."
raisingkids,2s7m8v,datanimal,1 point,Tue Jan 13 06:22:31 2015 UTC,"I grew up Catholic and went to a Catholic elementary school and grew up believing what I was told. I lost interest in the faith later in life and even though I was an atheist, I went to a Catholic university. Never an issue, never a problem.  The thing to keep in mind is that many Christian schools will teach incorrect facts, particularly in science class. This is unforgivable. Religions have the right to believe what they believe, and parents have the right to raise their children in their belief system. But schools DO NOT have the right to deliberately misinform students about basic and easily-provable scientific facts.  Not all Christians school are equal and there are plenty, mostly but not exclusively Catholic schools, that will not provide a disservice to your kids."
raisingkids,2s7m8v,nickcan,1 point,Tue Jan 13 11:15:54 2015 UTC,"The denomination makes all the difference.  In our area there are schools that range from the ""there is no evolution, Halloween is satanic"" (southern Baptist) to ""the biology teacher that has an amazing lesson on the genetics of neanderthals and how they relate to modern humans is a gay man that married his husband in the local cathedral"" (Episcopalian).  My oldest goes to the Episcopalian preschool at our church and it is an incredibly good school.  The religious component boils down to using biblical stories to exemplify the ""character trait of the month"" (patience, courage, generosity, etc).  A good christian private school will give you child a solid academic foundation at (usually) a significant savings over a secular school.  I encourage you to investigate your local options.  There are plenty of christian schools out there for whom academics is the highest priority and ""indoctrination"" is non-existent."

My experience at the school was great, I wouldn't hesitate to send my son to one, if he picks up the religious aspects no big deal.   As for science it was straight up science, no issues with conflicts there (honestly I think that is largely a fundamentalist crowd issue).      Your husband is Christian, there will be at least .... some exposure when questions come up.     Kids will find their way when they get older either way IMO, they're not permanently programmatic, and what they pick up long term is hardly exactly what is provided.  Just check out the school(s), ask questions, observe and see if you'd be comfortable there.   That is the most important thing, like any schools you'll find some you're comfortable with and some you aren't, public, private, religious, any school."

raisingkids,2s7m8v,Zombie-Process,0,Tue Jan 13 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"Be strong and don't let anyone brainwash your kid before they are able to think for themselves about religion.  If he doesn't like public schools then try secular private schools.  If he doesn't accept that, then it's not about public-private it's about brainswashing kids.  Those who have been brainwashed usually fail to understand that they have been, and think it is ok to pass that down the generations.  A similar debate may come up if you have a boy.  Is your hubby circumcised?  Would he want the kid circumcised just because he was?  If he'd lost the tip of his finger as a kid would he want the same done to his child?  Religious brainwashing makes barbaric things seem commonplace, so please don't take it lightly.  Fight for your (admittedly unborn) child's right to a religious brainwashing free life."

And they also have a 'physical fitness' corner with yoga mats and some other stuff so they can take non-recesses breaks during the day.  Her teacher told us that over the summer they went to a seminar or retreat or something and a major topic was how breaking up the mental learning with physical breaks makes a big difference in how the learning goes.
raisingkids,2s3p8t,Ozzah,5,Sun Jan 11 22:36:01 2015 UTC,"My wife has always spoken English with our now-2 year old, and I have always spoken German with him. He's had no trouble picking up the two languages, and he knows to speak the appropriate language with each parent. Obviously his grammar is only at a 2 year old level, and he mixes the two languages when necessary to make himself understood. But it certainly doesn't seem to have harmed his language development at all, in fact his English is fairly advanced compared to the monolingual kids in his daycare.  My biggest piece of advice, as others have said, is to be really consistent with this. If your wife wants to try to teach the baby Russian, she should only speak Russian to the baby. This will both help the baby learn, but also will quickly make it seem ""natural"" to your wife. If I try to speak English with my son now, it feels really weird, even though my wife speaks English with him all the time. In addition, when he does speak English to me, I usually ask him to repeat it in German. I don't pretend not to understand, I just say ""it makes me happy when you speak German, could you please say that again?"" If he knows the vocabulary, he always does."
raisingkids,2s3p8t,jueskin,3,Mon Jan 12 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"We are a bilingual family. I speak a type of American English (Midwest) to our kids, and my wife speaks a type of Germany German (Swabian) to our kids. We live in New York, but frequently take the kids to Germany for family visits and if it works out will be moving to Germany this summer (Saxon German, which my wife hates but that's another story).  Our eldest is old enough to understand that these are separate languages, but she can't quite parse which is which and self-correct when she is speaking to German family or American family. She also makes plenty of grammatical mistakes in both languages, but more in German since she gets so much more English. The way she speaks is what we call ""Denglish"" sometimes English, sometimes German, sometimes Germanizing English (""We have geplayed."") Sometimes Englishizing German (""Was bist du tuning?""). The little one is an early speaker, and her vocabulary and grammar is also mixed. It's actually interesting to see which language gets used for which words. You can always tell which words Mama uses more than Daddy and vice versa.  The biggest mistake we made, in my opinion, was my wife not insisting that she be spoken to by the kids in German. If they respond in English, she just carries on in German. I think that has hampered their uptake of the minority language. Also my wife speaks to me and my family in English (around the kids) and obviously speaks English outside the house. It kind of ""gives away the game"" so to say, but while she could speak to me in German and I would be fine, the rest has to be English.  I have zero doubt the kids will achieve expert level in both languages with this method. Actually my wife's mother grew up speaking a South Slavic language at home and German elsewhere, and to hear speak with her sister while they code switch back and forth is pretty crazy. My wife actually understands that language but never got enough practice speaking it. My mother in law did not speak it to her at home. Shame, but it isn't a really ""important"" language so no harm.  So, yeah, go for it however you want! But you have to stay consistent, even when the child gets old enough to reject it (and you) and want to only speak what his/her friends speak. I think it is important that you as parents both understand each other's language well enough to coparent in two languages, otherwise you may end up providing mixed messages. It's a parenting problem rather than a language problem, but it also shows that you both recognize the legitimacy of each other's language. Also I have a suspicion that when people say bilingual parenting is hard they don't mean hard for the kid...  In your situation I suggest English and Hungarian are appropriate, but not Russian. How can you raise a child in a language you barely speak? English is obviously valuable worldwide, and Hungarian adds a new twist that my wife and I don't have seeing as both our languages are not only Indo-European bit also both Germanic. Adding Hungarian gives so much difference in vocab and grammar... it would be fascinating to see how a child builds that Hungarian affix system into his own Engarian or Hunglish language."

Like no matter how hard I try I will never get the German ""r"" right and I have trouble with ""u"" vs ""ü"" and my poor wife struggles with both ""th"" sounds and ""z"" - but our kids will be fine with all."

If the grandparents are determined that the baby speak Russian, you should ask them to always speak to the child in Russian. Your wife can speak to kid in English and you speak Hungarian.

They speak English when it's the four of them, but the dad speaks German, the mom speaks Spanish.  The kids understand all three, and their level of fluency in German and Spanish depends on how much of it they speak back.    However much you can do I imagine is a huge boon.

We are pretty good now speaking it to the baby and are still working on speaking it to each other more. We've been watching/listening to a lot of videos and audible books in the first language on you tube and it helped us tremendously.

We'd visit roughly 3-4 times a year from what I recall and once there most everything would be in the other language, from church to grandparents interactions and just listening to the adults talk in the background.    I wasn't encouraged to speak all that much so my verbal skills were low but I recall when I was 15 a friend was visiting and my dad and grandma where arguing, I translated mostly verbatim for my friend because I could and could navigate comfortably in any household that speaks that language.    My point is that even with as little exposure that I had, over time it builds up and with proper encouragement the gains will be a lot greater.  Definitely tell her parents to do their part and speak only in Russian with your child because even if contact with them is as little as mine there will be benefits, at the very least a higher aptitude for learning later in life."

If he seems ok with it great.  If he's upset maybe try to have something to make it a positive experience for your son.  Explain that you know this may be stressful and you'd like to do something to make it up to him.  Maybe a new backpack or lunchbox?  Or let him pick out a new stuffed animal for nap time (if applicable), or a new toy as a ""reward"".  Or a trip to the zoo or a favorite destination.  Then, I'd try to make the transition as easy as possible.  Once you know his teacher, arrange a meeting with you and your son.  Ask the teacher for names of a few of the friendlier kids in class, or kids with similar interests.  Arrange a few playdates before the transfer so your son has someone he knows."

My husband and I honestly looked at each other after the first 2 weeks of bringing home our son, and we were both like, ""Why does anybody ever have a second child!?""  Infancy is hard. Babies are very demanding and need so much care. The good news is, that passes. This is a short phase of their life while they are so needy. It's not easy, and it can take time to bond with the baby. Stay involved, it gets better.  My husband had an easier time after our son was older. Each year just gets better. It's fun when you can do your own activities and bring your child along and share that with them. Swimming, bowling, skiing, hiking, rock climbing, etc. It's like rediscovering the whole world again through the excitement in your child's eyes. I feel younger now than I did when my son was born, because of that.  I think think after you see your baby growing into a child, and how fulfilling THAT part is... it's easier to know that the babyhood struggle is a phase that will pass and develop into a child. A child who will adore you and everything you say/do. Last night my son was counting money from his piggy bank and he kept running over to his Dad asking if he could trade 5 pennies for a nickel, or 4 quarters for a dollar, etc. His Dad & I were giggling to each other because little boy was just so very excited about doing these trades. Then our son came up to me and said something like, ""My Dad is just the best Dad in the whole world!""  There are so many moments that will pull at your heart and enrich your life. It's okay that you're not feeling it yet. I wasn't really at that age, either. I just wanted some TIME and some SLEEP. I did like the baby cuddles, but the constant feedings and diaper changes and burping and never ending laundry and spit up... ugh that gets old fast. Plus I hated that whole crying baby sound, as a new parent that would just send me into panic mode. Really, if it hadn't been for that hormonal oxytocin kick-in from breastfeeding, it would have taken me longer to bond with our baby, too. My husband didn't really care for bottle feeding, and I hated pumping, so we ditched bottles in order to have less work and cleanup for both of us."
raisingkids,2rvlnu,sprgtime,12,Fri Jan 9 18:36:40 2015 UTC,"First of all, this is very common at the age of your child. The first 6 months are a slog. It's all about juggling, adjustment, not getting enough sleep, and feeling adrift in your universe.  In my family, shit really hit when I was off maternity leave and suddenly, it was two working parents and an infant in daycare.  Some of the friend stuff will take a backseat for a bit, especially balancing school and work besides. Something has to give. But you eventually can find ways to carve out a night for you, leaving the kid with SO. Or nights for both of you, with the child in the care of a trusted caregiver.

I became a dad at 29, and again when I was 32. It's not easy. But nothing of value rarely is. You're a dad regardless of how you might feel about it. What you plan on doing with these feelings is what matters. You think 29 is too young to have a kid, and that your life is over? It's not. It's changed. And it's up to you to decide if it's a change for the better.   I couldn't imagine my life without my kids, and soon you won't either.

When a new father OP vents about his ""life being over"", we should say the truth: that's exactly right. Your old life as a narcissistic, selfish, vapid, essentially purposeless boy is over. Your new life as a man, however - sacrificing, chivalrous, teaching, dutiful, providing, taking the brunt for your family because you are strong - all that has just begun.   Embrace it. Your new life - a life that is not about you at all - is your true and highest purpose. See your old life of selfishness with the contempt it deserves. It was stupid and empty, even if others were forebearing enough to you in your childhood not to tell you so in the hope and knowledge that you would grow out of it, even if you yourself were convinced that self satisfaction was a goal unto itself rather than a vehicle by which to improve the lives of others. If you do, you can live an immensely and deeply satisfying life. If you refuse, you will remain mired in adolescence. The fact that OP is now confronting the death of his old narcissism puts him at the crux of that decision.   Take the high road, OP. You will never regret it."

It's very hard, babies don't really laugh or show amusement until a few months (in my case anyway). There is a lot going on right now for you and you won't have time to yourself or to go out with your friends for sometime now but once you get to 6 months it will be much easier. Then 9 months, better, and so on. After a while your son will laugh at you, and the best is when they try and get you to laugh.  Don't anybody take this the wrong way but I think it takes a while to really develop a love for your newborn. Mostly at first I felt just responsible for anything that upset my son and felt bad about any distress until I could remedy it--being a first-time parent is a surreal thing. Once you start seeing a personality and mutual affection it will start to fill you up more than you're read for and you and your wife will share the most boring storing of what they did that will be so exciting to you.  You also need to talk to your wife. In my situation we made sure each other had at least a few hours here and there of 'Don't bother me for anything' time where you could nap, watch a stupid tv show, or get out for happy hour.

I also agree that it will get better. Don't get me wrong, I love my kids and always have, but I'm just not a newborn person. My kids are 5 and 3, and I enjoy them way more now. Once they interact, life gets better. Also, and this is something I am truly only realizing now, the baby phase isn't forever. We know this, but we don't really KNOW this until it's over. Little kids are so much fun, and the ""reward"" is more immediate."

raisingkids,2rvlnu,Melitzilla,3,Fri Jan 9 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"It gets easier.  Even weekly you may notice it.  You are in metamorphoses, and the young man you were dies and the father you will be is born.  Surrender to the slog and when your child laughs and dances and sings the alphabet later, you will a deep happiness you've never felt before, because you'll know you were always behind him.    Your free time will come back when he sleeps better, and begins to entertain himself for hours at a time.  But for now you must endure the crucible."
raisingkids,2rvlnu,sleepyj910,3,Fri Jan 9 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be real: for the first six months, you aren't going to have much, if any, time for yourself. That's just the way it is. You can either suck it up, or stop contributing at home so you can make more time for yourself. The first six months are usually an all hands on deck situation. The feelings you have are totally normal. Cabin fever with a newborn is normal.   One coping mechanism that I've found helpful is zeroing in on time with my kid, almost like meditation. When they're within the first six months, there's little interaction, so I'd look at their little fingers or toes, notice how they breathed, made faces at them to see if they'd smile. Really noticing the details and slowing down. I found it very calming when they were really little. If you feel yourself longing for life sans baby, try getting into the dad identity a bit more. Are there other dads you can hang out with? Maybe your friends don't have kids yet, and that's why you long for those kid free days more. Is there a local dad group you can join?   But, there is a light at the end of the tunnel -- my SO gets half an hour in the house every day when no one else is home, and 2 nights (well, a night and a weekend morning) ""off"" for 3 hours with his friends. I get the exact same thing. We each take the kids for a walk every day for 30 minutes (and if weather is bad, a 30 minute ride to a local place), giving the other person half an hour at home solo. Then, one spouse takes over for 2 3-hour chunks each week, so the other can have time out of the house. I've always found that ""time off"" when you're at home isn't really time off, as the kids will scream for the parent that's trying to hide at home. This arrangement only works because we each have equal time out of the house without kids, otherwise the resentment would be huge."

It's probably just evolution at work, for a long time men had very little to do with raising babies, our involvement increased only after weaning. Soon your son will be crawling, walking, talking, and so on. He'll be a lot more interesting, and you won't feel so overwhelmed. On top of that, he may actually call for you instead of his mom one day."

raisingkids,2rvlnu,Ker_Splish,1 point,Sat Jan 10 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"You're experiencing it fairly normally man.  The first couple months (couple years?) are a struggle, especially if you're working and going to school while doing the dad thing.    The main thing to remember is that this is a marathon, not a sprint.  You've got to set yourself up mentally for the long haul.  One way to do this is to make arrangements with your spouse to give her a ""baby free"" day once in a while, while doing the same for yourself.  A little time apart will only serve to strengthen the bond between you and your kid.    Also, your social life is necessarily going to take a backseat for a couple years; think back as far as you can remember in your life and see if you can remember mom and dad going to the bar every weekend?  Didn't think so.  (I can, but that's another story. :P )  Basically, you have to find a way to line up your personal values, the ones that we typically have focused at ourselves (am I hungry/cold/hot/poopy etc.) and realign these with our offspring.  This will take some effort, as it is natural to view your kids as a massive time suck once the shiny wears off.    You got this though, man.  As a buddy of mine told me once, after hearing about my wife being pregnant with our son, ""Do you have any idea how far you have to stick it in there to get a boy back out?""  :D    Good luck homie.    EDIT:  Almost forgot:  Make sure you still get the occasional night out with your spouse.  After a couple of years as parents, you will tend to forget that you were lovers in the beginning.  I learned about this the hard way, don't make my mistake.  Hire a sitter once your son is of an appropriate age, and go on a date with your wife.  It'll be hard, you'll both be exhausted, but freaking DO IT to keep some passion in your relationship."

You are basically taking care of a lump. It is easy, because the care is pretty straightforward and basic. However, the first time your son runs up to you, wraps his arms around your neck and says, ""I love you, daddy,"" then you will know how cool it is.  Enjoy this time, soon enough they will be teens and you will be wondering why they won't listen to all your life lessons."

This becomes more manageable as the child develops and you gain experience.

I picture us being friends when I'm older, but this does not work for me right now.   I agree with this point made emphasis on phrases such as ""not your friend"", "" unload"", and ""deal with it"".   I agree with you that our real life experiences and problem solving is valuable too. And I do already share some old strategies and stories with my 3 year old. I am dead set against keeping household secrets from the kids like grandma just died but your exam is next week, or dad is unemployed but we'll have him suit him and out every day anyway. That type of stuff is traumatizing and patronising.   But I think the kinds of troubles the article point mentioned are casual friend problems: stupid coworker, your crush on the Batista or manager, your menstrual cramps, how the husband or ex fucked up, getting drunk and hungover etc. Stuff you should be telling your current day friend instead, you should not share with your daughter.

raisingkids,2riif2,rkbot,4,Tue Jan 6 14:00:21 2015 UTC,"I have suffered from postpartum depression for the past 2 years, my son is 2.  I wasn't ready for the pregnancy, so I had trouble adjusting to being a mom. I have a long history of depression. Before my pregnancy I sought therapy after and treated it through increased social contact and friendship community, because my issues came from early childhood death and abandonment trauma. I felt like I finally had built the community I always dreamed of having, and I was happy and vibrant. Having an unplanned baby made me feel isolated because I had to move out to the suburbs from the fun part of the city to be closer to the grandparents, and I didn't have the time or bandwidth to be a new mom, work full time, keep up with housework, and spend good time with my husband and son. Going out to parties and events and networking was the first thing to go, which derailed my treatment and sent me spiraling into the PPD. I beat myself up a lot because I knew that all the ""good moms"" didn't care about such trivial and frivolous things, they instinctively knew how to prioritize and bond with their babies. Everyone, including my husband, always tells me that those things are petty and don't matter, that I have better things to worry about, but they don't realize that me being part of a community and having that social contact is the key to dissolving the trauma of the past.   For the past 2 years I have been in denial about my condition. I knew I was at a higher risk for PPD, but I thought that because I beat depression before, I could do it again. So I bottled up my feelings to stay functional. I had a very difficult time adjusting to motherhood, and an especially hard time bonding with my baby. I didn't identify with being a mom, all I could identify with was my own self pity and emotions. I felt like I was drowning in the ocean, battling a storm, all in silence, all in shame. I would look at my son, and I knew that I loved him, but I didn't feel about motherhood the way that other women do. For them it was a source of joy and fulfillment, for me it meant giving up my liberty and autonomy (something I had fought very hard for in the past). I knew it wasn't my son's fault, I made a very conscious decision to keep the baby after finding out about my pregnancy. So I was filled with self-hatred and the overwhelming urge to just end my life. I knew I wouldn't go through with it, but I still had to deal with those thoughts and feelings. It was just so heavy and taxing.   The past couple of weeks, going through the holidays and new year, I realized that I never lost my friends.  They were there with me the whole time, and they still are. My friendships were never truly compromised, it was me thinking that since I couldn't have it my way (attending everything I want whenever I want), then life simply wasn't worth living.  As I celebrated the New Year with these friends and family, I realized just how lucky I was. I have everything. And I have started to practice more gratitude, and so I have resolved to seek therapy/counseling to help me put my past trauma to rest so that I can fully love my son without my ego getting in the way. I want to be happy for what I have. This is a huge step for me.   My son is going to be 2 next month. I remember when I used to look at him with an indifferent kind of love, absorbed in my own self-pity.  The past few weeks, we have been making some major strides. It's amazing what coming out of denial and acknowledging your emotions will do. He's so sweet and loving, he hugs me and kisses me, he loves me so much. And I have fallen so deeply in love with him, no longer blinded my own ego and denial. I see him for the person that he is, a pure being, capable of loving someone who can only think about themselves. He loves me so much, and now that he's almost 2 and understand how to relate to others, he really shows me his love. I feel the ice glaciers in my heart melting, he helps me see outside of myself. The past couple of weeks I have seen some changes within myself. Now I look forward to seeing him, to playing with and taking care of him. I look forward to his hugs and his kisses, I look forward to knowing how his day was.  Leo's love has transcended the depths of despair, he has shown a light in my darkness.  For the first time I can say I am so happy to have him in my life, happy to be his mom. As a New Years resolution I have resolved to stop hurting myself and to seek treatment.  Oh, the power of love."

Loves, loves, loves books so we read lots of books, every day but I absolutely do not push his reading. He'd just shut down completely. I do know though, that when he decides he wants to read, he'll do it fast. That's just his personality. Won't do anything before he's totally ready and when he is ready he'll just do it one day, no learning curve. Walking, biking, swimming have all been the same way!

She threw fits about it, and literally said she hated it (which crushed me since I love books and thought I'd done everything right to get her to love them too). After a few months, she decided she liked it again and really took off. She seemed to find her stride with reading and now halfway through the school year she's at the reading level she's supposed to be at at the end of the year.

I checked out lots and lots of books and read to them with enthusiasm constantly.   I made reading seem like a secret code that they couldn't wait to crack. My little one was sounding out words at 3 and reading fluently at 4.  He's always been the strongest reader in his class and he loves the attention he garners for it.  My older one wants the same praise so he reads like a fiend and above his grade level, too (gotta stay ahead of the little brother!)."

Don't worry about them damaging the books. When they outgrow them, you will get rid of them anyway. Also, delay introducing them to video games and TV for as long as possible. And, as everyone else has pointed out: read to them often."

Though, sometimes he is just having too much fun to go to the bathroom. Or he will be eating and doesn't want to get up either. Should I punish him for these things? Send him to time out or the corner? Or do I just say it is all okay, change clothes and go on?"
raisingkids,2ratb7,TheTattooedMother,3,Sun Jan 4 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"Don't punish him over it; all it'll do is make him associate peeing with punishment.  Honestly, try reminding him to go. And if it's been a while and he hasn't gone and doesn't want to -- take him anyway. And then let him go right back to playing/eating/etc.  I also found that announcing to him, ""Hey, I need to use the potty. I'll be right back!"" helped him to realize that he can go use the toilet and get back to what he wants to be doing -- more quickly than a clothes change and cleanup, too."
raisingkids,2ratb7,rainbowmoonheartache,2,Sun Jan 4 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"Getting into a battle of wills over potty learning actually prolongs the amount of time it takes for kids to be independant with their toileting. Never punish. Sometimes sneaky pee happens, try to make it not a big deal. Encourage (but don't force) his help in putting pee clothes in the laundry or making wiping up a spill with a paper towel.   Like another comment mentioned, try to set him up for success. My son was really reliable except he often peed when he was eating - so I started making it part of our routine that before sitting down to eat, we go potty and wash hands. Took care of that problem entirely.   If he was doing something fun, like playing with a friend or really into a toy... I needed to keep track of how long it had been since he'd last gone potty. If you're able to think ahead, you could set a timer for an hour or 2 once he starts playing something he loves, and let him know when he hears the timer, that he needs to take a little break to go potty.  Also, if you're at home and don't have company, try letting him be naked from the waist down when he plays fun stuff. That makes the sensation/urge to go way more obvious, and since he sounds like he's pretty reliable, I doubt it would lead to any mess on the floor at this point, but could help him be more in tune with his body."

You have been through pregnancy, 2 months of not knowing if your child would make it, and now you're finally home. :)   Allowing yourself time to breathe and getting into a routine that works for you, baby and Dad is most important.   If no visitors is what you need now, then those who love you will understand. If you are okay with visitors, then limiting to just a few, no kids, is also your choice. As a parent, I'd never think of bringing my kids to see a newborn, especially one that was premature and only home for 2 days.

It is true that RSV is a common childhood illness. Your situation is different because premature babies are at risk for severe RSV because their lungs are often underdeveloped. Maybe your husband isn't aware of what RSV is or possible complications?   100-120K infants under one year of age are hospitalized because of RSV every year. Those who are hospitalized may require oxygen, intubation, or mechanical ventilation. Incidents of RSV began spiking in November and will likely remain high through January.    National RSV Trends Management of Severe RSV   I was intubated as an adult - it is no fun a'tal. IMO, doesn't seem worth the risk, stress or worry with a preemie!

She's now almost 3 and healthy, but in my opinion, you are not being unreasonable.

It took four hours to get IVs started on all three and I was the only one who could deal with it, and it wasn't any fun at all. If they had been younger it would have been bad.  RSV kills really young babies. Preemies are VERY susceptible to respiratory problems. By the time we made it to a year old and had the hospital stay I was showing the respiratory techs how to give breathing treatments.  One thing that saved my sanity (well, what is left of it) was the snuza. It sounds an alarm if your baby stops breathing for a certain time and its portable and works in swings.

He still got bronchiolitis from it though. He is now 5yo and has had asthma ever since. His paediatricians attribute it to the prem+RSV, but say he will likely grow out of it (Nad knock on wood, he seems to be).

raisingkids,2r5e1s,sprgtime,11,Fri Jan 2 23:50:56 2015 UTC,"Excerpt from the second link, to save you time:  ""  If mom and baby are together, like on mom's chest, then the baby is protected from what the two of them may be exposed to. Babies should be with mom.  And the tigers.  What about them?  Define ""tiger"" however you want.  But if you are baby with no skills in self-protection, staying with mom, having a grasp reflex, and a startle reflex that helps you grab onto your mom, especially if she's hairy, makes sense.  Babies know the difference between a bassinette and a human chest.   When infants are separated from their mothers, they have a ""despair- withdrawal"" response.  The despair part comes when they alone, separated.  The kids are vocally expressing their desire not to be tiger food.  When they are picked up, they stop crying.  They are protected, warm and safe.  If that despair cry is not answered, they withdraw.  They get cold, have massive amounts of stress hormones released, drop their heart rate and get quiet.  That's not a good baby.  That's one who, well, is beyond despair.  Normal babies want to be held, all the time.  And when do tigers hunt?  At night.  It makes no sense at all for our kids to sleep at night.  They may be eaten.  There's nothing really all that great about kids sleeping through the night.  They should wake up and find their body guard.  Daytime, well, not so many threats.  They sleep better during the day.  (Think about our response to our tigers-- sleep problems are a huge part of stress, depression, anxiety).  I go on and on about sleep on this site, so maybe I'll gloss over it here.  But everybody sleeps with their kids- whether they choose to or not and whether they admit to it or not.  It's silly of us as healthcare providers to say ""don't sleep with your baby"" because we all do it.  Sometimes accidentally.  Sometimes intentionally.  The kids are snuggly, it feels right and you are tired.  So, normal babies breastfeed, stay at the breast, want to be held and sleep better when they are with their parents.  Seems normal to me.  But there is a difference between a normal baby and one that isn't.  Safe sleep means that we are sober, in bed and not a couch or a recliner, breastfeeding, not smoking...being normal.  If the circumstances are not normal, then sleeping with the baby is not safe.  That chest -to -chest contact is also brain development.  Our kids had as many brain cells as they were ever going to have at 28 weeks of gestation.  It's a jungle of waiting -to-be- connected cells.  What we do as humans is create too much and then get rid of what we aren't using.  We have like 8 nipples, a tail and webbed hands in the womb.  If all goes well, we don't have those at birth.  Create too much- get rid of what you aren't using.  So, as you are snuggling, your child is hooking up happy brain cells and hopefully getting rid of the ""eeeek"" brain cells.  Breastfeeding, skin-to-skin, is brain wiring.  Not food.  Why go on and on about this?  Because more and more mothers are choosing to breastfeed.  But most women don't believe that the body that created that beautiful baby is capable of feeding that same child and we are supplementing more and more with infant formulas designed to be food.  Why don't we trust our bodies post-partum?  I don't know.  But I hear over and over that the formula is because ""I am just not satisfying him.""  Of course you are. Babies don't need to ""eat"" all the time- they need to be with you all the time- that's the ultimate satisfaction.  A baby at the breast is getting their immune system developed, activating their thymus, staying warm, feeling safe from predators, having normal sleep patterns and wiring their brain, and (oh by the way) getting some food in the process.  They are not ""hungry"" --they are obeying instinct.  The instinct that allows us to survive and make more of us.  Jenny Thomas, MD, MPH, IBCLC, FAAP, FABM  back to www.drjen4kids.com"""

Finally we stripped everything off our bed and I slept on the mattress with baby, no blankets, and only a tiny pillow for me. Baby was dressed in his warm fleece sleep sack, and I slept in fleece too, which I could unzip to nurse him. I remember how I was so afraid something bad would happen because everyone said not to sleep with the baby.  I was aware of his positioning all night, but I slept so much better and he totally slept all night! I mean, aside from him waking me every 2 hours to nurse, but then he'd immediately be asleep and I could quickly go back to sleep myself.  I remember the first night we tried it, my husband woke up and was stunned and asked me, ""Did he sleep the entire night? I never heard him cry!""   So I went to bed early since my sleep was interrupted, and he let me sleep in on days he didn't have to work, but my husband got great sleep every night once we started cosleeping, which was helpful because two sleepy people get irritated with each other fast, so at least he was able to be level headed and support me and make sure I was eating and drinking and getting opportunities for naps when I needed them.   Our baby never did sleep in the crib. I didn't want to have to get out of bed at night to go feed him, that just seemed like too much effort for no purpose. He figured out how to climb out of his crib at 9 months old, so we never even used the stupid thing aside from a place to safely set baby when we needed to use the bathroom or something like that. At 9 months we ended up baby proofing the nursery and putting a gate in the door so we could still have a safe place to put him for a few minutes when needed."

Sometimes she would kind of wake back up from the movement of swaddling her, but she was pretty drowsy so it only took a couple minutes to get her back asleep.  http://www.summerinfant.com/nursery/swaddling?gclid=CjwKEAiA5qOlBRDAn8K5qen65joSJADRvlbqmOiBQYUIAoUK2I2MuddvrTEsg26r0oH7reF9gSXnjRoCuV_w_wcB"

raisingkids,2r5e1s,cooksfor40humans,2,Sat Jan 3 05:22:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people keep saying that, I'll start reading it asap!"

raisingkids,2r5e1s,Speechie99,4,Sat Jan 3 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"Everyone's offering great advice to help you through the first few months, but the first few days are a special challenge.    My suggestion is to take turns holding the baby while the other parent sleeps, with you bringing him to your wife to nurse (assuming she's breastfeeding) every two hours during the day and every three hours at night. Encourage your wife get 9-12 hour stretches of (interrupted) sleep every day so her body can heal.  The baby will probably only sleep in 1 1/2 hour increments for the first week or two, that is normal! You need to decide which one of you gets to go to bed early and which one gets to sleep in late. You two should try to sleep together, with the baby in his crib or a safe co-sleeping arrangement, for a few hours a night.  Your baby will regularly be awake at night, that's a good time to stare lovingly at him and bond or for you  to watch Netflix and bounce on a yoga ball.  Keep the lighting dim and try to keep the baby as calm as possible using the five S's mentioned above.  The baby will sleep best in his parents arms, but be careful that you don't fall asleep on a couch or recliner while holding him.  Good luck!"
raisingkids,2r5e1s,Mphindi,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:33:54 2015 UTC,"This might be a silly question, but what's wrong with napping in a recliner with the baby? (I'm having my first pretty soon and haven't heard this piece if advice yet)"
raisingkids,2r5e1s,Crafty_mom,1 point,Sat Jan 3 15:45:11 2015 UTC,"recliner    About the recliner: I'm thinking he's assuming that it's not a safe environment as you can drop the baby if you fall asleep in a wrong position.  I'm trying to make my wife sleep as much as possible for the healing to kick in. Thanks for the help, it means a lot. I'll try to keep it all together :-)"
raisingkids,2r5e1s,DreamtimeKids,1 point,Sat Jan 3 16:30:17 2015 UTC,"It's always a bit dangerous to sleep with the baby sitting up, or in bed with duvets, pillows, blankets, etc. If you're sitting up even slightly, there's the chance that you could fold over, or that the baby could fall off you. If you're lying down in bed, you have to really clear the area to develop a proper co-sleeping environment."
raisingkids,2r5e1s,earthpeesfire,1 point,Sat Jan 3 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"http://cosleeping.nd.edu/safe-co-sleeping-guidelines/ Click for safe co-sleeping guidelines. There are ways to do it safely.  Unfortunately, telling everyone NOT to cosleep leads to higher infant death rates due to parental exhaustion and accidentally falling asleep in an unsafe place with baby. Most cosleeping deaths are due to unsafe surfaces, baby getting wedged behind into a couch crease or something. Plus when parents are completely exhausted, it's not as safe to cosleep as when they're rested and more aware of the environment even while sleeping."
raisingkids,2r4ekg,annusha,1 point,Fri Jan 2 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"My daughter was in play therapy for 6 months and we are really happy with the results. With play therapy a lot depends on a therapist, the one we had was really good and she was able to figure out what's wrong right away."
raisingkids,2r4ekg,LovingLaura,0,Mon Jan 5 20:46:34 2015 UTC,"If parents spend more time playing with their children they wouldn't need to pay therapists for ""play therapy""."
raisingkids,2r4arg,ozyman,3,Fri Jan 2 18:01:43 2015 UTC,This might be somewhat related to the amount of vocabulary you encounter in each of these situations. A lot of baby books use the same words over and over (a cat! a dog! a butterfly!) while idly talking to your kids while you're doing whatever gives you more opportunity to use other words (how many kids books use the words refrigerator or power strip?).  Since there is a lot of data to suggest that breadth of vocabulary is a lot more important than amount of exposure (such as this article) I think this starts to make sense to me.

raisingkids,2r1fpu,AtlasDeZoso,2,Thu Jan 1 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"Schoolwork, their son maintained, was boring and pointless.   He's not wrong. Studies keep showing our antiquated school system is still trying to produce factory workers for the industrial revolution instead of actually educating students for the 21st century reality we live in. Being smart is not an advantage in our society, it's a liability. The expectations can never be met and the system children are stuck in has no real way to deal with critical, thoughtful and confident students. Many times they end up being labeled in various ways, and the result is often that they grow into those labels: troublemaker, ADHD, ODD, IED, lazy, etc."
raisingkids,2r1fpu,altrocks,7,Fri Jan 2 01:24:50 2015 UTC,"I never once did homework growing up, because there simply was no need to do it. The homework was for homeworks sake.  But boy do I wish I had been instilled with a wee bit of work morale and discipline. I dont do anything unless theres in intrinsic reward for it."
raisingkids,2r1fpu,altrocks,1 point,Fri Jan 2 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"My parents found other ways to do that. Weekends spent doing home renovations or car repairs with them, always involved in team sports, started a morning paper route at 12 that I kept at until I could drive and get a fast food job at 16."

raisingkids,2qy9lk,sprgtime,2,Wed Dec 31 20:53:09 2014 UTC,I was just rereading this page and remembering how much I like it. Thought I'd share in case you haven't seen it.
raisingkids,2qxys3,littlealbatross,6,Wed Dec 31 19:13:01 2014 UTC,"I don't have a custody situation like yours, but we use Choremonster -- it's an app/webpage that tracks tasks and rewards.   My kid loves it, and I actually have a hard time loading it up with enough things for him to do because he does everything immediately. Seems like it would be easy to use across multiple households.     Good luck."
raisingkids,2qxys3,Tgg161,2,Wed Dec 31 20:31:00 2014 UTC,He is big on monsters right now so I bet he would love this.  Thanks!
raisingkids,2qxys3,slodojo,3,Fri Jan 2 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a lot of work. I have also found that charting as a positive reinforcement method looses its ""fun"" pretty quickly. Keep it simple. I would keep them separate."
raisingkids,2qxys3,sprgtime,2,Wed Dec 31 19:46:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah, my concern was my husband and I dropping the ball and not keeping things up to date, but I think his concern was our son feeling like he had two benchmarks to work towards to get any reward. :/  Thanks for the input. :)"
raisingkids,2qxys3,TheTattooedMother,3,Wed Dec 31 19:56:35 2014 UTC,"A child's biggest motivation is to please you.  If his connection is off, he's less likely to do what you want. If he's having a hard time at the other parent's house... I sure wouldn't want to carry that same tally over to your house.   I'm not a fan of reward charts anyway, but... I'd vote to keep them separate. Kids are able to figure out that expectations change based on location anyway.   I love that you and Dad are working together to help create some consistency for him in his routines.   I think his concern was our son feeling like he had two benchmarks to work towards to get any reward. :/   Meh, the kid gets twice as many rewards so I think it evens out."
raisingkids,2qtewu,sprgtime,2,Tue Dec 30 14:33:34 2014 UTC,I'm just not going to tell my kids that people stay up til midnight on new years eve! I don't think they need that information until they're at least 8 or 9.
raisingkids,2qtewu,ilikegnomes,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:45:46 2014 UTC,"Well, it's midnight somewhere at 7 or 8 or 9pm. ;)  I've seen family friendly city events where they have multiple countdowns, like a kid countdown at 9pm, and an adult one at midnight. So a lot of families leave after the 9pm countdown.   My kid is going to bed as early as possible so we can play games into the night. ;)"
raisingkids,2qtewu,ilikegnomes,2,Tue Dec 30 21:22:02 2014 UTC,That's exactly what we're doing! Kids will go to bed at their normal 730 and friends are coming over for games at 8!
