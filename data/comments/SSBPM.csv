SSBPM,3e2jeq,heteroplant,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"Ivysaur to me is a support character that would go well with somebody who can go in on opponents while you control the stage with projectiles. You can't just mindlessly shoot them though. Think: ""what is my objective with this seed bomb? How can I put my partner in a good position using this razor leaf?""  I main Ness but Kirby is my go-to doubles character. It's time for you to make love to the ledge. Position yourself close to your teammate so that you can use your one-hit aerials like nair bair uair to set up combos. You need to also be in close reach of the ledge though so that as soon as your partner can send the opponent off stage, you're there to keep him off. Just remember that sometimes it's better to 2v1 than it is to edgeguard. Also Kirbycides are crazy good in doubles as soon as you have a stock lead, or if your current stock is at high percentage. Opponents aren't as careful for Kirbycide as they are in singles."

I'm a dedicated Melee player, but PM is fun and seems to have it's strong and dedicated followers. But those followers don't seem to translate into attendance these days. And with our scene we're now switching to 3 weeks of Melee for every 1 week of PM.

Many of Lucairo's moves now have a much higher SDI modifier than before, allowing one to escape the combos with a bit less effort with more control over where they go.

SSBPM,3e2vmd,EyebeeLurkin,8,Tue Jul 21 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"People suck at edgeguarding ZSS. It's not hard if you know what you're doing.   Bait my down-b and double jump. 9/10 times, you only need to bait out one since I'll probably use the other to get close enough to the stage to tether. If you failed to do this, pay attention to step 4. Grab the ledge. Seriously, just fucking grab itfirmly grasp it . Don't stay on stage unless you like giving up edgeguards. I will sweetspot the ledge, and your d-tilt pokes and charged f-smashes will not hit me because I can time my reel-in. Stay on the fucking ledge. Don't try to drop down and edgeguard me while I'm hanging unless your character has a really good option to accomplish that. Seriously, just do NOTHING for a second or two. I can't hit you after I've tethered onto the ledge unless you failed to bait out my jumps, and my only other option is to airdodge (WHICH YOU CAN PUNISH IF YOU'RE AWARE THE OPTION EXISTS). If you failed to bait my down-b/double jump, I will drift backwards after reeling in and try and walljump u-air/b-air you off the ledge. Otherwise, just wait for my inevitable landing on stage. EVEN IF IT TAKES 2 REEL-INS, I WILL LAND ON THE FUCKING STAGE EVENTUALLY. PUNISH ME. I HAVE 30 FRAMES OF LANDING LAG, AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING THE FORCED HOP.   This lesson brought to you by the whining of people that don't know the MU."
SSBPM,3e2vmd,Girth94,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"Two further notes:   You can punish the hop on reaction. Tethers have three options: hard drift back, attempt to ledge cancel the forced hop, and drift forward. Study your options in each scenario. The hop itself is inactionable aside from fastfalling for 50 frames, and if she lands she incurs 30 frames landing lag. Debug mode and a little thought will go a long way. Don't just go for the mindless aerial, see how much you can get. Tethers are forced to reel in after 90 frames. If they wait at least one second to reel in and you're below 100%, you can turn this to your advantage and bypass your reaction time by hogging the ledge with a standard getup. <100 getup animations take just over 30 frames, so when you account for reaction time and getup options you net comparable (in some cases better) frame advantage if you getup at the exact same time as their reel in and substantially more if they wait the full duration."

Sheik, Snake, Squirtle, Marth, Kirby, Jiggs, more that I can't name off the top of my head) it's better to crouch under the lasers/try to powershield them."
SSBPM,3e2vmd,Dunjunmstr,5,Tue Jul 21 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"I was looking through the 'complain-about-my-main' thread and was just reminded about how much PM turnips suck. The 'dealing-with-turnips' meta hasn't evolved for everybody yet to realise that in the majority of cases, when people learn and use AGT, that turnips not only can't be used for edgeguarding but they also suck in neutral. They are definitely not worth as much in PM as they are in Melee.  Thread  The video linked to in that post shows exactly what people who know the Peach MU well enough can get away with."
SSBPM,3e2vmd,Buttkream911,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:19 2015 UTC,Interesting. I completely forgot that one can press 'Z' to catch an item without airdodging until I saw that happen...that'll make dealing with quite a few characters easier! o.o
SSBPM,3e2vmd,fudgepop01,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"Against Ike:   Not knowing how to deal with the d-throw/f-throw DI trap. Always DI for the forward throw, and if you see the D-throw animation start, change directions. The animation is slow enough you can do that. Too much respect offstage. Ike is not that hard to edgeguard on stages without walls. If he's recovering with quick draw you can just jump in front of him and throw a hitbox. If he's recovering with aether you can either take ledge or wait for the vulnerability frames at the top of the jump and hit him with something. Biggest mistake: getting hit with the schlong-sword. Don't do that."

Whether it's forgetting they're there, or forgetting you can roll through/shield/tech them, or just blatantly running into them, everyone seems to mess up how they interact with the mines. Very few players blow them up willingly or combo into them, but they certainly could. I feel like it would help people with the matchup in a similar fashion to keeping Diddy's banana in check.

SSBPM,3dzoul,stowe9616,31,Mon Jul 20 20:56:23 2015 UTC,The difference in who died first is not due to screen ko vs star ko. Zelda died first because she had higher damage and is also floatier than Sheik.

SSBPM,3dzoul,Super_Bad_64,2,Tue Jul 21 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"What about having blast zone KOs on the last stock only? That way, the gameplay is kept the same in general, but stuff like this doesn't happen, and you can have last-stock offstage Solar Beams and Rests."

SSBPM,3dzknm,cheeseguy314,4,Tue Jul 21 02:25:51 2015 UTC,"Wavedash out of shield is extremely important tech, especially for Snake. You can do it by either light-pressing L/R to shield then jumping and immediately pressing the same button again to wavedash (full press though), or by shielding with one trigger and wavedashing with the other while still holding shield. I prefer the two-trigger method because it's easier, but it's PM-specific so I wouldn't recommend it if you play Melee. I don't so it's no problem for me. ;)  EDIT: Redacted."

SSBPM,3e0nyg,Drinkingfood,2,Tue Jul 21 06:28:49 2015 UTC,"<3  Unrelated, but I'm thinking of picking up ROB. I've seen you and Sneez and have been very impressed. Any tips to get started? I'm having trouble in neutral."
SSBPM,3e0nyg,FingerStripes,5,Tue Jul 21 13:28:10 2015 UTC,"Learn all your gyro tech, including glide tossing and AGTing while moving various directions and throwing various directions with the cstick. Keep in mind ROB has no real grounded approach options unless you have a gyro in hand. If you get good with gyro, people will come to you. Learn to boost fair/upair/bair very close to the ground like a DJC and learn to do it slightly above the ground with the same timing (FF so the hitbox barely comes out before you land. Boost fair is -2 on shield so it's safe linked into jabs, utilt, and dash away. Crouch cancel a lot; you don't have to be crouching to CC, but holding down when you're busy with another animation, say an fsmash or something, makes you automatically safe from weaker hits at low percents. Additionally, ROB has a very powerful bait in the form of run up->crouch. Most players will feel threatened enough by the run-up due to ROB's great pressuring ability (boost fair being safe on shield is the main reason) that they will pre-emptively retaliate to stop you from going in, if you crouch, your CC of this move they throw out will be much much better, and you will be able to punish with dsmash, dtilt, grab, or usmash. Also, ROB can whittle down shields. Boost fair is safe if done low to the ground, boost nair from higher up lets you cross up and does a bunch of shield damage. The good thing anout whittling shields is that it makes people antsy to approach so they don't get caught not shielding (which most people won't do to avoid a shield break). Additionally, dsmash is a good shield poke option."

SSBPM,3e1ljd,LifeSmash,15,Tue Jul 21 07:57:51 2015 UTC,"DK and Diddy couldn't be classified as Mario characters by any logical means.   Mario (known as ""Jumpman"" at the time) was initially a character from the original Donkey Kong game before he ever got his own series (or even his own name). So if anything, Mario is a Donkey Kong character.  And Diddy first appeared in Donkey Kong Country so idk how he could be even remotely considered a Mario character.  But for the most part, I agree in not understanding why Bowser got his own universe. Maybe it was just practice for a future character, or maybe they felt like Bowser deserved something but didn't know what to give him lol."

The old one made him seem like he was part of the Mario team, and he's really not. None of the villains are, other than Ganon (part of the Triforce, it would be really odd to separate him from the triforce in anyway, IMO)  Bowser's kind of in his own ""alliance"" so to speak. On his own team.  D3, MK and Wolf are the only other eligible characters, really. M2 MAYBE if they go with the Movie or with the fact that he's an artificial Pokemon."
SSBPM,3e1ljd,SensualMuffins,7,Tue Jul 21 09:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the logos are just to tell you what series they're from. There's no Bowser series so I have to agree that it is a little silly.  Victory theme works though."

SSBPM,3e1ljd,ThatsBullocks,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"Would the songs have to come from Smashville? 'Cuz stages like Castle Siege, Port Town, Halberd, Lylat Cruise, and WarioWare have a shitload of songs (even without the latter's Microgame songs)."
SSBPM,3e1ljd,PartyAmericaBeer,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"I'd assumed that since they drew from Smashville's tracks instead of the Wario Ware Microgames or extra songs on other stages, there was a specific reason they wouldn't use those. I think they're trying to avoid cutting down song lists (see their remorse on changing PS2's list to 3 songs), and Warioware's Microgames are still used in the alt version of Warioware."

SSBPM,3dzjzw,NICKisICE,38,Mon Jul 20 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"same with most of jigg's b moves. extremely situational, and honestly, there could be much more useful moves."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Shadowfax7337,21,Mon Jul 20 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"jigg's tilts even suffer from being useless, which is the far more serious problem imo."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Sothe-,15,Mon Jul 20 21:12:43 2015 UTC,Jiggs has such shitty ground movement that having marginally better tilts wouldn't really be a huge boon to her anyways. Can't use tilts while you're weaving in the air
SSBPM,3dzjzw,CelebratoryCrouching,11,Mon Jul 20 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it just doesn't seem conceptually right at all to have moves that are incorrect 100% of the time. Since jiggs players do use up-tilt to rest, there are clearly times that tilting is correct, so why not allow jiggs to have better tilts?  We could have ftilt be slightly longer than it is now (maybe) and have it act as a decent horizontal launcher that would force a techchase situation or something.   This might be stupid, but we could leave jigg's dtilt unchanged aside from adding a kind of tripping effect that acts similar to getting hit with diddy's banana (maybe techable, maybe not, I'm not sure, I just came up with it lol). I don't think this would be broken because, let's be real, how are you ever going to hit with dtilt in a neutral situation. You would have to call a tech with it, since it comes out so slow and has such a bad hitbox.   Another thing about jiggs is that in the air, all she does is space bairs until she gets forced to cross up nair or retreat (or get hit). Uair only comes out during combos and platform techchases, but what about fair? Fair's soft hitbox lasts a decent amount of time, but doesn't really do much of anything, while the hard hitbox seems really difficult to hit with in neutral. Perhaps what could be done is a buff to the knockback of the soft hit, and maybe pull back on the amount of time the hitbox stays out, while keeping the endlag of the move overall the same.   Those are just some briefly thought out ideas I've had before that hopefully avoids balancing around rest too much. My dtilt might get in trouble in that regard, but I don't think it would be too bad."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Sothe-,11,Mon Jul 20 23:02:46 2015 UTC,dtilt [...] tripping   That's a tech chase. That's a 1/4 chance of getting a Rest out of a tech chase. Think about that for a second.   what about fair?   It depends on the MU.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,MizterUltimaman,4,Tue Jul 21 01:24:42 2015 UTC,"I don't play jiggs, and the suggestions I came up with are just quick suggestions that came off the top of my head, so there are likely really really big flaws in them. I don't think a 1/4 chance of getting a rest is too big a deal though when (at least the impression I get out of it) dtilt is near impossible to land in neutral, due to its hella slow startup and endlag. If you disagree with that reasoning, then you're the jiggs player here and I believe you before myself lol."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Sothe-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:13 2015 UTC,"endlag   Not really. There's a ""trick"" to decrease the endlag. The move, in total, takes 39 frames. But you're only required to be in the dtilt animation for 30 frames. (Yes, it's only 9 frames, but I can feel the difference.) On frames 31-39, you can do whatever you want other than shielding. If you walked or crouched on frame 31, you can shield on frame 32.  Basically, the move has 9 frames less of endlag than it appears (or 8 if you want to shield)."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,MizterUltimaman,4,Tue Jul 21 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"9 frames IASA is a good deal, I still feel the 1 frame difference in my bair from 3.02 to 3.5."

My problem with the fair is that it never really comes out in the neutral due to bair being pretty undeniably better in at least 95% of situations. I also had in mind that soft fair would be hard enough to add an interesting depth of punish and combo game when you call a tech/getup roll with it.

Every time I say something about the chaingrab, or a setup throw or the techchases, or the chain everyone goes crazy because a lot of people either have flashbacks from Melee or simply are bad because Sheik is nowhere near as powerful in this game as she was in Melee, much less now that the entire cast is good."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Sothe-,14,Mon Jul 20 20:48:24 2015 UTC,"I don't get it lol. She even got her 50/50 throw mixup removed, so now all she has is a techchase d-throw.

SSBPM,3dzjzw,Epicfaillord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"Sheik isn't even...good anymore. She cannot chain throw a single character in the game with any use to my knowledge (maybe regrab twice? I don't even think so, even if she could that's not even remotely broken compared to Mario's throws), and is now essentially forced to tech chase. Except there's already about 10 characters that tech chase with their down throw so how useful can we even call that?  Sheik's recovery, at low levels, is REALLY good. People simply have no clue how to punish it. That being said, once you get to a certain skill level (particularly with melee vets) her recovery is actually one of the most easily abused in the game.  I'd be very happy with this change."

SSBPM,3dzjzw,Crawfiish,0,Mon Jul 20 21:32:00 2015 UTC,Because having a melee-like chaingrab was disgusting and made me want to hurl. She's literally half the reason most of the low tier characters are so non-viable.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,nikovan_smash,4,Mon Jul 20 23:06:25 2015 UTC,Chaingrabs were sheiks thing though. Fix the matchups and let her chaingrab high tiers.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Epicfaillord,0,Mon Jul 20 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"Nah, chaingrabs really don't have a lot of interesting counter-play involved in them.   There's better directions the character could take, but that would likely involve changing her play style a bit, and the PMDT really wants to avoid that for some reason."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,nikovan_smash,5,Tue Jul 21 07:13:32 2015 UTC,"That wasn't why the low tiers were non-viable. It was because they lacked range on their attacks, they couldn't combo, they had awful defensive options, they had free recovery gimps, and in some cases, they were flat-out bugged like G&W. The CG was what everyone placed their blame on, but in reality when you're a low tier you just lack options whatsoever. Sheik happened to be a character that could punish characters really hard in neutral for not having options."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,EmLeingod,10,Tue Jul 21 15:02:09 2015 UTC,And the sad thing is that there's Pit and Meta Knight that can either chaingrab better or get more out of techchases.

SSBPM,3dzjzw,Atlas627,5,Mon Jul 20 22:00:05 2015 UTC,Yeah for him it's a high-risk high reward situation.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Daeee,3,Tue Jul 21 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly her throw mix up was really awkward and ended up being worse than a 50/50, re-grabbing from a b-throw changes Sheik's direction and so a D-throw would punish correct b-throw DI. All while correct DI for b-throw changes every regrab off of b-throw. Surprisingly difficult to get out of."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,EmLeingod,11,Mon Jul 20 21:23:56 2015 UTC,Are you serious???  Hold down twice on the mix up and you're out if you're a fast faller.  Down and away if you're midweight.  It's really not that hard people.    Oooor you can DI for the dthrow since it's fast and then correct the DI if she bthrows.  People are just dumb.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Theytah,-2,Tue Jul 21 09:27:39 2015 UTC,"They were the same speed and faster than the average human reaction time, not even accounting for decision-making.  Fast fallers fell out with down. Midweights had to down and ""away"" but the whole point was that away was swapped for the other throw. Floaties just had to hold up.  Best case she got a tipper upsmash or regrab, worst case she got a techchase. Apparently that was overwhelming, but nobody PMDT has made it clear which part was overwhelming. If it was the tipper upsmash, then they should have lowered the angles. If it was the positional advantage, they should have either made upthrow a DI mixup or made fthrow faster as a mixup with dthrow. If it was the techchase, then they should have increased the base knockback so best case was regrab (maybe DACUS?) and worst was nothing. If it was the regrab, reduce the damage on the throws so you'd need more correct guesses to rack up damage.  Sheik is still a good character, but she's pretty boring now that her throws have little decision making. I really really miss the mixup"
SSBPM,3dzjzw,SensualMuffins,7,Tue Jul 21 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"Make it a tether like in Brawl.    Please. It's so unbelievably easy to edgeguard Sheik.  If they go for the ledge, grab it. Done deal. If they go on stage (without ledge-cancelling the landing lag, which is hard as hell) it's a free punish, and you can pretty easily force them on stage by edgehogging.  It's obvious that ""because Melee"" is no longer a viable excuse to keep Sheik's tether removed. With how tethers have been reworked to be edgeguardable, I don't see why she can't have it back. As it is, Sheik's only recovery mix up is turning into Zelda, which is a hardware dependent option (When I boot PM from SD card the transformation is instant. When I boot from a modded ISO, it takes a couple seconds and loses it's viability as a recovery option)."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,gabriel_larkins,2,Tue Jul 21 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"As someone who plays a tether character in PM (Ivy) and Sheik in melee:  Honestly a tether wouldn't help her much, trust me.  Tethers are pretty awful currently."

SSBPM,3dzjzw,auramaudegone,4,Tue Jul 21 13:33:21 2015 UTC,If someone is holding the edge (which is the correct way to edge guard sheik anyway) then there is a full half second after popping up where you eat a hit.

SSBPM,3dzjzw,NhgrtPlayer,6,Tue Jul 21 03:17:52 2015 UTC,It was useful. I wasn't aware it was changed. It substantially improves his recovery once he's lost his jump.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,EmLeingod,2,Tue Jul 21 03:30:37 2015 UTC,It actually makes his recovery worse now. Better off just airdodging. His regular air speed is faster than eggroll.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Daeee,0,Tue Jul 21 04:00:28 2015 UTC,Well...that's actually kind of lame. Now it's a useless move.
SSBPM,3dzjzw,EmLeingod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:48:06 2015 UTC,His recovery was pretty strong in 3.5 lol.  He still has stuff.

I just hate the idea of moves in this particular game being wrong in basically all situations. I'm fine with it in other smash games, but I guess I feel like this particular game can actually be perfect. Nobody ever expects melee to be."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,EmLeingod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:26 2015 UTC,Has anyone really experimented with side-b as an attack?
SSBPM,3dzjzw,fracktail,3,Tue Jul 21 07:24:49 2015 UTC,"back in 3.02 it was good, but the change from 3.02 to 3.5 dramatically increased its endlag."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Mallow-kun,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"After you realize that the hitstun is dramatically shorter than the endlag for the move, you stop experimenting pretty fast.  There's a weird glitch similar to a watered down version of Ness's melee yo-yo glitch, but it isn't practical.  It can be used to rack up a large amount of % on a recovering opponent, but they can almost always get back whereas Sheik can just...kill someone off stage."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Loyal2NES,6,Tue Jul 21 07:32:03 2015 UTC,"You know if it's all the same to the sheik mains here, I'd much rather sideb do something new than nothing at all/needles."

SSBPM,3dzjzw,nikovan_smash,4,Tue Jul 21 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"Well we could either give Shiek a tether or the bouncing fish. As far as Jiggs goes I'd rather you be able to act out of up b faster and make rollout faster with less recovery (or just less recovery). But back to Shiek, if not a tether or bouncing fish, maybe another projectile or a counter?"
SSBPM,3dzjzw,redbeanjelly,4,Mon Jul 20 23:10:14 2015 UTC,If nothing else can we at least get the EXTREME startup and endlag taken off. Then it could at least be used for some disrespect points. As it is now its too slow for even that. But the Scorpion chain idea sounds super siq and I'd totally be down for that even if it was still super slow.

SSBPM,3dzjzw,Atlas627,17,Mon Jul 20 21:25:29 2015 UTC,"Right, but let's be real. All of Samus' b attacks are incredibly useful. Why does Sheik have to be stuck with a completely useless one?"
SSBPM,3dzjzw,reignstormx11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Because she doesn't need it. Take away or weaken any of Samus's B moves and I'd argue that she'd be a significantly weaker character, to a point where it'd actually be unreasonable for her to stay that way. Clearly Sheik is not in the same position, since she's sat comfortably at the top of the Melee tier list for a long time, and chain has been shit that entire time. Most people agree that she was a perfectly potent character in 3.5, and many still think so in 3.6 despite the grab nerf. If she ends up sinking to bottom 5 in eight or nine months' time, then we can talk about changing her and her moves.  Not every move needs to be useful. Move utility shouldn't be analyzed in a vacuum. Sheik is still good."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,Atlas627,4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"Sheik is still good. Doesn't mean she is busted or she wouldn't prefer to actually use her side b for something, even if it was something situational.  I can't comprehend people looking at chain and saying leave it as it is because Sheik is good. All of Fox's b moves are useful. All of Falco's. All of Ike's. All of G&W's. All of Roy's. All of Marth's. All of Ivy's. Are you implying Sheik is sooo good that she doesn't deserve a useful side b, even if it turns out to be a situational one?"
SSBPM,3dzjzw,MizterUltimaman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:48 2015 UTC,"This isn't a question of what a character deserves, because what people feel a character deserves has little bearing on what is actually relevant to the game as a whole. This issue is about balance and design. Now is chain designed well? I'd agree with you that it isn't, cause like you said, it's a nonfunctional move. But does it fit in accordance with the balance of the character and how she fits within the game's balance? I think so, as of right now anyway."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,fracktail,18,Tue Jul 21 00:58:02 2015 UTC,"""Shiek is good so it's okay to have a useless move""  I gotta disagree with that. There is not point in having a move that doesn't have any proper functionality, that's why Jigs isn't viable in PM compared to melee"
SSBPM,3dzjzw,ElPanandero,23,Tue Jul 21 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"It's fine if you disagree with me, but I'd just like to remind you that there's other reasons why Jiggs isn't very good, and that despite all the stigma, some people still consider her ""viable""."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,VaranFenix,19,Tue Jul 21 05:02:04 2015 UTC,"""Don't every use the move ever"" is a terrible counter-argument.  Plup lost Evo because he did this. He's the best Melee Sheik to my knowledge, unless you count M2K as a Sheik.  My point is, having the move in her kit at all harms her so why the fuck is it there?"
SSBPM,3dzjzw,OriginalName244,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"Plup lost a match at Evo because he made a mistake. So he shouldn't have made the mistake. Mistakes get you punished in Smash. If a Sheik wants to not get punished for making mistakes, they should make fewer mistakes. They shouldn't whine that the possibility of a wrong input exists, they should just get better and not make the wrong input."
SSBPM,3dzjzw,TeamDogfight,16,Mon Jul 20 23:09:38 2015 UTC,What's GOOD about having a move that's ALWAYS the wrong input though?  The move serves to make Sheik weaker.

It also set up ledge hogging and good mix up for edge guarding. But, it might be hard not to move and do needles at the same time which would be pretty wonky.

Tons of characters in PM actually have absurd potential like lucario, lucas, ivysaur (you might not believe me, but it's there), GnW, wolf, squirtle, and tons of others that don't have a well-explored meta. There are lots of characters with no outstanding mains like sethlon for roy, prof pro for snake, and more, so there are plenty of characters without players exploring really deep into the character's intricacies. In other instances, there are characters like lucario that have iPK, lucas with Neon, and others that have so many possible options to be explored and so many new things to be seen that the possibilities really do seem endless.  Of course PMDT can't balance the game with undiscovered things in mind, which is why balance patches need to exist in the first place.

SSBPM,3dy42w,DarkLava,34,Mon Jul 20 17:26:01 2015 UTC,I love seeing Lucky have such a good time with PM. So many top players in Melee just trash on the game. Refreshing to see he and a few others still like the game.
SSBPM,3dy42w,BestNameEver_,5,Mon Jul 20 15:28:56 2015 UTC,Why do they not like PM?
SSBPM,3dy42w,fudgepop01,29,Mon Jul 20 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"It normally goes like ""I'm better than this person at Melee. I therefore should beat them at Project M."" They lose because they don't practice the game. ""This game is stupid."" Or they lose to a person they've never heard of, or against a character they've never played and get very salty. Could also be because they see it as a cheap knock off of Melee.  Of course not every top melee player thinks like this. I admittedly exaggerated with ""so many."" A lot are just apathetic, some want to see it die, some want to see it prosper. Not a whole lot you can do."
SSBPM,3dy42w,ZackNavySox27,4,Mon Jul 20 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting the everyone got the most exposure to the game during 3.0, and for many, that's how they continue to see the game."
SSBPM,3dy42w,Turrbanator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting point. I haven't thought of it quite like this before.   Perhaps it would be a good idea to stop referencing the famous matches of the past builds as what PM is/can be,  because that's simply not right anymore. Neon vs. M2K at LTC2 is one of those matches that will remain legendary on many levels for many reasons, however those characters been severely changed since then to bring about a healthier balance for the game as a whole."
SSBPM,3dy42w,Nomlin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:30 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like when it comes to Melee players it seems like that they feel like the characters are too ""cheap"" and they don't feel like learning the game because they have no incentive to, and because at the end of the day, it's not melee"
SSBPM,3dy42w,tmrxwoot,11,Tue Jul 21 04:12:09 2015 UTC,well to be fair alot of the criticism the game gets is pretty valid. There is alot of really easy jank you can spam in PM that doesnt really exist in melee.
SSBPM,3dy42w,Nomlin,13,Tue Jul 21 09:16:15 2015 UTC,"Because of balance changes, apparent ""jank"" from a majority of the cast, changes to melee top tiers, etc."

SSBPM,3dy42w,Nomlin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Well if spacies were introduced in Pm, they would be the equivalent of like 2005 spacie gameplay, so they woukd get shit on more, especially if people are beating spacies now with characters introduced to PM"
SSBPM,3dy42w,Aceroth,10,Mon Jul 20 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"Well, not necessarily. PM meta is developing pretty fast because we know what to look for. I don't think it would take too long to get spacies to the level of being almost broken like they are now.  I'm going to edit right now and repeat almost broken.

His punish game is devastating however it is tough to get into punish situations in the first place."

SSBPM,3dy42w,drewkid,6,Mon Jul 20 19:33:52 2015 UTC,The throw animation feels most cheap and janky to me.
SSBPM,3dy42w,ABMatrix,3,Mon Jul 20 19:51:12 2015 UTC,"None of this hitbox animations match their active lengths. Just looking at a gif of his dtilt makes me curdle with bullshit inside. The character is like opposite fox--people who play as him can get by by converting on mistakes they make, simply due to how long his active hitboxes are and how large they are and how little they resemble their animations."
SSBPM,3dy42w,drewkid,8,Tue Jul 21 00:11:51 2015 UTC,I agree about the throws. The mixups are real because the animations are all the same. Up does come out very fast (frame 1?)
SSBPM,3dy42w,Tokimobile,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:45 2015 UTC,Up b got nerfed in 3.6 to a frame 3 hitbox from frame 1 I think.

SSBPM,3dy42w,Drinkingfood,8,Mon Jul 20 16:11:57 2015 UTC,How does he grab Fox through his dairshine? I thought Fox has perfect shield pressure with some aerial to shine.
SSBPM,3dy42w,ghettoblush,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:13 2015 UTC,shines are not invincible in this game so if it happens on the same frame as a grab it will be beaten
SSBPM,3dy42w,Drinkingfood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:08 2015 UTC,"That's not a very common occurance; shine invul rarely even affected shield pressure in melee and shine usually beat grab OoS on virtue of speed, not invul"
SSBPM,3dy42w,ghettoblush,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:51 2015 UTC,It can definitely happen. Space an aerial too high on shield and you are vulnerable to trading with a grab with shine. It's happened to me on multiple occasions.
SSBPM,3dy42w,Drinkingfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:01 2015 UTC,"If you're spacing an aerial to high on shield chances are the shine isn't even coming out before you're being grabbed lol. Grab beating shine hitbox is literally a 1 frame window, shine in melee went from being safe from grabs after a -6 aerial on shield to being safe from grabs in PM after a -5 aerial on shield. I'm not saying it can't happen, but the likelihood is not high enough for it to be worthy of discussion  EDIT: In fact I re-watched the set and shine didn't trade with grab a single time"

Lucky has clearly never seen a gdubs player even half his caliber before. If both players had equal matchup knowledge this would be much more even.  This is not very representative of gdubs as a character. I've fought plenty of people who have adapted to gdubs mid-set and beat me and plenty of people who haven't. Lucky didn't. That's his fault. MrLZ clearly did some adapting if game 3 shows anything.  Don't point fingers. Learn the matchup.  It's not as bad as you think."
SSBPM,3dy42w,mutoeien,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Lucky had a few cases of bad DI and it looked like gdubs took him by surprise.

Dakpo's play style, I feel, has evolved into a really solid and beautiful one. This kid is just crazy too, both are extremely fun to watch for me.

SSBPM,3e1m3l,Luk101,7,Tue Jul 21 06:52:43 2015 UTC,"It is also worth noting that getting hit with eruption as you are riding up the wall should not mean death. You have a couple options to recover despite getting hit.  Even though it hits you downward, it is a meteor smash, meaning you can up B again right after getting hit by it.   Also it should be pretty easy to just input a tech on the way up so you can tech the wall and survive."
SSBPM,3e1m3l,elre233,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:18 2015 UTC,Okay I'll have to try out these options next time. Thanks!
SSBPM,3e1m3l,Narelex,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:18 2015 UTC,What character were you using? Since what options Ike uses to edgeguard are dependant on that fact.
SSBPM,3e1m3l,NightKev,2,Tue Jul 21 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"Considering his flair and the fact that he mentioned riding up the side of the stage as part of his recovery, I'd say 99.99% chance he plays Ness. Probably."
SSBPM,3e1m3l,Narelex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do play ness and even if I time my recovery right to get a sweetspot, if  my friend's Ike is on point I'm going to get spiked."
SSBPM,3e1m3l,RadiantBlade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:15:13 2015 UTC,Yeah Ness is one of the easier ones to use eruption against if you're riding up the wall. I'd suggest trying some different angles and snapping from above if possible. Also maybe stalling with magnet a tad. Eruption is only death if you're at really high % or he spikes with the tip.  Any character with a linear recovery can be hit with eruption so this is just a case of try to avoid getting put offstage. Ike is one of Ness's harder Mu's last time I checked.
SSBPM,3e1m3l,RoadWarriorRonin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"Ally uses it here are some examples https://youtu.be./lQztIDp6jT4?t=88 and https://youtu.be/lQztIDp6jT4?t=1036. From what I seen, it is used but compared to other moves, very rarely. I use it as a mix up, taking a gamble with the heavy armor if they attacking while trying to recover, and if they are below me. I believe people avoid using it due to the fact that there safer options out there as Eruption lacks horizontal range and perhaps they dislike the start up? I think Ike's edgeguard depends on the player and character. If there is anyone to correct me, I would love to learn more about Ike, as I still need work on my Ike. EDIT: Failing to link correctly and fixing it."
SSBPM,3e1m3l,tealzombie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:59:30 2015 UTC,Yeah my friend really likes to just sit at the stage when you're off the edge and wait for you to make a move then react so eruption makes a lot of sense for his playstyle.

You can slide your thumb from jump to b like you would do for a multishine just at the moment you input diagonally down after your dash.  It makes it easier to get the max distance of your wavedash and it makes the ""startup"" faster which makes it a safer approach/bait/mixup in the neutral.  On an other subjet, I need to practice the ledge cancelled pkt2 you do there, they look really cool !"
SSBPM,3dzme4,Azzucips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:52 2015 UTC,I use jump with x and use y to taunt(footstool combos) so I can't slide it without hitting A. I can get them pretty low but I just kinda turned on my wii and messed around a little. kinda related do you think that the super low magnet is good? I see people on smashboards talk about it but when I do it I don't really see it being THAT useful.
SSBPM,3dzme4,guysneedlovetoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"But what adelrune is saying, is that if you're going to do a sh magnet to djc ff fair then if you get the magnet closer to the ground there will be less distance for you to drop, letting you l cancel sooner,and making it faster and less punishable."
SSBPM,3dzme4,iSnowden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:42 2015 UTC,I understand why I should be closer to the ground but some people were making look like they were sliding on the ground. is that for the same reason? I think it makes sense now that I think about it.
SSBPM,3e0okp,Acenus,7,Tue Jul 21 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"His tech roll is a balancing point. Lucas has fantastic mobility. Opponents should be able to convert off of knockdowns for getting in on Lucas. B-reversing literally just turns your character around. There is no b-reverse in the game that increases the speed of a move. Ganon's flame choke gets some extra distance, and that only happens because he takes a step back on frame 2 and b-reverse happens on frame 5. It also only works with the grounded version. The ""reward"" for being frame-perfect was just a bug, ya know? I don't think Lucas mains should be compensated because they got used to abusing a tool that was never supposed to exist in the first place. Lucas already gets a stall with magnet. Two stalls is silly."
SSBPM,3e0okp,Girth94,3,Tue Jul 21 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think that Lucas having fantastic mobility necessitates a slower tech roll.  Right now, Lucas's fall speed makes him fairly easy to combo, and his light weight also makes him reach KO percent faster than most characters.  Also, his fastest aerial options (fair, magnet) come out on frame 5, which is considerably slower than some characters (Fox, Falco, G&W of the top of my head).  I'm not saying that Lucas gets comboed harder than anyone else in the game - obviously, characters like Bowser and Charizard deserve that title - but he's certainly easier to combo than many.  And him having a bad tech roll only worsens the problem, since even if he DIs correctly or his opponent drops an easy combo, it's not hard for his opponent to read the tech and keep the combo going.  In Project M, Lucas is designed to be a character that can combo well, but also get comboed hard.  In 3.0, obviously he was too good at comboing and killing, what with his back air and insane shield pressure.  But in 3.5 and 3.6B, he was weakened to the point where he gets comboed harder than he himself can combo others.  I do agree with your thoughts on B-reversed snowballs.  And using OU to stall was in 3.5, it just wasn't very good since it was too easily readable for too little reward.  I don't mind that change too much, although it does make misinputting offstage extremely dangerous for Lucas now.  Edit: Up air is frame 5 also, and down air is frame 4."
SSBPM,3e0okp,ObeyHypnotoad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:13 2015 UTC,"And you also forgot that Nair is frame 4 as well. G&W aerial frame data is comparatively a lot worse than lucas except for Uair. In fact, most of his aerials have double the startup time that Lucas has. Also lucas frame data for the most part is on par with Fox and Falco. The only gripe I have about this character is that once you reach a level where opponents learn to tech his Dair, a lot of lucas combo game has to become extremely technical for him to get any results. Mind you, if you can achieve that level of consistency with his techniques, then Lucas becomes a demon reminiscent of his 3.0 days.   Probably the only changes Id like to see to the character is a slightly larger fair sweetspot hitbox, a 1% damage increase to the sweetspot of his bair, or better tech rolls. Not that he really needs them since he's a complete character, but it just makes his life easier. Reduced hitlag on magnet would be cool to, so he could act out of it immediately like in 3.02 (without as much advantage) would be cool too, but not necessary, just a way to speed up his gameplay."
SSBPM,3e0okp,th3bman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought Ganon's was intended.  My reasoning for the neutral b stall was giving away offense for a chance to mix up recovery, but none of these changes are really necessary."
SSBPM,3e0okp,XxNick99xX,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:11 2015 UTC,"There's really no reason to give Lucas another stall on his recovery since he already has magnet.

SSBPM,3e0okp,Fastpakii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"Lucas is still viable I feel, but after playing 3.0 Lucas for so long, the nerfs to him (especially sweetspots on his aerials) mess with my muscle memory too much. I try to go for combos that just don't work anymore, his projectile is nerfed, and something about his movement just doesn't feel the same. Basically I dropped Lucas not because I think he's bad (he's still viable), I dropped him because no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get my muscle memory to adapt to the changes. This is why eventually my former sub, Roy, moved up to main for me, and Ganondorf took the place of sub."

SSBPM,3dyw07,chrisp_,4,Mon Jul 20 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. Otherwise, Snake wouldn't be able to recover from more than a meager distance, Sonic and Rob would be simple and easy to edgeguard, Snake and G&W lose one of their few good OoS options, and all of them -- Snake, Mewtwo, Sonic, Rob, Lucario, Snake, G&W -- are anywhere from slightly worse to neutered in terms of punish game. As I see it, all of these characters are in a very good place this patch and no amount of buffs could compensate for losing so many options integral to their playstyles."
SSBPM,3dyw07,chrisp_,3,Mon Jul 20 21:34:10 2015 UTC,Depends on the Up-b tbh.   I'm okay with Lucario being able to cancel his with an aura charge but I'm not sure if it should retain jumps after being cancelled.
SSBPM,3dyw07,Narelex,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not against it, per se, but I wouldn't mind if it represented a more significant choice by the player. I think Sonic/Snake/G&W can't airdodge out of up-b, but that's it. Considering how powerful of a combo starter each of those up-b's are, it's not really a conscious risk/reward sort of thing to use them. The only danger is a whiff, which is really your own fault anyways.  I don't know what an alternative would be, but generally it doesn't bug me that much so I don't particularly care."
SSBPM,3dyw07,EyebeeLurkin,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:46 2015 UTC,Sonic and Snake also lose their double jump. Sonic also must sacrifice all other Specials once his up-special is used.  GnW's is preserved for more combo potential.

I do it quite often -- it's very useful as you can imagine. o3o  The key is resetting your control stick to neutral as Lucario is facing downwards in the upB animation near the ledge. As long as the stick is in neutral and Lucario is deading downwards*, the grabbox is active. It's actually really well-implemented imo, for it allows me to travel beyond the ledge with upB when in 3.02 and below it would auto-snap IIRC.  *downwards means 'Lucario is losing height,' not 'Lucario is heading straight down parallel to the ledge'"

SSBPM,3e07j6,Im_French,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:43 2015 UTC,Not the only one at all! Once you understand how it all works it's relatively easy to snap from a wide variety of locations. :3

DownB feels like such a versatile move since you can jump cancel it, dice kick, wall jump out of it, and control the distance you travel with it. The problem that makes her recovery bad more than anything is how weak tethers are atm. Most characters with ""fair"" recoveries die when hit once off stage   Aside from downb there were some buffs and much needed QoL changes so I feel like overall ZSS is stronger this patch."

Even with sethlon, oracle, and awestin destroying everyone I still felt like chicago was a deeper area and we just didn't have the experience to win big tournaments aside from Kirk and Metroid.

SSBPM,3dx2dp,twosnaresandacymbal,7,Mon Jul 20 08:06:48 2015 UTC,"1) 64- falcon/fox Brawl- Marth/ZSS Melee- Marth/Sheik PM- ZSS/Roy Sm4sh- Roy/Falcon  2) I'm not a fan of jiggs at all. I would rather make her aerials less obnoxious and give her usable tilts/specials. If I had to though, I think rollout during the charge could be shield cancellable or only be cancellable before you hit someone's shield/hurtbox. Sing is a silly move and I would probably rather just replace it considering it's only use is to sweetspot ledge.  3) Progressive Rock/Metal (think where Prog got his name from) Favorite artists would have to be Rush and Dream Theater/ Liquid Tension Experiment  4) I would love to see dustforce alts for the mario characters but unfortunately they all have so many costumes already before you even mention the obscurity of that game reference or legality/permissions pending  5) Nothing beats an Italian beef with sweet peppers and mozzarella melted on top with a root beer. People not from Chicago are missing out!  6) I just love the freedom we have in design decisions. We are free to include so many obscure references that casuals and diehards love alike along with the ability to literally change any moves sets we want at will.  7) I play a lot of hearthstone and steam games. I play a lot of rogue likes and have way too many hours into binding of isaac/rebirth and crypt of the necrodancer specifically. Couldn't tell you why I like roguelikes so much. Probably just has to do with how different the game is every time you play it or something   8) I think yoshi is really good in 3.6. As a baseline, yoshi is a mid-high tier in melee already, then just receiving bigger tilts compared to melee and being able to jump out of shield are both huge buffs. Yoshi got even more on top of that so I see him sort of like Pikachu where a real niche but tournament viable melee character got some pretty significant buffs.  9) I wish melee characters were unique and had their own pm flair. I don't dislike any of them but I already play melee, you know? I used to like pm a lot for the purpose of being able to play new characters against the melee elite but honestly pm hasn't resembled melee to me since like 2.5.  10) although they are not mutually exclusive things, I don't think there is any chance of dash cancelled laser coming back. It was fitting for a world of 3.02 characters and necessary to have any chance to get in or run away from them but not really in 3.6. If anything I kind of just want unclankable lasers back. As for tether grab, I wouldn't mind so much. A lot of people thought it brought a lot of flavor to her and it could be better made to fit her character (aka not a 16 frame start up on grab lol)"

SSBPM,3dx2dp,itisapanda,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"If anything I kind of just want unclankable lasers back.   Mind if I ask why? I don't see how this addresses any of the things that make Paralyzer fundamentally underpowered post-3.5. It would have virtually no impact on her use of the move and just push opponents to use superior counterplay more often (powershielding heyooo, though I do enjoy short hopping over it on reaction in the ditto sometimes).  Future ZSS changes are obviously well out of my hands and my wishlist is focused on other things anyway (tether grab, better tether mechanics, usmash that you can't ASDI out of with frame advantage for free, maybe slightly less jab1 knockback for better jab resets, maybe slightly better linking on fair), but if paralyzer got buffs I'd like to see it made into a more meaningful tool. Maybe something that enhances her vortex gameplay via meaningful option coverage in tech chases and the like, given that her dashdance game already covers a lot of what paralyzer would otherwise theoretically do in neutral. Maybe start with drastically reduced active frames and see what can be done to enhance it from there, not a whole lot of value in its current range anyway.  Also bitches didn't know bout that frame 11 pivot grab '-' I know what you mean though, would not complain at all if a restored tether grab had trimmed startup/endlag on standing and dash grab (and less pivot endlag, heh). She's got the mixups to make it work if she has to, but better frame data certainly wouldn't hurt."
SSBPM,3dx2dp,Narelex,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"The clank lasers are just unnatural to me and there are a lot of situations in 3.02 and prior where if I read or reacted to what my opponent was going to do, I could interrupt it. Clankable lasers just make lasers usable in less situations. If I know fox is going to jump in nair then lasering under a platform usually nets me advantage in neutral after fox gets hit and is forced to react defensively afterwards. If laser is clankable then he just nairs it and ZSS gets punished. Sure that would happen to every clankable projectile, but a majority of them are infinitely more useful in neutral in the first place. It's more of a preference based on setups and situations I grew accustomed to from 2.5-3.02 and it sucks that they were taken away in addition to dash cancel."

SSBPM,3dx2dp,Courteous_Correction,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that ivy should have at least 3 frames added to her reel-in time (2 frames is ridiculous), since she can literally steal the ledge out from under pretty much everyone with the right timing (wario seems impervious though lol). Really though, tethers are one of the most polarizing mechanics left in PM and they need to be adjusted imo."
SSBPM,3dx2dp,DarkLink1996,4,Tue Jul 21 05:26:24 2015 UTC,It's kind of a character specific thing you know. Upb tethers generally are too fast reeling in to the ledge and it is too easy to punish forced reel imo

Hell in every fighting game ever, the top tiers have stupid traits. That is what makes them good for the most part. I wouldn't mind if all melee characters had basically total revamps not because I think they are too good, but because I already play melee and I play PM to have a different experience than I already get from melee. I used to enjoy playing newer characters against melee characters, but that sort of loses its appeal when the characters are no longer new and the meta game is being developed"

SSBPM,3dx2dp,Azzucips,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:57 2015 UTC,Thoughts on sheik overall? Do you think that her throw changes were necessary? Did it change anything about her identity as a character mostly focused on getting grabs?  I have my own opinions but I'd like to hear yours first :)
SSBPM,3dx2dp,redbeanjelly,5,Mon Jul 20 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"Still really good. Sheik is still top tier in PAL which is what she is now basically. PAL sheik with a buffed upb and f smash lol. It probably isn't enough to make her like top tier but still extremely viable. As for her identity, it's probably still the same, it's just way harder to do what you want to do because of the throw changes. PAL Sheik has always had the same connotations as ntsc sheik from my understanding so there is always that."
SSBPM,3dx2dp,Omegaknight75,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. The reasoning is the competitive environment.  Consider for a second PAL's tier list. There was a LOT of Fox and Falco in that scene, who aren't getting comboed by Sheik's downthrow anyway, so that nerf didn't hurt her hugely, mostly just against Marth (who was nerfed too) and Peach.  In PM, there are a VERY large number of characters that can tech out of Sheik's downthrow when DIing properly, but could get caught by a well placed backthrow.  In 3.6, Sheik is a techchase bot until over 100% in her grab game against, well, most of the cast. It's a bummer, especially since so many other characters can do that and more with their throws (Sonic and Metaknight come to mind as characters that have similar downthrows, but other throws that can sometimes combo).  Sheik feels very neutered by the back throw change."
SSBPM,3dx2dp,SoulPech,6,Mon Jul 20 21:53:16 2015 UTC,She is definitely worse. My main point was that even in PAL when she had to tech chase everyone she was still extremely good. She definitely got nerfed very hard.
SSBPM,3dx2dp,SoulPech,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:29 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I'll ask you something sort of difficult to answer.   If somebody wants to get into game design and learn about balance and game feel, how should they approach fighting games as a whole? What are key things to look for when considering the balance of a mechanic? What are some questions to ask yourself that can create a better idea/philosophy of how a game should play?"
SSBPM,3dx2dp,SoulPech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not Oro but I can touch on this  One of the most important things when designing moves in a fighting game is ""feel"" How does it feel to use it? How does it feel to be hit by it? Is it intuitive to use and play against? If something feels great for the user but feels awful for the person fighting them them even if its balanced that's poor design.  (Sheik Bthrow or MK's Dimensional Cape Drift from 3.5 are good examples)  Design is very complex and difficult to explain concept in video games.  another important thing is character ""identity"" does this move make sense from what we know of the character? You try to have a ""theme"" or set of values you want to hit with your character from the get go. If you want to make a character that has good shield pressure and combo game but linear recovery and easy to combo. You end up with Wolf then you make his moves based off his themes and what we know of the character."

SSBPM,3dx2dp,InfinityCollision,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, Oro?!. What are some basic thoughts on ZSS as a character? Do you believe that's she's in need of some improvements or perhaps a new design to her functionality?"
SSBPM,3dx2dp,The_NZA,5,Mon Jul 20 06:54:13 2015 UTC,"I think if you look at just general character stats and not at moveset, she has the makings of a top tier for sure between movement, traction, and aerial drift etc. There is a fine line between move traits being bad, good, or op. A lot of what makes things consistent also generally makes things too good or easy. That being said, aside from the 3.5 design swing ZSS has taken, she had always been developed and buffed/nerfed rather slowly just to take time to make sure nothing was erroneous. That is the design style that Yeroc and I mostly went for, and believed that ZSS was in a relatively healthy place (middle of the pack, maybe upper mid) in a majority of our updates. I think that 3.6 fixed a lot of issues and in the next official patch I feel like ZSS will be a completed character and in a good place both to play as and against."
SSBPM,3dx2dp,sparklypiggy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:12:07 2015 UTC,"I particularly appreciate these kinds of mindsets. I feel like 3.5 Lucas was a knee jerk reaction to 3.02 Lucas's strength, for example. Small changes here and there, mostly to remove unfair advantages and moves with minimal counterplay (Old Mario and Roy's recovery, anyone?).  I strongly feel that now that we're at 3.6, every character's change from here on out should be VERY minor tweaks."

SSBPM,3dw72o,watermelon51015,18,Mon Jul 20 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"If such an overhaul were to be implemented, there would more than likely be a good number of textures where simply upping the saturation by 10-15% would not be sufficient. [Try drawing a gradient from a light color to a dark of the same color, then boost the saturation - in a good number of cases, odd strips of the gradient become brighter than the rest of the image.]    There's also the issue of some textures having shadows and highlights pre-baked on to them, meaning the slightly different shades of what should be the same color can potentially end up becoming two slightly yet noticeably different colors altogether.    Plus, as has already been noted on this thread, improper saturation of skin tones can end up looking unnaturally orange, so a subtle hue change would be required for each instance of a character's face or bare arms or what-have-you.    In other words, some actual effort would have to be put in to making sure that each texture brightens up properly. It would not be something that could be easily accomplished in one day. but when has the PMBR ever taken the lazy way out?"
SSBPM,3dw72o,Shredster7,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:40 2015 UTC,"Another issue is that stages would ALSO have to be saturated so the characters don't stick out like a sore thumb (Which is necessarily why I don't use the Smash 3/C textures, they look very odd compared to the Brawl stages.)"
SSBPM,3dw72o,Zero-Striker,15,Mon Jul 20 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"Oh god no.  As a former photographer hobbyist who delved heavily into image retouching, I would hope to god that if PM's color palette were to get a boost, that it would be done by an actual artist and not just someone tweaking with saturation Gimp for the first time.  Upping the saturation in colors has to be done at varying degrees with different hues to maintain a good aesthetic.  I'm not sure if there's a name for this, but some of my friends and I have noticed that as artists, if you sit in front of your work for a long time tweaking with colors and lighting, it's very easy to go overboard.  It's relatable to the ""frog in boiling water"" effect, in which a frog may jump out if dropped in boiling water immediately, but may stay in a pot of room temperature water getting hotter, even until it does reach the same boiling temperature.  I'd caution anyone encouraging others to boost PMs color to consider this, and how too much and ""unbalanced"" color boosting can stray from the visual feel that Brawl has established ( it's had to tweak one aspect of a whole package without it seeming out of place in hindsight)"
SSBPM,3dw72o,ECHOnce,2,Mon Jul 20 13:21:48 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, but do you agree that this game does, in fact, need more color?

Hopefully I didn't scare you away from your computer with my bad saturations..."
SSBPM,3dw72o,ECHOnce,11,Mon Jul 20 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a few quickies.  Nope, I'd love better color/lighting!  I just feel that it's important to stress the dangers of falling in love with an overdone image.  A lot of what you and others have described here as something they want isn't strictly improved by just boosting color, either.  PS2 is a great example of a stage that prob wouldn't benefit from color boosts as much, since there's so much negative space from similar hues and all.  What it really needs is some more contrast in shading between the background and the main stage.  BF on the other hand, does look great with just a nice color boost (+a bit of lighting giving focus to the stage again) because it has a variety of hues, and they're fairly balanced in the frame.  Temperature is important too; especially in a fighting game like PM, many stages could benefit from warmer colors influencing a more exciting atmosphere."

When boosting colors, you can't just saturate all hues universally.  Certain hues just don't look good anymore past a certain degree.  Balancing it with lightness/darkness can help, but you can still only push it so far.  I'll whip up some examples in a few min.  EDIT: to be clear, some of yours did look fine.  The saturation didn't come off as too strong in some, and the red filter complimented the color palettes well.  But as I and others have stressed, just boosting colors using the same method across everything doesn't work out conveniently."
SSBPM,3dw72o,UnintelGen,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply/critique. I understand you can only do so much with a blanket solution. My intent was largely to touch up the shadows and darker tones. I don't know if it was an engine limitation or design decision, but everything in Brawl just fades values for shadowing and it looks really dirty. I emphasized the red because that's what I felt brought out those missing flesh tones in the characters best. It makes the character portraits really 'pop'. Especially characters like Mario or Snake. I just wanted to get rid of that sickly green/grey look the game largely had thanks to being a Wii title. Unfortunately, some greys (Like Hyrule Castle HD) can become pinkish. I feel it's better overall though. Also, as an added benefit, the bloom really makes Bowser's Castle come to life. It really feels like the lava is emitting light and the texture modulates so the bloom is constantly varying intensity."
SSBPM,3dw72o,ECHOnce,2,Mon Jul 20 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"Np!  I'll agree with the intention for sure; I just went about making some of my own, and I agree that adding some more warmth helps a multitude of issues.  As you pointed out, it helps some skin tones, and influences the atmosphere of the game.  This was definitely very noticeable on Bowser's Castle, but while I liked it personally, doing so to such an extent that it adds another aspect to the stage that isn't in the vanilla PM version - the strong red bloom that may be seen in other videogame volcano levels and all - will leave you prone to meeting some opposition.  It's just safer to keep to aspects from whatever base you're working with, and enhance its features a bit without letting one overpower the others.  Remember that when you're editing, since you're exposing yourself to such drastic potential differences, you're liable to wanting more and more in the end product.  But anyone else who sees your work may be more than satisfied/impressed by a toned down version.  Might help to sometimes take a break, come back in an hour or two, compare the original, your edit, and a 50% transparent overlap of the edit on top of the original (...RIP grammar, 8am and I haven't slept lmao), just to get a bearing on how much toning down is needed, if any."
SSBPM,3dw72o,Repiteo,55,Mon Jul 20 15:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'd be all for a universal color boost in P:M. The dull look of Brawl, while appealing at the time, would definitely benefit from an overhaul.  That said, I think they only need to alter the textures that they already have, and not necessarily completely replace the textures like the Smash 3 Project does, as I rather like the detailed looks of the Brawl models. I would adore seeing that detailed style in conjunction with a more vibrant palette."
SSBPM,3dw72o,GeneralKnuckles,12,Mon Jul 20 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"I will say the same I said with the recent Melee Remastered 2.0 Trailer: you can't just edit the characters' textures.  You would need to edit all textures from all stages, items and NPCs to bring an uniform, coherent art style.  That's too much work for the PMDT."
SSBPM,3dw72o,Super_Bad_64,3,Mon Jul 20 09:34:13 2015 UTC,I'm sure there is a way to increase color saturation via gct codes.
SSBPM,3dw72o,My_name_is_Jaime,15,Mon Jul 20 10:14:45 2015 UTC,This would create an awful filtered visual style.
SSBPM,3dw72o,LlamaYamaMommaObama,32,Mon Jul 20 13:52:22 2015 UTC,"Your edits aren't bad, and I'm probably in the minority here - but I personally hate the Sm4sh look, and love the muted/drowned out colors of Brawl."
SSBPM,3dw72o,IgnoreMyName,34,Mon Jul 20 01:31:41 2015 UTC,"I think the thing with Sm4sh is too may colors, not necessarily that it's colorful. The trail from being smashed looks weird imo. I would like brighter colors but not too much color if that makes sense."
SSBPM,3dw72o,Penultimate_Sneeze,9,Mon Jul 20 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we should start an anti-smash4 movement that reduces P:M to browns and grays, with minimal kill effects and muffled sounds..."

As others have pointed out overhauling the color scheme properly just isn't as simple as applying a one-size-fits-all filter to all the textures. I just can't imagine that it will ever be a high priority for the P:M team. I'm not even sure that it should ever be a higher priority than textures for new stages, characters, and character costumes."
SSBPM,3dw72o,_flash__,5,Mon Jul 20 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Smash 4 is this big blend of blurs and colors and animations, and brawl seems more crisp and watchable and playable - i'd really dislike these changes"

SSBPM,3dw72o,Sheecacaa3,8,Mon Jul 20 03:18:35 2015 UTC,"It's funny how when you're editing color saturation and stuff, everything looks normal at first. When you boost the saturation, you think to yourself ""oh, okay that looks a bit better.""  Then you look at the image before you boosted the saturation and you think to yourself ""Wow, these look monochrome or something.""  I had the same reaction to your edits.  Honestly, I would really appreciate more color in the game. The ""gritty"" art style is really showing it's age, and a little more color would freshen things up without getting rid of the hyper-detailed textures in Brawl."
SSBPM,3dw72o,OpulentUX,8,Mon Jul 20 06:25:11 2015 UTC,"Your edits look waaaay too over saturated, but I totally agree with the sentiment lol. I would love to see a boost in color and playfulness in PM, but it's not as easy as just raising the saturation unfortunately."

SSBPM,3dw72o,Smashbro29,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I've made very saturated/colorful texture hacks, which are comparable to the saturation and color of Melee textures (and have even tried AlGeorgeRomo's Melee Remastered textures). But for some reason, they look WAY too bright/colorful on TVs I've used. Yet, Melee doesn't. I use a GCN with official component cables for Melee and a Wii with official Wii component cables for Brawl/PM, so maybe it's just something to do with the Wii's video processor, or perhaps any filters Brawl may have to de-crapify the textures.  The point I've been trying to get to with all this rambling is that maybe not make textures as saturated as much as you'd think. See how good it looks on your computer screen, and dial the saturation/color back a bit."
SSBPM,3dw72o,Batman_the_Dino,4,Mon Jul 20 06:52:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with the overall idea, but those edits look a bit over saturated.

SSBPM,3dw72o,PeachyCoke,4,Mon Jul 20 08:56:56 2015 UTC,Yes but it would need to be consistent across the entire game and I don't know if they'd wanna do that.

I am in full support of a complete recoloring of PM to make it more vibrant. The new graphics added in 3.6 have improved the game already, and I really want to see the game recolored to complement these changes.  I don't think this would take as long as it might seem. There are probably filters in Photoshop that can liven up the picture and improve color saturation. All the PMDT would need to do is open up each character's/stage's items up in Photoshop or GIMP or whatever and apply these filters to all of the pics together. Of course, I could be wrong and this could be much more complicated than I am making it sound. Would love some PMDT imput on this."
SSBPM,3dw72o,1338h4x,8,Mon Jul 20 02:25:03 2015 UTC,"""Filters"" wouldn't be good enough. Changing the brightness and hue colors will alter some of the details in the textures. We would likely need to re-paint them to fit with the theme, and stay high quality.  Also, good like finding an SD card that can work with a wii and hold more than 8 GB... we can't replace every texture, stage, character, etc in the game without re-writing the ISOs on the disk.."
SSBPM,3dw72o,Nevergreen-,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why would it take up so much space?   If Brawl was smaller than 8GB as a whole and most of that was the full-motion video, with a fair amount of the rest  being textures/models for stickers and trophies that I assume people wouldn't mind seeing unaltered, wouldn't altering the remaining stages (since most stages in PM already have at least some of their own textures, i.e. Pokemon Stadium 2 and Final Destination) and character costumes not already modified not take up that much more space than what is currently downloaded?"

One of the biggest mistakes I see people make (and consequently, the thing I have to correct most often) is when they crank up the saturation so much your eyes start bleeding. You can't just take an image, get rid of all the subtle tones, and expect it to be better. (And don't get me started on contrast... you're NOT improving the image by removing information!)  Now, if you want to change the style of Project M, then be my guestâ€”just know that it requires a re-design from the ground up.

SSBPM,3dw72o,kraatu,4,Mon Jul 20 08:16:18 2015 UTC,"Heh, I was thinking about this exact thing but never bothered to post. It was going to be a sorta ""guide"" for making Dolphin/Project M look better. I don't think the Project M Dev Team is going to go through textures and saturate or paint them individually. Partly because ripping them out and putting them back in will undoubtedly cause information loss via compression. And because it would take waaaay too long.   Anyway one of the things I use is ReShade to do my grunt work, and it works really well. Lots of subtle touches and largely accomplishes the same thing and more as what the OP asked. I've modified the color, added a saturated bloom effect and a few other bells and whistles. Pictures are better than words, so here's a couple albums showing the differences.  First picture is ReShade, second is the original from Dolphin:  http://imgur.com/a/GhDt6#0  http://imgur.com/a/734wk#0  http://imgur.com/a/bZkVy#0  I know people think of bloom as unnecessary, but really ties the image together (Well, mostly. Post Processing is kinda hit and miss) and makes things look coherent. And it's not intense enough that it will blind or impede players. As for the saturation, I mostly just upped the red and blues and largely left out the green. Dunno why, but I feel it works.  If only Dolphin had access to Brawl's depth buffer. You could do even crazier effects, like tilt shift and ambient occlusion."

SSBPM,3dw72o,Stitchfaces,3,Mon Jul 20 14:52:45 2015 UTC,"You remember how Earthbound starts with that fade from morning?  Serious answer (Assuming you are talking about the Onett shot) is that the blue sky is intense enough to coat the screen in bloom and Ness' taunt is still fading from the picture taking flash. Honestly, kinda gives a nostalgic-like look.   Or a really bad Instagram filter.  Edit: If you are talking about the menus in general, it's largely because I focused on tinting the game to skew more to to purple/deep blue, the coloring of Project M 3.5 (Well, the splash screen anyway) It's just a side effect of the post processing not considering the menu or neutral colors (Like the brick layer in Hyrule Castle HD)"

SSBPM,3dxh68,SchofieldSilver,7,Mon Jul 20 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"in melee if you're hit whilst you're grabbed you go through a 20 frame long stun animation (usually because you're being pummeled), and you can't escape during this animation. Wobbling works because the ICs can alternate hitting you, constantly forcing you to restart this stun animation indefinitely, effectively ignoring the normal timer that forces a grab release. My understandint is that in PM they made it so this animation either a) doesn't occur, or b) doesn't ignore the grab timer, making it moot.  I'm pretty sure it's b, tho."
SSBPM,3dxh68,NICKisICE,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"This also mattered in doubles, where coordinated partners could essentially wobble you when grabbed in a 2v1 situation."

(Based on what /u/fangdude said, I don't actually know stuff about Melee) In Melee if they are in hitstun while they are grabbed, they can't mash out, in PM they can.

SSBPM,3dwaqp,smashA-thro-away7777,2,Mon Jul 20 07:21:51 2015 UTC,"more rant: And he is always making into top 8 without ever sleeping before tournaments. He won't tell me his real name. His version of trash talk is pretending every character is midtier and that smash brothers isn't a real game because mice and keyboard isn't allowed at tornaments. He also has really stupid names for mundane combos.  In bracket all he tried to do was hit me with ""the turock evolution"" and the ""honey dew choo choo"". He is honestly the most BM player I've ever run into. He never tries or takes it seriously and he lets you know by being purposefully awkward and bored."
SSBPM,3dwaqp,smashA-thro-away7777,3,Mon Jul 20 07:33:04 2015 UTC,"I made an account to tell my chaloopey story  at meteora in bracket against me, he practised ""walk dancing"" instead of edgeguarding me. Every time he hit me off stage he would run to the opposit side and walk back and forth and just let me recover. I thought he mighta been stupid or something because he said it was gannondorf specific tech (gannon bann me, idc). I barely lost and I though he was bad.   I got discouraged becuz I lost to a guy named ggspicy and atomsk in friendlys inbetween sets. No big deal since I am kinda new but it still sucked. Then, chaloopey a kid I though was a baddie, comes over and bops his friend atomsk and styles on ggspicy like he was a bot.  I ca't beleive he's 33 tho. btw, he was super nice to me, he just treated me liek the scrub I am in bracket :["
SSBPM,3dwaqp,__Apok,3,Mon Jul 20 08:27:24 2015 UTC,That does not sound nice.
SSBPM,3dwaqp,smashA-thro-away7777,2,Mon Jul 20 10:28:07 2015 UTC,That's actually hilarious.
SSBPM,3dwaqp,SchofieldSilver,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:50 2015 UTC,Chaloopy shot my dog. Such BM.
SSBPM,3dwaqp,Repiteo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:51 2015 UTC,"Also, he constantly talks about how he's better than Metriod but whenever they are in tourney he tells the guy he doesn't want to ""play a scrub who plays a bad character"". Chaloopy is an overall douche. Don't even get me started on moonshoez. He'll ask you to buy him a pack of cigarettes with the promise of paying you back, then when you give them to him he just smokes them all in one sitting while constantly blowing the smoke in your face. Once at a venue he brought (and drank) and entire fifth of Jim bean. We can't control him, no one does. ""I know doogy sammich"" ""I've beaten moon"" shut up moonshoez. Do you think you are good??"
SSBPM,3dwaqp,I-am-Trash,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:36 2015 UTC,honey dew choo choo   I'm already a big fan of this guy
SSBPM,3dwaqp,Nomlin,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"Chaloopy is a freaking douche, he straight up challenged me to a duel by literally slapping my face with a glove, a fingerless one mind you, and then forced me to play a Falcon ditto where all he did was falcon kick me upstage into uptilt infinites. I got so freaking mad and I kind of started crying. Meanwhile his crqptalking  friend moonshoe or whatever his dumb tag is called me a ""fajet"""
SSBPM,3dwaqp,tzarNIKOLAS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:21:36 2015 UTC,I'm going to start a m00nshoes hate group. I'll add you on FB if you want to join. That kid needs to fuck off and die. I thught chaloopie and his fuckwit possie were bad enough before he joined forces with that ugly prick from the asshole of the midwest. Niether of them have tech skills and are one trick ponies. m00nshoes ruined both house og paignes I went to for me. The dude is just a mango copycat without the style.
SSBPM,3dwaqp,moonshoeshategroup,3,Tue Jul 21 08:32:38 2015 UTC,I forgot to mention that they stand right next to the doors that say stand 50 feet away when smoking and smoke 20 packs a night. Chaloopie and m00nshoes just stand out there and talk shit all night to other smasher. Fuckng trolls.
SSBPM,3dwaqp,moonshoeshategroup,2,Tue Jul 21 09:19:34 2015 UTC,"Chaloopy charged me $5 to play him in friendlies and sign a contract saying I would do his laundry for a month if I lost. I agreed to do this without knowing he lives 3 hours away.  During the friendlies he made me play Luigi against his falcon on yoshis story and all he did was di trap me. Chaloopy also made me refer to him as ""coach"" or else he would not respond.  I will be visiting coach chaloopy this coming weekend so he can cure my emo nature that has been negatively affecting my gamplay"

SSBPM,3dwaqp,Ripple884,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:42:34 2015 UTC,I once watched moonshoes do an interview with these guys and he just screamed im the fucking best ever. He was smoking the whole time and then shotgunned 3 beers in the interview. He doesnt take anygame srs and told me my mom is big and busy and played an airhorn on his phone
SSBPM,3dwaqp,Fuckmoonshoez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"I made a new account so that I could tell my Chaloopy story without losing credibility in the ssbpm subreddit or seem overly petty. So here it goes.  When I played Chaloopy at a tournament in Illinois, all he did was act really tired and he didn't seem like he wanted to be there. This came through in his play as well. He just constantly baited me into getting thrown off the stage and then he would pull out some new cheesy ledgeguard I had never seen before for each of my stocks. He played like I was a scrub and I fell into his traps. I never reached 100% and I got 4 stocked. I fucking hate him. I fucking hated myself for losing to him. Everybody seemed to dislike him at the venue, or they didn't care who he was. Even the people that know him outside of smash get salty when they lose to him and cheer against him. Including his brother."

I even heard them talking about how they don't really like me, but they let me come to the venue because I sometimes bring pizza. They don't even call me by my name or tag, just ""pizza boy""."
