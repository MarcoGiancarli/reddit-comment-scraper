EvolveGame,3e4vl5,Danielsaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:46:57 2015 UTC,Good stuff. I always like to see full armor and all stages in these skin videos.
EvolveGame,3e2i0a,racoon9,4,Tue Jul 21 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"They each have their own color, I thought? Anyway, when I see the player selections before the match, I make a mental note of who I'm focusing first. Like, if I see Hank, I know I usually gotta go for him. Or maybe it's Laz, whatever. At that point, just note the name."
EvolveGame,3e2i0a,helsquiades,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time telling blue and yellow apart from green in this game. I can tell medic and support apart, but at quick glances they all look like trappers except assault. And sometimes I use my phone between games and don't get to see the loading screen characters."
EvolveGame,3e2i0a,Terra277,3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:02 2015 UTC,I would love to hear why they made Support Orange and Trapper Yellow. Might as well be the same color in the heat of battle.
EvolveGame,3e2i0a,ElementalFiend,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, this.  Worst case of muted colors ever.  I get that green on black is hard to read, but I still can't distinguish these two half the time."
EvolveGame,3e2i0a,LocoPojo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Trapper and Support are same color for me, so I really need to look at their silhouettes to tell which is which.  So sad, hope they get color blind mode in the next update. We were really talking about it last the last two updates."

It was made in a couple of weeks so don’t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with monsters. In fact, you’re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if you’d spend your $160 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life hunting hobby"""

EvolveGame,3dxssj,Semajjamess,9,Mon Jul 20 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"Slim is MEDIUM range., unlike the other medics, who are all long distance.  Fire with the leech gun a lot and constantly pressing heal.  Be inside the spore cloud (not jetpacking), but not too close that the Monster can hit you with a melee.  In 10 seconds, you should have been able to be hitting the monster with the leech gun a lot and have healed 3 times.    Then you shoot another spore cloud.  The whole point is that if the monster goes left/right/back/etc, he's still inside a spore cloud.    As another poster said, throw out the little healing fly instead of going to revive someone.  Stay within the spore cloud, but at the edge of it."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,Jimm120,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:35 2015 UTC,"Just to add: I think Slim's bug is more important than people realize. If you're on a team with Slim and you're hurt, back off so he can bug you. The monster can only focus one person, whoever isn't being focused can be healed without effort. As soon as someone takes damage in a dome, I throw the bug at them and shoot a spore cloud. A lot of the time they are able to juke and regain full health rather than me having to try to play catch up with the leech gun."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,helsquiades,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:50 2015 UTC,TIL Caira is long range
EvolveGame,3dxssj,tdude1994,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:58 2015 UTC,What if the person whos down is being focused do i just give him up?
EvolveGame,3dxssj,Dontreadmynameunidan,3,Mon Jul 20 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"Just keep punishing the monster for camping the body. The more damage you put out, the more you can heal burst, the longer your teammate will stay alive"
EvolveGame,3dxssj,kexecuter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:25 2015 UTC,The spore cloud doesn't hide people inside it. If the monster is inside the spore cloud then it's smell just doesn't work regardless of whether or not people are inside it.
EvolveGame,3dxssj,Mechwarriorr5,5,Tue Jul 21 03:57:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've found the jump height perk + spore clouds between every (EVERY) full clip of leech gun to be the best. You should basically never be watching a reload animation for the leech gun, as the passive reload should finish up right as you put your spore gun away.   If you've got jump height and Behe focuses you, leap straight up and jet pack dash over him. If you've been playing correctly, he will be in a spore cloud and the majority of the time he will not have the vertical orientation to track you as you go over him, and then won't be able to pick you back up after turning around. And on a target as big as him, you can fire off nearly half of your leech gun's mag as you go over him and net another heal burst (only do it if you're confident he's lost focus though, otherwise he'll spot you right away again).   If he still tries to focus you, use the spore clouds and your jump height to find a new perch without giving yourself away with jetpack trails, and then start firing away when he's looking at someone else."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,_Despereaux,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:23 2015 UTC,"To add onto this you never need to look at the recharge for the heal pulse because the circle that acts as your crosshairs for the leech gun is your recharge for the heal, when it's green mash the heal button.  I've found that if you plan to play a more agile slim, go jump height. Otherwise go magazine size. You can get 2-3 heals off per reload depending on how many leech pellets land.  As far as spore gun goes use that whenever you need to reload, just switch to the spore cloud and by the time you go back to leech gun it will be ready, no need to waste time reloading.  I love the bug. Whenever a teammate goes down I throw a bug on him and keep him at edge of my heal range to burst heal him so if monster is focusing him I can keep him up a bit. Also throw bug on teammates in between fights to top them off. I see few people do this and it drives me nuts. The bug doesn't require line of sight and has infinite range, take advantage of that."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,Smashmonki,5,Mon Jul 20 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"You really need to keep your distance with Slim and be a good shot. If you can be consistently hitting the monster with your gun, you can be firing your healing burst almost constantly. If someone goes down, don't go over to them to revive, fire your healing bug over and it'll revive them for you. It'll go through walls and everything, so you just need to fire in their general direction."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,bibaman,6,Mon Jul 20 12:43:28 2015 UTC,Oh Ithought with slim you stay up in the monsters face with spore cloud to heal your team and constant damage.
EvolveGame,3dxssj,bibaman,4,Mon Jul 20 13:01:02 2015 UTC,"Possibly? I've always personally had god results trying to keep well out of reach. The spore cloud radius is pretty large. I often roll with the quick switch perk so I can be quickling switching from the spore cloud to the leech gun. Always have a spore cloud, always be leeching."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,pitmissile,3,Mon Jul 20 13:38:24 2015 UTC,"If the monster is focusing you, don't be all up in his grill, especially behemoth. Besides, none of your team needs healing when you're the one keeping his attention. When he goes for a teammate, that's when I try to get in close and get plenty of heal bursts off. When you're shooting at his back, you'll be firing off bursts constantly. He's kinda like Lennox in that regard. Another thing to remember too is that when you use the spore launcher the monster can't see health bars. IMO, that's more important the the dulled vision, because it can help you control who the monster is focusing."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,helsquiades,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"Stay out of his face. Use the bug as much as possible and keep him in the cloud. You don't really want to be face-tanking with the POSSIBLE exception of when you have Hank on your team. Even then, I'd rather be hanging back and keeping the monster ""blind""."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,Liquidignition,3,Mon Jul 20 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Slims is a combat medic. Try and position yourself in the centre of all the hunters at all times if possible.  Be up in his grill and spam the leech gun, when reloading switch to spore. Rinse & repeat. Also. Use the bug often as well. I see too many slim players that never once use the bug in a dome. The monster is at least once going to change target. Use that opportunity to send a bug to a  low health teammate. TDLR: slim is a spammy medic. Use all of his abilities."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,Izawwlgood,2,Mon Jul 20 14:02:21 2015 UTC,Can someone explain the utility of the spore cloud? I thought all it did was prevent the monster from smelling? That doesn't seem that useful if you're currently fighting the monster.
EvolveGame,3dxssj,PleaseNone,3,Mon Jul 20 17:00:24 2015 UTC,With the game being as a dark as it is most of the time and the hunters being so relatively small it actually makes a huge difference when fighting when there is no outline for which to help you see them when fighting so it's easy to lose track of them.
EvolveGame,3dxssj,helsquiades,3,Mon Jul 20 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"Have you played monster again Slim? It's quite annoying to a lot of monsters. You can't see the outlines that make them obvious. You can barely tell who is who making it hard to focus a target. You can't see health bars so it's hard to tell even who TO focus. If you're tracking, the monster can't tell how far you guys are or what direction you're coming from as easily."
EvolveGame,3dxssj,Recon_by_Fire,3,Mon Jul 20 18:49:08 2015 UTC,I've been playing since launch and just started playing monster recently.  Last night I was grinding out Goliath mastery in solo and it was the games with Slim and his cloud that gave me the most trouble.
EvolveGame,3dxssj,DoctorSugarbear,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:47 2015 UTC,"Change your heal burst to mouse2 or mouse3 for slim. Mashing 4 is doable but its easier to shoot and heal if you rebind it.  A lot of people like quick reload on slim but I go quick switch. It's much easier to keep a cloud or two up which is a huge help.  Aside from that, shoot and heal. Don't get too close, heal burst has deceptively large range since the buff."

EvolveGame,3e0yxb,tdude1994,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"Most people who play are max (40). As i climed I got matched with higher levels. At lvls 1-10 I got matched accordingly. When I was levels 11-20 I got matched with people up to 25, sometimes 30. When I hit level 25 I got matched with 30-35s. Once I hit 30 I was being matched with high 30s and maxed people, which also amped the challenge by a LOT. It was CRAZY how the balance of the game shifted at level 40"

As mikey said the patch made the MM worse, and it wasn't in very good shape before. If you sit in the que for more than 5 min or so it's probably forgot what it was supposed to be doing. Finding partial games, people quitting, disconnects, all are going to test your patience. People will recommend friending others and make your own matches, but I like to fight random unknown people. It's good fun though once you get in a full game, keep trying."

TRS was trying to apply some patch fixes to it to improve Matchmaking, but as with patching for most games, when you fix one bug you often cause another. Sadly, they did not see this one coming because testing the Xbox Matchmaking system is pretty hard to do from TRS' side, and they have not previously worked on the system that XB1 uses for Matchmaking so they are pretty much learning how to use it on the fly and trying to make it work. An update and bug fix for Matchmaking should  be coming with the next fix to consoles."
