GearsOfWar,3e5oza,Jackie_654,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:22:25 2015 UTC,But why can't they just have 1 pre-order bonus world wide and have the others unlocked through game progress?

GearsOfWar,3dyh75,NordicDong,6,Mon Jul 20 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"This is why I will always love the original Gears more than anything, shit's always intense."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,psych7111,0,Mon Jul 20 18:37:54 2015 UTC,I dunno. Getting a 5+ kill clutch on a TDM match is pretty intense. Also outstandingly more difficult.
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,kpyle,3,Mon Jul 20 19:43:23 2015 UTC,"I literally went bat shit crazy when I had to clutch a 1v5 TDM on Old Town, best day of my life.   ps, used the boomshot towards the end, but come on 5 guys on 1, I had to play it smart."

GearsOfWar,3dyh75,kpyle,4,Mon Jul 20 22:24:33 2015 UTC,"TDM just doesn't work for Gears. There, I said it."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,Hubbleshubbles,5,Mon Jul 20 21:55:02 2015 UTC,"Execution is boring af. There, I said it.  I want ordered chaos and the ability to take risks without completely fucking my team over. I want the game plan to change as the round goes. Its not, well that didn't work, we lose. Or vice versa."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,kpyle,5,Mon Jul 20 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"TDM works better in gears 3 simply because life is alot cheaper. Gow 3 is much more of an arcade shooter, I much prefer execution in the earlier games though, with a messy annex game thrown in here and there."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,ozkah,2,Tue Jul 21 01:33:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that doesn't really match the squad style battles that GOW1 had, only having one life per round made it so you had to think before acting and if you worked as a team success was almost guaranteed the way the game is meant to be played."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,DersTheChamp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that doesn't really match the squad style battles that GOW1 had   It is a different style of teamwork, but you still need teamwork.   only having one life per round made it so you had to think before acting   You still have to think in 3, just more on the fly if you want to run around. Knowing how many they are down, glancing at flank routes, and knowing when they will spawn etc. It takes lots of awareness. One life is less forgiving. Sometimes it takes risks to win. Risks you wouldn't take with one life. You lose position? Take it back next life.   if you worked as a team success was almost guaranteed the way the game is meant to be played.   Exactly like 3. If you working together perfect the only way you lose is if the other team is way better than you."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,kpyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:57 2015 UTC,And all of that is fine for GOW3 play style but in GOW1 that was clearly not the case I guess mostly what I'm trying to say is that the gameplay evolved to that it is not how GOW1 was meant to be played besides in annex.
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,DersTheChamp,2,Tue Jul 21 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"No you're right. Play style is completely different. It comes down to preference. I use to love execution. After seeing how tdm works I can't go back. I don't want to stand around. I want call outs and craziness. I want to cross while my teammate gets a double. I want a cross while I get one. Those things might happen in execution, but they happen way more in TDM. Its execution on crack."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,kpyle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"I guess I should say since it's less predictable, crazy shit happens more often and is more intense. I find myself saying, ""Holy shit did you see that!?"" in Gears 1 more than in 2 or 3."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,psych7111,5,Mon Jul 20 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"Well 2 is beyond slow. In 3 crazy shit happening is the way it works, so it seems less crazy, relatively speaking. I mean shit, there is a point in every game where I get a kill doing ridiculous shit. Strafe, bounce, fake strafe, wall stick, headshot. Someone does that in 1 and I'm turning my shit off."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,kpyle,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"Man I suck at Gears 1. I play really well and almost always come top of scoreboard on gears 3, but as soon as I played Gears 1 I felt like a complete noob, people kept calling me 'trash'. Funnily no other insult, just trash lol. Its a completely different game, could someone please give a quick explanation as to how to kill someone on it? Like, when ive downed someone, and then repeatedly shoot them up close, nothing happens, do you have to execute? Also am I the only one that finds the bullets are fired at a delay from once I press the right trigger (360)"

GearsOfWar,3dyh75,DubstepGirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"All I can suggest is to keep playing, consistency really is the best to just get used to moving and stuff. do you blind fire a lot? I find that actually aiming with the shotty, and drag shotting with the aim (aiming in and following my target wherever he rolls, strafes side to side). But yeah, you'll get a lot better the more you play, bounce a lot on walls even if your alone with no enemies, just get used to moving fast and being accurate with aiming when  you do so. Also, I find the more I play the more i'll get used to knowing exactly what to do in the situation i'm in to kill the guy (which cover to use to make my self untouchable whilst they are out exposed in open etc.  Also don't be afraid to spray people down with the lancer lol.  Also  look forward to gears 4! It looks more like Gears 1 play, so you should have an advantage over all us Gears 3 players lol, if you master gears 3 as well as 1, then you'll be lethal on gears 4!"
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,gaaainz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:04:17 2015 UTC,"Oh and melee in close up shotgun battles are good to I think, slows the guy down and the speed of the situation, allows you to just pick a nice shot on him when hes stunned. Also plant smokes on walls discreetly so when an enemy walks by and thy're stunned, you can just practice aiming on them lol."
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,gaaainz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:01 2015 UTC,Sensitivity all the way up or youll be strafed/bounced on all day. The only to stop it is with quick aiming

GearsOfWar,3dyh75,deathday,0,Mon Jul 20 19:45:47 2015 UTC,So you can self revive in Gears 1? In the beta there was a stretch where you needed a teammate which always meant you'd just bleed out. Then there was a really long self revive time; don't remember it ever happening that fast.
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,TerrrorTwlight,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:30 2015 UTC,Execution had 10 secs as default then you self revived. Warzone needed someone to revive you otherwise after the 10 secs you bled out. I hope that clears that up.
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,deathday,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"You could always self revive in Execution. Warzone you can't. I forget what it was in the beta but it did feel a bit long, probably just because 99.99% of every match I played in GoW1 had a 5 second bleed out.   I don't know, maybe it was 5 seconds and it was just all in my head, who can tell?"
GearsOfWar,3dyh75,tsaebedliW,0,Tue Jul 21 04:36:02 2015 UTC,From what I read they were experimenting with a lot of different settings during the beta. Like early on there were no active reloads (no bonus damage) and I know for a fact they had 15 second bleed outs at the very beginning when the only map was Gridlock. One time I got sniped down from across the map and had to just sit there bleeding out like a jabroni. 5 seconds is much more reasonable; I hope they stick with that. I was just asking about the original Gears because I never played it online. Didn't get into multiplayer until Gears 2.
GearsOfWar,3e124g,Thesalvianaffliction,7,Tue Jul 21 03:25:50 2015 UTC,"Last I heard Gears 3 was more active. Gears 3 has about 5k-7k on at once. Not too sure about judgement though, sorry. I'd guess that you still might be able to get into games."

GearsOfWar,3du7vg,decoys_lois_decoys,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:26 2015 UTC,Yeah well. That'll happen. Where we go from here is the question we should be asking.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,PM_ME_STORY_IDEAS,5,Mon Jul 20 03:22:07 2015 UTC,It includes weapon/character skins exclusive to that edition of the game.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,Mitchfarino,10,Sun Jul 19 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"What a load of shit, just give everyone the same skins"
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,sirmonkey95,11,Sun Jul 19 20:18:09 2015 UTC,They are just skins. So if someone wants to spend $10-50 more for it than they are welcome to do so. If it were special maps then I would agree with you. Also it seems as if TC and 343 are going down the path of not splitting up the community of people with DLC maps and people who don't have the DLC.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,LandownAE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:38 2015 UTC,What are the weapon/character skins? Is it some version that's exclusive to a specific store? Or can you preorder it anywhere?
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,PM_ME_STORY_IDEAS,2,Sun Jul 19 16:12:53 2015 UTC,There hasn't been any direct confirmation about it by The Coalition.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,Chickern,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:05 2015 UTC,Deluxe weapon skin and Aaron Griffin. http://cdon.no/spill/downloads/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-deluxe-version-pre-purchase-34359092

GearsOfWar,3du7vg,wtbrian,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer I guess, that would suck if it was single player needed gold, but I highly doubt it. It wouldn't make sense to do that."

GearsOfWar,3du7vg,Conscious_Exaltation,5,Sun Jul 19 19:51:11 2015 UTC,They can just do backwards compatibility for that
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,Curtdjs15,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:25:52 2015 UTC,Not on PC.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,deathday,5,Sun Jul 19 23:12:17 2015 UTC,You cant get everything you want lol
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,KooolKay,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:42:39 2015 UTC,I heard that Microsoft would be asking for publisher permission for each game they add to the backwards compatibility list. Publishers are legendary assholes and money grubbers so I really don't see Gears 2/3 coming to xbone anytime soon unless they do more of these ultimate editions.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,deathday,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:33 2015 UTC,Micoroft published all the Gears games. They don't need to ask themselves.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,KooolKay,0,Tue Jul 21 14:40:34 2015 UTC,"Okay good point. BUT I still don't expect to see them on the backwards compatibility list any time soon. I would think they'd test the waters for possible remasters first. Like, see how the sales of Ultimate Edition go before bringing 2 & 3 over to the xbone.   For me, the ideal situation would be to make an ultimate edition of Gears 2 just like they're doing with 1 and give it dedicated servers. I loved Gears 2 multiplayer but it needs servers so badly. Then just bring 3 over via backward compatibility because I don't think it needs much of a remaster and it already has servers."
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,deathday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:38 2015 UTC,Gears of War 3 hasn't had servers for a few years (I could look up the date but lazy) Gears 2 had major issues as a game. The mechanics didn't work. Server would fix some but not all of these issues.  Testing the waters for remasters isn't a bad idea but I would be a bit disappointed if they did that as I would have rather seen a master cheif like collection if they we're going to do all three games.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,KooolKay,0,Tue Jul 21 16:11:09 2015 UTC,Everybody says that about Gears 3 but I swear that's only if you don't have all the DLC. I have all the DLC and it still plays like a dream to me. Whereas Gears 2 is a lagfest unless you get host. Then it's a lagfest for everybody else. I've only played a few matches of Gears 1 multiplayer and they were just as laggy as Gears 2 while the beta played perfectly for me just like Gears 3. So it seems to me that dedicated servers is mostly responsible.... but I suppose it could be to do with netcode.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,deathday,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:04 2015 UTC,The netcode in Gears 3 is by far the best (not counting UE which will probably be better.) But the Gears of War 3 servers were shut down on December 31st 2012. All P2P now.
GearsOfWar,3du7vg,KooolKay,0,Tue Jul 21 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm, googled it and you're right. I'm surprised because I played Gears 3 well after that point and didn't notice a huge difference. Well let's hope every Gears game from this point is as smooth online."

Banned people can still access the marketplace for DLC from the main menu and all that. I have absolutely zero online functionality. Like, my profile has signed out of Live completely. Like, I can't even bring up my friends list or party chat or recent players or any online functions at all.

GearsOfWar,3doe0q,HelloImHorse,2,Sat Jul 18 12:39:05 2015 UTC,Same here! Forget what movie it was but first time I saw the trailer was before the movie trailers / previews. Gears is the reason I bought a 360.

GearsOfWar,3dmd41,Joe3po,2,Fri Jul 17 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"The anti-preorder movement is a reddit thing for the most part. And the anti-preorder movement is a very, very miniscule amount of people in the entire population of gamers.  There's no solid evidence that preordering is ruining games. However, it is true that if preorders are low, publishers might push back the release date to allow for more development time. Which is a good thing, but there's always a point in most projects where the game has to be put on the market. The companies lose money until the game is up for sale.  Another point, it's not supposed to be on a consumer if the product doesn't work day one or not. Yeah it's a technology and they (the corporations) are protected by ""buyer beware"" clauses, but it's the entertainment business. If you can't entertain the audience, won't get money for your ""next show.""  But going around telling people not to preorder is dumb. No reason. It's their hard-earned money, let them spend it as they please. It's good advice to give someone when looking into a game, but if they know the risks it's fine."

GearsOfWar,3dgda7,ButterThyToast,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"How did you go about such? When I checked Xbox.com, it said that the gold exclusive price is free, but I have no way of getting the game  without going through the $19.99 purchase process. I'm logged in, and I have an Xbox one with gold as well. I also wanted to have the game linked to my account."
GearsOfWar,3dgda7,OGxGroosalugg,2,Thu Jul 16 16:01:03 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it can be a bit finniky when it comes to pushing it out for everyone. If it is still not coming up as Free for you, just wait a day or two and try again then.  Another fix, is if you are having problems getting a GWG title on one system (example, your X1), try grabbing it through the website, and vice-versa if you are having problems getting it through your X1. Doesn't hurt to try it anyways."

GearsOfWar,3dgda7,LissenToMehNow,3,Thu Jul 16 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say they've skipped Gears 2. There is always an option to bring it into the GWG program, somewhere down the road.   If you aren't willing to wait (and have the extra scratch), then you can always go with Amazon, eBay, or GameStop.  Amazon  GameStop  eBay  If you have a local game store, you could also support them! Always buy local whenever you are able to, because Small Business matters."

Sad story, I was on the cusp of obtaining 3.0, before my stuff got glitched (this was about 2 years ago). Level Blue 100, 60/65 Onyx Medals, everything in Horde unlocked, just... gone.

Of course, Guardian is DLC (which slinging the money towards the Season Pass is very well worth it, honestly), but everything about Gears 3 is worth it."

GearsOfWar,3divvc,MilkManX,2,Thu Jul 16 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"When I bought Destiny I was unable to play until 3:00 a.m. my time, when it was midnight Pacific time.   Bungie didn't turn on their servers until 3am EST for that launch and forced us (I'm on the East Coast too) to wait until 3am to play it.  Also, Destiny required servers to play.  I'd bet that you can play Gears 3 Ultimate single player as soon as it's midnight.  And with digital editions, you can pre-download and have them ready right at midnight."

GearsOfWar,3divvc,Misplaced_Sock,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"If that's the case don't risk it. You got the day off so fuck it. pre order a physical copy, take a nap before night of launch, pick it up at midnight your time, ???, profit. Plus with a physical copy you can share or take with you the game where ever you go. I also feel they are less buggy than digital copies so I recommend getting the disc. You don't gotta risk waiting until 3am, the game is now portable, plus you get the thrill of waiting for a game with others just as pumped as you for its release. Beats sitting home alone watching a clock"
GearsOfWar,3divvc,kbruno711,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:52 2015 UTC,But if you want to take it to a friends house then you're going to have to wait an hour or more installing and updating it. If you have it digital then you only have bring the drive and it's good to go. Also you're going to have to installing/update when you get home (probably by 12:30-1am) so it may be just about 3 am when you actually start to play it. I'm pretty sure The Witcher released at midnight est (also my time zone)
GearsOfWar,3deq8b,deathday,3,Wed Jul 15 18:16:59 2015 UTC,"I was absolutely not expecting that. I mean that means the beta is somewhere from April to June and the release date for the game will more than likely be Nov 7 to capitalize on the 10 year anniversary of Emergence Day. So a beta roughly 5 to 6 months before launch is crazy. It means we really might be able to have some significant impact on the final product.  It also means there will be some significant bugs and people will need to understand that and not do stupid amounts of bitching.  Edit: Ok I re read the article. This does not state that the beta starts in Spring merely that if you play UE before March 1, 2016 that you will get early access to the beta. So the beta could happen in October 2016 but you get to play it 1 day early or something. Basically this is a shit article.  Edit 2: So the article still sucks but if you click the link to the source page it actually says the beta is EXPECTED SPRING 2016."
GearsOfWar,3deq8b,2th,3,Wed Jul 15 18:22:46 2015 UTC,I'm so excited about all this Gears news. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition will be the perfect game to hold me over until 4 hits... and hopefully the beta will have some interesting gameplay to get everybody hyped for its release. I wouldn't mind a Gears 2: UE but it doesn't seem like that's in the works.
GearsOfWar,3deq8b,2th,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:10 2015 UTC,You should re read the article. I edited my post to reflect that the article is actually pretty bad and does not provide any real info about a date for the beta.

GearsOfWar,3deq8b,crackalac,0,Wed Jul 15 18:45:48 2015 UTC,i'm not sure how i feel about another gears let along on a supposed another planet.  i mean i feel like they rounded it up nicely in gears 3 with marcuses dad.  I guess it's the new players it might be that i know nothing about them or i just don't like such massive changes like that.  i suppose it could be set a few hundred years in the future where humanity has found another planet to live on but i feel that's just too far fetched for a gears game.
GearsOfWar,3deq8b,fullmoonwolf1995,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:47 2015 UTC,All that matters is the multiplayer anyway.

GearsOfWar,3ddjrk,bigthagen87,0,Wed Jul 15 13:54:06 2015 UTC,Yea that would make sense. With Karen Traviss writing both the books and the story for GoW3 you'd think she would have tried to fit him in somehow.

Everything always looks better when it's dark and there's a lot of shadows.  Gears of War has always been a graphically superior franchise and I'm sure they'll continue to push the console to its limit.  As for what we've seen up til now, it looks good. But as I said, a lot of details go missing in the dark so to actually be able to tell if something looks good we'll have to see some clear weather/ day time settings.  I've no doubts it will look amazing!"
GearsOfWar,3dcxs0,Mathy16,-3,Wed Jul 15 09:38:57 2015 UTC,I'm sure they'll continue to push the console to its limit.   Not that hard to do.
GearsOfWar,3dcxs0,sumoman485,2,Fri Jul 17 06:08:34 2015 UTC,I thought it looked fine as is. I just hope they keep the 60fps with minimal issues with other features such as split-screen.
GearsOfWar,3dcxs0,Fn_Strobe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"It just depends on whether the current dev's know how to utilize UE4 correctly and as most of them are former Epic employees they probably know a thing or two about it.  I just know for sure that UE4 is a greatly optimized engine, for example you can run the latest Unreal Tournament 4 pre-alpha build on a crappy office PC with onboard graphics, of course not at maximum settings, but it'll still run very well.   If The Coalition (anyone else doesn't like that name too much?) can max out the Xbone's performance, it'll be quite a pretty game. But I do hope, that they go for 60 fps (in multiplayer at least) in favor of fancier graphixxx, because since I've played Gears UE, I can't go back to the 30 fps of the old ones, it just played better in every way imo."

GearsOfWar,3dcxs0,LissenToMehNow,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:36:52 2015 UTC,Its not a final production build. If anything its still in beta testing. They are probably still in the process of tuning the engine and all that other technical shit. Plus they are working on Gears Ultimate Edition which drops next month I believe so all their efforts or at least most of it is probably aimed at pushing that out with quality. When Ultimate Edition drops they will shift more attention to Gears 4.
