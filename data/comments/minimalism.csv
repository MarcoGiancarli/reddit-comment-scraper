Without air to get under there there's potential it's trapping water and molding.   However, I was in a basement, so that increases the chance of that problem. Also I lived in a humid environment. If you live in a dryer place it'll mitigate the issue."
minimalism,3du94m,LucidKnight3,11,Sun Jul 19 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"I second this. Do a little research online - mold on the underside of mattresses is kind of inevitable. You release a lot of moisture as you sleep, that moisture travels through the mattress and can't escape under neath. When mold first starts, it's hardly noticeable (discolored beige and grey patches). Once you reach actual black specks, the mold is actually going to affect your health. Don't 'wait and see' if it happens. Be preemptive."

I'd recommend you start with clothing as it tends to be easier to get rid of. Try on every single piece you own. I'm serious. If it doesn't fit, flatter, makes you feel bad (because you feel obligated to wear it or regret buying it) or has holes or stains, get rid of it. I have 3 bath towels and 1 beach towel that stays in my trunk. As far as a new wardrobe, check out ikea's stuff that's made for retail. They have the wardrobe racks on rollers etc and more casual options. Basically, if you don't absolutely love it or have a regular requirement to wear it (like a work uniform shirt) you don't need to hold on to it.

Minimalism is something we should slowly bring in to our lives as it can be a shock to the system if decluttering occurs to quickly. As in the [Flair] it's a lifestyle but I appreciate when downsizing it does have to happen rather fast sometimes, I would look at alternate places to keep some of the items, with friends, family or perhaps in storage.

minimalism,3e0205,RavenclawHouseRules,2,Tue Jul 21 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"You might consider looking at capsule wardrobe ideas to help with your clothing choices. Google search the term and look at images. Then dial in for men and young or whatever other modifiers that might apply.   For shoes (I'm female, so take this advice for what it's worth)... I used to own dozens of pairs of shoes. I forced myself to reduce until they all fit in one 12-pair rack that sits on the floor of my closet. This made me think about what I truly want to wear and choose quality over crap.   Minimalism isn't a race to get to the least amount of items. It's whatever works for you and your life.   I don't know what type of furniture design you might enjoy, but a nine-cube grid storage shelf doesn't take much space, the fabric cubes or baskets are easy to find and they hide away a bunch of stuff. If I were you I'd look at those for your studio apartment - you could tuck smaller exercise items into one, underclothes, socks, t-shirts into a few, your gadgets and cables in some, even some basic kitchen items. A bonus is that these shelves have a nice flat top and are pretty sturdy - so they might work for your cooking prep, too.   For a small apartment, I'd probably also look at a ""Murphy Table"" or a table that folds up into the wall. Some, like the design I'm linking here, have storage - which could work nicely for cooking spices and some canned / dry goods storage.   http://www.klockit.com/products/dept-451__sku-murphy_desk.html  Good luck to you! So many people get an apartment and immediately hit Target or Wal-Mart and think they have to buy ""one of everything"" to make it a welcoming home."

Not entirely sold on the cube storage thingys, they will collect a lot of stuff over time, I'll see what else I'll put in there once I move."
minimalism,3e0205,khattify,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:54 2015 UTC,"As someone who lived in a 400 sq. Ft studio apartment, I'll attempt to answer some of this.    Now I am moving in a month, my room will stay about the same size but I won't have a big kitchen, which I used to share with one flatmate.   At this point, you should focus on getting rid of things that will not fit into your new flat, or items you simply do not need. If you can, try boxing clothing up for charity... clothing is a good place to start.     A table for dinning and a table for meal prep and a mixer.     I would strongly suggest getting a multifunctional worktop. Possibly one with drawers or a food safe surface. I bought one large enough for two backless barstools to fit underneath and used it as a desk, food prep, eating area.   How do I chose the clothes to keep and to ditch. Also talk about towels and all the cloth stuff that you don't wear.   I'm lucky enough to get by with casual clothing and a few business outfits for meeting clients/networking events. Sort your wardrobe to suit your needs, if could be half work-wear and half casual-wear in your closet. As long as it works for you.  Need help deciding what to get rid of? Try on the things you wear frequently. Look in a mirror, does it fit as well as you'd like? Is it worn or faded? Can you replace that piece of clothing with something from your wardrobe that is in better condition?  Bedding and towels. I keep two bath towels, one for me and a spare for company or to use as a backup. I had quite a few kitchen towels (6-8) since I was a messy cook. A spare set of bedding is handy on laundry days, and two heavy blankets for cold weather.   How do you keep your shoe count low?    I gravitate to flat soled sneakers and own a pair of sturdy boots that I use for days I'm going to be on my feet a while. I wear these two pairs of shoes nearly every day and replace them once every 7-9 months (sneakers) and three years (sturdy boots.) Any dress shoes I own are in black/brown and are only worn for meetings with clients. If your job requires you wear dress shoes, keep the pairs you wear the most often.   How do I get rid of gadgets and cables that I ""might some day need or make use of"". What is worth keeping and what is not, how to distinguish?   Backup the information on the gadgets. Store it in a flash drive or external hard drive. For the most part, cables that are used with gadgets you've outdated (by putting the data onto other mediums or making the device redundant by using an app on your smartphone or a program on your laptop) are not useful to keep around.   I cannot overstate the value of an extension cord with a built-in surge protector. Especially if you live in a building with older wiring.   Suggestions? Thoughts?    Minimalism is about keeping the things in your life that improve your experience. Many of us here have hobbies we enjoy that require a lot of gear. (I'm a freelance artist, so I've got stuff too.) Some of the greatest advice I ever got about handling my possessions came from this sub.  Somebody said ""pick your top five hobbies/interests and work on streamlining things unrelated to those five hobbies/interests."" For your new living space, I highly suggest something similar. Pick three functions your living space must fulfil. Work from there.  Best of luck."
minimalism,3dyrmh,rosipov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"Things like furniture, cooking appliances and household items are undoubtedly essential if you decide a house is the route you want to take.  The important thing, I think, is to make a judgment call on whether you (a) need the item (b) will use it often (c) have considered the purchase over a long period of time and (d) can be sure that it a quality, durable product.   If these are all satisfied, any purchase can fit within your minimalist framework. Ultimately there aren't many products that actually do fit all of those criteria (go on, try and think of some!) so you won't end up hoarding lots of unnecessary gear."
minimalism,3dyrmh,minimalj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:26:23 2015 UTC,It's best to remove as much clutter as possible but I always caution that you should not cross past minimalism into deprivation. Although you might not get joy out of every item you own if they serve a valuable purpose in your life then its ok to keep them. For example I could get rid of my forks and only have a spoon. However I use a fork daily and it has a valuable purpose in my life even if I never think about it and it never brings any joy.  Keeping to one suitcase is not really something most will do for decades. It is usually a much shorter term experience. I find it amazing that most people are trying so hard to accumulate more stuff but as soon as I stop trying to accumulate stuff the world constantly tries to provide me with more belongings.

minimalism,3e0fsp,sortofrelativelynew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:10:46 2015 UTC,"What does it mean to be a minimalist?  “Quality over quantity” and “less is more”  are two popular sayings that typify my understanding of minimalism as a lifestyle.  Minimalism as a lifestyle can be defined as thus: an art of living a life less cluttered. While this may translate to fewer possessions, there are no set rules for one to qualify as a minimalist. The primary goal of minimalism, based upon the above definition, is to simplify the mind.   Two years ago, I owned a more stuff than I could handle. Like so many others, I possessed so much stuff that, when I moved into a small lodge with my girlfriend, we were living on top of each other for months. I took the drastic choice of paring down my items. This was a difficult choice for me, but I discovered that the end result was well worth the effort and emotional duress.  Owning fewer objects forced me to become more efficient and effective with what I own. I eliminated items that only had one use, or were duplicates, and replaced them with technology that was multipurpose.   I began noticing that I was under less stress, and I realized that it came from having fewer things in my brain (even if it was only subconscious). My mind began to run wild as the thoughts that had previously clogged and congested my brain were disposed of with the objects they represented. Intriguingly, finding what I needed when I needed was easier, and losing things became far more challenging, both physically and mentally.  ERROR: Brain Overload  Run with me, for a moment. Let's examine this idea that less is more. Imagine if you will, that your brain only has the capacity for owning 100 items. This includes the knowledge of what they are, how they work, where they are located, and the experiences connected to them. Those 100 items are much more expansive in the brain space than they would seem to be, at first glance.  Now, what would happen if you own 1000 + things? There would be a background fuzz in your brain from being subconsciously overloaded. This ""fuzz"" is an unknown stressor, that manifests itself at unhelpful times, without much reason. This makes recalling certain tasks or information... complicated, to say the least. In my experience, when I declutter, a peace and clarity is brought into play that sharpens my ability to appreciate what I own, and to use the knowledge I already possess.  Since I've experienced both lifestyles, I believe minimalism is better.  Naturally, it's important to understand that if you would like be ""minimalist,"" it is your personal choice as to how much clutter you can own before your brain ""fuzzes.""   Often times, simply throwing away all your items is not the most productive start. It's wise to first establish rules for yourself, and then to take your time. Personally, if I hadn’t used something in the past two months and the item was not of artistic or sentimental value, I sold, trashed, or donated it. All of us have unique areas of struggle when it comes to minimizing.  I had difficulty getting rid of shoes and penknives. Obviously, you should utilize common sense, since throwing away snow shoes when it's summer, or sandals when it's winter, isn't helpful if you live in a geographic with more than one season. It's important to practice ""mindfulness"" to sort through your thoughts if you're unsure about an item. You can box the item up, or send it to live with a relative until you decide if you'll miss it or not.  A large part of minimalism for me is “Mindfulness”. I won’t go into too much detail here but being aware of thoughts as well as things and learning how to deal with them is a big stress reliever. A sort of Minimalism for the mind. this needs work or to be eliminated. I would suggest it be it's own article  I believe I own about an eighth of my previous possessions. While my objects may be too small for some, for me, it works. I also don't have the ability to ""onebag"" it, and place all my items in one bag, so I'm still in the process.  Minimalism is a continual process. As new things come into my life, I make sure others are leaving. I try to upgrade my items so that I won't buy as much or as often. For example, buying a  £100 pair of jeans will last me longer and look better as opposed to 3 £30 pairs. ""Less is more,"" remember?   Giving things away is by far my favorite method of slimming down. Recently we had a TV given to us, It had built-in “Freeview” and was half the size of our old one. Our Digi-box had packed up and so I decided to keep the smaller one with built-in freeview both saving money on another purchase and saving space. Minimalism is an attitude. Finding someone that wanted it makes the pain of decluttering easier, I enjoyed the feeling that it was going to make a little girl smile. If you have a good experience when getting rid of an item it’s common to want to repeat the process and thus your Minimalist journey starts. (again, pare down, or remove. It's not necessary, and you've said this different ways already.)  In summation, Minimalism is a tool to lighten the load on your mind. It should free you from stress, teach you about efficiency, and focus your mind. It helps you give value to others and receive gratitude from it. (this is your topic sentence, and should be at the beginning.)  To learn more about minimalism and some more opinions, check out this link for a great place to start!   What are your experiences so far with minimalism ? Do you find some things easier to lose than others? Please share below in the comments!  Okay, I rewrote most of the sentences, for proper grammar and punctuation, as well as rearranged thoughts because they didn't make much sense. There are some paragraphs I didn't touch, but I marked them at the end, to let you know. Overall, I can see how you have an idea you are trying to present, but there's no structure. Try to begin with a topic sentence. One sentence that outlines the flow of your article. Then have one paragraph per point. It's okay to expand past that, but begin with a topic sentence, intro paragraph, one paragraph per point, and a conclusion. Use a thesaurus, it'll be your best friend. There's only so many times you can say stuff or things. It's not bad. It just needs work."

minimalism,3dwd9q,Aikidi,2,Mon Jul 20 06:51:05 2015 UTC,What hurts is I spent money on it. Right now I don't even care about trying to recoup money by selling because I know I never will get rid of everything. Much better to just donate or give away.

minimalism,3dwd9q,khattify,2,Mon Jul 20 06:38:18 2015 UTC,I've moved at least once a year since 2004 (graduating high school). A lot of crap was thrown away for this very reason. I was going through boxes that had not been unpacked from a move 4 years ago! I am donating almost everything in those. The only things I'm keeping are some keepsake things that I want to be able to show my kids someday. But I am limiting all of that to one small decorative/ archival box. It's like 9x11x5.
minimalism,3dwd9q,khattify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:57:14 2015 UTC,"So true!   I've lived at my flat for almost two years, and until now, I'm still getting rid of things I brought over during my move.   I did most of the move by myself, and I carried all that shit around with me. What the hell was I thinking.   OP, I would suggest getting rid of everything non-essential and yes, I agree with limiting sentimental items to the barest minimum. Try to finish all perishables before you move, so you don't have to carry around food (to also prevent waste). If you can leave any of your stuff behind for any period of time while living at your new place, do it - so you can really determine if you can live without. Good luck! 😊"
minimalism,3dwd9q,khattify,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:39:22 2015 UTC,Put all sentimental stuff in a box and leave it for 6 months. List all the stuff in the box after the 6 months. Anything you forget on the list get rid of. That might help.

minimalism,3dtuoe,SoSaltyDoe,5,Sun Jul 19 12:36:43 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, it's hard to maintain an anti-consumerist attitude as you get older. Part of the point of the 40 hour work week is to keep people consuming. They work hard, pay their bills, clean up, deal with their children... there isn't a lot of free time left over after all that. So they go out and spend money on convenience, entertainment, subtance, you name it. Any number of products that were flashed in front of them and played through the radio all day.    And honestly, there's nothing inherently wrong with all of that, if that's what gives you satisfaction in life. But until you're put in the position of carrying out duty after duty, and only given limited resources for your individual self, you'll know if keeping your consumption minimal is really something you can maintain. It's certainly not easy, but you'll truly appreciate a limited-consumption lifestyle if you settle in over time."

I just want the cheapest thing that I can write with. However when buying clothes for example, buy the £20 white t shirt instead of the £5 one. It always pains me, but I have to tell myself that I don't need 4 tshirts at £5, one at £20 is much better and helps me keep my wardrobe small. and it last longer and fits better and most likely the money is going to a national company that treats its workers more fairly, rather than somemass produced chinese factory. (I'm not really a hippie I promise!) so why would you choose otherwise. But on the otherside, I am not paying £50 for a t shirt because that is ridiculous and you are just paying for branding as opposed to the quality.

For me, I culled them over time, again and again, till I'm down to just a few - mostly art books that I enjoy looking through still and display beautifully. The thing with books is - they aren't doing anyone any good sitting on a shelf in your apartment. Keep only the ones you love, then donate them so a kid can read the book and experience all the wonderful things that made you so attached to that book in the first place.   As far as feminine products, I've found that you only use most things because you use them. I've eliminated multiples from my makeup and streamlined it all. Sometimes that means investing in new things, like a beauty blender, which eliminated all my disposable sponges, or finding one really good bb cream to eliminate all your face makeups. In addition, it's pretty likely you've got old makeup. Take this opportunity to cull because it's really a cesspool for bacteria- especially anything you use on your eyes. Consider finding other new multitaskers. I eliminated shaving cream because conditioner does the job even better for me. Do you have any specific questions about that?"

I know it's most times cheaper to buy in bulk, but you do pay the additional price in space and chaos when you lack storage space.   I've also been trying to make sure to finish one thing before buying another. Don't have multiples or various kinds of the same thing. 1 sunscreen, 1 body lotion, 1 mascara, etc.   It's really easy to accumulate makeup items - I've found that it's been easy to give these away (sanitize if you must).   I agree with the person who posted re Light By Coco - she's one of the true minimalists on YouTube! She may sound boring at first, but she's very soothing. She also goes through her makeup collection and routines, so there might be a couple of things you can pick up. Good luck!  ETA: Oh and books! I just finished culling my books right now, so it's still fresh in mind. What helped me is to keep all the books in an out of the way place to start (I hid them in boxes). Spend some time away from them to see if you would naturally want to bring some of them out. Every book you take out, place it out in the open. Give yourself a deadline - maybe six months to a year. After that time is up, get rid of everything still in the boxes. I got rid of maybe 100-150 books this way."

For a while I didn't store my books on shelves, but stacked them against walls. I was very comfortable letting them migrate to coffee tables, side tables and into stacks on my window ledges. (Do not do this if you have pets, the books could fall and harm them.) This method meant not designating a space for a bookshelf, and allowed me to box up books for charity without having an empty space on a shelf.  As for make-up? I have a travel case for make-up/hair supplies and one for toiletries. They each contain all the products I own. I rarely unpack the cases, just remove whatever I need... use it, put it back. Less cluttered countertop.  If you're looking for a place to donate unused hair/toiletries products, talk to shelters in the area... often they are in need of such supplies."

Either way, getting rid of stuff is probably a good start. One relatively painless way to get rid of stuff is to go through and bag/box things you don't think you use. Put them somewhere else. Wait a couple months. Anything you haven't gone and gotten out of those bags or boxes, you can probably live without.  As for minimalist appearance, this is largely a result of the furniture.

I know the mindset of minimalism is to eliminate excess things that aren't contributing to your happiness, but I have a big problem fitting that into my wardrobe. On one hand, I really love the look and style of minimalistic, neutral closets, and I can easily imagine myself conforming to that (I mostly wear black anyway). On the other hand however, I get really tired of wearing the same things! It doesn't make sense to buy another plain black cardigan when I already have one, so I usually end up getting a different color, or a different style. Also I'm a college aged girl, so I get crap about repeating outfits sometimes haha.   What do you do/think about this? And, I've seen comments from guys about not caring what other people say and just owning two pairs of pants and 5 plain shirts, but I honestly believe that this issue is very different (socially) for women vs men; I observe many guys who wear basically the same thing on a daily basis and it's no big deal, but seriously, girls can be mean to each other sometimes, especially about clothes."

You could also try just sticking to a few basics and then use accessories to change it up. A belt, necklace or scarf with a pop of colour can really change an outfit without adding too much to your wardrobe.

So the story: I study Spanish in university and next month, I'm moving to Spain from Ireland for a year to do an intensive Spanish course as well as teach English.   I decided pretty early on that I didn't want to check a bag a) because it costs more and b) because I'd have to haul it from the airport to my apartment which is in a different city. So carry on it is.  What I'm bringing: 7 dresses (missing 2) 4 cardigans (missing 1) 3 pants (1 jeans) 3 tops 1 rain jacket 2 leggings 4 shoes (Skechers, Birkenstocks, t-bar sandals, missing boots) 4 bras (3 ordinary, 1 sport) 9 underwear 7 socks 7 footies  Electronics: iPhone iPad Adaptor Plus various cables     Miscellaneous: Dressing gown Toiletries (bringing solid shampoo etc.) Travel towel Tangle teezer  Sun glasses Reading glasses Notebook Various medications (4 month supply)     I think that's basically it. If there's anything I've forgotten, I'll add it in after the fact.  Some housekeeping before the (welcomed!) suggestions roll in:   I'm a plus size girl and while it seems like a lot of clothing to bring, I have difficulty sourcing clothes in my size, that I like, from brick and mortar shops. I feel there's no point in leaving my clothes at home and having difficulty buying in another country. It just makes sense to bring them with me. Same applies for bras. I'll be teaching Monday to Friday so I need to look professional. Hence the extensive wardrobe. I'm only taking a 4 month supply of my prescription medication because I'll be back home at Christmas when I can restock. Because I won't be home until Christmas, I need to make sure I have season appropriate clothing. I plan on buying 2/3 long sleeve tops to wear under my dresses that will keep me sufficiently warm in the winter months. Other than that I'm covered.   And that's it!

If you need more clothes, you can ask a relative to send you a box with more clothes, you can use whatever webpage you like but I have had really good result with www.packlink.es , they are spanish also.  Being a plus person (I am not really sure what a plus is, I am a slightly oversize male and I have trouble finding clothes for me) just check C&A before any other shop like H&M, Zara or Bershka. Also ""El Corte Inglés"" has usually a wide extension of plus size clothes, in the other hand they are quite expensive unless you go on sales (August and January).  I see you are not carrying any deodorant there. Well you will need, you can buy when you came here, they are usually cheaper than other countries (like France).   If you have not find yet a house or a room check www.idealista.com, has a wide extension of flats and rooms for working people. You can also look in fb but they are usually for students.  Finally, Spain is not Ireland, UK, Canada or USA. If you leave something unattended it will be stolen. I guarantee. Keep your belongings with you (do not leave your smartphone or wallet in top of a table in a bar at the street or the inside), do not leave your jacket unattended. I don't pretend to be scary, but I have met some people from there and all of them got something stolen just because they were not paying attention to their belongings. If some gypsy gave you something or try to read your hand in the street, do not accept and retrieve, do not talk to them just, overlook them and pass away.

The box on the left is the cables for them, the right is the controllers. We also have a PS3 and an Xbox 360 in the house, but they are almost entirely for streaming video at this point.  I have a box of a few games for each console though. Typically only classics that I would rather play on the original hardware instead of an emulator and typically multiplayer games for when people come over.

Finally I have a PS4 with 30+ digital titles and only MLB The Show 15, Grand Theft Auto V and Metro Redux on disc.   I used to find many excuses to buy discs, I would let the hype get to me and pick up a new title at a midnight release. I would also pick up stuff on sale if it was ""a good deal"". Now I don't but a game unless I want to play it right now and if it's a physical copy I will most likely sell it when I'm done. If it's a new title I can usually get $30-40 for it and when I want to rebuy it down the road it will probably be $15-25 dollars.

minimalism,3djmnh,SumahDeez,105,Thu Jul 16 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Edit: Received a lot of questions about my rent. I pay $1100/month for the room, which is considerably less than what my roommate pays for the larger bedroom. I realize this seems high for people living in other parts of the country, but I made the choice to live in NYC -- and in a great part of Manhattan for young people -- and I'm happy with what I'm getting. The rent (even assuming a 50/50 split) is well below median for this neighborhood.  Just want to emphasize, since there seems to be some confusion: this is just my bedroom -- I share the apartment with another person (who has a much larger room) and two cats. There's a decently sized living room and kitchen and one bathroom, so in no way am I cooped up in this space.   I chose this apartment because it's in an amazing location, it's a short walk from work, and I wanted to live with this roommate. The bedroom is tiny but I'm really happy with how it turned out -- I wanted a place to comfortably sleep and work, I wanted adequate clothing storage, and I wanted it to feel bright and uncluttered -- and I managed to accomplish all of that.  Every apartment has some tradeoffs, whether they be cost, commute, space, etc., and now that I've got everything setup the way I wanted I am more than happy with the decision I made.  Thanks for all the positive comments! I'm really proud of how this turned out and I hope it will provide some inspiration for people looking to make a small space livable."

I'm asking because there's just simply better ways to experience life if you're living out of a box for $2k a month. I chalk it up to people not being able to take risk or dare to be different or simply being unaware that there are other options out there.  Sure, I get it if you're in the upper % of income but, let's face it, most of us on reddit are not.

minimalism,3djmnh,CWSwapigans,11,Fri Jul 17 15:24:52 2015 UTC,That's a bit presumptuous. Some people genuinely enjoy living in cities. It's not always about making it big. They enjoy their lives as much as you enjoy yours.

Reddit started as a news aggregation site and forum for bored programmers.  And the median household incomes in SV are in the 80-100k range. So if your household is in the upper 50% you take home more than that.

This sub is partly about reducing one's footprint on the world, eliminating the unnecessary possessions in our lives, etc. Living space is simply something that many people do not see as very meaningful, i.e. tiny homes.  The bay area has a temperate climate, access to some of the best produce, wines, and restaurants in the world, and there is tons to do in the urban areas as well as out door areas. The culture and experience goods far outweigh any desire I have for space and things to clutter it up."

Many (sometimes seems like most) of the people I meet in NY or LA grew up in places where $2K/mo gets you a 3BR house and left it, so I wouldn't think this is the reason at all.  I choose to pay a lot in NYC because I enjoy walkable neighborhoods and being surrounded by diverse cultures. The opportunities for that in the US are pretty limited.  I also could never live in the suburbs because they promote unhealthy lifestyles on a lot of different fronts and I think I'd be among those who fall into the trap."

In NYC there is always tons to do and there's much more potential as far as having a social life goes. Most of my friends are a short walk away and I spend nearly every day hanging out with people before/after work or on a day off. If I had to commute 2-4 hours a day and drive 30-60 min just to see somebody then I'd spend most of my time alone in my house, which is not how I want to live my life. You may have more square footage and a yard, but I've got a beach, hiking, music, art, great food, and more, all accessible to me by foot or mass transit.   And on top of all that it's actually not that much of a rat race if you know what you're doing. Plenty of my friends actually work for themselves from home and make good money.

minimalism,3doxx3,AimToDiscuss,7,Sun Jul 19 06:05:27 2015 UTC,"Do your own thing in your space, and eventually it may rub off on them. I've dealt with the same thing in my office, and showing the benefits of a clean and clutter-free workspace through example goes much farther than talking to them about it."
minimalism,3doxx3,chrisjacobs7,4,Sat Jul 18 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"I share an office with three other people as well, occasionally a fourth. We all have our own areas that we tend to stay in, but each of our jobs overlaps with one another's so we have to 'borrow' each other's desks and filing cabinets and what not. If your disproval is purely aesthetic, you can't do anything. However, if their clutter/disorganization interferes with your productivity, you can politely take action.  Because I'm the newest person to the team, I'll tell you some of the stuff I did. Not all of it applies to you, but you might find it helpful:   I arranged my things so that they accommodated the routines of the people who'd been there longest. My coworkers are pretty flexible, but when someone's been doing something one way for fifteen years it often causes more trouble than it's worth to change, even if they're on board.  If you notice things that have no benefit whatsoever, point them out. Things like 10+ y/o files and broken equipment should be fixed or replaced. Some people may have too much on their plate to deal with it, or the crap in question may not concern them at all and so they haven't noticed.  Volunteer to do things yourself. I hated our supply closet/dump when I first got there, so I offered to clean it myself. If you don't ask other people to do things themselves, they'll probably be fine with whatever you want to do.  That being said, ask for everyone's opinion while you do it. If you're organizing files that involve someone else, ask that person if they want things alphabetical or colour sorted. It saves tons of time so that you don't have to rearrange everything again when somebody loses an invoice (and goes postal on you). Whenever you have something proprietary, show others exactly how you do things and ask that they follow your system. If you're managing a project or taking over a task you might find that when you get your shit together exactly as you like it, you care less about how they go about their business. If you do things well, others might copy you.  Organized chaos is a thing. Don't assume that because someone's desk is stacked with loose paper that they are disorganized, just because they aren't neat doesn't mean they don't have a system of their own - one they'll defend.  Make other people's crap valuable to you. The objects they surround themselves with, much like their mannerisms, may never be endearing, but they can still offer insight into that person's personality.  Be glad that when four o'clock rolls around you have a simple, clean home to retreat to.    It sounds like it's mainly decor that's bothering you, in which case you'll just have to embrace it.  If it's an actual problem then solve it like you would any other."

Those are all big, expensive suggestions unfortunately, but where I live most of them would be necessities.  And you're probably already familiar with it, but /r/vandwellers is great."
minimalism,3diaw4,Blimped,3,Thu Jul 16 15:33:40 2015 UTC,I'm not too familiar with portable toilets and how they operate so I'm going to do some more research on that now actually! My plan until this point was to use public restrooms because I don't plan to ever be too far from civilization for too long.  A generator is a good idea too. Do you by any chance know if it's safe to run a generator in a van with people in it?  And thanks for suggesting /r/vandwellers! I knew there would be a sub for this thing but I couldn't find which sub it was in my quick searches.

A quick search for such generators makes it look like they are much more expensive than I had remembered though so you're probably much better off for now with a cheaper simpler solution, like an auxiliary battery at least."

My husband and I have 2 spoons, 2 forks, and 2 butter knives for our house and hardly ever need more. I would argue we could share the butter knife and just have one probably. If you only have 2 kitchen knives, I would recommend a good chef knife and a pairing knife. Also one cup and one bottle I would think would be just fine.   You may want a washcloth to do the dishes. I am assuming you will wash them in the large pot you had mentioned. This is always what we did when camping in the boundary waters and it works great!   For clothes you might want to add shoes, one for every day, and one set of sandals (for showering at gas stations and campsite). Maybe a small first aid kit as well? Like Tylenol, antibacterial ointment and aloe. Only pack if though if you will actually use it! I hardly ever use bandaids, for example. Most cuts that can be fixed with a simple bandaid really don't need a bandaid at all. If its worse, the hospital usually provide the proper blood stopping device :)"

minimalism,3dftlo,musicman0910,0,Thu Jul 16 11:49:42 2015 UTC,This. It could almost be an art piece. I've had ideas of hanging cables in interesting shapes along the wall rather than bunched at the floorboard
minimalism,3dftlo,birdcar,2,Thu Jul 16 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I'm an audio engineer and this was the hardest part to minimize/control in my life for sure. Here are a couple of ways that helped majorly though.   Figure out what it is you really need and use. The way I did this was a spreadsheet. I Inventoried everything and kept track of how often I pulled it out. Discovered there were things that I held on to for aesthetic or ""what if"" value more than something I actually used. I made replacement and sale decisions for my gear based on that spreadsheet before doing anything else. I built a rack system that I mounted under my desk (looks similar to this now), anything I currently had that couldn't be rack mounted I replaced with things that were rack mountable or I bought a rack mounted shelf unit for it. Soldier or purchase cables to be the exact length needed for your mic pre's/outboard gear and use a patch bay on the front to ensure that you don't need to access the back end for anything. This will help you have mostly invisible cabling as the only things you'll see will be inputs or routing, and as you'll see below, those can be organized and kept out of sight when not in use. Get some rack drawers for loose cables, adapters, and mics. This keeps your needed lose items out of sight, but easily accessible. Clean up at the end of every day to cut down on clutter.   Hope any of that helps man!"

Unless of course you go almost completely digital and get rid of that unsightly (and usually unnecessary) mixing desk. Go software as much as possible? It's nearly impossible to identify the difference now anyway so unless you are a ""purist"", I'd do that.  I try to own as little as possible. I know too many people who buy up tons of stuff and only use it once in a blue moon. Instead I just borrow or rent from people.

I had never realized how much I was irritated by our work desks residing in our previous living room until moving. Now our living room just has a sofa and a television and bookcases. I can keep surfaces clear in the living room and bedrooms and kitchen no problem, and everything has a place to go away. Our hobbies live in back...generally tidy (or at least my desk is, his varies), and we don't have to sacrifice what we enjoy doing. I don't think there is a way to minimize audio gear.

If you don't get a box spring or frame you can simply lean it up when you need space as its not heavy.  You can even device a rope/bar to make sure it stays leaned up.  I'd probably get a mattress cover for the underside (or even a curtain) so when its leaned up you are looking at something other than just a mattress bottom.

Interior designers are about creating designed interior spaces, and generally it's about adding stuff.  The idea of staging her own place as a store has helped her minimize her overhead costs on business as well as minimize the amount of time she actually needs to work.  As a business owner, cutting overhead is huge and working from your home means you can work less and optimize your time.  Also as an architectural designer, visual minimalism is more tended towards architecture, whereas interior designers are more focussed on filling the space.  That's why the two professions compliment each other so well."

This allows a person who likes to gift, to still have options of what to give, which makes them happy, and also gives you something you can use.

We don't do birthday gifts much in my family, we just get together and share a great meal and maybe go for a long hike in one of the parks nearby.    As for receiving, as other's have said, it's hard to break people of giving gifts and to expect them to would be rude.

If a piece of clothing gets rarely used and clutters up your closet throw it away. If you want to downsize and you don't have space for all your clothes figure out what is practical to keep and which clothes give you the most value in life and use that to decide what gets removed.

If we didn't enjoy going out to eat and buying quality foods so much, we'd be able to save a decent amount. I think my other spending vice as far as the material goes is clothing and his is weed.   We really need an emergency fund again because the few times we have saved up for one, it's been depleted by an incident or two. But if we don't go out to eat, we get stir crazy or feel like we're missing out. Trying to find inexpensive/free things to do that we both will enjoy is difficult. I always love walking around the city or in nearby parks, but it's a coin toss as to whether or not he'll be into it. He loves tabletop RPGs and board games, but I generally do not. Not really a fan of being couch potatoes. We're both still relatively young and don't want to severely limit ourselves on experiences because we're constantly saving for potential emergency.

In my case, I live in a small city in Spain, which by the way is quite cheap. Also I live in my mother's house and I have lot of clothes (not very minimalistic though).  For me it is cheaper to use my own baggage and pay for a baggage ticket or use packlink.es to send that baggage, than trying to buy locally in any other of the northest countries/cities which are so much expensive.  About the climate appropiate, if you live in Spain and then goes to Laponia-Finland, maybe you are right. But Northface, and similar branding clothes is pretty much the same around the world. IF you have one, I see no reason why not to carry with. It is simple math.  Cardboard box: 4€  Send the cardboard to a destination: 25-40€  Total: 50€  New coat: 250€ >> 50€  And in the cardboard you can also add other stuff appart from the coat, like boots.

Here's what you really need:   5 pairs of underwear One pair of jeans (you're wearing them, don't pack them) One pair of runners or good boots (dep on destination, wear - don't pack) two tshirts / shirts *Jacket *toiletries    Everything else is optional and also can be bought where you're going probably for cheaper - unless you're going to Switzerland or something."
minimalism,3d53l8,khattify,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"It is not my first time, and I have learned one thing from that previous experience. You carry always an eiderdown with you and it has to arrive at the same time than you do, not before, not after.  The only way to do this is in a suitcase, and a airplane ticket with a suitcase is still less expensive than the combo (Have to buy an eiderdown/ hotel night).   So if I am going to carry a suitcase just for the eiderdown, why not to fill with some clothes, not so much, but I mean, to have underwear is usually quite uselful instead of having to pay 6€ each time you want to clean your clothes.  I may be writing about this topic long time, it is a topic that amazes me."

Follow those tips:  The forclaz 50 from Decathlon is carry on bag while you don't fill the top pocket with any rigid, use it for socks, underwear or a towel (always carry a towel!).  Get the priority board pass, it is only 10€, you enter first so you can place your carry on baggage before anyone else, also I have never had any trouble of managers complaining about the size of my bag, but other people with the same bag and not in priority boarding has.  Act like you are fabulous and you are sure your bag enter in the carry on. Good luck in Spain."

Most of the lines let you to upgrade your tickets to priority boarding.  I still recommend you to do so, specially because if the plane is full (and always is) some of the carry on luggage go to the inside compartment, and you are probably carrying a laptop there and trust me you do not want to leave a laptop inside of a backpack with those brute people who load and unload the baggage."

minimalism,3d53l8,ParticleSpinClass,3,Tue Jul 14 01:30:21 2015 UTC,Pictured is my Canon 7D with a Canon 50mm 1.4. It's probably not the best all around set up but I really enjoy shooting with prime lenses and the 1.4 doesn't weigh too much and lets me shoot low light so it works for me. I'm considering getting something a bit more wide angle like a 16-35 when I have the money.
minimalism,3d53l8,CantaloupeCamper,2,Mon Jul 13 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"The Canon 28mm 1.8 is spectacular.  You might consider that.   It is as light (or lighter) than the 50 and pretty close in other ways.   I used to shoot the 50 1.4 on film for ages before I went to digital and it was too long for me on a cropped sensor for travel.    The 28 1.8 is really sweet, just as quiet as the 50 too.  Although personally I've gone to a Fuji x100t, the ultimate travel camera ;)"
minimalism,3d53l8,ParticleSpinClass,2,Mon Jul 13 17:47:46 2015 UTC,The 28mm on the crop sensor will be better for travelling than the 50mm imo. It will be in the sweet spot of usability I think.   50mm on a full frame is great but I don't think I would like being stuck around ~75mm for everything (about what that 50mm is on the 7D).

minimalism,3d53l8,ParticleSpinClass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:32:38 2015 UTC,Considering that you have a crop sensor you should also think about Sigma 18-35 1.8 ART. I heard its amazing. I own 35 1.4 ART - just superb.

minimalism,3d53l8,CashRockThunderBeast,3,Mon Jul 13 23:18:16 2015 UTC,That would be great if it is a full frame body but IMO that is a bit too long on a cropped sensor.   I have that lens and it is outstanding but on a cropped body for travel... to tight.
minimalism,3d53l8,CashRockThunderBeast,3,Mon Jul 13 19:10:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree. That'd be closer to 70mm on that 7D. Way too long for an all-rounder. I'd go with a 28mm or something for a crop sensor."

Instead she wrote mostly about her childhood in the 1920's, and after 20 pages she said she was done. She's dead now but it's still one of the most important documents I own.

For instance: regular bb protection requires laundering all of your linens 2x month. A load of small laundry takes $5.00, and I only make about $60.00 a week.   The upside (I guess) is that I'm severely allergic to the bites. Coupled with my severe anxiety, I'm an anti bedbug machine. All of the furniture in the new place is going to be metal. No clutter. All shoes in bins lined with cimexa. All cclothes not in drawers and closet in plastic bins. And every three-six months we're gonna pretend we have them again and clean top to bottom with very meticulous inspection.   Realtalk: with my mental illness, the first round of bedbugs drove me almost to suicide. No one believed me that I had them and I was forced to sleep with them for a month by the rental company.

I stumbled into another job, working at a candy store, but the heavy SSRI medication I was put on caused me to lose my mouth and memory. I got accused of attempting to steal and I have no idea what transpired to this day, so I got fired again. I continued to work for less than 100 a week until I left that job June 2015.

That doesn't make us childish. We are adults that own a house and are probably more responsible than most people our age (early twenties)  Just date a girl that likes the things you like dude. Or, if you really are torn up that some women might dislike your posters...I volunteer to take the Sinon's off your hands. I would do that for you.  (But seriously. Don't be ashamed of your hobbies)"
minimalism,3czopn,Sleipnoir,3,Sun Jul 12 06:38:15 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. But you also have to account for the fact that anime is a niche hobby with a fairly negative connotation, and not fitting into the stereotype early in the relationship (usually a girl sees your place in the first few weeks that you know her) is probably good. Early impressions are the hardest to change. When someone goes to your place for the first time, they'll quickly draw a few conclusions that will probably influence how the rest of their time there is going to go. You want to convey ""This guy is organized"", or ""this guy likes to read"", or ""this guy is really into playing music"". But ""this guy likes having a bunch of posters of scantily clad women with big boobs on his walls"" is not something you want, unless anime is so central to your life that anyone who doesn't align with your taste is automatically disqualified as a dating partner.  So, two things: either OP only ever wants to date women who are really into anime. In that case, I agree with you - keep them up and don't give a fuck.  Or maybe OP wants to date a broader set of women, most of which will have negative associations with anime. That doesn't mean they're wrong for him - you can get to know them, and introduce them to an anime show you like to show them that it's not all bad. But in the meantime, you don't want to come across as a weird dude who's obsessed with anime to the point of having his walls covered with anime posters. Especially since, as other commenters posted, a lot of anime portrays women in an extremely derogatory way by western standards in 2015.  When you're settled in with someone and you both know each other very well, sure you can have your crazy anime room and do whatever you like. But when you're building up to that, you want to be mindful of the connotations associated with your hobbies and adjust for it. It's not denying who you are - it's just being pragmatic."

minimalism,3czopn,belugacat,11,Mon Jul 13 01:19:08 2015 UTC,"From a minimalist perspective: why take down something that you love?  For me, the point of minimalism isn't to live in an empty cave, it's to absolutely love everything that you have.  So if you love your Mikasa poster, keep it up.  Take a look at all your other posters - if you don't LOVE them, take them down.  Sell them.  When you get tired of your Mikasa poster, take it down and buy a new one if you like.  As for dating women - be minimalist about that too.  Only date women that you really connect with.  If you connect with them, they aren't going to care if you have a tasteful anime poster on the wall.  If you don't, then they are just cluttering your life with unnecessary thoughts and feelings you don't have to deal with.  Have fun =)"

The fact that you're asking makes me think you're on the edge for at least a few, so perhaps curate. I agree with one askwomen poster that often the way female characters are shown in anime and on posters can be offputting. If I was at your place and there were a few of those posters or a mousepad with Asuka's boobs as your wristpad I'd be put-off, but if I walked in and you just had giant amazing Mikasa and the torso-up of Sinon I'd think ""sweet, someone I can watch anime with.""

It's not like those posters are offensive or anything, it's your house and your posters so you should do whatever you want.  If a girl is going to judge you negatively on your perfectly legal and morally okay choice of entertainment, they have their heads up their bums and you should find someone who likes you how you are.   Also maybe pick your favourite two or three posters and keep them up, stow the rest away somewhere. (if they fold up you can put them in plastic sheet protectors and file them in a folder, or you can roll them into tubes.) Then you can decide if you miss them or not with no pressue, and without having some kind of regret caused by either throwing them away or keeping all of them up."

Lawl that's the most ignorant thing I've ever read.   I just spent $50 on my last one, a huge one of Mikasa from Attack on Titan that I fucking love.    That's a bit excessive, IMO. The poster itself is a bit tasteless as well (coming from someone who likes and watches anime, and has several figures).   But I really feel it's childish having all this up.   What's childish is being worried about what's childish. Displaying what you enjoy isn't childish at all. It's being honest.   Maybe if I reduce to one or two of my absolute favorites, but I don't really know what to do with them.    Well, considering we are on /r/minimalism, the go-to advice is just to get rid of them. All of them. Sell them to someone who wants them. Personally, I still have a few limited edition collectors posters that were manufactured as a fan recognition in a loyalty program. I have them framed and hung. I'm not a big fan of general posters though.   If I save them, I know I'll put them back up sometime.   Then keep them up? Do what you want to do. Minimalistically speaking, less is better. Socially speaking, you probably don't want to be involved with people who hate your hobby. Home decorationally speaking, you can do what the fuck you want with your space.   But damn I'm 26 now I should probably be ready in case a girl comes over, right?   IMO, if a girl has a problem with your hobbies, you probably aren't going to get along. A couple posters shouldn't be a deal breaker. If they are, there's much bigger problems than some silly posters.   TL;DR: 26, apparently women would not like a guy with a ton of anime posters at his place   That's not women. That's /r/askwomen. Reddit's slowly becoming more ""SJW"" and the people that are rising and becoming more common dislike anime/gaming/nerd culture. So naturally they'd be opposed to anime/gaming/nerd posters.  Go ask /r/anime, and I'm sure they'd be cool with it."

Do you feel embarrassed by them?  I think that may be something you need to dwell on.  If you invite a girl over and she doesn't like them or responds negatively towards them, you could in theory take that as a sign that things may not work out between you and this female.  Don't be embarrassed by what you like, if anything be open about it.    Some of the posters/wallscrolls I have up were picked by my girlfriend actually.  Also, if you do decide to get rid of some, let me know.  I'd probably buy some of them off of you so you didn't have to throw them out and be out all your cash.

Don't be embarrassed by it. Of course I would not put it on your dating profile either. Chances are if it's the end of a date and she comes back to your place you are in the clear anyway.  As a minimalist I tend to stray away from any collections or collectibles. A modest amount of art has purpose but be careful about collecting more than you can display.  You might also consider buying a book of prints or something like that rather than the full size posters to minimize your collection while still being able to view the art.

minimalism,3czopn,asianketobro,5,Sun Jul 12 06:37:35 2015 UTC,"So from my understanding is you want to remove the posters from your walls for the sake of a girls view point about you? I don't think being 26 years old and having posters is childish, but I guess you are just being a bit unconfident about your true passions and personality. Not sure why you are posting this to /r/minimalism but my advice to you, take pictures of your posters individually on your phone (if you have the ability) and set your favorite as your wallpaper. Better yet, set the wallpaper on your computer as your favorite anime character. Take all the posters down carefully as not to ruin them and put them away in a safe place. After a while if you can't handle the blank walls (my preferred type of wall), then put one back up. Think about it though before you do. You said you use them as motivation to work out. Maybe it's not motivation you need, but discipline. Something minimalism helps you with is focus and the importance of the things you do and own in life. This is something that minimalism has taught me and I use it every morning when I wake up at 5 or 6 to go to the gym. I think of anime like Baki the grappler, or training to be like goku, or even as lame as it sounds telling myself to BELIEVE IT like Naruto always says. Build discipline and if you truly want change and no longer want the clutter of anime posters and distractions from what you really want to be in the way, you just have to do it. Sorry I rambled a bit and I'm not sure if that made sense. Well time to go to sleep so I can wake up and train to become a super saiyan. Good luck."

I doubt someone who is immature would be pursuing such a difficult degree. Maybe certain people are just interested in different things. I wouldn't random peoples advise on this.

minimalism,3cxis5,custardextract,38,Sat Jul 11 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"I've read (online) about the possible benefits of reading. I don't have any links, unfortunately, but if my memory serves, reading books has many positive benefits. These include:   Improved memory. I don't really understand why, but reading has benefits for memory. As a result, it might slow the progression of certain diseases, such as dementia and Alzheimers. Improved vocabulary. That's fairly self explanatory. Reading also improves writing skill, which I suspect is because of the better vocabulary. Improved knowledge. Again, self-explanatory. I personally find that I learn most things online, and read books for fiction, so it's less of a thing for me. Having said that, I'm reading a non-fiction book about Roman funerary practices at the moment, so it's not entirely wrong. Improved focus and analytical skills. I can see why that would be the case. When I was studying abroad, a tour guide showing me around the university campus said that scientific studies into attention spans have shown that they have progressively decreased over time. I never checked this, so it could be wrong; if he was correct though, memory spans used to be quite long. I think he claimed that Victorians had attention spans of half an hour or more (no idea how this was tested). With the advent of TV, they dropped to an average of a few minutes, as this is the time between advert breaks. The Internet has supposedly eroded attention spans to a minute or less, because if you can't find something in the first two pages of a Google search, most people either give up or change the search. I don't know if this is actually true or not, but it certainly sounds possible. Stress-relief. Reading a book is a relaxing activity. Unlike the Internet or TV shows, which assault you with pop-ups and explosions and adverts and so on, reading is quite gentle. Reading improves empathy. This one was a little surprising, at least to me. I even have a link on this, if you're curious. But, yeah. Reading some books - literary fiction, specifically - improves empathy within the reader.   Personally, I read because I like the stories, and I like knowing things. After a long time of ambivalence, I've become more interested in Shakespeare in the last few months, and the number of quotes that I've started to recognize, in TV shows and other people's writing, is surprising.  I'm also hoping to be an author myself one day, so reading is good for scoping out the competition, and whatnot.  I suspect everyone has different reasons for doing it though.   As an aside, and not to be rude - I looked your quote up. I think you mean John Kellogg, not James. James appears to be a hypnotist, or something, whereas John Harvey Kellogg was a doctor who invented corn-flakes along with his brother, Will Keith.  I wouldn't put too much stock in what he said, though. I looked up the quote, as I was curious. As this says he thought that reading too much would lead to women having painful menstruation.  He also advocated applying phenol to ladies clitorises and circumcising men in order to reduce the frequency of masturbation. If Wikipedia can be believed, he even suggested tying children's hands to stop them touching themselves, or - and I'm not kidding - ""covering their genitals with patented cages and electrical shock"".  In a way, that's actually less insane than the corn-flakes thing. He believed eating corn-flakes would help prevent 'self-abuse'.  I've tried; it doesn't. It really, really doesn't stop you masturbating if you wind up dribbling the milk all over yourself, but I feel I may be straying into the realms of ""too much information"" now..."
minimalism,3cxis5,Hansll,5,Sat Jul 11 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"You're right -- I cited the wrong Kellogg. Thanks, will correct in the OP.  That quote was more for devil's advocacy, fwiw.

I think I learnt about it on QI first, but it makes sense - the ""hys"" part of the word is the same as in hysterectomy, and so on.  It's a fair point that many of his beliefs were more common back in those days. I try to keep in mind that times change, but I am still sometimes dismissive of people because they had silly ideas.

If you never intentionally set aside time to do those things, getting rid of your TV probably won't change that. It seems like in some cases, people get rid of all the things they think are distracting them from more worthwhile activities, without actually wanting to do those other activities in the first place.   If you make an effort to start reading more, find that you prefer it to watching tv in your free time, and then get rid of your TV because you find yourself not using it anymore, that's fine. But don't get rid of all your stuff because you think it will inspire you to change. I think that inner change needs to come first."

Often in our consumeristic world possessions are distractions.

However, if you enjoy reading old classics (something I have been forced to do, but ended up enjoying in my English Literature degree) then surely that is fine as you are striving to spend more time on something that you enjoy which is far more important than other 'trivial' pursuits? (putting trivial in inverted commas as that is a subjective term and based upon what you consider trivial past times to be)  I think the reason why people want to read so much is that reading is the oldest form of teaching yourself something, whether fiction or non-fiction, there is always something to be gained from reading a book. As a student of fiction I can tell you the impact a good book can have on your life can be immeasurable, and encourages free and independent thought, which can never be a bad thing.  No one likes pretentiousness, but it is impossible to claim that reading a work of say Chekhov or Steinbeck is equivalent to browsing the internet, and I certainly wouldn't use a quote from a  creator of a cereal corporation as evidence to support that comparison."
minimalism,3cxis5,iweenana,3,Sat Jul 11 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"Throughout elementary school and less throughout middle school, I was a huge reader. In the third grade I read 63 books, the highest amount in the class (it was a competition, no I did not cheat). One of the things I think I've gained from reading a lot was the ability to gauge others. Someone else posted that it improves empathy, which is basically it.   Specifically through fiction and especially realistic fiction, you learn about character types and how people act/react/feel towards people, situations, things, etc. Of course biography leads to this too but I've always been a fiction gal. It's my favorite genre although I do read a lot of self-help/spirituality/philosophy books and essays. The ability to talk to people and make really good connections and friendships is one of the most skills you need to succeed in life in general, and I think reading on a consistent basis always gives you new perspective into the psyches of people, even if they are made-up.   Reading also VASTLY improves your reading/spelling/grammar abilities, at least, in my case. Most of the adults/young adults that I know who barely read throughout childhood can't even write a basic middle school-level essay, which is pretty sad imo!  Reading expands your mind empathetically, broadens your imagination, and exposes you to the infinite possibilities that life has to offer. Of course it's not for everyone."

minimalism,3cxis5,boofrickenhoo,2,Sun Jul 12 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"Well that quote is just one man's opinion, man.   I think everyone understands the potential benefits of reading. I don't really see any downsides unless you just exclusively read fiction, and even with that there are plenty of upsides to balance any potential downsides there. Downsides to developmental types of reading could include reclusion or analysis-paralysis, but that's a whole different animal than what you alluded to originally.  When I say read - I'm talking business, investing, coding, life, specific knowledge like carpentry, etc. Reading is the best, often cheapest and efficient way to learn something new. I'm not really into fiction but I also can recognize the value in fiction alone.  (In general) The more you read, the more you know. The more you know, the more valuable you will be. The more valuable you are, the more money you will make. I've never once thought of reading to be for anything else than entertainment, knowledge, or personal growth.  Literally everything can be boiled down to consumption, and we always compare ourselves to others, so there's no fighting that."
minimalism,3cxis5,coldcoldiq,2,Sun Jul 12 05:08:45 2015 UTC,"This seems less about minimalism carving out more time for reading and more about some vendetta you have about fiction, so as an avid reader, writer, and lifelong student of literature, I'll try to explain.  Fiction is a vehicle for ideas, and a lot of us find ideas an excellent ways of connecting with and understanding other human beings. For some, it's about story-telling and escapism, for others it's about finding in others' experiences echoes of their own. Some want theirs opinions validated, some like to be challenged with opposing points of view. Some want to gain an intimate knowledge of the sorts of lives they will never lead themselves. Some enjoy the aesthetic side to words and sentences flowing together as others enjoy a melody or a painting.  Not all classic literature is prissy matrons in starched dresses weighing the pros and cons of their daughters' suitors. There is plenty of excellent world lit on the horrors of war, diaspora, genocide, poverty, dogma, ethics, loss, etc. There are also modern-day authors of impressive skill, such as Kazuo Ishiguro, Arundhati Roy, Toni Morrison, or J. M. Coetzee, no less talented and important than Balzac, Dostoevsky, Hemingway, etc."

I was just stating my observation that if you read pretty much any thread about someone's motivations to simplify their lives, ""more time for reading"" is almost always at the top of their list.  As someone who reads and writes often, I feel that it isnt really a better use of time than many other hobbies and it certainly gets in the way of some other things -- i'd probably be in better physical shape if I didnt read/write for fun, for example.  That's why I wonder if people idealize it too much. It becomes just another one of those things you're 'supposed to do' which in my mind are the things a simple lifestyle is supposed to weed out."

You become a better person by reading more as you can understand others better (their motivations, inconsitencies, histories, etc.), you can understand yourself better (and then do away with parts of your personality you'd rather do without, very minimalist) and overall become a more responsible and mature member of society.

For many people reading is something they enjoy but never seemed to have enough time when all the clutter was in the way.  The same can be said for hiking, fishing, visiting with friends, and so on.

The thing with minimalism is that it's supposed to add clarity to your life by getting rid of the bulk, the excess making way for the essential. If getting rid of stuff becomes an obsession, you've gotta pull yourself back and re-assess why you're doing all of this and why it's important to you.  Is it worth it to shift your life to go car-free, to live in a smaller apartment, as you mentioned? Or is it enough for you to live life the way you've been living it, making it better one day at a time instead of concentrating on a massive shift that might not be something you need?  A lot of people get caught up in smaller and less -- mostly because minimalism is trendy at the moment. I guess you're more prone due to your OCD, but I hope you can always let your best judgement take over."
minimalism,3cvzud,strategichope,9,Sat Jul 11 07:58:34 2015 UTC,"As stated else where minimalism and hoarding are extremist attitudes. I have been personally without a gaming rig proper desktop for years and at work I have both options. When I can I use the desktop as much as I can even though it is older and slower than my laptop.   The friend that introduced me to minimalism did point out one specific key. Minimalism is more of cutting the crap you don't need in life to focus on the things you need/want with more quality. I saw I can live more happily with a small ARM based server, a laptop, smart phone, and desktop than some can with just laptop and a smart phone.   Gaming is important to you it seems. Of you are going to sit down and be at the computer a lot get the desktop. If you want to get back into gaming heavily then take a page out of minimalism and don't own 4 consoles + the computer otherwise all those different devices will begin to own you.   As for going carless, it depends where you are. I love having both my motorcycle and my car. I take my bike as much as I can and just did 1100 mile trip and it was awesome. Everything packed for the trip fit in a back pack which really made me appreciate this subreddit with the tips I picked up over time. But at the same time a trip like that isn't always practical. For me my life is going out doors, computers, and lots of time driving to different places. So... I only buy things and focus on things that enable those 3 things now and promptly throw the rest of the crap out.   I think op should look at simplifying and focusing their life more. If you can live by public transit, do it. If your living space is nothing but eating, sleeping, and videogames/occasional work then shrink it. That is what I have been doing and I have been a lot happier since slowly throwing stuff away."

I've put away all the unnecessary electronics in a closet, and tried living like this for about a month. I realized that I miss my gaming PC, so I pulled it out of the closet. But I didn't miss Xbox and Kinect, so that went away. I drastically reduced my wardrobe by bagging all the items which didn't fit me well or I didn't wear often. Kept the bags in the closet for a month. Ended up taking few items I hastily reduced back in. The rest was donated.   TL;DR: Try living without things before trowing them away."

A tool can be used for positive and negative things, just like a hammer can build a house or bash in someone's head.   If you're looking for a mindset to focus on, figure out your top 5 priorities and make decisions with your time, energy, money, thoughts, and actions that help to support and enhance those priorities.

I find that minimalism is more about essentialism that it is to declutter. On the car example, I would never never get rid of an car, it's a passion, but even in that I could go minimalist even if I had 2 cars. Example: I would love to have a Land Rover Discovery for hill climbing (4x4 red neck mud trucks) and a track day car/ hill climbing car, an evo V or a evo VI, for me this would be minimal, if I only had this two. My point is, if you use it everyday and it helps to make your life easier don't get rid of it, if you have more than 1 or 2 that does the same job get rid of that.

minimalism,3cvzud,Marsupian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"No.  I think minimalism is taking away what is of little value and thereby getting more value from the few things you have. It's a focus on what is important by reducing the redundant.  Taken to the absolute extreme you would have one thing that provides all ""value"" to you. This isn't realistically possible outside of maybe certain religious people like a Buddhist/yogi/monk type person who lives on alms and only has his body or some clothes. Are those people unhappy?  Less extreme options are people who have one major possession which gives them fulfillment in life. A surfer who just has a surf board and a VW van with some basic living equipment. A touring cyclist with just his bike and camping gear. A travelling entrepreneur with just his laptop and some travelling gear.  I would say such a lifestyle is better than hoarding and being a mindless drone in the corporate 40hr workweek who buys shit for a quick dopamine fix or to belong.  What your problem was is that you started minimizing your stuff before you found what gives value to your life. Apparently gaming is a significant part of who you are at the moment so getting rid of your gaming equipment reduced your value. If you received more value from something else getting rid of the gaming equipment would put more focus on that aspect and increase your benefit your life.  What you should do is first build the activities and values you want (you mention being social and reading) and then when you find the things that truly matter to you you can make decisions to reduce your stuff and focus on what is important."

In the beginning its hard to get rid of many of your belongings. Then it gets easier and easier and feels good. The problem is it can be hard to realize when to stop downsizing. I think you are very close to being decluttered. Getting rid of more of your items may be depriving yourself. Maybe you have hit your comfort level of minimalism and don't realize it because you have been in the habit of decluttering. This is common so its nothing to feel bad or worried about.   Try setting a goal to not bring in any new items and adopt the one item in, one item out rule for a couple months. This will break the declutter habit and will let you know if you truly still have useless stuff. Chances are you may find that there a a few items you never used during those two months and its ok to get rid of them. I think either way you need to take a break to get your focus back. Good Luck!"
minimalism,3cvzud,dGasim,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"I used to be a gamer DIY PC builder guy since i was 7. 2 years ago (when i was 20), I got a rMBP 13"" and it was the best decision I made. And this comes from a guy who used to have dual 23.6"" monitors and hated windows laptops because the manufacturers declutter it with shit. Just old unnecessary shit. Here is why you wont regret it:   It comes with all you need. Nothing more nothing less.  Interface is very intuitive and beautiful Once you take advantage of full screen apps, you are going to forget about multiple monitors. 13"" is a small screen size but with retina resolution, it doesnt feel that bad. Easy to carry.   Gaming was a big issue for me with rMBP and I found a solution: PS4. It is going to take some time to get used to controller after mouse and keyboard but there is nothing better than using 55"" TV to play a video game.   I know that if I ever move somewhere, I will always take these two things with me.   Plus buying games digitally and appa digitally is amazing and keeping all the documents in the cloud (iCloud drive works fully for me). So if you ever lose or break, you can access it from everywhere."

My dad had to leave Iran after the revolution so he could not bring anything. I don't old pictures or keepsakes to look at. Don't throw them out! Keep them safe and tucked away somewhere. Those things are important.
minimalism,3cpyev,SauteedGoogootz,10,Fri Jul 10 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"Thing about this, the items are worthless without your mind. Seeing the items is what brings back the memories.  Holding them or having them in a box is not needed.  What I recommend is you take some good pictures of the items.  Store them in your cloud backup. I sometimes write-up a paragraph or two and insert the images into a doc. As I get older I realize that my memories will fade and I may not remember all the details so writing it down really makes me feel good.  Then I stick it in a folder called memories and every once in a while I check in and read a story and/or look at the pics. For documents a scan is just as good. One you have made sure to preserve the sentimental value its ok to get rid of the items by selling, recycling, donating or giving as gifts.   Remember that most of the stuff will probably get tossed after you pass. Don't burden your kids with junk. They can look at the pictures, scans and stories if they want. I have had to go through a house after a relative died and it was hard to do. Do you want your kids to have to go through this same battle you are going through years from now? My guess is there is only a handful of truly sentimental items and the rest should be ditched."
minimalism,3cpyev,SumahDeez,8,Fri Jul 10 03:45:13 2015 UTC,"Making you happy is a purpose. If an object has real positive sentimental value for you, give yourself permission to keep it. If there's a document or picture you think you may want later you can also scan it.  Obligation items, however, are not worth keeping. If you become religious again, get re-baptized. You don't like owning the item and if you died your relatives would throw it away. Save them the trouble. And sell the expensive stuff you don't like. If you're just keeping things that have value then money also has value.   For saving things for your kids: wouldn't you rather your kids go through things that are really meaningful to you? What was meaningful to you about going through your mother's things? I assume because you got to know her better and see the world she was from. You'd be sad if you went through your mother's things and then she told you she hated all that stuff, right? Also be prepared for your children to have no interest in this, they will be different people from you; they might not care at all."
minimalism,3cpyev,idamayer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"You know, your last comment caught me. I didn't really have any expectations that they (my future kids) would want to see it. And I already have a box of treasures I put together for myself. So why keep the things that I don't care about, in hopes of something I don't even expect?"
minimalism,3cpyev,idamayer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:19 2015 UTC,Exactly! I'm glad you get to remove these unimportant possessions from your life and keep hold of others that are meaningful to you.
minimalism,3cpyev,HenryHendersen,6,Mon Jul 13 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Here's how it usually goes when you save things about your life for your kids. You lug it around with you for every move for 30 or so years, then at some point you show it to your kids. They say ""Oh, that's neat"" and then go on with their day. I kept quite a few of my toys and mementos and books and so on for my future kids. I have those kids now and they really were never all that interested in playing with the toys or looking at the mementos. They are too busy developing memories of their own to sit and think about my memories.  If you don't want those things, get rid of them. Or take pictures of them, then let them go. You could still look at them and get the memories, but you aren't tied to a physical object you have to be responsible for."

minimalism,3cpyev,HenryHendersen,2,Sat Jul 11 07:36:25 2015 UTC,"Children have their own likes and dislikes. Many children have absolutely no interest in Lego, while others love it. You could drag around your Lego collection for a few decades, hoping you have a child that loves it, or you could let it go and let your child find their own interests and toys that they love.  in my case, I had a big collection of Barbie dolls. I always thought I would have a daughter who I could sit and play Barbies with. I ended up having all boys. They had absolutely no interest whatsoever in my Barbies. I drug around that collection for about 30 years for nothing. It was pointless and an obligation I didn't really have to have, looking back in hindsight."
minimalism,3cpyev,pygmy,11,Sat Jul 11 12:44:16 2015 UTC,"Sentimentality is a real trap. Watch a few episodes of hoarders to see people struggling to part with the most inane things. People accumulate so much stuff, so easily- without systems in place you will drown in your own shit!  Seeing a family dealing with their deceased (90yo) mother's house full of possessions recently was eye opening.  Many valued collections, sentimental items suddenly become worthless. Heaps of stuff also gives the bereaved a lot of homework.  The experience has left me really scrutinising my accumulated belongings, and reminds me that I can appreciate something without having to own it. Hanging on to stuff 'just in case' clutters your mind and distracts you from living in the now.  Let it go!"
minimalism,3cpyev,HenryHendersen,7,Thu Jul 9 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"My aunt passed away unexpectedly. She had many collections, items she spent a lot of money on, and a lot of time shopping for. Her house was filled to the brim with many lovely things, but too many of them. Many items were still in the shipping boxes, and she never even had the chance (or the space) to really enjoy or display them.Most of the things in her house were very dusty and dirty and covered in cat hair because there was no possible way for her to actually be able to clean and care for everything because there was just too much.   Working on dealing with her possessions has been so eye-opening for me, and really pushed me further into the minimalist lifestyle. I was already leaning that way, but thinking about my aunt and how much of her life with devoted to buying things and rearranging her collections and cramming her house full of stuff made me realize so much that it isn't the way I want to live my life.   I honestly can't think of any non-essential purchase I have made since that experience."
minimalism,3cpyev,whatdoiwantsky,3,Fri Jul 10 09:35:30 2015 UTC,"Keep what you want now. Re-evaluate it in a year or two. If you still find it important, continue to keep it. If you forgot about it and won't need it again, then donate or toss it. The ""hoarders"" comment is concerned only with extremes. Memories are precious. They are indeed tied to physicality. A smell can bring you back, an artifact can bring you back. Why deny the richness of memory that might otherwise be forgotten? I'm certainly not advocating hoarding. I am asking you to evaluate for yourself what memories are precious to you and what you can do without. Nothing wrong with a journal either in place of the artifacts.  There are many shades between hoarder and vagabond."

When she eventually passes on, going through all her things will be a nightmare for her kids (mainly my Mom).

minimalism,3cpyev,Technicolor-Panda,2,Mon Jul 13 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"I too have been going through sentimental items. I had even saved about every letter I had ever received (which I know dates me.) I have come to the conclusion that the longer you have things, he harder they are to let go. Anything I save is passing that along to my children.  My thoughts:   Anything that has monetary value does not realize that value until you sell it. Sell it if you do not want it. Part of the difficulty decluttering is that it makes you take stock in your past. You need to cope with something you worked hard on now being fairly meaningless to you. Make peace with your past and how you have grown and let it go.  Take pictures of larger things that genuinely give you happy memories and let them go. Maybe put aside a box or things to keep. Don't feel obliged to keep everything.   As for myself I have thrown out about all of my old letters mostly unread except a couple from my mom and grandma. Many pictures even have been tossed. There are a few things I know my children will want but the majority of it is gone."

Physical items that hold memories but no practical purpose, I'll take a fun photo of it and save it on my computer as well. A friend told me recently, ""Once you receive a gift, it's yours to decide what you want to do with it. Don't hold onto gifts out of obligation, because when the person gave it to you they were trying to make your life better, not worse. Only keep gifts you find value in."" So, if if an item has only sentimental value, I digitally save it, then send it on to the trash can or Hannah Home so someone else can find value in it."

The idea behind minimalism is to clear clutter to focus on the things that serve purpose to us and bring enjoyment to us.  I would add that as long as that hurts nobody else then by all means, enjoy the things you like to do. Chances are some hobbies will dwindle while new ones show up. Life has so many things to experience so approach it with an open mind.  What else would you do with the time anyway?  Minimalism is not about deprivation.  Its about clearing clutter to focus on the important things.  What is clutter to me is not always clutter to you or anybody else.  Why would you get rid of everything only to  be bored."

You're asking the right questions. As humans, we have a finite amount of time and mental/physical energy to invest in life things. Identify five or so things you consider worthwhile in your life. Heavily invest in those and question the rest. You don't have to adhere to expectations of the culture or other individuals. Only you can discern what adds value to your life.  All that said, from time to time we will find always ourselves veering into activities that lack value. Continual reassessment is a good thing."

I still watch and read reviews of films I like, but online. If you enjoy making music, why would you get rid of it? I think, minimalism is to focus and intensify our focus to our goal and get rid of 'other' things.  It doesn't make any sense if a musician/someone who enjoys making music gets rid of his piano or filmmaker gets rid of his camera or etc. I think, you get the point. It's to get rid of things you don't enjoy or need, not the specific things you need, use or enjoy. Don't deprive yourself from enjoyment."

As long as you've sort of got your hobbies prioritized, and you're doing them for the right reasons (e.g. enjoyment vs impressing people), I see no need to cut down. The only activities I try to limit are those that I feel obligated to do rather than truly enjoy, and those that I want to stop but can't (browsing the Internet is a big one for me, but a lot of people have the experience with Civ 5 or Netflix - the sort of stuff where it's basically an addiction and you'll be physically uncomfortable but still can't stop.

Fourth, iTunes is good for sorting all your music, on my iMac I have around 200GB and it does a great job.  Fifth, it boots up really quick and never freezes (I don't use many 3rd party apps so that may explain it)  Of course you have different priorities so you may find some things I find great just OK but you'll appreciate the simplicity anyway.

Battery only lasts about 4 hours when I have the lowest power usage option and only onenote open. I did that to test the theoretical maximum battery life with screen on. Otherwise, the design is awesome. It's 4 pounds and 15.6"", which is really light for a laptop of that size and for how sturdy it feels. It makes a fair amount of noise when it's really being stressed, but otherwise it's very reasonable. The performance is great of course, as it should be for a $1500 notebook. The lighting options for the keyboard are decent. My only real annoyance was the lack of a Windows key on the left side of the keyboard. The reasoning is to remove the possibility that someone will hit the windows key while gaming. They could've just made it a key you can disable with a switch. And you can't change the left fn key at all. I had to get a smart user by the name of Svet (non-employee of MSI) on MSI forums to write a custom BIOS for me just to change what a few keys do.  More relevant to this subreddit is pcdecrapifier. It detects preinstalled bloatware and gets rid of it.

Books 4 & 5 can be a little rough to get through, that's true. GRRM splits one concurrent timeline into two different books based on character/location, and some readers have found it boring. Here's a proposed mashup between the two books, so you read one or two chapters of one, then one or two of the other... it's supposed to be a more entertaining and engaging read! I can't vouch for it, since I'm bound to audio tracks, but I've heard it's good enough to recommend.

Sitting around with friends, listening to music and having meaningful conversations quickly replaced all of the other stuff.  When I get together with my roommate from the time, that's pretty much what we still do by default."

minimalism,3chd9f,red_delicious,3,Thu Jul 9 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"It started as a short term experiment, but my roommate and I ended up enjoying it and  made it through our entire 1 year lease and then an additional 7 months.  In some ways things became easier.  I had more money since there were fewer bills, and I had more free time which I used more productively, such as cooking and reading.  A lot of good habits have stuck permanently. I was never super strict about the experiment, so if I needed to do my taxes or something I would drive out to my parents' house and use their computer.  You probably won't like this, but I'm in a very different housing situation now. I live in a smart house, where even the light bulbs go through a voice activated computer.  it's not very minimalistic, but it's pretty damn cool."

minimalism,3chd9f,trivial_trivium,56,Thu Jul 9 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what you did with your time during this experiment.  I do relapse prevention counseling and the main thing I emphasize with my clients is that it isn't enough to take away the substance -- they've got to add something healthy and productive in its place or else falling into old habits will be virtually inevitable. Did you actively pursue any new hobbies or interests during this time, or have anything concrete in mind aside from wanting to read more?  I can see that if your focus was solely on taking comforting things away without much plan as to how you would self-sooth without them, that it would have been very difficult to maintain. You may not have been prepared enough to take the leap.  Then again, you may have just learned that that degree of minimalism isn't for you.

After that, I've been going to work and driving, then getting home and doing, not much. Back to internet, movies, games. I'm kind of buying time until my ""Contract"" is up for my current job and I can move to something that pays better and give me more hours of work.   I also had other motivations from being more disconnected from the internet which I have not talked about on here. But yea, I found boredom to be a problem.

The basic concept can be applied to almost anything, 'I have too many possessions I feel weighed down', 'my mind feels cluttered and I want to simplify my life', 'I feel out of touch with reality when living through technology', 'I like clean edges and simple design'.    There are so many contradictions as well, for example is having an e-book with 100 titles more minimalist than having a bookshelf with 100 books?  It takes up less physical space, but the content remains the same, the burden of 'I need read these things' or 'I'll get around to it' is still there, and is the trade off of taking up less physical space less minimalist than worrying about charging the e-book or being concerned about losing/damaging a more valuable object.  It's a broad term without distinct boundaries, but the general concept can be applied to many things."

minimalism,3chd9f,DontQuixote,14,Wed Jul 8 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"You didn't make any of the lifestyle changes you wanted.  You lost a few meaningless pieces of furniture and bought a bike that doesn't allow you to change your lifestyle at all, then returned to spending time on the internet and watching tv because you enjoy it and everything else is too much more difficult when you're tired from work.    Do what you can to cultivate real hobbies (TV is art, but just consumption) and then try to find things you like doing on your own and with other people and then find the people doing those things.  TV is the path of least resistance any given moment, and if you don't have a concrete plan to do something else that you believe is important and valuable, you will continue to make the choice to watch tv over and over.  I quit my job because I felt so stifled having to go to work 40 hrs a week and being forced into all sorts of industrial consumption and then only having the nights and weekends to frantically relax, so I have until my savings runs out to figure out how to make money non-consumptively.

I'd recommend something like 'Night Mother or Equus as a start. Then some Yasmina Reza, the.n some Shakespeare, then explore on your own. There isn't a science in that path and I'm sure there are better recs or it doesn't matter. It's just how I got started with them.  anyway read a bunch of them to exercise and maintain your reading muscles and then 'graduate' to whatever books you've been wanting to read.  it also might be helpful to think about and articulate why exactly you ""want to read more."""

A song of ice and fire isn't something I would recommend to someone who wants to get into reading, you already know the major plot points if you've seen the show anyway! I'd be looking at something smaller than a 5 book epic fantasy series, but if fantasy is your thing then try the name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss. Great writing and you don't know what's going to happen so you will actively want to read to find out more.   I'd also be tempted to try some smaller books, things like 1984, brave new world, earth abides. Or some YA fiction. And if you want to stay minimalist use your tablet or get an eReader."

minimalism,3chd9f,Volcomrock808,4,Wed Jul 8 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, I had the exact same idea as you. I should've made a post out of it. A few months ago, I got rid of my tv and recently I cancelled my broadband subscription and got 4g all on my phone for emails and such.  All for the sake of reading,learning more and not wasting time.  I calculated on a Google spreadsheet that over the course of a week I spend 20 hours watching shows. I figured thats 20 hours I can learn stuff. I then made another sheet a huge  list of stuff I can learn and do with those 20 hours.  It was unsuccessful initially,  my broadband still works outside of me cancelling it for some reason. Only in the last 2 - 3 weeks am I making progress. I'm reading at a faster rate, I can now concentrate better on educational videos and online language courses.  I've read nearly 3 books, an hour or two total of videos about philosophy, 50 words in German. There are a lot more benefits like being more mindful,  relaxed, better English vocabulary and sleeping better.  I like to centre activities around my books recently, ill hop on the bike and cycle to a remote place in a park by a stream. It makes it easier and more  comfortable to read.  I watch a few tv shows here and there, going cold turkey is too ambitious for most people.   Id say if you had of stuck to your habit , made it more flexible or if you found the right book you would have succeeded. I believe recently that books resonate with people more than others because we all have different life experiences. I struggled through reading catch 22 for a month but I've read Catcher in the rye in nearly 4 days.  If you do pick up reading , make your way through the classic books with the highest reviews on goodreads.  Hope you do give it another shot. Its well worth it.   ps it seems you are reading novels that are known to be lengthy and difficult to read. That could be your problem. I know because Atlas Shrugged of over 1000 pages stopped me from reading for a long time.  You could try reading one sitting, more shorter, addictive novels. There are lists of them on Reddit. Books like;  Old man and the sea by Hemingway   Albert Camus - the stranger  Of mice and men - Steinbeck.  These three books have around 100 pages each."

minimalism,3chd9f,Volcomrock808,2,Wed Jul 8 07:58:01 2015 UTC,"Ill admit, I do over think things a lot. Its in my nature to plan miles ahead. Id say the majority of overreacting belongs to this type of person or because that person has too much extra time. Extra time I certainly had, I have freed a lot of time for myself in the past few months.   Over thinking or not, it was a useful experiment. One spreadsheet was  for a wish list of what id like to do with the time. I still look at that sheet for ideas.   The other spreadsheet with the tv times was a great idea. What I'd do after each tv episode was to log the minutes into the spreadsheet and tally it up at the end of the day. Easy enough to do. The results of the spreadsheet were a key motivating factor to continue the habit. I don't watch tv as much as used to. Finding out I was wasting 20 hours a week on brainless activity really did make me change. The spreadsheets took me an hour total to make and maintain for the two weeks. That's a good investment if you consider it's benefits.  The overreacting as you say is always a thing you have when you start an ambitious habit like this. I can't imagine anyone being relaxed with their time when you take away their crutch, their tv, their internet. What was I supposed to do now with all those extra hours. Initially overreaction,  gradually I've reformed that into the results and benefits that I posted earlier."

minimalism,3chd9f,Volcomrock808,2,Wed Jul 8 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"I meant that some people can go through books quicker based on their own experiences and interests. I had zero interest in army literature or media until I read Catch 22. If I did have that interest or army experience,   I imagine I could of read the book a lot faster.  Case and point, after finishing the book, I finally finished watching Schindler's list in one sitting.  I became really  interested in a lot of  army films after reading this novel. I'm confident I can read a novel with an army theme a lot faster than before.  Catcher in the rye - Even though I like it, I know of people who hated it, calling it pretentious and found it difficult to read. They couldn't relate to the book or they didn't like the style of writing/dialogue. Saying it's easier to read isn't being entirely accurate. People who went through that phase of angst and hate in their teens can relate more so and I assume they could read the book faster. That is my opinion, because I can relate to a lot of the book.   I'm comparing these two novels because they are of different subjects and they were 2 of my most recent reads.  That's not being unfair. I can imagine someone finding Catch 22 easier to read than Catcher or even finding the 2 books absolutely annoying.   Also the book I read before these two was,  The giving tree.  Now, comparing that book would definitely be unfair to compare since it is an illustrated book.  To be fair, the higher page count and the unusual way the Catch 22 novel is written do make it a bit more of a read than Catcher."
minimalism,3chd9f,little-lion,2,Wed Jul 8 19:46:24 2015 UTC,You raise decent points but none of them really defend the fact that the catcher in the rye is a simple linear book where catch 22 is a decently complex read. The lexile score of catcher is 790 where the lexile score of catch 22 is 1110.   I'm really only talking about reading comprehension though and more specifically the words heller uses to describe situations. His vocab just blows Holden's out of the water.   And of course other people identify with different works differently. That argument goes nowhere.  I would absolutely recommend both of them though. They are both in my top 5 books ever.

I have agreed on that already. The point I was defending was that in your first message was that you said the difficulty made them uninteresting. That's why I went off on a ramble about some people identifying with some books more than others.   If you are on about which  book is more of a challenge, then Catch 22 for sure. I never said that either book was uninteresting, I haven't read that many fiction classics, but these books are really good novels. That's nice that you have the catcher and catch 22 in your top 5.

Hmm about the 5th choice. I've read only half of Terry pratchett's first book, so the 5th book is tied between that and Philip Pullmans Dark Materials series.

I applaud what your doing but it seems like you are trying to get more connected to real world and detached from the internet world. It's a cool thing, but I'm not sure if it's really minimalist.   I live in an airstream in the desert and our physical books and movies create more clutter than our laptops. The Internet and technology lets me get away with having less physical real world items."

minimalism,3chd9f,letsgocrazy,2,Wed Jul 8 05:06:30 2015 UTC,"I don't mean this to sound harsh but you don't need minimalism, you need self discipline.  Getting rid of all your stuff and forcing yourself to live a life you're not ready for doesn't solve anything. All that happens is you revert back to old habits. Look at what happened over time with your laptop etc...  If you want to read more, get a book from the library and finish it before it is due back. This might motivate you into reading more till it becomes a habit.  Want to spend less time online? Get one of those internet extensions that blocks websites after an hour a day or something. Yeah, you might have to turn it off for important stuff occasionally but it will train your brain to focus and make the most of the limited time you have.

Every other minimalist blog writer or poster always seems to have the following similarities:   Introverted Love reading (especially the phrase and act of 'curling up with a book') Love writing (despite same turns of phrase, subject matter, and the inevitable ebook) and photography   Yawn  Be yourself. Sure get rid of crap, and try not to buy for the sake of buying, you'll probably have some revelation and discover your true purpose, but chances are that you won't but at best will save money and if you continue will realise that you don't need much stuff.  If you want to improve or discover yourself the work towards it, regardless of what that means (so long as it isn't harmful to others, and you're not a jerk about it.) try singing, running, writing, reading, or whatever but don't do the oft-too-well-trodden path of: 1. I want it 2. I'll buy this the. I can do it 3. Do nothing after buying  Is there something lacking in your life, you can go around asking here there and everywhere, you can make many of the cookie-cutter self-help (traditional, dietary, lifestyle - e.g. Minimalist) even richer by purchasing their secrets to living, but you know the answer yourself so take action, picking support along the way.

This sub is now a place where people compare how much stuff they don't own.   ""I got rid of my car! I'm a minimalist!""  ""I live in an empty white room and have 1 pair of clothes! I'm the most minimalist!""  Minimalism is a tool used to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.  Life's excess doesn't necessarily mean material possessions. If reading doesn't make you happy that's fine. Just because you're not reading as much as you think a minimalist should doesn't make you less of one.  What you're doing is in fact the least minimalist thing possible. If you're not happy and not feeling fulfilled then you're not living minimally. You're making life way more complicated to fit in with a community who has an extremely narrow view of what constitutes minimalism.  What is minimalism"

minimalism,3chd9f,lxmunch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:26:18 2015 UTC,Good post. It is interesting to hear your story. I wouldn't beat yourself up at all because you started acquiring a few things. Honestly I think you took it too far anyway. You crossed over minimalism and went straight to deprivation. Minimalism is not about depriving yourself of things that serve a valuable purpose and bring joy to you. It is about removing the clutter so you have more time to focus on the things that bring joy and make you happy.  It seems like you are back on track as a minimalist. You have acquired back the items you deprived yourself off. I would focus on not acquiring back the clutter though. Also it sounds like you were doing a little searching for happiness at the same time and thought getting rid of it all would be the shortest path. Obviously that didn't work out as you intended and you mostly found yourself bored.  Instead of trying to start out so extreme maybe try to build a habit.  Do 30 mins of forced reading each day.  Soon you will build a habit.  We are creatures of habit so in most cases you have to build new habits slowly to get rid of the old habits.  Either way thanks for sharing and good luck.

I have gotten urges to do something similar but never have the guts to cut so much out. Especially since I have a family that would be affected by my choices.  You did sort of go extreme. I think things like netflix and cable internet are ok for minimalism because they give you access to loads of information and entertainment and take up no space. The problem is the addiction or habit of using them as a crutch to fill our time. If you want to read more just focus on that and don't worry about cutting things out.  Things will fall out as you fill your time reading...if that is ultimately what your goal is. Otherwise, just focus on reading 10 minutes a day and enjoy it to the point where you want to up it to 15 then 20, etc.  If you stick with it you'll be reading 1-2 hrs per day and might find you don't have time for netflix so it will then make sense to cancel but even then you'll still probably want to keep it for an occasional movie or episode."

What you did is pure shock doctrine meaning you drastically changed the conditions of your way of life but you didn't manage to change the life itself. That's when things either come back to old way or you rot in sorrow. My advice would be, if you change the conditions, you have to adapt to new ones. Great thing is if you find proper replacements for what you used to do, I don't know... instead of watching netflix, take two hours and go for a run or play basketball... It's going to be hard from the start, but it will get easier and in the end it can become joyful activity. And you have to have strong will, without it you are not gonna make it.

minimalism,3cf9p1,vairaagya,2,Fri Jul 10 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"That zen habits post is mostly just living frugally (or broke as it might be); remember there's a balance to be had. Try to stay out of debt. Save a little each month. And also remember that you can't take it with you when you're dead.  One part I really disagree with is the never going out part. It's important to me to go see shows, plays, live music, and movies, because I care about these things. I think they're important to our culture. Now that's not to say that every concert is worth going to, and it's important to me that I reflect on these experiences and see if I'm actually getting any joy, or appreciation, or new perspective from them.  I do have to ask whether I can afford things, but I've also found that there are a lot of opportunities to be a cheapskate. Libraries are an obvious option. Volunteering at nonprofits and doing favors for people (computer repair, concert photography), has got me lots of free entry into events and other things in return (mostly lots of beer and homemade food, which is just fine by me!).  I personally have been learning more and more to Marie Kondo's method of tidying up, not just the physical things in my life, but the things I spend my time doing. Asking ""Does this spark joy?"" is important. If it doesn't bring me joy then, I ask myself ""is it worth it?"" (going to work usually falls into this category), and lastly ""is it fairly quick and painless?"" (examples include paying bills and doing dishes). If it's none of those three, I'll probably resent whatever activity it is and I probably shouldn't spend my time doing it."
minimalism,3cf9p1,andr0medam31,11,Thu Jul 9 06:35:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a few things I did in my senior year of college and I am now two years into it and it feels great.   Cut down my wardrobe and took out all patterns and colors and only kept black, white, brown, grey, and blue clothes (along with their various shades) in solids. This really made my life easier when I pick what to wear every day.  Made sure I do not wear a t-shirt/underwear to sleep. Only pyjamas, shorts, or boxer shorts. This minimizes laundry.  Became a vegetarian. There were multiple reasons to why I did this. My personal philosophy (religious, ethical, moral) was making it obvious that I had to leave meat some day. And I did. Now I don't spend as much money on food, don't eat as much, and when I go to a restaurant I have limited options which saves me the headache of choosing from a hundred different items.  The most important things according to me is to remember that there is no right way to approach minimalism, everyone has their own personal ways. Another thing I feel is true is that minimalism is not the end, it is a means to an end.  Hope this helps."

I struggle with the impulse to consume information more than I do physical products.  I use a mantra: I want this but I don't need this, so I will let it go. This works for both physical and intellectual consumpion and to me is the essence of simple living. I say it to myself meditatively when the consumer (or hoarder) impulse hits. I recommend you come up with your own mantra (putting it i your own words will make it more meaningful to you -- it doesn't matter if it is has been said before, just so long as you thought of it, too) Practicing any sort of mantra will help to clear the clutter from your mind."

As far as making new purchases I read this article once and it said if you are thinking of buying something that you don't need (hobby stuff, new tv, camera, etc.) then you should wait one month and if you still want it or feel like you need it at the end of that month then you can get it. It sounds kind of weird or silly, but for me it has really worked. By the time a month has passed I'm usually like ""shew, I'm glad I didn't buy that thing, I don't really need it"""

No major epiphanies but being able to close the laptop or put the book or guitar down definitely helps with keeping to a schedule, even if it's just getting to bed at a decent hour.  I do a lot of creative stuff in my free time and one of my bad habits was that I'd get so involved with something in the evenings that I wouldn't even stop to eat until I was really hungry, then binge on junk rather than healthy food, which just perpetuates a negative cycle. I'm glad I'm past that although the monster is always lurking."
minimalism,3cf9p1,dGasim,18,Tue Jul 7 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna give you something I do to keep myself minimalist while being a software engineer.    Buy things that you can carry. For example, Instead of a desktop PC get a laptop (macbook preferred for it's minimalistic design, plus it's amazing for app development. That doesn't matter though) Don't stop things you like. If you like playing video games, play video games. Don't stop just to be minimalist. Just don't let it consume your life.  Keep things simple. I mean your lifestyle, your life, and your Intellect. For lifestyle, have a simple routine. E.g workout 3 times a week, play video games on weekends online. Sometimes break the routine, go parachute or something but always have a base. When it comes to your life, just live it. I really like the lyrics from Avicii - The Nights: ""one day we'll leave this world behind, so live a life you will Remember."" Intellect is a tricky business. I am going to say it even though I cant control this. Stop thinking sometimes if you have this problem. I don't know how and if anyone does know it, please inform me.  Stay healthy, stay calm, stay clean. Workout, meditate, dress with style. Always look good. Eat healthy. This will keep your mind positive.  Minimalism doesnt mean poor. If you want and can afford expensive shoes, get it.  Do not get addicted to anything.  Overall, basically make everything just elements that doesn't affect your life. You affect your life, with those elements. Everything is just a tool. Nothing more, nothing less. Just build you life using the necessary tools to keep you happy."

minimalism,3cf9p1,doneitallbutthat,6,Wed Jul 8 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"I have 3 pairs of pants, 3 pairs of shoes, 3 shirts, and 3 suits. But I spend way too much money on them because I buy everything ""premium"" brand.   When it comes to actual style, I declared 3 parts to my style - body, cover, accessories.   Body is the shirt and sometimes can be pants.    Cover is suits, pants, shoes.   Accessories are just accessories - earbuds, watches, bracelets, necklaces (i personally don't wear them), phone cases etc.   Generally each part uses one color. Sometimes, if it looks amazing, you can have 2 for some parts but try to keep it to one.   Here are some examples:  Black suit, black pants, white shirt, black shoes, red earbuds. You can also wear a watch while leather band but it is optional.   Blue jeans, purple shirt, blue suede drivers, a sports watch with maroon bands.   Cyan shirt, brown pants, blue or brown drivers. Accessories is optional. This style is specific to summer.   In the last one I am kind of breaking my own rules but for me style is art. I started it as science and built my own rules and now I look at it as art and break those rules if I need to. The whole idea is to have everything separated and wear things that are not patterned crazy.   Also when it comes to actual fashion itself, you can always wear things cheap. You really need to go look into it. I generally like to separate the Budget based on the mall :P Macy’s, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus. For me Nordstrom generally is affordable because I shop very rarely. But I used to shop at Macy’s and it is still decent. The selection there is much larger than in Nordstrom. Also check out Gilt.com. They have insane deals sometimes. I have once gotten $500 shirt for 60 bucks. Also check out subs /r/malefashionadvice and /r/frugalmalefashion. There are lots of good ideas and deals.   One last word about fashion and minimalism that is very important. Have the type of wardrobe where you don't need to think what you want to wear or what pants to wear with what shoes etc. Keep it simple. Have one sporty outfit, one semi formal, and one seasonal. And for some occasions, have one formal outfit. But again and improvise and see what you like the most."

""Try to live as close to your same lifestyle as you do now and avoid debt.  Aggressively pay off any debt you have then invest in retirement with any excess money each month"".    As soon as I got a real job and started making more money, I spent more. I went into debt. My coworkers, and most of society, were all financing new cars, buying the latest gadgets, buying bigger than needed housing, buying lunch every day, buying $5 coffees daily, and so on.  I thought that was what I needed to do.  Hence I wasted some of the best investment years of my life making my net worth way less than zero dollars. I was actually poorer than when I was in college and I was a slave to my paycheck. That lifestyle was ensuring that I would need to work until age 70 to retire.  The truth is even if you just make the medium income for your region you don't need to work 40 years to retire as long as you live modestly. Check out mrmoneymustache.  He is a bit extreme and made way more money than most in his work days but even a modified version of his philosophy will get you fast tracked to retirement. Being you are a graduate my guess is you are in your early 20s.  Imagine that with a little hustle you could be financially independent sometime in your 30s.  You don't need to retire by 40 but you can switch to working part time on things you enjoy instead of slaving away in a cubicle.   There are so many paths you can take but becoming a slave to your paycheck just so you can hit up the local mall each weekend or buy a new cell phone once a year is not as rewarding as chilling in your 40s while everybody sits in traffic and still has 20-30 more years of the grind.

In the spirit of living simply, think about whether you'd be needing to read any more books in order to become a minimalist.  So, what is it that you're missing in your journey to living a minimalistic lifestyle? Are you having a hard time following Marie Kondo's guide? Is there a specific area that you struggle with decluttering the most? Do you feel overwhelmed with the process? Most likely, you'll be able to find plenty of resources online through the many minimalistic blogs and communities out there ;)"

If there is a book I can recommend, it would be ""The Compound Effect."" It helps you step back and re-asses everything in your life so that you can better strategize your goals. Whether it's relationships, career, money, lifestyle, etc. It's a good starting point.  Once you have recognized the areas in your life that you needed to ""declutter"" the most, you can easily see the next steps that you need to take so you can be happier.

minimalism,3c82wl,kuvter,3,Mon Jul 6 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in 2011 I got an Asus G73sw for $1,100.   Specs: 17.3"" 16:9 HD+ (1600x900), Intel Core™ i7 2630QM, Win7 home, 8GB ram, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460M 1.5GB GDDR5 VRAM, 750GB 7200rpm HardDrive, Super-Multi DVD.   I mostly play Steam games bought on sale. Everything has been able to run on High settings at decent FPS. I use it for graphic design using GIMP. Screen is big enough to watch movies with 4 people on a couch. Works fine for movie date nights. I also got a Chrome Bag - Metropolitan to carry it, since it's a beast.    Edit: Ram and Graphics card are the most important when looking for a laptop. Everything else will likely be what you need if the Ram and Graphics card are gaming worthy."
minimalism,3c82wl,mercurybeatingheart,3,Mon Jul 6 00:48:37 2015 UTC,"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460M    Huh, I'm impressed that you're able to run on High settings with this! I've been skeptical of buing even the 700 series, but it might just work after all... I'm picky about cores, though, and will want the newest generation i7. I use Gimp too (and will probably have to subscribe to the Adobe package for work soon, althouhg I dread the day). I've no problems with Gimp on my late 2013 Macbook Air (i7, 8GB RAM), but running games? Not a chance in hell. Got it mostly for the keyboard, but considering going back to Lenovo – awating some gaming oriented laptops from them with SSD in the near future, unless I decide to just change it myself. (I absolutely love Lenovo and had the X1 Carbon for the keyboard (a bit different than the usual Lenovo suspects), but when I borrowed an Air I realized it had a much better keyboard, so I reluctantly bought one. I've found the Asus keyboards I've tried too flat/low and too far apart (tiny hands), so I'm pleased with my Air in that regard.)  But I can't play games such as FEZ on it, which I love so I'm looking for an all-round laptop to avoid adding to the clutter of consoles we already have in my household (SNES, Wii, Xbox 360 that sometimes works, PS1 and PS2). Although I must admit that I am considering an Xbox one, but then again, I'm a sucker for FPS's and was born, raised and fed on WASD on Doom, Duke Nuken 3D and Castle Wolfenstein, and I can't snipe for the life of me on Xbox.  Wow, this turned into quite the rant. Not exactly a minimalistic comment...  (Edited for formatting.) Edit 2: And of course, thanks for your reply and kind advice! :) ... Edit 3: Fan noise is also a huge issue for me when it comes to laptops, hence me considering the Xbox one – even if it means no proper sniping. I'll sacrifice almost anything to escape fan noise..."

I've been playing Grim Dawn, used to play Firefall, Bastion, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Borderlands 2, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Skyrim, Killing Floor, RPGs and other less graphically intense games. So take that High setting comment lightly. I'm a casual gamer that binge plays from time to time.  The fan makes some noise now, but were pretty quiet when I bought it. I really should used some compressed air and clean out the fans, or consider replacing them.   I used to play FPS, hundreds of hours of Counter Strike 1.6. But that was back in the day. I rarely play competitive FPS anymore, but co-op or single player ones like Borderlands, Firefall and Killing Floor were fun when I played them.   Playing FPS on the Xbox 360 is not fun. It took me two days to get used to the controller, learn the maps of  Halo Reach then start beating my friends, who thought they were good. I still didn't like the feel or sensitivity of the controller, give me a keyboard and mouse any day!"
minimalism,3c82wl,glmn,2,Mon Jul 6 02:56:17 2015 UTC,Cool! I'm a GIMP and Steam person too. I just play Dota2 and all my graphic experiments is done on GIMP and Inkscape.

minimalism,3c82wl,khattify,7,Mon Jul 6 12:57:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just recently gave up my smartphone because it brought about too many problems. First was money, in it costing me $120/month for 2GB and unlimited text and talk. My girlfriend is considering downgrading from a smartphone and was asking me why I did it.  First, yes, it's super convenient to have a GPS, audio player, phone, camera and internet access in one device. But here's where I suggest having them separate:  I downgraded to a simple dumb-phone about 2 months ago. The first perk is that if I leave my phone alone with full charge, it has a 261 hour standbye time. It still has the alarm function and all the simple tools most starter phone have. It's nice not having autocorrect, actually touching buttons to type, it doesn't light my pocket on fire from CPU usage, and it's less likely to get stolen. The phone was free with a $5/month 2-year contract.  Using the first $100 I saved from that month, I bought a really nice Garmin GPS that is by far 200% more accurate than my Galaxy's GPS capabilities. It stays in my car, where I need it, so It's always there, even if I forget my phone.  With the second $100 I saved, I bought a nice MP3 player that had over all better quality than the Galaxy. It's super easy to browse and has better compression/EQ quality. It can last for an entire day on one charge, and in changing music I never feel inclined to go on Facebook or randomly google something.  With the third $100 I bought a nice point-and-shoot camera with the same quality as my phone, and it has more usability than most free camera apps. I'm less likely to try to take pictures of a moment than to actually live in the moment, and I tend to enjoy life more.  As far as internet, if I think about something I want to google, I jot it down on a small notepad and if it's still relevant later, I look it up. It's faster on my computer, it's part of what I'm probably already doing, and I forget about it while it's not the immediate task.  Of course, it's more items in the long run, but it separates a lot of distractions, puts you more in the moment, and gives you better quality of each feature. I can't tell you how upsetting it was eating at a little pancake house with 10 friends on the 4th of July and having 8 of them on social media and being completely disconnected for the entirety of dinner.

minimalism,3c82wl,AcidDrinker,3,Mon Jul 6 15:27:01 2015 UTC,"After reading through this, half of these things aren't really a problem for me with a smartphone. Things like buttons (BlackBerry, yeah!), battery life, doesn't run hot; but I guess there are just down to choice of phone. I never saw the point in taking pictures of every moment that happens, just enjoy it! Which means my camera gets used for taking pictures of my work schedule (for easy access and one less piece of paper) and the rare selfie. Besides, if other people are taking the pictures, I don't have to, right? :p  I can't say I need a GPS either, but the music player is definitely important! But barring the iPod Classic, I couldn't really find many to house my collection, whereas my phone with a 64GB microsd card works wonders and can always upgrade to a larger size!  I can completely see where you're coming from and it's something that would be very blissful, but for me, it's more about sorting out what I do when I'm home and doing what actually matters to me with as little distraction as possible.

minimalism,3c82wl,paddedroom,2,Sun Jul 5 22:49:43 2015 UTC,What sort of work do you do and how well do you feel it integrates with that?  What's the social media side like?  Can you usefully use time consuming apps like Kindle or games?  How did you find the transition from Android to BlackBerry OS? Is it as intuitive?
minimalism,3c82wl,4boltmain,4,Sun Jul 5 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm working In retail at the moment, so I don't use it for work. But, since they're designed for business professionals, I'd imagine they're good!  Social media works well, all notifications, messages etc. get integrated into the Hub, which is a huge time saver and means you don't have to open the apps unless you fancy scrolling the feeds.   Yes, but some apps might not work if they need to be sideloaded. For example, there's a struggle going on with Snapchat, since the developers are refusing to support BlackBerry and are banning users that use third party apps for it. But there's an alternative In Casper.io which seems to work fine. The BlackBerry store and Amazon appstore come native with 10.3, so getting a lot of apps isn't a problem and most other apps work fine by just downloading the apk file for them.  I can't say I had much difficulty with Android, but I hated typing on a touchscreen, after a good 2 years, I still couldn't seem to type well with it. So when my Xperia Z1 broke out of warranty and was gonna cost a lot to fix, picking up a cheap BlackBerry was a no-brainer. I wasn't particularly app heavy, so I knew that wouldn't be a problem. The swipe gestures are brilliant too. Swipe left for hub, right for app menu, up to minimise an app and go to home screen, down for app settings etc. There's also setting up keyboard shortcuts, like setting the T key to open twitter etc. which come in useful! The OS itself is rather low maintenance and doesn't use a lot of processing power, unlike Android; and all updates will run on any BB10 phone without so much as a slowdown.  But I've probably rambled enough for now. :p"

Luckily I have a WiFi printer so printing stuff wasn't really an issue. Since I use my phone all day I charge my phone about 3-4 times a day. What sucked the most was making power points on my phone, I had to make a few power points for my classes and working on them on the phone just sucks. The apps for making power points are just not optimized for phones. Other than that giving up full web pages and a bigger screen, it wasn't that hard. It made my life easier. Especially with summer I go out a ton more and spend less time in front of computer. I do more things that I said I would do. I definitely learned the value of a smartphone through this experience and just how much one can actually get done on a phone these days is incredible.

minimalism,3c5n6k,lifesodandy,12,Sun Jul 5 08:16:39 2015 UTC,"I list everything I own and what I intend to own in the future. Making lists keeps me frugal, thankful, and organized all at once, and unless I don't find joy or use in them anymore, I probably won't stop.  Usually I'll start with a broad category (fashion, home decor, technology, etc.,) and create a document based on that. Then I'll list the names of things with links to where I can find them online, ordering them by brand name and sub-category. To save our time, this image is what a small portion of one of my lists would look like.  I understand many people don't like keeping strict lists like I do, but I've never felt like doing this causes anxiety or is a waste of time. Nothing excites me more than an organized present and a well-planned future, so making lists is a pleasure for me. Cheers."

minimalism,3c5n6k,blackmirrorlight,3,Sun Jul 5 08:19:24 2015 UTC,Yes! What I do is think of all the items could possibly need to own and then make sure I purge the things that aren't on the list and it also keeps me from buying things I don't need.
minimalism,3c5n6k,pinkdildos,3,Sun Jul 5 08:15:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a college student trying to minimalize. In high school, I really wanted to make that list and never did, but I am now because I'm directly benefiting from making a list of all the things I own/have. I both use it to get a good sense of the amount of stuff I have, as well as just know what I have, and then eliminate what I don't need. It's almost easier to be more objective about decluttering.  My categories involve: clothing (broken up into subsections like tops and bottoms, etc.), kitchen (so my coffee maker, silverware, etc.), home goods (bedsheets, towels). I live in a furnished student apartment so I don't have categories like furniture and stuff. The couple of lamps I own I just put under home goods."
minimalism,3c5n6k,mauranaut,3,Sun Jul 5 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"Just for fun I counted what I owned. I categorized it into Clothes, Tools, Kitchen, Furniture, Electronics, Entertainment and Misc (toiletries, nostalgia box, safe).   For simplicity I mostly itemized larger items - all clothing, all kitchen items. But didn't itemize smaller items - every single nostalgia trinket (1 box), guitar picks (1 item), or attachments for the electric hair clippers (1 kit).   It helps me to see at a glance everything I own. Every so often I look at the list and see if there is anything I'm not using. I also categorize them based on my top 5 priorities and make sure every item I own matches a priority.   BTW it's 184 items and everything I own fits in my car."
minimalism,3c5n6k,kuvter,3,Mon Jul 6 00:10:46 2015 UTC,"For me, I list what I own regularly.  I like to play the game of remembering what is in my possession - if I don't remember it, that usually means I either A: have too much (for myself) or B: don't really love the item.  I have very little already, but it helps to keep what I have pared down so that I don't acquire any junk."

If I get something I feel I absolutely need, I add it to the list, and if something becomes obsolete, or would no longer fit because of new additions, I delete it. It doesn't necessarily mean I dispose of it right away, just that if I have to move again, I'll leave that behind.

I would separate things into categories in an excel sheet. Clothes, electronics, disposable stuff (Tide, etc). If I suspected I didn't need something, I would gray it out the cell on the list. I would put that item away for a month, and if I didn't touch it, it was gone. No questions, no qualms.  Eventually, I added in a couple sum equations to add up the items in each category and then total, just for my own curiosity.  I stopped keeping it up eventually. I'm good with what I have now."

You're right, a few years ago we didn't have self righteous mods unilaterally shutting down entire subreddits to ""send a message"". It has gotten worse.

With all due respect, if you don't like the way I'm running ship, you can go elsewhere. I know this issue doesnt directly affect /r/minimalism, but we're all in the same boat; I think a day without the sub is small enough payment for sending a message that we aren't happy with the way things are being run by the higher ups."

Most users either don't care about or aren't even aware of these issues. Shutting down the subreddit just inconveniences the community you are supposed to be supporting and improving.   You've got valid complaints, but this blackout has done more harm to reddit than poor admin communication or the loss of Victoria ever could have. Outside of /r/IAmA, it was a disproportionate response and it was selfish of all these mods to drag their communities into this argument.  So yeah call yourself ""owner"" if you like. But realize that you do not speak for everyone in this subreddit. Just skimming through this thread you should be able to tell that many users in this subreddit do not stand by or approve of your actions."

How else are we (the mods) supposed to make our point? We can't support and improve a community without good communication from the people that actually host and run the site.  It honestly kinda' sucks that there's so much backlash here. I'd have thought there'd be more support for us mods, given the hundreds of hours of work we've put into the site."

minimalism,3bvtzq,custardextract,187,Thu Jul 2 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"Just my opinions here, so feel free to disagree with me.  I understand your point, but I think that you have made a bit of a strawman out of minimalism.  The people on this sub, and indeed in real life, who adhere to a minimalist lifestyle have a tremendous diversity.  Some are extremists, others are quite modest in their reductions, yet all share the viewpoint that a simplified and less cluttered existence is in some way beneficial. To say much beyond this is beginning to make assumptions on the person or the philosophy. Sure, some minimalists are running away from uncomfortable emotions through constant distraction.  So are some Buddhists, drug addicts,  musicians, office workers, and essentially any categorization you can make on people. In this regard, a person who wishes to escape from emotions may choose any avenue they wish, and that obsessive behaviour (in my opinion) may reflect more on the person than it does on their chosen avenue of distraction.   I don't say this to invalidate your point entirely, because it does have merit.  I don't comment here very often, but I have seen some people treat minimalism as some mix of a fashion statement, an ego booster, and a goal to be accomplished.  Again, you can draw this back to the person rather than the philosophy.  Someone who treats minimalism as a stylish, trendy thing, and tweets about their progress constantly while nonstop declaring their newfound nirvana to the world is quite different from a humble person who makes the journey inside themselves.  Is there a morally superior route?  There might be, but each person approaches their life in a different way.  Everyone has issues that they have to deal with, and we each do the best that we can.  Happiness isn't a concept that we can define for someone else; our version of ""extreme"" may be someone else's moderate, cut back. There again, our modest may be another's obnoxious. It's hard to judge someone without being inside their head.   I apologize for going a bit off topic, but to address your main points: extremists tend to be extreme people, people can't be grouped under one label so easily, and every person approaches life from a different standpoint.  Thanks for an interesting viewpoint."

I wish more people would apply this understanding to any point of view, philosophy, creed, etc.   Anything taken to an extreme is, by definition, exclusive, and exclusivity creates false hegemonies.

There are people on this sub who live out of backpacks, simply because they find the freedom to travel freely rewarding.  For me, that would be stressful and would deprive me of some possessions that add real value to my life.  On the other hand, I value minimalism in design.  I don't deal well with distraction, so clean aesthetics matter to me on a practical level, not just a trendy one.  These are two people living different approaches to minimalism, for different reasons.  One of the us wants white walls, one wants no walls.  Neither of us would be satisfied with adopting the other person's practice of minimalism.  Our shared belief is simply that reducing the unnecessary is a goal worth being conscious of.  Beyond that, everything is personal."

I never got the 'hurr dis ain't truu minimalism durr'-salt a lot of this sub has become. Just be happy, yo. Agree to disagree. Minimalism ain't a race. It's not a belief.

minimalism,3bvtzq,JakeChip,22,Tue Jul 7 05:18:05 2015 UTC,"It can become an obsession definitely. It doesn't HAVE to be though. I naturally don't want many things because the more things I own the more chaotic I feel. I have Aspergers and am very sensitive to sensory information. For me, everything I own is in some massive list of stuff in my brain that I feel as a pressure to manage it. For example, chipped bowls need replacing, curtains need taking up, technology may eventually break and need replacing, seeing lots of objects in a room is chaotic and stressful rather than a restful, calm, object free space. So each object I bring in becomes something on this imaginary to do list. The less I have, the easier I find life!   On the other hand, I am prone to obsession and perfectionism. Minimalism offers a sort of perfection and simplicity that's very attractive. Luckily I had therapy to overcome perfectionism so if I ever find myself spending too much time thinking about getting rid of things, which is very rare, I have strategies for just getting over that and putting my attention on something more important.  If minimalism comes to define you and your way of life or a crazy challenge, you've probably lost sight of more important and interesting things you could do with your one chance of life. If you practice a degree of minimalism that enhances your happiness and ability to relax and enjoy life, then that's ok. I personally think I could be quite a lot more minimalist than I am and without doing it obsessively I think it would actually make me more happy and relaxed. For example, I'd love to get rid of all social media accounts, but because of my work, I can't!"

minimalism,3bvtzq,JakeChip,14,Tue Jul 7 05:18:52 2015 UTC,"I know that my minimalism stems from my abuse as a child. My mother would either throw things of mine away, take them for herself, or be little me for my choices in what I purchased.  It became the only way to make sure I had only want I really needed, and kept her at bay from stealing my stuff. Less stuff, less to steal. This doesn't just mean the quantity of stuff but also the quality. I constantly thrift because my mom thinks it's gross and won't take something second hand.   I was always told I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth, but I pretty much started making my own money at 15. So I guess in not getting nice stuff, and not having a lot of it helped build my case against being entitled and selfish. Though I am no longer in contact with her, the wounds are still there.  I will give most things away to those who show interest because if I have a emotional connection I could get hurt. I've had things that I cherished thrown away, belittled, or destroyed so often in the past that I try to create a barrier against feeling anything for material objects so it doesn't happen again in the future.  It is a compulsion? Yes, very much so. It comes from a life long fear of losing things I care about or having them thrown away. Along with anxiety, OCD, and childhood abuse, I find comfort now in having only what I need and nothing more. The less I have, the less that can be used against me?  I see it now as being efficient and not have too much clutter but I still need to learn that I deserve nice things, and that I am worth things that are quality. Though I thrift now because I tend to ruin all clothes from my inability to eat without getting stuff all over the place."

I've since become a bit of a hoarder, too, I guess out of a need to protect the few useful things I have.  I no longer purge stuff on a regular basis.  I long to go back to the days of having only what I need.  I want to get rid of half the furniture so I can dance in the living room.  I want to park in the garage when it's snowy.

minimalism,3bvtzq,bkedelen,2,Fri Jul 3 03:24:28 2015 UTC,"I think you have some valid points but my interpretation of what you are talking about is the extreme end of minimalism.  In fact I think the extreme end is more appropriately call ""deprivation"" rather than minimalism.  Minimalism as a whole is not about having only one suitcase full of possessions or only 100 items.  Sure some take it to that extreme but even those people may still feel fulfilled and have everything they need to be happy. Minimalism is about removing the items that serve no purpose and bring no enjoyment or rather the removing the ""clutter"" from our lives. By doing this we have less distractions and can focus on the things that are important to us. The amount of items, relationships, or experiences we deem important is going to be unique to each individual.   For example a family of 4 may view a couch, a TV, a desk, and a laptop as essential items. A single college kid in a studio apartment may see that couch and TV as useless items since they have a computer and a desk to consume their media entertainment.  Neither side is wrong. Most importantly neither side feels deprived.  This forum is a place for me and I assume many others to speak with like minded people that we probably won't find out in the wild. We have conversations here that we would not have elsewhere because frankly we can't talk to many minimalist throughout our day.  We may seem more extreme or boastful in our postings here but my guess is most of us don't bring up these topics in casual conversation. This is our outlet since most people in the wild don't really get this lifestyle choice. I never judge or lecture people because I hate when people do that to me.    By the way, I got a chuckle out of your example of the person that brags about not watching TV.  Out of nowhere a coworker came to my desk at work today bragging about how he hasn't turned on his TV in 4 months.  Dude, did you seriously just walk over to my cubicle to tell me you don't use your TV? Uh, ok thanks for sharing bro."

But don't come in here and try to objectively claim it is harmful.
minimalism,3bvtzq,sunsetdive,2,Fri Jul 3 02:38:29 2015 UTC,"I've found that the most happiness and purpose in life comes from giving (helping others).   If you're focused on your stuff and acquiring (taking) then you're not focused on giving, and happiness will be fleeting. If you get rid of most of your stuff then you have more time, energy, money to focus on what's important, such as giving.  I left corporate America and the corporate ladder because there's no true happiness in it. There is only rising up, buying new things, showing off, and the temporary fleeting happiness that comes from it. As it wears off then you seek the next rung or purchase to continue the cycle.   If you get rid of your stuff, to live simply and minimally, then you have more time to focus on your inner self, because you're not distracted by stuff. It's one way to focus on the bigger picture instead of the minutia of life.  TL;DR Some ideas found in minimalism lead to a happier more purposeful life."
minimalism,3bvtzq,andr0medam31,2,Fri Jul 3 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"For me, minimalism isn't about removing things, but about finding the essence. Only using as much as you have to, for the essence to be there (in art, literature, music). For me, this is a fullness, not an emptiness, because you are getting rid of excess to let the essence shine.  Minimalism which results in spartan asceticism doesn't interest me so much. In fact, I think that a lot of modern minimalism misses the point. It's just empty, especially architecture. Why do people want to live in perfect boxes? Come on.   I much prefer the elegant aesthetic of secessionist architecture. Those buildings aren't necessarily minimalism, but there are elements that are similar. Accentuating a flowery detail by leaving the majority of the building sparse, for instance. Sparse but tasteful details that fit together in harmony.  To me it seems that the decluttering is another kind of ideology - we are better because we do not hoard. I dislike that aspect. Decluttering is useful in order to make a good flow of living, but here it's meant in a more extreme sense.   Things cannot make us happy, true. But we can use things to help us express our happiness. They can be an extension of ourselves through which we create more joy."

Shit, I haven't had a TV for years.  Maybe you shouldn't think of your friend as representative of ""minimalists.""  Your friend is just your friend, no one else, and doesn't represent any type of lifestyle.    avoid confronting uncomfortable emotions through constant distraction.   The point of minimalism is to give yourself space where you can relax and be you, to think and meditate and do hobbies, instead of wading through stuff and fussing over stuff and caring about stuff.  Minimalism takes LESS time and effort than being materialistic--that's the point.  You don't spend time working for money to spend time and money while shopping to spend time lugging stuff home to spend time organizing it in vain as it pops out of every corner and time cleaning it and dusting it and trying to use it and all that shit.  Minimalism isn't distraction, it's freedom from distraction.    I have what I need, and I have the space to do what I like.  My huge empty swath of floor in my room is where I do yoga. It's the pruning away of things that distract you from what you want.  You can't do yoga in a room flooded with stuff, with stuff all over the floor and up the walls and scattered all four ways about.    he was simply reallocating his focus to some new place to avoid confronting his internal self.    Minimalism is about clearing out room so you can be yourself and know yourself.  Pretty much the exact opposite of what you said.  Like, someone has a shitty life, so they go do shopping therapy every weekend, and come home to a messy house full of shit and a pile of credit card bills, and it is agitating and stressful and makes it worse.

I've never tossed out an object and then felt like I was a better person for it. If anything, I feel wasteful and wish I had never gotten the object to begin with. I also feel less burdened, so it balances out.  The only negative effect of minimalism is the social fallout; i.e. other people being weirded out because you don't have a massive pile of shit neatly organized in your home. It may sound snide, but this is a problem with other people, not the minimalist. Much of what is considered ""normal"" is ridiculous, and even moreso that people will ostracize others for not adhering to their definition of normality. (side note: I actually consider the social fallout a benefit, but I understand that the majority of people enjoy spending time with other humans).  Of course, if we're talking extreme minimalism, then a lot more negatives begin to crop up. These are the people who own so little that they depend on everyone around them to provide even the basic necessities, and constantly ask to borrow things. It can also take the form of people who flip-flop on their definition of minimal, so they keep getting rid of things and then realizing they need them back. I've been guilty of the latter, during the initial phases of testing my boundaries.  I don't think many minimalists would gloat about not owning a television. If you don't own one, and you tell somebody about it, you will be offered a free television by everyone who hears about it, and none of them will understand the concept that you intentionally and actively do not want a television.  I suspect that if you encounter a minimalist who talks excitedly about their life choice, it's just exactly that - they're excited. It's a great source of entertainment because it flies in the face of their entire life prior. From the vantage point of an avid consumer, embarking on minimalism is an adventure."
minimalism,3bxgz7,faithtrustpixie_dust,6,Thu Jul 2 23:26:30 2015 UTC,"I learned the concept of Minimalism in July 2014. I decided to act after couple of weeks. I had been getting rid of things until some months ago. I have slowed down. There haven't been left much to get rid of.  I had some personal troubles too. And, getting rid of emotional stuff, like yearbooks, was fast. I wanted to get rid of anything that weighs me emotionally or physically. The whole process was 9 months or so, its like a child birth.   I'm single and currently I live with my family. I've decluttered my own room and generally the whole house. They weren't happy with me giving away some things at first but as I proceeded, they told me to do the same thing I did with my room to other rooms. I told them I can't touch anybody's bedroom. :)  Congratulate yourself, you have succeeded a very difficult thing; cleaning and decluttering with two kids. Well done!  Edit: Grammar."

If you have a huge selection of clothing and you feel it is mentally fatiguing you to pick out an outfit everyday, or if you feel washing the clothes is taking up too much time, reduce the amount of clothes you have until you feel you have hit a balance that allows you the freedom you're seeking."
minimalism,3bwibh,twhitter,8,Thu Jul 2 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"This talk on the ""10 Item Wardrobe"" is a great if you haven't seen it already. Basically, start by figuring out what your style actually is, then build your new wardrobe from a small but versatile foundation of pieces that you'll wear often. It's sort of the reverse of what you're doing now: you'd be choosing what to keep rather than what to discard.  My most recent overhaul left me with a few tops, dresses, and maybe one or two pairs of trousers/denim from COS and Everlane. Both stores make basic pieces that are still interesting and high-quality (though not exactly the cheapest stuff out there).  Hope that helped!"
minimalism,3bwibh,fiberglassoceans,5,Thu Jul 2 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"There's a French author, Dominique Loreau, who wrote a book on minimalism that recommended 7 of each item. Seven pairs of pants, seven sweaters, etc. This is a good start, but your personal number may vary. For example, I have 5 pairs of pants, and that works really well for me in a climate that has four distinct seasons. I have 10 t-shirts, though.   If I had your closet, and assuming all of your t-shirts are one type (long sleeved, for example), I might go with three of each item, except maybe 5 t-shirts. Also factor in whether you wash ever item after wearing - then you might need seven.  You could always try putting some items away for a month or so and see if you miss them.  Good luck!"
minimalism,3bwibh,binary,5,Fri Jul 3 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"I just play a game ranking clothing into piles of ""yes"" ""maybe"" and ""no"" every so often when I think my closet is getting cluttered  Clothes I know I haven't worn in a long time go in ""no""; clothes I like a lot and wear frequently go in ""yes"" -- everything else goes in ""maybe""  I then aim to put half the maybes into ""yes"" and half into ""no""--I donate the ""no"" pile.  For my thinking, the key is to not get hung up on liking the clothes. I want my wardrobe to consist of my favorite things to wear, so I get rid of for example band tees I like but don't wear too often, more experimental clothing that I can't wear effectively, etc. I end up donating a fair amount of clothes I could see myself wearing, but in the end the clothes I keep are those that I really like"

Take note of how often you wear each group of clothing and work out from there how many you would need, keeping in mind that those patterns might change with seasons."
minimalism,3bwibh,charlesyj7,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:28:14 2015 UTC,"If you get stuck on thinking about the number of things you should have, minimalism doesn't serve you any purpose. The idea behind minimalism is not to own very few things, it's to live with what is essential. So, my advice would be this: pack all the clothes you have. And then unpack only when you need them. So, instead of having the clothes on your wardrobe, have them in a luggage. Then, by taking one by one, you realize what clothes are essential to you and what aren't. This is the principle behind minimalism. It's not about number, it's about necessity. It's about getting rid of everything that is accessory/extra so you can focus on what is essential on your life: your goals, your connections, etc..."
minimalism,3bwibh,vickinga,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"5 of each is a good start. You'll have a 20-25 piece wardrobe: 5 tshirts, 5 hoodies, 5 jeans/shorts, then get other 5-10 pieces that you can use to dress up a bit just in case.  Depends on climate and activities (do you need uniforms or gym clothes?), and how often can you do laundy, so you might need more.  Also, keep in mind that very casual clothing is not as versatile, so you'll need more pieces."

The worksheets are useful, and I used her idea to create a pinterest board to create a uniform for the seasons. Your taste will change as you grow up, so play around with your wardrobe.

And again it also depends on how well the person can read the watch. I know some people who can read those numberless watches just fine but I look at one and think ""Fuck it, it's like, noonish."""

Also Ive hit it a couple of times hard and it seems the screen gets off a bit and the light gets dim a bit, though you just put your finger with little pressure and its okay, after another accidental hit its back to normal also. Although thw biggest con about it is that in the sunlight in day time is really hard to see the numbers. Thats the most annoying aspect. I work in a theater and also spend alot of time inside and it works fairly well for under 1$ clock. Wont feel pitty when it stops working :)"

minimalism,3bxvoy,nothingfinal,6,Fri Jul 3 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think that these are really at odds with one another at all. Do you think that there is something inherently anti-minimalist about the act of setting and achieving professionally focused goals?   I think that minimalism is a process that allows us to declutter our lives of the unimportant things that distract us from our true aspirations. If you aspire to achieve difficult professional goals, decluttering your life of other commitments and living simply can be one way to reach that sense of personal fulfillment by allowing you to focus on work. If your professional ambitions are not a priority, maybe minimalism means that you scale down on the time that you invest into your work and find a better work/life balance.   I think that it's just a case of different people having different priorities, not that minimalism and professional attainments are mutually exclusive categories."

I agree with this 100%. The issue with it in the area I live is that your profession is how most everybody defines themselves. Where I live, when you meet someone new the first thing they ask is ""what do you do?"" and then they put you in a box based on your answer. I've tried answering with things like ""oooo. I love to hike, I'm reading an really interesting book right now, I've tried some new recipe..."" and the response is usually ""No, I mean what do you do for work?"" At least where I live if your work isn't your priority then people think you're a failure.  Mind you, this has nothing to do with the original question. I'm just saying that I love what you said and wish it was easier to implement without looking like a fuck-up. Where I work ""work/life balance"" = ""you must be lazy."" My boss, who's on his third wife, likes to give tips on how to make your wife think you're paying attention to her while your actually getting in some work at home.

minimalism,3bxvoy,Paranoid-Penguin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:25:18 2015 UTC,"I find myself to be ambitious and have just recently moved into a marketing role with high visibility, high responsibility. I'm always pushing myself to be better. In doing this, I'm finding the more clutter I shed, the more I can focus. The workplace I'm at now is completely mobile, no fixed desks. It's forced me to abandon the last 7 or so years of managing a desk with all it's bits and pieces.  Then I'm trying to make what I carry with me as little and light as possible. I'm even changing things down to my wallet and what keys are on my chain. This carries over to home as well, where I am releasing myself of the weight of accumulated stuff over the years.  Ultimately this has allowed me to worry less about managing so many things and to focus more on my home life, my work and career as well as the things that make me happy. This doesn't mean I sit in an empty room and refuse to work or aim to be successful, it just allows me more freedom to focus on the things that are important to me."

If your parents ask where certain things went tell them that they did not fit in your new place. Add that you hope that they will bring someone else joy at the thrift store you brought them too. I imagine the last part would make your mom happy.  In the Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up, the author strongly cautions against throwing things out in front of family members. Many times your family will feel like they need to keep the items."
minimalism,3bta8p,Technicolor-Panda,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:20:55 2015 UTC,"Just want to second this post. My brother moved out years ago, and all his shit is still in his room just as he left it. Given he does come home every once in a while, but that's like one or two nights a year. And throwing away stuff like that definitely stresses our mom out.   Even if you didn't buy the item or you don't use it/want it, I still think it's your responsibility to part with it. Don't put that burden on someone else, especially if that person got you the item."
minimalism,3bta8p,ghostlyinthesky,11,Thu Jul 9 08:21:34 2015 UTC,"I am going through a similar situation myself but my parents are okay with me getting rid of stuff. I told them that I'm going to be moving in increments. When I initially move I'll take the essentials, bed, dresser, clothes, etc. Then, every time I go and visit them I'll take a box or two of things and get rid of it (most of the time to a secondhand store). It helps that I'm not moving very far away."
minimalism,3bta8p,lifesodandy,7,Thu Jul 2 00:59:56 2015 UTC,I'm actually moving out also (in August) and my mom was not so happy when I decluttered my room. She especially lost it when I tossed sentimental items from my childhood. We compromised by filling a shoebox full of these keepsakes. I'm leaving this shoebox at home because it's really more for her own sanity than mine.
minimalism,3bta8p,ReddRabbits,7,Thu Jul 2 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"It's kind of you to be sensitive towards your parents' feelings (it sounds like you care about theirs more than they care about yours in this case), but you're not their pet. Get rid of what you like and live your own life. Show your mom the text of this post. Whats the worst that can happen, they ask you to move out?"
minimalism,3bta8p,ban_anna94,7,Thu Jul 2 04:35:42 2015 UTC,"I've learned that taking pictures of sentimental items has been the easiest way to let them go. You keep the memory but you let go of the material baggage. Keeping them on their own usb drive or sd card, or at least a separate folder of sorts, is handy for when you (or your mom) want to take a trip down memory lane. You could maybe even print them out and give your mom a nice album if that's appropriate.   If you're moving out, just take the stuff with you. Once at your new place, donate the items to a place where your parents don't shop at. Then, showcase the few items that you actually use or like around your house for your parents to enjoy when they visit. I know my mom has gifted me a few items that I do not like. I keep them for a time, and when she inevitably forgets she gave them to me, I sneak them in a donation bag (donation bins would also work splendidly). I don't want to hurt her feelings, and I've found this is the best way to avoid that.   If you're on the fence about a few other objects, store them or give them back to your parents.

minimalism,3bta8p,SumahDeez,5,Thu Jul 2 01:14:53 2015 UTC,I would just be honest with them. They love you. As you mentioned your mom wants you to stay she loves you so much. So I doubt being honest with them will ruin that love.  Just tell them you really don't want the stuff and it feels like the excess stuff is a burden on you. You want to start a new life adventure.  Assure them that doesn't mean you are leaving them or moving on without them. It just means you are trying something new and can't wait to report back to them. Offer to take the stuff out and help them plan for what they want to do with all the extra space.  Turn it into a positive. The idea is if they understand your desires and goals they may get on board and be supportive of it even if its not what they would decide for you.  You are not doing anything bad or wrong. You are not messing up your life or becoming a drug addict criminal. You are just trying to grow as a person and find your identity.  Once they understand that I suspect they will come around.
minimalism,3bta8p,dbcanuck,8,Thu Jul 2 14:40:18 2015 UTC,"Move out all of the stuff that you own. Sell / dispose of 'junk' that you are certain you will not need. In your new place, when your parents visit and if notice the missing items, simply tell them they're in storage as your current location isn't big enough. (EDIT: This also can be used as an excuse to refuse future 'gifts' = clutter. Years later, if they still inquire about the items, you still have an 'out' -- tell them your storage locker was burglarized/fire/flood, and you lost the items...but you didn't want to tell them at the time as it would hurt their feelings.   You eliminate the need to confront your parents; at the same time you  are able to move the items out of your life.  The ultimate rule on this, though, is that you don't let them keep introducing nick knacks into your life. You will need to stop the clutter but refusing/declining the gifts in future."

We've faced huge problems with sentimental crap and unwanted gifts, especially now that we've had a baby. It's a long process of confronting it head on, gently and lovingly. People need to understand they can't force things on you. It's also very bad etiquette to ask after gifts, but people don't know that.   A good way to break the cycle is to say, oh I donated that to goodwill, with a big smile. People attach too many emotions and memories to physical objects, and it's not healthy."

It also was populated solely by federation officers whereas D had families and civilians leading lives of luxury. 1701 had little choice but to live a spartan life aboard ship. D crew, with more space (pun intended,) chose to embrace a minimalist lifestyle. It also helps that you get to see a lot more of the quarters on D, and the quarters of all the main cast."

minimalism,3bpg45,MrEggplant,8,Tue Jul 7 18:57:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd say that the best example of minimalism - certainly in the newer series, but possibly eclipsing the original series - is the USS Defiant.  It's built as a warship, so the minimalism is there by necessity. But even so, everything about it is spartan. With the exception of the captain, I'm not sure anyone gets separate quarters; everyone shares. They also seem to only get a punk bed, a small area to hold personal possessions, and one desk shared between them.  The mess hall is similarly basic. I remember it as lacking decoration, and not even having a window (a far cry from Ten Forward). When they do start decorating it, during the war, all they do is stack burnt-out phaser coils against the walls, to symbolize how bad-ass they all are.  The NX-01 is also fairly minimalist. That's understandable, seeing as they're flying around on their own, without Starfleet to back them up or anything, and with relatively basic technology (compared to the later Star Treks, anyway).  The Defiant is definitely my favourite ship, although the 1701-E is a close second.  Like /u/eaglewatch1945, I think that in the later series, it's more about people choosing to embrace minimalism.  I've always thought that minimalism would be much, much easier to do when you have a replicator, though. Why keep glasses or plates or the like when you can just replicate them on demand?"
minimalism,3bpg45,Hansll,3,Wed Jul 1 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"I view life on the NX-01, NCC-1701, and NX-74205 as asceticism more so than minimalism. They have to deny themselves simple luxuries because of the job and sheer lack of accommodationd, not because of a lifestyle choice, especially on the Defiant since it isn't commissioned for long-term use. Though the Defiant was pretty bad-ass."
minimalism,3bpg45,eaglewatch1945,2,Wed Jul 1 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"Fair point.  I tend to have quite a bit of crossover between ascetism and minimalism. So, that's a personal blindspot, and I have to admit, you're probably right. It's not a choice for them, so it might not be 'real' minimalism.  The Defiant really was awesome.

The biggest thing is that following trends, focusing your life on material items - not only is it unhealthy, but it's a reflection of a deeper belief (or can cause you to subconsciously acquire this worldview) that this physical world is all there is.   Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and decay destroy, and thieves break in and steal. Matthew 6:19"
minimalism,3bpl8e,slavicswimmer,2,Thu Jul 2 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"Has religion affected your minimalism, or minimalism affected your religion in any way?   Yes. In both ways.  I wanted to help people. After becoming a minimalist to the point where everything I own fits in my car, including furniture, it's made me able to travel and help where there is a need. I've been doing it for over three and a half years now as a full time volunteer. The bible tells us to ""go and do"" and live out what we believe, instead of just talking about it and theorizing about it, thoughts alone don't help people, actions can and often do. Having less junk holding me back makes it easier to go and do.  I want to take care of the environment and live sustainably. This has pushed me towards minimalism and /r/simpleliving. I had already cared less about money before minimalism, but now I care even less about it. The bible talks about it being harder for a camel to get through the eye of a needle, than a rich person to get into heaven. And the idea is that if you have wealth you may think you don't need God, because money can buy you anything. The same can apply to any possession, or substance, that rules your life.   Minimalism has also helped me to see the spirit of the law and bigger picture, instead of the letter of the law with all it's minutia. The Pharisees focused so much on the details that they missed the big picture. I've learned to not sweat the small stuff, and to focus on the bigger picture.  Side note: Christianity is very Buddhist-like or Buddhism is very Christian-like if you look at the bigger picture. Put another way, all religions are fairly similar. I've heard that all religions of the world agree on the same 70% of tenets, and yet people focus more on the 30% where they disagree, instead of working together to make the world a better place."
minimalism,3bpl8e,kuvter,2,Thu Jul 2 00:55:28 2015 UTC,"Christian and Buddhist doctrines work extremely well with minimalism and simple living. As others have mentioned in their replies, Jesus advocated living with the bare minimum of possessions, if even that. The same thing with the Buddha. This probably isn't so clear in the modern world, since the Calvinist view of Christian morality equated productivity/wealth/industry to holiness.   In a roundabout way, minimalism affected my religion first, by making me more conscious of my relation to material possessions in the secular plane. Now that the initial energy has dissipated, its a heightened sense of spirituality that keeps my simple-living/minimalist ethos on track."

I prefer to use the term Tradition on Reddit as ""Religion"" seems to trigger the fedoras with the ideas of biblical literalism and theistic personalism. As if thats all ""Religion"" is, or has ever been; unintelligent, unsophisticated, superstitious and imaginary.  I model my faith on the esoteric/hermetic Medieval Catholicism... the Tradition that I feel purified/perfected the wisdom of the Pagans, Stoics, and Neoplatonist. I have built on this for myself by synthesizing its scripture with my previous study of eastern mysticism and ancient wisdom (Advaita Vedanta, Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Sufism etc.).  ...  To me, Tradition is very minimal.  Tradition focuses my life away from the chaotic, dissolute, and unimportant. Through ritual and customary practices, Tradition gives my mind the freedom to direct my Will, filter my experience, and focus on higher things.    Religion, applied to the Self, is essentially Lifestyle Design. Applied to the folk, Religion is Civilization Design.

Since I found out I was a Deist, I stated paying more attention to things like nature and whats in my own head, so I guess that's how it made me more minimal.

Hindu values encourage minimalism: detachment from possessions, selfless action, simple living. Mainstream Hinduism can be very ""maxi,"" with its plethora of deities and holidays, shrines full of icons and paraphernalia, complicated rituals. Ramakrishna Vedanta allows for all that if it appeals to you, but also encourages you to dispense with all of that if you find no value in it. It also promotes acceptance of all other religions: we're encouraged to learn about the various faiths and even find inspiration in them, so I can read something like ""Buddhism Plain and Simple"" - a minimalist spirituality if ever there was one - and put some of those concepts to work for me."

The area where the recycle bins / garbage can are located should have a full sized pantry cabinet or closet there, floor to ceiling. You could put the bins in the bottom of it.

minimalism,3bkfs3,hamb_sammich,3,Tue Jun 30 08:11:21 2015 UTC,"Extending the cabinet to the ceiling would be pointless. The top of the cabinet is already used for extra storage (food, rice cooker, dishrack). A shelf above it would not fit. The countertop doesn't need to extend to the fridge since you can already see, its used for storage anyways. (Classmates, however, put their fridge in the opposite corner of their rooms. That I don't get.) A full-sized refrigerator is not necessary for a single person. Yes, a cabinet to the left of my kitchen would be nice (I hate staring at my mop and broom all day), but not necessary. In a small space it is necessary to balance storage with blank space else it'll feel so overwhelming and tiny. I understand why they decided not to do it. Drawers under the sink however, I completely agree, would add space. Dutch people tend to do their groceries multiple times a week and the concept of a 'pantry' is literally foreign to them. Even when I shop for the whole week, I have enough space to store all my food. Besides, the grocery store is less than a mile away.  Space to cook, however, is a different drama."

Somewhat related example: If you try to add a powder based creamer to cold coffee it won't mix in, it'll just clump up. Add powder based creamer to hot coffee and it'll disperse almost immediately. -- In the same sense soap will act quicker and better with a warm shower, than a cold one.   With all that said I still do laundry with cold water only. I also only take a shower every couple weeks, or when needed after a hot sweaty work day or workout. I already take short showers, under 10 minutes. I don't have any problems smelling. We could learn from the French that a shower daily isn't needed. I also don't drink coffee, but knew of the example by seeing it recently.  An alternative to shower is the clean off key parts of the body that often perspire and smell, such as feet, genitals, under your belly (if there is a flap), behind the knees, and your armpits. You could put water (cold or hot) into a bucket, stand in the shower, soap up, clean the targeted areas, and dry off.   Additionally you shouldn't use the typical soaps when showering, because the oily residue it puts on your body often closes pores and decreases their functionality."

Freedom from the weight of material possessions and trivial decisions allows me to embrace the beauty of chaos and find the clarity that inevitably exists in that recognition.   There was a time when I tried to comfort myself with possessions and THINGS only to recognize that I was riddled with anxiety and things that I held little to no real attachment to.   Life is chaos.

minimalism,3bkxkh,r4ptor,3,Tue Jun 30 02:04:24 2015 UTC,I like ebooks for casual reading as well. I thought I'd prefer physical books for school but some of them come with an ebook version.

minimalism,3bkxkh,M4R1488,3,Tue Jun 30 17:54:58 2015 UTC,I find I don't retain information with ebooks as well than physical. It's one thing to be able to search keywords but I guess my brain is more wired to knowing where information is physically within a book than going through keyword instances. Plus I like being able to set the book/paper beside me to reference rather than constantly switching screens.  Though it's a giant pain in the ass having stacks of books and stapled journal articles to sift through.
minimalism,3bkxkh,r4ptor,2,Tue Jun 30 22:31:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. At first I thought it was going to be hard to use an ebook textbook but I've been coming around to it.

I like the smells of a new book, and the way the pages can fold and flip back and forth, and I like the feeling.  However, I'm actually in the process of transitioning to only having e-books. To me, the pleasant things of books are outweighed by the convenience of all of the books being on a Kindle. I also adore the Kindle function that lets me get a definition of a word I don't recognize. For example, I'm reading Brave New World at the moment (a hardback I have, that I will donate or sell when I've finished it). I'd never seen the word ""viviparous"" before, and although I was able to guess at the meaning through context, it would've been nice to just tap it, and get a definite confirmation before moving on. Plus, the Kindle editions are often cheaper, which is no bad thing.  My plan, long-term, is to have the majority of my books on the Kindle. Then, I'll get a few books I really like, and splash out on nice copies - leather-bound, hardback versions of everything.  At least for now, I think that's the best compromise I can hope for."

Some size reduction and OCR and you're good to go. Love the iPad for reading ... easy to highlight text (which you can then export via eMail, e.g., when using GoodReader).  Never, ever going back to physical books. Both for fiction and non-fiction. With fiction, it's a good way to get interesting quotations easily (think back in horror to all the post-its still sticking in some old books at home), with non-fiction, it's a good way to get verbatim quotations for notes.

Probably the ideal would be one paper book that you get rid of when it's done and replace with a new one?  I really like ebooks - I have a tendency to go to Goodwill and pick up whatever books I have felt vaguely like reading, then forget about them and they pile up. Last year I did a big purge before I moved and I got rid of all but about 15 books, all either sentimental or fancy art books (not including about 10 cookbooks - I have the most basic Kindle and no tablet, so no color pictures). I MUCH prefer having that small curated collection to look at. Then my Kindle is a mishmash of whatever I feel like reading and I don't mind it being cluttered."

Minimalism is often confused with the art movement, and the heart of the applied ethos, 'a curated and mindful existence' is promptly forgotten, cue the commercialised iEverything aspects, and a thousand photos of blank desktops or 1:9 ratio landscapes of something random, to cloud.  Essentialism, is unencumbered by the baggage of minimalism,  but could also be confused with various interpretations of the philosophy. However, the author is trying to redefine the term through his book, talks (such as this one at Google ), and articles, all of which. have stressed the idea of Essentialism as a lifestyle choice.  Therefore, I would think that proper lifestyle Minimalism is effectively Essentialism...for now ;-)"

You can just contact the local community college's welding class. Welding takes a lot of skill, but cutting can be accurately done by first year students.   So buy a used shipping container for $800-$1500 (depending on size, material, gauge)  Decide where everything is going, pick up your doors, windows, and utility caps and such, draw where everything needs to be cut using the high-temp chalk sticks.  Have the student cut the holes for $150.  Line hole edges with silicone trim.   Frame inside of holes using 2x4s and bolts. Install windows, doors, etc.   Run power, gas, etc.  Frame, insulate, and hang drywall on interior walls.   From this point everything is like furnishing a double wide.

It's a mineral used to make gypsum board (drywall). It's just a standardized board version of plaster.  Reclaimed materials are typically more expensive than new because labor is the most expensive part of cosntruction and it must essentially be handled twice (once to remove, once to install).  The cheapest house in the US is a typical stick built construction. 2x4 @16"" on center, double top plate, 1/2"" interior gyp., ~1/2"" exterior OSB, batt filled cavity, some vapor barrier on the outside, and covered in vinyl siding.  It's complete shit but it's how almost every home in the US is built and nothing comes close in terms of cost.  Assuming you're talking about a 40' shipping container that's 8' wide that's 640 square feet (60 square meters). At $25k that's $39/sf. I'm not sure what part of the budget you're leaving out (plumbing, inspection fees, soft costs, your own labor, etc.), but that is not a realistic number. If you're talking about 20' containers the cost is closer to $80/sf which starts to get into the low end of possible.  Source: am an architect."
minimalism,3ba27z,translunar_injection,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply.. They would be the right measurements for the shipping container.   It costs about 2 - 3 k a container so let's say 5k for the containers. I've seen land here for 6. So 11k would cover the both. I'm guessing the last 10 would cover basic plumbing. I reckon 25k could build a house out of container, the construction and labour costs could make that a lot higher.   It looks like like I have to go back to the drawing board to determine a new build outside of reclaimed materials and containers. On top of that I'll have to research a stronger budget which has to include the invisible costs such as labor, inspections etc.  I think I have made these mistakes because tinyhouse projects don't list these costs too often and are exempt from it because they use trailers. I'm looking for land with the tiny house which means I'll need building permission etc. These costs are going to screw me."

minimalism,3ba27z,Tancoll,0,Sat Jun 27 15:34:59 2015 UTC,How is security improved at all with a container design? The weak points are still the windows and doors which are normal hardware.
minimalism,3ba27z,lanceinmypants,8,Sat Jun 27 08:18:47 2015 UTC,"It is a really strong construction, after all they are made to be stacked over 10 containers on top of each other and travels around the world. And not to forget about fire safety, it wont collapse in case of a fire."
minimalism,3ba27z,Evanthatguy,6,Sat Jun 27 09:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yes they are made to stack on each other, but once you start cutting out walls they become real flimsy. At That point you need to start reinforcing the container."
minimalism,3ba27z,ryoonc,2,Sat Jun 27 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"Yes but people don't break into houses through walls, which was my point. And to your point about fire safety, smoke inhalation from burning finishes, furnishings etc. is probably a much more common way to go than the structure itself burning when we're talking about a residence this small. That can definitely still happen in this case. I should also mention that steel will become elastic and experience structural failure in high temperature, often before timber structure if you can believe it. Timber will char and become resistant to failure, and there are great photos of burned out buildings with timber supporting failed steel members.   As an architect I just find the whole shipping container thing to be kind of a gimmick. You're essentially replacing timber construction, which has proven to be excellent for small construction (not to mention incredibly sustainable), with something at a small, predetermined size, uninsulated, and which will lose a lot of strength when you cut windows, doors, vent holes etc. in it. So you'll have to reinforce it anyway, most likely with wood or metal studs. So why didn't you just make a timber building clad in metal in the first place?"

If you insulate the inside with a typical stud (not metal studs, thermal bridging) and batt you're going to be reducing an already tight space, creating thermal bridges, and there is some risk of condensate issues depending on your climate and detailing.  The real issue as I see it is the floor. Best would be to set the container on top of the insulation but then you need a crane.  Could also spray foam the outside but that's expensive."

Why is it so awesome?   It allows you to travel, less items to maintain, more money to adventure.    How can I get this in my life?    Supporting my top 5 priorities is how I know what's important, so I only keep things that enhance them.   The first 3.5 years as a minimalist I pared down to few enough items that everything I own fits in my car, including furniture. I also paid off all my debt, to free myself up to travel.  The second, and past, 3.5 years I've been traveling around the US, mostly on the East coast, helping out where there is a need, supporting communities and living simply.   Helping included teaching English to refugees, tutoring inner city kids, running an aquaponics garden, cooking for 60 ppl, cleaning, farming, gardening, giving food to the homeless, helping with VBS, chopping down trees for firewood, refurbishing a basement, rebuilding homes after natural a disaster, building websites, a tool shed, a folding table, and a caterpillar bike rack bench.  In my free time I played disc golf, acoustic guitar, went on day hikes, wandering around cities and countryside, swimming, biking, bonfires, board games, video games (Steam sales under $10), floor plan designs, met and hung out with a ton of people along the way. Life is good!    It helps if all your hobbies are inexpensive or prepaid (acoustic guitar, gaming laptop).  TL;DR Support your top 5 priorities, pay off debt, travel, help people, and life is good!"

Assuming this is the agreed upon idea, there are ways to make the wording more succinct.  Debate and discussion are similar enough that we could chose one of them, instead of saying them both. New: Discussion about the different facets of minimalism  Different can be implied as a facet has many sides. New: Discussion about the facets of minimalism  Discussions root word is discuss. It's got the same implications as discussion, but changes the verb tense enough to make the next change. New: Discuss about the facets of minimalism.  ""About the"" is implied, and with the previous change you get: Discuss facets of minimalism.

If you can't find your keys, then I suggest you learn to put them in a common place. If the common place is cluttered with other things, then you need to declutter that area.   A tray is just another thing that will eventually fill with other things. Loose change, receipts, rubber bands, whatever.

The main points seem to be that 1. you need to be more wealthy to be minimalist and 2. minimalism is still a focus on stuff, or more precisely the ridding of stuff. I'm guessing you think that buying stuff is the same as 'getting rid of stuff' which is the point of minimalism. But that is not how i see it. I personally think the process of getting rid of stuff is just a step in the direction of minimalism. Minimalism doesn't start till you have already gone through that process to to that point that you only have remaining the things that add value to your life. Trying to buy more things even if they replace other things isn't quite the same as this as if someone is asking the question what should they buy then these things they haven't even dreamed up of themselves are hardly essential to adding value to their life. That is unless this person asking just wants to follow minimalism as an art movement rather than lifestyle."

minimalism,3b00uz,jackphraser,3,Thu Jun 25 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"You are confused.  Black is when an object absorbs all light. There is no light reflected and thus the object appears black (or near black). Black holes absorb all light, so they are 'black' in the sense that you can't see them and they look black.  Near-black objects are similar, but reflect very low amounts of light.  White is when all the colors are reflected. It's also the color you get when you mix all the colors of light. So the object is absorbing no light, which then makes a perfect reflection. Or near white which ultimately creates 'white' objects.  As such, you have two ways of arriving at both, and they are contradictory: mix to get black, or mix to get white. And remove to get black, or remove to get white. In terms of light, white is all the colors black is none. In terms of objects/pigments, white is no color and black is all."

minimalism,3b00uz,Level1Barbarian,4,Thu Jun 25 15:11:13 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with how humans emotionally percieve color.   For example, a room with one window as it's only source of light painted all black feels small/cluttered/dead compared to the same room painted white. So I think it translates well that minimalist artists use the viewers connection to the color to their subtle advantage in an effort to portray their art as more free and open and lively and not small or cluttered or dead."

They're lightweight, breathe well, and dry quickly. I've used them for work, day hiking, wandering around town, disc golfing, tennis, soccer, biking, fording rivers, and trail running (just because).   I suggest shopping around for the lowest price if you want to get them. I waited till there was a sale and bought a second pair before the first ones wore out."

From a podiatric aspect, it's bad for your feet to wear the same shoe everyday. From an economic aspect, you'll be wearing out and replacing these shoes frequently. From a performance aspect, you're not meeting your athletic potential.   It's okay to be a minimalist and have multiple shoes. I consider it just as important as having multiple pairs of underwear. Get a good pair or runners and a good pair of hikers. Then, depending on where you spend your most time on your feet, 2 pair of casual shoes and 1 pair of dress shoes or vice versa."

However, for everyone else it is - depending on what you do. Light stroll in the woods or even front food running? Sure, grab a lightweight minimalistic shoe. Heavy hiking with a lot of weight? Unless you have year upon years of getting used to almost no support of your ankles, feet, knees and even back - get a heavy duty higher boot. How high and how heavy duty? Depends on terrain and the weight you're carrying. Source: was a professional soldier, now I work part time selling and giving advice on hiking boots and shoes.

minimalism,3ay3xh,felipebf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"If you're not having fun with it, and see no use, then of course cancelling it is logical.  I've had several iterations of my facebook account, deleting it and reinstating it a few times with similar thoughts. Eventually, I switched it back on, but for a specific purpose: to keep those contacts that I would otherwise lose, and to promote my music. I never post anything on my FB that I would not want read in a public magazine. I treat it as a very public place, and I've deleted friends who don't. I do not share my location, where I work, where I went to school. I do not have family added.   Another good reason to have a FB account is to lessen the chances of someone faking your profile. I've seen it happen. If I have my own profile, at least people know that that's me.  So my approach is the opposite of what people try: to keep facebook private, only for real friends, for a smaller, closer circle. I have FB for acquaintances and friends I don't connect with often. I never share anything private, only an occasional link to a music video or cool thing. This level of investment is casual and doesn't have me too involved. It's instrumental for promoting my music, though, everything happens through FB in that regard. Arranging gigs, hearing about events to play at, finding places to play, promoting and gaining exposure. I could not do what I do without it."

minimalism,3auwq2,jackphraser,7,Wed Jun 24 01:49:27 2015 UTC,Let's see your conveniently hidden kitchen sink full of 400 dirty dishes so we can all know you aren't a true minimalist /s  Nice place btw
minimalism,3auwq2,Polaritical,8,Tue Jun 23 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Everything looks awesome except your bedroom which has a sort of ""I just moved in and don't own furniture"" college apartment vibe. To me it just looks a tad less polished and pulled together than the rest of your place. But you may love it, so who knows."
minimalism,3auwq2,SumahDeez,3,Tue Jun 23 20:24:11 2015 UTC,Looks pretty minimal. nice work.  The nice thing is this minimal style makes a small place look like more than enough room.
minimalism,3auwq2,Kestral,14,Tue Jun 23 21:58:27 2015 UTC,"Prison bars on the door, tacky furniture, tile floor. It may or may not be minimalist but I hate it."
minimalism,3auwq2,YourLovelyMan,5,Tue Jun 23 20:29:32 2015 UTC,You should have made that second sentence rhyme too.
minimalism,3auwq2,Kestral,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:50 2015 UTC,"Damn, good catch! Missed opportunities"
minimalism,3auwq2,drunkenAmoeba,5,Wed Jun 24 13:49:12 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever seen an entire apartment tiled like that. Wild.
minimalism,3auwq2,happenstanced,3,Tue Jun 23 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"As someone with a toddler, I am extremely envious of not only the simplicity but the tidiness of your place."
minimalism,3auwq2,__Venus__,0,Tue Jun 23 22:18:49 2015 UTC,Nice!  I have the same salt lamp. Your place looks so relaxing.
minimalism,3auwq2,ActiveShipyard,3,Tue Jun 23 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"Nice choices, but the best choice was getting a place with that awesome flooring."
minimalism,3auwq2,esharkin,0,Tue Jun 23 20:28:57 2015 UTC,"Looks like a good combo of practical and comfortable! I'd love to see your kitchen, too. Enjoy!"
minimalism,3auwq2,BananasAreYes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:46:26 2015 UTC,Do you mind if I ask where you got those nightstands from? I've been looking a for a set just like them.
minimalism,3auwq2,KingBoogaloo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:50:46 2015 UTC,I have had them so long I forgot. It might have been cost plus world market.

minimalism,3auwq2,AxOfCapitalism,-2,Thu Jun 25 12:41:50 2015 UTC,"""College dorm aesthetic"" is not the same thing as minimalist."
minimalism,3avqgs,KoaReedD,5,Tue Jun 23 21:57:39 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but looks like the Simple White Add-On."
minimalism,3avqgs,eddieabed,2,Wed Jun 24 05:53:57 2015 UTC,Looks like it but I hope OP shares his customizations because it looks great.

minimalism,3avqgs,eddieabed,3,Wed Jun 24 16:54:55 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone! /u/eddieabed had it right with the Simple White Theme for Firefox. But I'm also using some custom browser css with Stylish.  here is the css http://pastebin.com/5LCtjL4R  Stylish and Simple White Theme are the only addons required to make this work. Although I have greasemonkey for 4chan extensions, RES for reddit, and AdBlock plus."
minimalism,3avqgs,jackphraser,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The style looks good, except when running Firefox in fullscreen mode (OS X), the traffic light buttons disappear and the tabs get pushed to the top left hand corner without any padding, which is kinda ugly - any idea how to fix this using some CSS?"
minimalism,3avqgs,jackphraser,2,Thu Jun 25 02:30:55 2015 UTC,Looks awesome wish this was somehow google chrome.
minimalism,3avqgs,SimplyEnvy,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:29 2015 UTC,I used to be a google chrome guy but switched over because of its high memory usage and lack of customization. Never looked back!
minimalism,3avqgs,Badya122,2,Wed Jun 24 16:55:33 2015 UTC,Yeah most of my memory is unused anyway so it hasn't been a problem for me yet. I keep chrome pretty vanilla extension-wise as well. Although I do like this user interface aesthetic.
minimalism,3avqgs,g0nzalo,2,Wed Jun 24 17:40:48 2015 UTC,Plugins/extensions/theme would be awesome here. Would love to have this as my browser.

minimalism,3avqgs,absolutebeginners,2,Wed Jun 24 16:55:39 2015 UTC,Damn that looks awesome! Does it still use a lot of memory though? Asking because on MacBook
