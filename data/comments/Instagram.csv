Instagram,3dy68t,Proofay,3,Mon Jul 20 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"I enjoy this service because while words can be used, they are not required. You can post a picture of something, even yourself, that maybe describes a thought or feeling. A response is not even required. Someone can like it or not like it. But it's out there.   As a photography fan, I enjoy sharing my photos and seeing others. I am a flickr member, but it is not very good for social activity. The feed on instragram is much simpler to navigate. flickr is a tad bit cumbersome, especially since all of the changes they have made over the last year.   I have only been using it for a month or two (I only have a little over 100 followers) and I really enjoy the exchange that I have with a small handful of that 100. I don't know them personally and they do not know me, but I feel like there is a minimal relationship there. I don't know if they feel the same way, but I often look forward to their posts and notice if I haven't seen one from them in a few days.   While I would love 2000 followers or to follow that many people, I wonder where the line is where it becomes impossible to remain engaged with all of the people you enjoy being engaged with.   Also, I get a warm fuzzy when someone has taken the time to go through some of my older posts, not just the first one or two. Especially if they commented on them. I try to keep that behavior as well. The fact that some random person, out of billions of people, thought enough of your posts to go back over weeks or months to look at them gives a good feeling.   I will probably never meet any of these people--quite a few live in countries far away that I will never visit--but it some ways it restores my faith in humanity. For instance, I often hear how other societies are this way and that way against other sexes, races, faiths, etc. But society doesn't exist on instagram. There are no groups or forums. It's just one on one. There is no social pressure to not socialize, to be unkind or unfriendly. There is no reason to be. In the real world, maybe some of these people would not, could not be my friend. But for a few seconds each day on instagram they are."
Instagram,3dy68t,overbored454,3,Mon Jul 20 16:48:45 2015 UTC,Great response.   Exactly how I felt when I started my account.   What is your instaname?  I want to check your gallery out.

I've got 237 followers at the moment and have put almost 20k euros in equipment and flights, at the moment it's more of a hobby then a job and the only money I make from photography is selling prints of my pictures which has made me almost 5000 euros in the past 5 months so hopefully once I get more followers I'll be able to sell more prints and make it a real job."

Instagram,3dy68t,Dimbit,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:01 2015 UTC,At first it was a way to train my eye to see differently through the 1:1 ratio. But then I started seeing work others were doing with dslrs and then uploading to insta. I couldn't compete with a phone given the subjects I shoot.  It pushed me to invest in better equipment for the thing I love most. I'd really like to use it to build a customer base and potentially get some publication/editorial work.   Still trying to figure out the best method to get followers without following a bunch of accounts. It's almost become a brain teaser for me. I'm trying to navigate influencers to get featured and build an audience in addition to figuring out which hashtags get the most followers.  IG: @nickrad

The desire to post daily to Instagram has helped motivate me to get out and shoot more landscapes.

I'm still finding my aesthetic, figuring out which gets the most traction/what I enjoy shooting.  Your perspective is everything, you can post your laptop, you can post your coffee, you can post fun selfies, you can post your job.   My friend who's like instagram famous said this to me when I went shooting with him for the first time last weekend and I was looking up at this building of a police center that used romanesque revival architecture. It was beautiful, I knew a shot was there, but I couldn't quite figure it out. He pulls out his camera and points it at the thing and says ""This is how you shoot it without making it look like you're a tourist who pulled out your cellphone,"" and that was to play with the angles, lighting, and focus."

It's easy to save over time without having to think about it and helps you be a bit more conscious about your spending/savings habits, and by purchasing frequently it also helps to mitigate the effects of bitcoin's price volatility over time :)"

Instagram,3dkjl2,katsumichan,3,Fri Jul 17 00:39:04 2015 UTC,"I always try to make sure that my photos are geotagged either when I take the photo on my phone, or I add the location in Lightroom later.  Instagram will read the geotag on the photo itself when you post.  So if I took a photo in San Diego, I can still tag it as San Diego even if I am posting in Wisconsin for example."
Instagram,3dkjl2,lukejc1,3,Fri Jul 17 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"I find geotagging on Instagram can be....frustrating sometimes. Even photos taken on my phone with geotags can show up on the wrong spot on the map, even when the name of the location looks ""right"" at posting. Wish Instagram would let you edit/fix geotags. I like my map, annoys me when photos are in the wrong spot.   When I upload a photo taken with my camera (as opposed to the phone) that has no geotags I get a bit of ""hit and miss"". Sometimes no matter what it just won't let me geotag it, other times it works. Seems to work slightly better when I'm on wifi. Not sure if that's just my perception or not.   Haven't tried adding geotags through Lightroom, since for those times I use photos that aren't from my phone I usually just transfer them directly from the camera.   Best of luck :)"

I am so tired of all those spammy tactics people used to grow their instagram. Followforfollow just doesn't work because the people who follow you only wanted you for a follower and will not engage with you. Buying followers is even worse.  So my question is: Will people be interested in an ig account that puts out tips to help others gain instagram followers organically? NO spammy followforfollow, likeforlike. Your followers are there because they want to be there, and those are the best kind."

Just sign into the site with your Instagram account like you would log into some sites using your Facebook account.

I have a ton of pictures from a city I just visited, but I don't want to spam my feed with them. An album feature, even if there was a max cap of 5 or so, would be awesome.

Instagram,3czzmd,morganelle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, there are a few (IMO really insignificant) kinks that IG would need to work out. E.g. Would you caption/like/comment on an album or each individual picture in an album? Should there be an upper limit (people might try to upload 100 photos of their vacation, which IG might not be able to handle)?  But again, really simply solved. And this way I don't have to scroll through 10 different pictures by the same person to get to other posts, but instead skip over the album as a whole.   Ah, well, I'm crossing my fingers at least"

I was waiting for the subway in Tokyo at rush hour and could not fit in when I saw a lot of Japanese people just pressing themselves in, I thought it was full, turns out about 8 or 10 more people jumped in, so much that the metro workers had to push them in and tuck anything that was blocking the door !

The double exposure is accidental, in fact everything about the photo is accidental - I was using a supersampler multi shot camera with no viewfinder, so only had a vague idea of what the results would be.   I loved every second of my time in Japan and this photo is a nice reminder of that :)"
Instagram,3cu9eh,Keenan_RIVALS,3,Fri Jul 10 20:46:27 2015 UTC,Yeah it's happening to a lot of people. Just wait it out & see what Instagram says. Most likely a glitch in the system.

Instagram,3cu1i0,KlaatuBrute,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:28:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Depending on the demand and popularity for/of the iOS version, absolutely."
Instagram,3cu1i0,niccig,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"This is pretty neat. Once you get to the 'no more photos to vote on right now', when do you get more? Are you only allowed to vote on a specific number at a time, or do you just get images until the photos submitted to pstcrd run out?  Edit: Is there a limit to how many/how frequently you can submit photos?"
Instagram,3cu1i0,niccig,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Well, you get the no more photos indicator when you've run you of the photos in your 'inbox'. There is no limit, it just happens to be the number you have. The environment has been fairly active the past few days, so I always have a few more after checking every hour or so.   The max you can post per 24hrs is 3 photos right now, and you can only post each of your photos once.   Let me know what other questions/feedback you have!"
Instagram,3cu1i0,niccig,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks :-) I do have one suggestion - there should be more ways to invite people.

Instagram,3cu1i0,pmur,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, and one more suggestion - it would be cool if the posted photos on your profile page had a timestamp of when they were posted, so you know when you can post more."

I live cheap, doing random jobs for a few weeks or months here and there to make enough to survive. I don't have much money but if I have some food, semi clean clothes and my camera I feel like the richest person in the world. If I would happen to die now I feel like will have lived 3 times more than I would have working for another 40 years at an office job I don't like. We live in a dark world and photography helps me to see the beauty in it.  Please if you are an avid travel, street or life photographer, I would like to check out your work/instagram. I found a few good ones via reddit so far.  I'm quite new to instagram but I upload daily or more.  Thank you!"

Instagram,3cs6em,jkbh,2,Fri Jul 10 10:22:59 2015 UTC,I can confirm this. some users in my group got increase in followers from 100-10000 with one user jumped from 38k to 72k in just one refresh. Don't know what happened but is this some sort of bug?
Instagram,3cs6em,porneyes,2,Fri Jul 10 11:28:52 2015 UTC,"I've had the same - a jump of around 500 users this morning without any actual new followers. My count went up as of about 8 hours ago. My girlfriend has an additional extra 7,000 followers on her count, but hers only jumped this hour."

Instagram,3cs6em,georgiakatee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I probably wouldn't worry about it. Either they'll fix it or you'll just have a higher follower count. At least it isn't a bug that interferes with anything crucial."
Instagram,3cs6em,GirlOnAJourney,2,Sat Jul 11 02:28:18 2015 UTC,You are probably right. I just don't like having a huge number of spam followers though so it kinda bugs me.

Instagram,3cs72s,zpactoid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:05:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear some people hates it, for me personally I like it when people on Instagram stick with 1:1 format, I know sometimes there are pictures that works better in other format, but I think that's what make Instagram different, so you always need to make the best of it in 1:1 format.  But don't make this encourage you to not post picture in Instagram, Instagram is a really good photo platform and I know a lot of user that use other formats, my advice is try to make your feeds similar, if you love to post picture in 2:3 format, then do all of your picture in that format, otherwise if you keep changing your format, your feeds will look ugly.  Hope this helps, English is also not my first language."
Instagram,3cs72s,puterawicak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I've been posting my photos with white borders, and unfortunately, using different formats. I'm beginning to think that Instagram isn't just about the photo itself, but the overall feed. I mean, how the feed looks in general. Like instagramers who posts photos with only one dominant color."
Instagram,3cs72s,108stars,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:09:08 2015 UTC,I like 1:1 but sometimes use 4:3 because 1:1 doesn't always frame a picture right. It sucks to miss the full effect because the Instagram crop forces 1:1.
Instagram,3cs72s,Impisheye,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:25:10 2015 UTC,I do get less likes on the pics I have used nocrop to fit in the whole thing. But hey its your instagram you can do what you want! :)

Instagram,3cs72s,hibrie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:09:56 2015 UTC,"No matter what the subject there will be people in this world who hate it.    I prefer to post in 1:1 format whenever possible but sometimes a photo just can't be cropped and have good composition.  In that case I will post it with borders using whiteagram (iOS).  I only use solid white borders so it looks more natural than if it were black, grey, yellow, etc.    I say post away in whatever format makes the photo looks best.  If the photo can't be cropped to square, use borders if you have to.  If the photo is good you won't be laughed at."
Instagram,3cs72s,GirlOnAJourney,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"It's your feed and your photographs, so post them however you feel is best! Sometimes, especially for landscape shots, a 3:2 photo is the best for the situation."

Instagram,3csl4d,facesinthesky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:00:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just checked your profile and you shoot a really good picture, some tips for Instagram is try to make a theme for your feeds, for example I think you're really good at Architecture or Travel, you can make these two as your Instagram theme and post mostly pictures from this category.  You also need to use the right hashtag, not only a random hashtag like #sky, #beautiful, #art, but Hashtag that can featured you in some popular pages like #agameoftones, #webstapick, #urbanromantix, etc if you get selected and reposted by this popular pages, more people will know about you and know you're good, so more followers!  The last tip is try to attend Instameet in your local city, you will get a lot of tips and friends there and people will tend to follow the people they really meet in real life.  hope this helps, @puterawicak"

Instagram,3csl4d,ggeoffreyy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:09:36 2015 UTC,posting nice photos is only one part of instagram. knowing how to market your account is another. the easiest way to get exposure on your account is to like a shit ton of photos and in return people will check your profile

Instagram,3cp9js,Ragnogroth,2,Thu Jul 9 17:54:55 2015 UTC,One is an expression opposing racism and oppression and the other is in favour of racism and oppression. Many people think racism and oppression is a bad thing and therefore it tends to be forbidden.

Instagram,3cp6ni,b1jan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:29 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about android but if you're on iOS there is an app called followers+ and you can click on any account and it will show you when the last time they posted was and you can mass unfollow people so you could potentially unfollow like 20 people at the same time.
Instagram,3cp6ni,NightWingsDouble,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:54:04 2015 UTC,any way i can like 'sort by last active' or something? or else i have to open each profile and see when they were last active and then unfollow and there seems to be no real sorting order
Instagram,3cp6ni,rageoftheninetails,2,Thu Jul 9 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"you could pay to see how active they are, which I haven't tried because iTunes keeps asking me security questions that I can't answer apparently. It also tells you who's your best followers and some other options. I recommend downloading it and using the free options which are really good regardless."

Lamborghinis are awesome, but I've literally see thousands of photos of them.  Show me something new: what's the stitching in the leather look like? How are the bulbs in the headlights arranged? Where and how do the curves drop off?  Show me an angle that I just can't google search for.  Tell me a story.   This guy may be someone you want to take inspiration from"

Instagram,3cmv7c,Emilio_Rebenga,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:55:30 2015 UTC,You have a theme and a recognizable one.   You take good pictures.   But your pics are all kind of the same.  Parking lots and roads with nice cars get old.   You need some action.  Race tracks and donuts and nice cars in nice settings.   I head out once a week with a few hours of commitment and take pics for my stream.  I have ideas but not anything solid.  If I see a photo op I am setting up and shooting.  You need to do the same.   Get some bizarre shots like under the car at the chassis.    A good feed but you need to branch the variety out more now and get some shots nobody has thought of.

Instagram,3capw0,actionx1,2,Mon Jul 6 18:27:46 2015 UTC,A 1920 x 1080p screen on a phone can only produce a 1080p wide picture. So it shouldn't make a difference if the pic is higher than that. Since you cant even zoom in the picture anyway.  They COULD have future proved it anyway since there are some 1440p phones out there now.

Instagram,3cb5lp,tdaun,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:26:56 2015 UTC,Do you mean like this frog picture thing? https://instagram.com/zooatl/?hl=en (scroll down a little) because I am all for banning these things.
Instagram,3cb5lp,lukejc1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:42:58 2015 UTC,I agree it's annoying when users do this.  You don't see anything from them for a week or more and suddenly you see 20 pictures in a row from them.  I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with it and don't see a reason for Instagram to police this.  I simply unfollow them.
Instagram,3c9rw9,cronaman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:22:12 2015 UTC,"I think it can only display 300 most-recent liked photos at a time, so once you liked more than 300, the old ones start to get eaten. You need to save your favourites (screenshot them or set up an IFTTT recipe) if you want to keep them."
Instagram,3c930w,sleuthwood,3,Mon Jul 6 01:16:06 2015 UTC,"Just delete the app from your phone. When you re-install it later, you'll just log in and resume where you left off."
Instagram,3c7oyy,ifitdontfit,3,Sun Jul 5 17:50:28 2015 UTC,"There's a chance that IG is actually keeping that larger file on their servers as well, and that would be smart on their part.   Why exactly is that? If there's no way for anyone to access it, how is it beneficial to anyone? Storage costs money, the smaller files they have the less cost there is to store them."
Instagram,3c7oyy,steakmane,0,Mon Jul 6 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"It is my educated guess that storage cost is one of the last things that they think about.   Facebook paid $33 per user when they bought Instagram, and its never made money.   For compressed JPEG 2300x2300 is 1MB and 10802 is not that much smaller. If you use 3000 images it's less than 1GB data storage difference. compare that with the amount of free storage Google, FB, dropbox and YouTube give you.   The advantage is, not vomiting when you look at images on a 30 inch roll up retina screen in the future. How much better would Instagram be right now it all images were at 1080 square and not just The ones right now with only the most current app and uploaded in the last day."

Will I have to edit them all from scratch again to get the HQ effect? :("
Instagram,3c7oyy,dogecoin_pleasures,2,Mon Jul 6 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"Instagram used to save at 1536 square, so if you have been following my advice of always saving automatically, your mobile device should be able to give you most of the quality bump if you use those edited saved files in your Instagram folder.   PS now it saves edited files on your device at 2250p square."

The follower count is showing an incorrect number yet when I check the profile list of users that follow me I've been able to count well beyond the number that Instagram is indicating. I checked my connected accounts to see if there could have been something that hacked me, yet all ordinary connected apps are there as well. Seems to be a direct Instgram issue."
Instagram,3c8gr7,evanwmusic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:09:42 2015 UTC,Same thing has been happening with me. It says 64 followers but I got 59. I thought it was because of this app I got that tracks who unfollowed me but could it be from instagram directly??
Instagram,3c8xaw,AppleGeek227,3,Mon Jul 6 00:22:24 2015 UTC,Pay attention to your Hashtags. What's your account?
Instagram,3c8xaw,TKNims,6,Mon Jul 6 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, if your account is on private no one will see your hashtags.   If you use hashtags that are more popular,  it will get drowned out by the millions of other posts. Better to narrow it down to something local. Strangers are less likely to press like on pictures of your family."
Instagram,3c8xaw,cupcakewin,2,Mon Jul 6 02:40:52 2015 UTC,Why should anyone care about pics of you and your family? That is probably why nobody likes them. You need to take pics for the masses. Then go and add lots of hashtags to allow more people to find the pics. Search for hashtags that don't get updated too often so that your pictures stay near the top of that list for longer.
Instagram,3c8xaw,chromiselda,2,Mon Jul 6 03:00:36 2015 UTC,OP - Wouldn't it be creepy to have random people liking on family photos?
Instagram,3c8xaw,tw33kz0r,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:42:29 2015 UTC,"Nice pics are all relative.    Court of popular opinion decides what are nice and like-worthy.   You need to focus and narrow your theme.    Maybe start another account for a more narrow theme and start employing hashtags and interact with other users more.    Keep your existing account for friends and family.  The only people you should care about liking the family pics are your family.    The question is, why arent your friends and family liking your pics?"
Instagram,3c8xaw,Emilio_Rebenga,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:41:39 2015 UTC,"Use relevant hashtags in your posts.  I find that posting in the evenings yields the most likes.  Posting at noon might be a problem because people are working, at school, etc. and may not be on Instagram.  Find people to follow and like their pictures.  Often people will reciprocate likes.  Commenting on photos too also gets people to check out your photos.  The main thing is to be active and gain a following of active users.  Then the likes will come."

Instagram,3c7gzi,ifitdontfit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:43:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for this! Started researching this camera and found the alpha series which looks exactly like what I was looking for but i'll keep looking into this. The fujifilm x-t10 looks good too but a little afraid of the older film settings they've brought in along with it (plus quite expensive close to a mid tier Nikon DSLR)
Instagram,3c7gzi,ifitdontfit,2,Mon Jul 6 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything bad about the Fujis, sony mirrorless has some great features too.   I was going to say get the rx100 because it's got most of what you need to be a good photographer, if you want interchangeable lenses, get an alpha.  https://instagram.com/p/4xsKhOxt0N/ Then again I just took this with an iPhone and and stock camera app. Looks pretty sharp to me.

Instagram,3bvf45,mineraloil,3,Thu Jul 2 18:17:13 2015 UTC,I tested again today. My new photo uploads are now 1080 pixels on Android. :) That's the highest it seems. I uploaded 2500 pixels and it was downsized to 1080 pixels. I uploaded 1000 pixels and it remained 1000 pixels. The compression is still a little on the high side though.

Instagram,3bkzs6,warriorprincessdi,2,Tue Jun 30 11:35:25 2015 UTC,"Looks like The Shire, but it's not THAT shire. (Shot near Byron Bay, Australia.) https://instagram.com/p/3LlKwZA7U9/"
Instagram,3bkzs6,salometunkli,2,Tue Jun 30 11:38:31 2015 UTC,"This shot is my ""Most Liked"", My wife bought me a Craft Beer advent calendar and this was one of the selections.  I also have a bunch of vinyl toys and Wooden Bender was a perfect match with the label.  I have a couple that I think are my best.  This one, I snapped many years ago with my 35mm on the Red Mile in Calgary. I recently figured out the process to post photos that were not taken with my phone. This festive shot is one of my favorites, although I may have gone a bit crazy with Snapseed processing it. And finally, this overhead shot of a park in Calgary."

Instagram,3bncmv,mobileagnes,3,Tue Jun 30 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"Post up past photos, no one cares when they were taken. No albums, but if you want to organize them in some manner, create a hashtag that you think Joe Public won't use (you can search for hashtags to see what's in use)."
Instagram,3bncmv,Knightmare6_v2,2,Tue Jun 30 16:52:56 2015 UTC,You can always add a #latergram to the comments or wait for #tbt (throwback Thursdays). In general no one will really care unless you seem to imply they were taken right now.
Instagram,3bncmv,rachycarebear,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:24:41 2015 UTC,To make you feel better my first 3 pictures on instagram were more than a year old. As long as you identify them as past pictures you really shouldn't have an issue.
Instagram,3bmlel,warriorprincessdi,2,Tue Jun 30 13:03:50 2015 UTC,Oh good. We needed another girl with tired angles of wilderness.
Instagram,3bmlel,taxthatass,-2,Tue Jun 30 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"thanks for the critique, I'd love to see your account?"
Instagram,3bktgk,fakeshits,2,Tue Jun 30 01:11:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I love the photo, but it's such a pet peeve of mine when people use 'selfie' meaning any picture of them!"

Instagram,3bk0ch,briantomasch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:35:35 2015 UTC,How do I find out what it's all about?
Instagram,3be5fo,JalapenoJaques,3,Sun Jun 28 11:04:53 2015 UTC,very weird!  I would try contacting support.  Instagram scares me sometimes when I hear these stories.
Instagram,3be5fo,texxed,2,Sun Jun 28 11:28:49 2015 UTC,Instagram has been pretty weird lately. One of my photos was removed and next thing I knew my account was deleted.
Instagram,3belml,EpicRoadTripUSA,3,Sun Jun 28 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"Interact with other Instagrammers, comment, like, follow people that inspire you. Then maybe develop a style. Look at other travelling Instagrams and you'll notice a consistant color scheme, clean shots, and interesting photos.  Camera_Jesus is a great example of a person that puts a lot of thought and effort into all of his pictures, plus he does a lot of exploring. He's in Deroit, where you seem to be! Link!"
Instagram,3belml,Ericana,2,Sun Jun 28 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"Also, look for the visitors bureau & tourism hashtags of the area you're in. Use #PureMichigan when you're here -- Also, I saw when you visited Holland that you didn't use #HollandMI - using just #Holland confuses us with the Netherlands, so I don't pay much attention to that tag. There are some other great Michigan tags like #MichiganAwesome, etc., that will connect you with a lot of very active Michigan-based accounts. Surely other states have similar accounts. Most cities have visitors bureaus, so just look for their websites and social media pages and interact with them, as that could get you likes, shares, re-tweets, re-shares, etc. I use Iconosquare to find tags that are relevant to my area and will re-share content (with permission) from those tags."
