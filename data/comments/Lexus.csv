Lexus,3e75c3,Nosen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:23:13 2015 UTC,I have a buddy who has been an auto body repair tech for about 25 years. I'm going to try and fix it after dealing with the insurance company. The door still opens and closes fine but there is a small crease in the jam. I'm hoping the rim and rear end are fine. I didn't feel a wooble or notice it in the mirror to my house. I wanted to get it painted again anyways but not like this.

Lexus,3dbzgw,CancelledEyes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, they told us the reason was because the manual transmission had a less than 1% take rate on the second gen cars. Maybe if they offered it on the 350 instead of the balls slow 250, the kind of people who specifically seek out manual transmissions would have actually bought an IS with a manual. A good portion of enthusiasts will take a car that can actually scoot pretty well but has an automatic (the 350) over a car with a manual but is slower than molasses in Antarctica."

Lexus,3dbzgw,xampl9,3,Wed Jul 15 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"Driving a manual is all about practice.  Ask a friend to teach you the basics Hint: don't rest your foot on the clutch pedal.  Repair costs are in line with what the vehicle costs.  The good news is it ought to be about as reliable as your Honda.  However, it's going to be more expensive to maintain than a Civic.  Hint: Protect your wheels - don't curb them.  Is it more fun to drive than a Civic?  Oh yes.  Insurance is pretty much a ""you get what you pay for"" situation. You can find the discount insurers easily enough (they're the ones spending lots of money on TV advertising), but if you ever have to make a claim...  Get quotes from Amica, or USAA if you're eligible.  They both are highly rated."

With a Lexus the repairs cost might be a bit more but at the same time... It's a lexus, so it should last for quite awhile even in its current state.  As others have said, the clutch might be a bit tricky. I don't drive one myself but I heard it's a bit of a pain in the ass. Maybe look around and see if you can find a manual?

The key to it, however, is diligent maintenance according to the manufacturer recommendations. I have seen them come thru our dealership with 400,000 miles or more that run great.   Lexus also has an unwritten 50,000 mile engineering rule. With proper maintenance, the car should run exactly the same at 50,000 miles as it does when you drive it off the lot.  All these examples are word of mouth from guys at Lexus College.  So yeah, the key is maintenance.

Lexus,3co6qr,uniquecannon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:11:25 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd like to know where Lexus will go with the 350 line of motors, since the 250 is being replaced by a smaller motor, but getting a 40 hp bump. Could we see maybe the return of the turbo JZ? I hope a 300t, featuring a 350hp 3JZ-GTE, is in the works.. If Lexus want to continue competing on performance, then they need to get back up to the line with the other automakers. The G37 was running 330hp before its replacement, and the 3 liter 335i give the IS350 a run for its money."
Lexus,3co6qr,tunersharkbitten,2,Fri Jul 10 05:59:53 2015 UTC,"no 300t, but they WILL be making a IS300 AWD.    http://media.lexus.ca/releases/the-lexus-is-::-complete-driving-enjoyment-with-a-whole-lot-of-new-for-2016  the IS350 will ensure that the legendary 2GR-FSE returns to kick butt as always.  also, Toyota retired the 2jz with the IS300.   they will no longer make a straight 6 either.  V configuration from here on out.  friend at CALTY told me that."
Lexus,3co6qr,jmckenzie51,2,Fri Jul 10 06:06:24 2015 UTC,"Ignore this guy, plug turbo in and show us video."
Lexus,3co6qr,smackythefrog,3,Fri Jul 10 04:14:40 2015 UTC,I think you've bought the wrong car if you're looking to do those types of modifications.
Lexus,3co6qr,JakSh1t,2,Fri Jul 10 03:35:09 2015 UTC,With enough money anything is possible. That being said the 2GR-FSE doesn't go well with a turbo. The compression ratio is really high and there are no low compression pistons available so you'd have to buy some and have a genius machine shop modify them. Then you'd have to replace the EMS/ECU because you can't tune fuel delivery on the stock ECU.
Lexus,3co6qr,JakSh1t,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, lad! Any suggestions on what i could do to add more performance? I'm a total noob, as this is my first time venturing into modding a car. Cheers."
Lexus,3co6qr,satin_rules,6,Thu Jul 9 13:31:12 2015 UTC,If you're unhappy with power you should look into a different car. You can always modify your suspension but I think the GS 350 is already set up pretty good. Were you aware of the GS F before you purchased your 350? Sounds like that's what you're really after. Personally if I had a 2015 I wouldn't do anything except tint the windows and enjoy the ride.
Lexus,3co6qr,Voogru,3,Thu Jul 9 13:40:11 2015 UTC,"Winner right here, buy something unless your dedicating lots of time to building a car."
Lexus,3co6qr,ScaredOfAPotato,2,Thu Jul 9 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"Enjoy the ride.  The nice thing about Lexus, IMO, is they don't need to be touched.   So really, it's a money saving tip. Rather than spending all of the money on mods, you can just... save it for other more important things.  The best part? Don't need to worry about engine or transmission blowing up and a surprise five figure repair bill."
Lexus,3co6qr,uncleluu,2,Sun Jul 12 06:10:55 2015 UTC,"An engine swap is probably easier than just 'adding a turbo'.  These days an engine swap is a bloody big job if you want to retain the convenience and electronic functions of the car.  If you want a fast car, buy a fast car.  Better yet, if you want to go fast stop pissing about with cars and get a sportsbike."

Your investigation has shown that there's probably not any red under that vinyl sticker they used to make the taillights legal.   I don't know why even an aftermarket taillight wouldn't have a red tint to it, but you're probably better off finding some new aftermarket lights yourself that are properly tinted. THEN, take the sticker thingy off. If it's red underneath, then no harm done and you can either return for refund or resell the others you bought. If it turns out to be clear, which I'll bet that it is, then you won't be too far from being legal again and having a nice looking set of lights on your Lexus!"

Lexus,3b7epo,enternets,3,Fri Jun 26 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"Idk if there is a current Lexus with fewer common issues than the RX. That 3.5 is literally bulletproof, which explains why Toyota has used it in everything for the past decade. Previous models had issues with the rear brakes seizing up but even that little issue was resolved in the current model. Rear shocks tend to leak on the newer models but that is almost always caught under the 5/50 warranty and would definitely be covered by the CPO warranty. I think it's a great reliable buy."

Lexus,3b7epo,thewun11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:34:26 2015 UTC,"I assume you're speaking of the RX300 from 2001.   Your boss more than likely never cared for her SUV very well (abuse from bad weather, never changed the transmission fluid, etc). Lexus` do have reputations for remarkable reputation, most of the issues you'll ever hear are very isolated, unless you were to own a 3rd gen GS or a ES (sludge issues).  The newer 350's are a terrific choice, however I wouldn't opt for premium audio if I were you. The speakers usually loose their bite somewhere down the line, but again, it's my opinon. Best of luck on your purchase!"
Lexus,3b7epo,uncleluu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she said she bought it used so she didnt know the history as far as trans goes and I immediately assumed she never did any pm on it. I do a fluid drop every 70k miles on my personal vehicles using OEM fluid. I think I would just go ahead and do the premium audio since most of the CPO have it to begin with and if the sound diminishes everything is there to just pull them and replace with better speakers."
Lexus,3b7epo,OldBear62,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:30:14 2015 UTC,"Time out here!! Your telling me that my beloved Lexus, premium sound (ML) has an issue with its speakers going bad? I've never heard of this before, is it really true?  I have an 2012, RX-350 with ML sound and your telling me that there will be speaker melt down!!??  How long does it have to live? What price (estimate) for BEST possible, most thorough and complete upgrade??"
Lexus,3b7epo,airchompers,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:59:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. Every mark levinson system has issues with longevity. The speakers usually start to degrade after 5 years, it's not uncommon for the subwoofer to blow after 7 years. The amp usually starts to peter out after 10 years.   A brand new audio system (amp and speakers) is probably 2-3k."
Lexus,3b7epo,OldBear62,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:30:33 2015 UTC,"Shit, Shit!! ""Say it ain't so, shoeless Joe..""!  Can't see replacing it, to pricey, to much work getting to the speakers and amp, don't like the styling on the new RX-350's either. Poopy Butts!"
Lexus,3b7epo,airchompers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's a bummer. The best thing you can do is avoid exposing the car to temperature extremes. But the Mark Levinson audio is very disappointing for anyone who doesn't drive the car new.   It's a shame that Lexus can't put a high quality Japanese system in there like something from Onkyo, Sony, or Kenwood. The base lexus systems are usually made by Panasonic and last forever. The 90s Lexus had Nakamichi as the premium audio supplier and those nakamichi systems are still running better than 200-2007 Mark Levinsons at this point.   It's a bummer that the AMP and speakers go. At least the head unit is good. I think I might just wire in a good bluetooth speaker to replace my subwoofer and live with it."
Lexus,3b7epo,OldBear62,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:38:03 2015 UTC,I have a 2012.. I have loved the sound I also love Onkyo and Nakamichi a LOT. How come you never hear this stuff until years later?? Oh well thanks for sharing.
Lexus,3b7epo,airchompers,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"I seriously think everyone that knows has an incentive not to share.   My mark levinson audio is going out, and I guess I'd like to get a car with the base/pioneer system. FWIW, when it works it's unparalleled at playing classical music.   But I'm not going to tell any prospective buyers of my car about the issue, and I'm not going to tell anyone with a base sound system that's a desireable feature I'm willing to pay for.   New car salespersons probably don't know about the issue. And used car salespersons have the same incentives as myself.   But really, if the only issue I have with a 14 year old car is that the audio doesn't work in the middle of the Minnesota winter, it's alright. Unfortuantely I can't wear headphones and drive, but I think I'm going to pick up a bluetooth speaker and strip the audio out of my car and sell the stuff that hasn't broken yet.   FWIW, the Amps usually sell for $800, the head unit is an easy $500, and the speakers and subs are $400 used. You get pretty close to being able to buy a new system if you sell all the old gear."

Lexus,3b7wjc,tunersharkbitten,2,Sat Jun 27 01:10:20 2015 UTC,I think this is a reasonable complaint.  I would try going to another dealership and getting a second opinion.

Lexus,3b3ftc,tyndall_blue,5,Thu Jun 25 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"you will not get any noticeable performance increase with any mods on the IS250.  It is all cosmetic.  Having said that, I have the Fsport intake and it sounds great.  Makes the car sounds more aggressive.  Instead of getting an aftermarket exhaust, I just took out the resonator on the stock exhaust.  No drone, and sounds great when you need it and quiet when you're cruising.  If you really want aftermarket exhaust, look for the HKS exhaust (Not the big fartcan looking one) Lexus was actually selling in dealers a couple years back, those had the best sound.  Fujitsubo have some great sounding ones too. if all fails, you can't go wrong with Fsport."
Lexus,3b3ftc,KevinMHC,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:46:10 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the reply. Kind of a bummer there's no noticeable performance but I suppose it makes sense since the 350 solves that problem for the ones too worried about performance.  I'll definitely look into the HKS and see if any of the dealerships around are offering it. On one hand I like the quiet cabin that the stock setup has....but on the other I'd like it to purr a little more haha I'll probably be happy with either way but I figured I'd look into the intake/exhaust world and see what the community thought. Thanks agian!

Lexus,3b2b1p,Malilima,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:57:07 2015 UTC,Here is what I don't understand...   Power and engine choices will depend on the version of Lexus ES. ES 300h will be equipped with 2.5-liter 4-cylinder Atkinson engine. Given that this is a hybrid model under the hood will be placed and an electric motor with a battery of newer generations.   That isn't how Lexus does things. We add 100 to whatever the ACTUAL displacement of the vehicle is when we add a hybrid powertrain.  NO EXCEPTIONS.EDIT:I stand corrected.  guess my service advisor friend is full of shit...    I am guessing it will be a 2.0L I4.    ALSO this gives hope to them making the IS200T.
Lexus,3b2b1p,tunersharkbitten,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:54:02 2015 UTC,That is only correct for the GX and LS.   CT200h has a 1.8: 200-180 = 20 IS300h has a 2.5: 300-250 = 50 ES300h has a 2.5: 300-250 = 50 GS300h has a 2.5: 300-250 = 50   The IS200t is vital for the European market.

Lexus,3az25p,_TheRedNinja,3,Wed Jun 24 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"It's a marketing ploy.   They already described how it works, which is via superconductors. Basically what they do is freeze magnets with dry ice (liquid nitrogen), this is what's causing the fog coming out of the ""hoverboard"" in the video. Once magnets are cooled to a certain temperature their interaction with nearby magnets is different than normal. Instead of being repelled in a fashion that tries to flip the magnet over, when in this superconductor state the magnets interact in a quantum lock relative to the static magnet.  The skatepark they showed the board on in the video has a metal base, and I read somewhere that it's electrified (either by the board or something else) to create a magnetic field of its own. So when the board is placed down it is quantum locking with the magnet below the concrete.   You can see at the end of the Lexus video that as the guy puts his foot on the board, the board then sinks towards the ground and the camera fades to black quickly. The force required to hold a magnet and the materials of the board is sufficient, but it's definitely WAY too weak to hold a person. Seeing at how easily it dropped with his foot on the board, my guess is it couldn't handle much more than a pound of weight. So we'll need to wait until they can make it more than 100 times stronger. Don't hold your breath. This is all for marketing.   Also, this video will give you a visual of the quantum locking with a good explanation of what's happening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6AAhTw7RA"
Lexus,3az25p,picodroid,2,Wed Jun 24 17:45:49 2015 UTC,Seems legit. Although they don't seem to have figured out how to keep it off the ground with some one standing on it. I am interestd to see how they aoear to be able to levitate it off concrete versus a magnetic track.

Lexus,3ayzi0,xampl9,3,Wed Jun 24 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"There's not anything else near there that goes bad. OP, I'd do it. At 100k your water pump is holding on by a thread anyways, and your spark plugs would be required in 20k miles.

I assume if they can pull it back out without damaging the paint, it might not be worth claiming through insurance, but man this sucks!! Took me almost 2 months to convince myself to buy it..."
Lexus,3aifky,minlite,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"Well the front bumper was cracked so had to be replaced. The estimate came out a lot lower than I thought. $1500. I did have comprehensive with a $500 deductible, so worth it to go through insurance. I got lucky though, my policy gave me a $50 / day allowance for a rental which they paid me even if I didn't need a rental (which I didn't). So since the car was in the shop for 11 days (because the bumper was backordered) the insurance company cut me a check for $550. So I ended up making me ($50). Maybe find out of your insurance does something similar."

Lexus,39yl7h,LoLViperNA,2,Mon Jun 15 21:07:24 2015 UTC,"You don't have to use the paddle shifters while in sport mode. The paddle shifters just give you the option of downshifting/ upshifting when you want like a traditional manual car. When you downshift, you'll notice the car begin get into the higher RPM.s on the tachometer. This allows you to use more torque/power to pass people/ race/ run from the law and what not. Being in sport mode doesn't harm your car, you'll just use more gas.. Which harms the wallet however."
Lexus,39yl7h,a70hero,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"So say I put it in sports mode and dont use the paddle shifters, are there any performance differences?"
Lexus,39yl7h,inXorable,3,Mon Jun 15 22:22:16 2015 UTC,If it is anything like my ISF (which is probably is) there are quite a few differences. Most notably your throttle response will greatly increase in addition to having tighter and quicker shifting.   Turn on sport mode and slightly accelerate then while you are still accelerating turn it off. The car will feel like it fell on its face.
Lexus,39yl7h,Voogru,6,Tue Jun 16 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"If it is anything like my ISF (which is probably is)   ISF is a completely different animal, to be honest."
Lexus,39yl7h,inXorable,3,Tue Jun 16 01:11:07 2015 UTC,Not really in this regard.    increases throttle response. increase steering response. increase shift pattern and speed. will hold which ever gear you are in. increase the parameters for VDM
Lexus,39yl7h,domo-saur,2,Tue Jun 16 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"Differences that matter? No. Simply don't ever bother pressing it.   Shift points are changed, meaning if you floor it you'll reach redline before upshift. You will not bounce off the redline unless you use the paddle shift to stay in a lower gear, it is never recommended to bounce off the redline. ABS is still on. Traction control is still on, but is not as intrusive. Because of electric power steering, the steering becomes slightly heavier for better road feel.   Just drive it the way it was meant to be driven, as a grocery getter."
Lexus,39yl7h,nekowolf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:34:01 2015 UTC,"Here's what sport mode on that car does (assuming AWD automatic).  You shift to sport, and it says 4.  This does not mean you are in fourth gear.  This means fourth gear is now the highest gear you can shift to.  Switch your display and you can see which gear you are actually in.  The reason is that fifth and six gear are more for keeping speed than overtaking.  By using only up to fourth you'll get better acceleration but worse gas milage.  There's also power mode.  That's the button to the right of the wheel.  Push up for snow and down for power.  Power mode just changes the timing on the gear shifts I think.  Honestly, I have a 2010 is250 and I don't really bother with either."
Lexus,39y4cj,Arayder,2,Mon Jun 15 19:10:06 2015 UTC,Power wash it off and see if it comes back. Most of the time it is from oil refilling due to mechanics not cleaning up after themselves.

Lexus,39ctrz,gmasterrollie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:27:24 2015 UTC,How sure are you that its the bulb and not the ballast? If you want to make sure you need to swap the bulbs and see if the problem follows the bulb. If it does not its the ballast or possible wiring issue.
Lexus,39ctrz,Lord_Zero,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:19:22 2015 UTC,I am almost positive it is only the bulb.  I do not know what you are referring to by the ballast.
Lexus,39ctrz,Lord_Zero,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Because of the energy required to run a HID headlight, the HID bulbs do not run on low-voltage DC current, so they require a power pack (ballast) with either an external or internal ignitor, which controls the current given to the bulb. Considering automobiles use a 12-volt electrical system for their lamps and the HID lighting requires over 20,000 volts to ignite the bulbs and then 85 volts to keep them running, the ballast is a necessary part of the system. Apart from turning it on it also regulates the voltage, and is an integral part of the HID system.   http://www.ebay.com/itm/DENSO-LEXUS-Toyota-Prius-D4S-D4R-HID-Ballast-2007-2008-2010-GS-RX-Avalon-IS250-/230553955476?hash=item35ae162c94&vxp=mtr  How to replace burned out ballast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88_gCBHdJoo  The ballasts can die before the bulbs can. Which in your case is a bit of a nightmare because you own an older luxury car, and like most luxury cars around that age, the ballast is embedded within the headlight assembly itself.

When my lights stared going out, if I turned them off and back on again they would always come back on.

For me, the RWD with winter tires felt about the same as FWD with all seasons in terms of control in the snow.   It really comes down to how comfortable you are with your driving skills in foul weather.  You of course have to use caution no matter what vehicle you're driving when there is snow/ice on the roads."

Lexus,38jyxd,DHK7,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:10:05 2015 UTC,I would buy a set of cheap wheels on craigslist or something and have snow tyres mounted and you should be fine.

Just make sure to put your summer wheels/tyres back on as soon as the snow starts to dissapear otherwise youll eat up the tyres in no time.
Lexus,38jyxd,Popsiclestix1234,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:00:31 2015 UTC,It will be fine as long as you have a set of quality tires. It's not an AWD so dont drive it as such. Also sometimes it may help to load up your trunk with some bags of sand or something to gain traction.

Lexus,38jyxd,domo-saur,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"If you aren't confident in your driving ability, or simply do not trust other drivers around you then do not get RWD. The closest experience you can get at the moment is driving quickly in heavy rains using dedicated summer tires. You basically point your car in the direction you would like to go in and hope for the best. There are some winter tires that'll help or you can just put chains on your tires, where allowed. If you live in an area that plows the snow in a timely manner then it doesn't matter what you drive.   Looking at the sidebar picture, you can always ask /u/Naserume."

Summer tires are the best tires for rain, as long as it's warm out...Not sure how hitting rain on summer tires is comparable to using them in snow. It's not even similar. My Continental Extremecontact DW (iirc that's the name) are summers. Best rated rain tire out there. I love them. I was plowing through flash flooded streets yesterday here in VA.  That said, I only buy summer tires. I have a RWD IS350. The continentals this past winter (when I put them on) were awful in the snow. I trust my driving, and I probably did 200+ miles in about half a foot of snow and ice. Now once I parked for the night, I couldn't get out. Got towed out buy the 4runner like 4 times haha.   Snow tires will help significantly on either platform, but snow on awd will be obviously the best. Will handle beautifully."

Lexus,38jyxd,domo-saur,0,Fri Jun 5 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"What was implied is because it's currently summer right now, to try and emulate driving in the snow you could try driving with dedicated summer tires in heavy rains. Dedicated summer tires will not cut through the water as well as other tires, making it harder to drive in the rain. If you cannot drive in extreme weather, then don't drive RWD. FWD are generally easier to drive in bad weather.   People generally never experience the limits of whatever car they are driving. If possible, learn the limits of your car in a controlled and isolated location away from people and things to crash into, so that when difficult situations arise you will be able to react to what the car is doing and stay in one piece."
Lexus,38jyxd,abscissa081,2,Fri Jun 5 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"No you're wrong. Dedicated summer tires are the best option for heavy rains. Check tire rack or any other suppliers. Or the manufacturer. Until you get to extreme summer tires, that are like 100UTQG and more like slicks or drag radials (track tires) does the rain performance begin to diminish. That's only because that lack of tread.   Summer tires are your hands down best option in warm weather. I use mine year round. I have no problem with cold rain (as in sub 45 degrees) but snow sucks. I trust my driving enough to do it. I don't buy all seasons because I don't want a tire that is ""okay"" in every category. Dedicated summers and winters are the best option.   http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Continental&tireModel=ExtremeContact+DW Those are my tires. Absolutely one of the best options for rain. Please don't spread misinformation about tires. Lives depend on it."
Lexus,38jyxd,domo-saur,0,Fri Jun 5 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"Are you ignorant or just dyslexic? Summer tires are that, for DRY conditions. That solid strip down the middle of the tire? That's why summer tires are NOT able to cut through water on the road, which ends up causing hydroplaning. You want all season tires to be able to drive through a variety of driving conditions. The various thread patterns allow for water/ice/snow to be channel out allowing the rubber to make contact with the ground to allow traction. To reiterate, summer tires generally have big, fat, chunky thread patterns that allow more rubber to make contact with the ground. All-season/winter tires are the ones with all the cuts/grooves/thread patterns that allow water/ice/snow/dirt to be pushed out of the way. So, no. Those Continentals Extremes are fucking terrible in the rain. Those are summer tires that are not designed with braking through water in mind. Those are fantastic in the dry and, unbelievably, they actually have long thread life considering being summer tires. I agree those are good tires, those were the previous sets that I used before moving onto Toyo Proxes T1R rear, Proxes 4 Plus front. Tires are referred to as all-season, summer, or winter for a reason.  Driving a RWD car with summer tires on in the rain/snow/ice, the back end will break loose unless you are familiar with throttle control and corrective steering. Manufacturers tend to make cars understeer rather than oversteer, because it's better to see where you're going to crash instead of crashing blind. You don't want the back end to break loose unless you are purposely trying to oversteer. Generally people are not familiar on how to react when a car oversteers.   Unless you're trying to troll people into driving with the wrong set of tires in bad conditions, then don't go spreading the wrong information."
Lexus,38jyxd,abscissa081,2,Sat Jun 6 03:25:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just appalled because you refuse to read any of the info that the tire manufacturers give with the tires, not just what I'm saying."
Lexus,38ji4m,Arayder,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:10:56 2015 UTC,"Its a pretty easy job depending on the engine. I did mine this winter. (IS300 so 2JZ)  Spark plugs were absolutely covered in oil because the valley between the two valve covers had a pool of oil in it and it was leaking onto the spark plugs. I took the time to change the spark plugs and wires while I was down there.   Long story short I wouldn't be terribly worried. Keep an eye on oil level of course just know that its probably leaking onto your spark plugs too. I noticed a drastic increase in torque and responsiveness after I replaced the spark plugs and my fuel economy has also likely increased too so that should probably give you some incentive to change it. The gaskets are very cheap, I think I paid $30 for both.   Edit: After some creeping it seems like you have a GS400. It will be a tougher job on your car unfortunately because the outer valve covers are harder to access with them being close to the outside of the engine bay."

There are two way around this, you can grind a little bit off the steering knuckle and caliper (which sounds scary to me) or do what I did and buy roll centre adapters. These are spacers that fit above the bottom ball joint and they give the clearance you need plus they correct the camber on lowered cars. All of the parts i bought were from a 2000 LS400, I can confirm that the supra rotors do not work with LS400 calipers because they are a little bit too big and the standard gs ones are a little bit too small."

Lexus,37f7jg,Keeken,2,Fri May 29 03:27:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, all the new models post 98 have vvti. It's just variable valve timing technology (messes with the camshaft position. It increases engine efficiency). Wikipedia has a good article on it if you search vvti.   With the ls430, just make sure the timing belts are replaced in accordance to the service manual and the air suspension is in good working order! These are the most costly issues with an LS"

Lexus,3732gv,ProbabilityOfFail,5,Sun May 24 16:31:59 2015 UTC,Wow. It's like the OP wants swirls and huge scratches. Might as well use sandpaper to polish the paint.
Lexus,3732gv,Voogru,2,Sun May 24 15:54:59 2015 UTC,"Look up some videos on properly washing a car, really you should not be using a automated car wash that touches the car.  If you're going to auto-wash, do a touch-less autowash.  Look up topics like ""two bucket method"", another tip I do personally is I rinse cars with deionized water so I do not have to dry it by hand, pretty much if you're touching the paint, you can be scratching it."

Lexus,374co8,ZahidInNorCal,4,Sun May 24 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"Your salesman was somewhat right. In general iPhones have fewer quirks than Android has. Especially Androids running KitKat. They have crazy issues with pulling contacts and messages. If your phone isn't running KitKat, then you may be OK since they've fixed it in later versions from what I hear. If you are running KitKat, there are some fixes I can send along to you.  What you're talking about wanting to use is called the ""Mobile Assistant"", or if you have an iPhone, it's called ""Siri Eyes Free"". TO use Siri Eyes Free, you just press and hold the off-hook switch and when you release, you'll be talking to Siri, albeit with a limited set of commands for safety reasons.  To be honest, I don't really know if this functionality will work on an Android device or not. I should know, because I am a certified LTS, but we really have so few Androids come thru the store I haven't dug as deeply into them as I should have.  Try the off-hook switch and see if it engages the Mobile Assistant. If it does, then there ya go. Press and hold it for 1 or 2 seconds and release. You should see ""Mobile Assistant"" appear on the nav screen if it's engaged."
Lexus,374co8,SireBelch,1 point,Sun May 24 23:47:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I'm running the latest version of Android, and contacts and messages seem to work fine, so I don't think I need any additional fixes.  Holding down the off-hook button takes me to the Call History screen. No sight of the mobile assistant anywhere. I wonder if maybe Android doesn't give the capability of limiting the available commands, so Lexus opted not to enable the Mobile Assistant for safety reasons.  Any other ideas?"
Lexus,374co8,spolski,3,Mon May 25 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"LTS here that see's a 90% iPhone owner base.  I agree with /u/SireBelch in that the Android integration is not as polished as the iOS side of things. This is because the amount of testing needed to do on the hundreds of different versions of android based phones compared to Apple's 7 (4-6+). The message function is spotty at best for devices running 4.4.x, but mobile assistant should work by holding down the off hook switch instead of the voice command button."

Lexus,36y4jo,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 24 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"Italian tuneup:       An Italian tuneup usually refers to a process whereby a motor vehicle engine is run at full load for extended periods in order to burn carbon buildup from the combustion chambers, spark plugs, and exhaust system.   It is performed after a traditional tuneup and often accompanied by an addition of fuel system cleaner to the fuel tank. This can also be performed before each oil change interval with the addition of a good quality fuel system cleaner, [citation needed] then a few redline runs under load, after the engine has reached operating temperatures. Most carbon will escape through the exhaust but traces will find their way to the oil pan, hence doing so just prior to an oil change. It is particularly useful for vehicles that are only operated at low speeds on short journeys, but can help any vehicle to run cleaner longer, and for diesel vehicles prior to emissions testing. Driving for 20 km (12 miles) is typical.      Interesting: Auto maintenance | Engine tuning | AVG PC TuneUp | Advanced SystemCare   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Lexus,36hs0g,DonMoogan,1 point,Fri May 29 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"Really? I truly don't see the appeal of the three LED's, or square leds like the ones I see on Acura's. I've seen the three LED set up on the RCF and just sort of just looked at it, it wasn't ugly by any means, but just was there and nothing really went through me head. Does it make it look more sleek or something like that to you?"
Lexus,36hs0g,Imallvol7,2,Fri May 29 14:14:35 2015 UTC,At night when the lights are on is when they make the difference along with the awesome look.
Lexus,36hs0g,dnasians,2,Sun May 31 04:50:51 2015 UTC,What do you think the price tag is on this bad boy?  I have a is 350 I'm paying on right now but would lease this beauty if I had the chance.
Lexus,36hs0g,tunersharkbitten,2,Wed May 20 13:56:24 2015 UTC,i'm going to guess somewhere in the neighborhood of 75-80k
Lexus,36hs0g,viper689,1 point,Wed May 20 15:43:20 2015 UTC,"Yea I've read anywhere between (high seventy thousand to mid 80 thousand)  as well.   So   i'm going to guess somewhere in the neighborhood of 75-80k   is what I'm going with, but it sure is a beauty and worth the money from the looks and some Little tidbits of specs I can find on it. This car is one of the few reasons I'm toughing it out through engineering school (besides making the family proud) , so I'll be able to afford her. She's my dream.   And if you lease her tell me how she rides. I won't be able to get the car for at least another 4 years 😳😳"
Lexus,36hs0g,tunersharkbitten,1 point,Wed May 20 19:10:39 2015 UTC,"I know this is self serving, but does anyone else think that Lexus really is creating a TON of great looking vehicles?   I cant wait to see a press release regarding the new IS/RX 2.0T."
Lexus,36hs0g,viper689,3,Wed May 20 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Lexus, I think the spindle design only works on their cars, not so much on the SUVs/crossovers. I personally think that the spindle on the GX, NX, and upcoming RX are way too overdone. But on cars like the IS and GS, it looks absolutely stunning."
Lexus,36kdgo,WallyEXPRESS,2,Wed May 20 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"The ballast is actually sitting on the housing, you may be able to get away with going through the wheel well, but to save yourself headache, I'd recommend going ahead and pulling off the bumper and then the housing."

Lexus,36kimn,bumbumboogie,3,Wed May 20 01:32:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure your cars are the same as the US but the remote start is run through the Lexus Enform remote app. It's free for 1 year. Check it out on the App Store. Since it's run through the cellular and telematics systems it will pretty much work as long as you have cell service, for the distance sake. Good luck."
Lexus,36kimn,DonMoogan,2,Wed May 20 02:49:29 2015 UTC,this is correct.   and its cheaper than most systems nowadays.
Lexus,36kimn,tunersharkbitten,1 point,Wed May 20 05:06:26 2015 UTC,Didn't know that. Thanks!
Lexus,36kimn,RyuTheGreat,1 point,Wed May 20 11:59:30 2015 UTC,"I do know that a more mainstream popular option are the   Viper remote systems   This has a range of 3 miles. Now on the issue of regarding going to a 3rd party vs the dealer? Unless I know a truly talented and reputable person/ company, I'd rather just deal with the official car dealer, especially if it pertains my brand new car.  And I looked this up for you    Sometimes car dealers will tell their customers that if they install anything in their vehicle that is not made and/or installed by them, their warranty is voided. That is NOT the case and it became a federal law back in the 1970’s. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act addresses this very topic.Now, here is where it gets important. Very important. This law does not protect you from poorly engineered and poorly installed remote car starters. A lousy product with a lousy installation can cause problems for your vehicle and it can void parts of your new car warranty."
Lexus,36kimn,effse7en,2,Wed May 20 01:59:39 2015 UTC,"That's a US law, OP is Canadian."
Lexus,36ei6a,DickNickerson,3,Mon May 18 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if you are looking CPO then you might be hard pressed.  What model are you looking at?  You might be able to get the dealer near you to trade with another that has one."
Lexus,36ei6a,tunersharkbitten,1 point,Mon May 18 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"I've started looking at is350 but having a difficult time finding one with levinson audio.  Might consider looking at GS, just don't like the way it looks as much.  I can buy one just about anywhere, doesn't have to be CPO, I have a Toyota franchise.   From dealers I know, I found an ISF that's pretty well equipped and an IS350AWD.  For the $$ I would probably go with the awd since its a year newer and less money."
Lexus,36ei6a,tunersharkbitten,3,Mon May 18 20:31:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely take a look at the f sport gs350.  I didn't think I would like it, but it is REALLY nice with just the right amount of aggressiveness."
Lexus,36ei6a,abscissa081,2,Mon May 18 21:49:00 2015 UTC,"I've got an 08 IS350 with the ML. It's 14 speakers opposed to 13 standard. Center dash speaker being the addition. But it does have the amp. It's not the best, but I really enjoy it. Riding in someone elses car with a much less impressive system really makes me appreciate it. I couldn't go without it anymore.  But I'd look into a GS. I feel like going to an IS would be a big change."
Lexus,36ei6a,satin_rules,-1,Mon May 18 23:10:27 2015 UTC,Im sorry but what the hell is the Mark Levinson system?
Lexus,36ei6a,ctjameson,4,Mon May 18 19:59:45 2015 UTC,Premium sound package. Has a discreet amp separate from the head unit.
Lexus,36ei6a,satin_rules,-2,Mon May 18 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"Not the best choice of name for that IMO but sounds cool, couldnt you have someone rig that up after the fact instead of choosing a car around a sound system?"
Lexus,36ei6a,ctjameson,4,Mon May 18 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Mark Levinson is the maker of the system. It's just like BOSE systems in GM vehicles. It's a subsidiary of Harmon Kardon audio. It's their premium line.   As for aftermarket, newer models of Lexus have too many things integrated into the radio to be able to just up and replace it."
Lexus,36ei6a,xampl9,3,Mon May 18 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"I'm going to tell Mark you don't like his name.  Seriously - it's the guy's name who started the audio company, and Lexus licensed it. http://marklevinson.com/about-mark-levinson.html"
Lexus,36bj06,OUTKAST5150,4,Mon May 18 01:14:46 2015 UTC,"Pricing varies depending on the model and year. Some are affordable and others start to push the wallet. Google Lexus and find a dealer, then sample a few different ones nationally and look at their service  menus. That will should give you a good baseline to work with."
Lexus,36bj06,mi55mary,2,Mon May 18 01:22:54 2015 UTC,Will do. Thx
Lexus,36bj06,JakSh1t,2,Mon May 18 05:35:40 2015 UTC,"It will really depend on what is being serviced. I do a lot of my own work (spark plugs, oil) and it's not much more expensive than any other car. If I had to replace a computer or mechanical component and sure it would be much more costly than a Toyota."
Lexus,36bj06,JakSh1t,2,Mon May 18 04:06:00 2015 UTC,Glad to hear. I'm guessing the parts are easily accessible like Honda/Toyota. Thanks.
Lexus,36bj06,abudzl,2,Mon May 18 05:35:14 2015 UTC,"Engine bay access depends on the model. My IS 350 has a much more cramped engine bay than say a 4 cylinder Camry. The packaging is pretty tight. I will say getting to the air filter is super easy. Changing out headlights is a bit more labor intensive than it was on my Scion tC, but nothing drastic."
Lexus,36bj06,jesusmcpenis,2,Mon May 18 05:48:20 2015 UTC,"I have a '98 ES 300. The initial buy and oil changes aren't bad, but I have to get work done on it a lot. Don't know if my mechanics are scamming me or what, but had to get the alternator, brakes, and brake pads exchanged in less than a year. Still love the car, but the mpg is not the greatest. :["
Lexus,36bj06,DHK7,2,Mon May 18 12:44:03 2015 UTC,I've got a 99 and have done all those about 3 times now. Still cheaper than maintenance on anything German

Lexus,36bj06,abudzl,1 point,Tue May 19 01:16:57 2015 UTC,are you having it serviced at a dealership or independant?
Lexus,36bj06,SireBelch,1 point,Tue May 19 01:15:43 2015 UTC,Dealership. Haha
Lexus,36bj06,SireBelch,2,Tue May 19 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"The thing about a Lexus is that if it is properly maintained by a dealership, the car is going to last 15 years or 300,000 miles. That's what they're engineered to last to. Lexus has a ""50,000 mile rule"" where if properly maintained a Lexus will drive just like it did when you drove it off the dealership lot 50,000 miles later but that assumes you did the proper maintenance on it.  I'll never understand why someone will want to spend $50k on a car, and then bitch about a $100 oil change and maintenance check every 10k miles.   If you want something that will last, buy new or Certified PreOwned from an actual Lexus dealership, and then keep up your maintenance religiously.   I'd personally never let a Jiffy Lube touch my Lexus. A Toyota dealership might be OK in a pinch, but not as a matter of practice.  Just sayin'."
Lexus,36bj06,supermcginnis,0,Mon May 18 14:43:43 2015 UTC,Is this 50k rule automatically included or do you have to pay for that warranty? Thanks  Agreed on those speedy oil change spots
Lexus,36bj06,ctman2015,1 point,Mon May 18 20:36:29 2015 UTC,It isn't a warranty. It's a principle on which all Lexuses are designed from the beginning. It's a standard by which they engineer the vehicles.
Lexus,36bj06,xampl9,2,Mon May 18 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"Heavily dependent on the model. Something like the ES, for example, shares a lot of components with the Camry/Avalon. So figure the cost of maintaining a top of the line Avalon, +20% or so for the higher quality trim pieces, paint, and 'Lexus tax.'  Take a car like the LS, though? No commonality with any Toyota. Whereas the powertrain in the ES is nearly identical to that of a $27k V6 Camry, the powertrain in the LS was specifically designed for a $60k+ vehicle.  Lexus is statistically the most reliable auto brand on the planet, but when something does inevitably break on a $80k LS, well, you're going to pay prices in line with repairing any other $80k vehicle."
