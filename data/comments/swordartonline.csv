swordartonline,3e3nx1,tomogon,7,Tue Jul 21 18:33:51 2015 UTC,Awesome to hear that you like it and welcome to this awesome community!  I pretty much felt the same and I also watched the whole anime in 2 days. However you got me a bit confused. Did you only watch season 1 with aincrad and Alfheim or did you already watch season 2 with GGO and mothers rosario?
swordartonline,3e3nx1,Angwar,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"Not watched sao2 yet, but if its as you all say, I gonna need some tissues again."

swordartonline,3e3nx1,ZeHaffen,4,Tue Jul 21 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it! You'll love SAO II, the first arc is a whole new setting, the second is a short side story featuring the main cast, and the third is just... I can't even explain it. All I have to say about Mother's Rosario is good luck, it's possibly the best arc in the series but I still need to say good luck. I'd love to hear your thoughts on SAO II once you finish it."

I don't mind since Asuna is my favorite character, but other people may think different. I personally liked that it switched over to another character to build on them, I was ready for the focus to shift off of Kirito for a bit. Obviously you think differently, but to each their own."

swordartonline,3e3nx1,nasif10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:14 2015 UTC,"Just asking, in what way was the Kirito- Sugu relationship great? Sugu is from her introduction on a completeley useless character. If you take her out of the story and make her some random friend, it would end exactly the same way, the whole romance dynamic didn't hit me positively at all.   Her cousin get's imprisoned in a VR game andthe first thing she does after it is buy one herself? And she just happens to meet Kirito in the first second he joins the game, doesn't know who he is, falls in love with her cousin and then when that doesn't work out she, oh wonder, falls in love with Kirito ingame which turns outto be her cousin :shock:  That whole shock doesn't work though because we as viewers know who she is from the first moment and it was obvious what will happen.  They could have kept her, playing AlfhO a secret and revealed it later on nd it could have been very cool, or she could have been the one to see asuna and tell Kirito about it and help him then. Same story, with better dynamic.  Glad you liked it though, mothers rosario will rip your heart to shreds though:("
swordartonline,3e3nx1,ZeHaffen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:38 2015 UTC,well if she wondered why so much of Kirito's time was in SAO and a year later was when she decided to see why her brother was fascinated by it by buying ALFhiem and playing it. Also i reckon it was better that we knew Suguha was Leafa. it gives it more reason on her point of view why she loves Kirito IRL and in-game. But yes kinda a coincidence they bumped into each other
swordartonline,3e3nx1,ZeHaffen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"kinda a coincidence they bumped into each other   Actually, it's explained by Yui. When Kirito asks why he didn't spawn in Spriggan territory, Yui says that it's possibly because someone near him dove at the same time and caused interference. That someone was Leafa, putting their spawn locations close together and, through Yui's guidance with the map, Kirito found her without much difficulty."
swordartonline,3e3nx1,ZeHaffen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:50:50 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, this is gonna be a long post.   Sugu is from her introduction on a completeley useless character.   This is entirely untrue and I don't even want to get into all the ways she's important. That would be a long post.   If you take her out of the story and make her some random friend, it would end exactly the same way, the whole romance dynamic didn't hit me positively at all.   Mostly the same as above, though the romance was important for character development for both her and Kirito.   Her cousin get's imprisoned in a VR game andthe first thing she does after it is buy one herself?   Yes, that's explained. Not only is the AmuSphere designed for safety, she also wanted to know exactly what drove Kirito away from his family a few years prior.   she just happens to meet Kirito in the first second he joins the game   Explained, they logged in at the same time which caused Kirito's spawn location to change. Thus he was near her and found her quickly through Yui's help.   doesn't know who he is   The anime doesn't do the best job of showing it, but in the LNs his ALO avatar is far different than his normal look. One big difference is that he is described as having ashy colored skin.   falls in love with her cousin and then when that doesn't work out she, oh wonder, falls in love with Kirito ingame which turns outto be her cousin   Because of his drastic personality changes and, I'm assuming, the hormones of a 15 year old girl. Then meeting someone online who has similar personality traits as the person you're in love with but don't want to be, of course she's going to fall in love again. As pointed out above, she just didn't know it was the same person.   That whole shock doesn't work though because we as viewers know who she is from the first moment and it was obvious what will happen.   I'd agree here, but that wasn't used for shock value for the viewer. It was used as a way to develop the relationship between the two, which it did a very good job of.   They could have kept her, playing AlfhO a secret and revealed it later on nd it could have been very cool   That's what they did, Kirito didn't know it was Sugu until episode 20-something. She even told him at the beginning of the arc that she had a secret she didn't want to tell him yet. If you mean keep it a secret from the viewer, that wouldn't have had the same effect. Keeping us in the dark like that would have brought up a ton of issues with her motives, especially considering some of the scenes between us knowing she's Leafa and Kirito knowing she's Leafa.   she could have been the one to see asuna and tell Kirito about it and help him then.   If that happened, not only would it completely change the way the relationship was developed, it would likely cause other problems. Not going to bother getting into it, but I can think of a few off the top of my head."
swordartonline,3e3nx1,archon80,2,Wed Jul 22 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"You are aware that marrying your first cousin is common around the world, including in Japan right? Hence she thought it wasn't as bad, though she did mention multiple times that it was wrong and wanted those feelings to go away. Like OP said, part of it was that she was confused and the other part was probably hormones since she was 15."

She fell in love with her cousin's personality, as you can't really help who you fall for. She's a tragic hero, because while she was trying to move past the relationship with her cousin by finding a new guy, but with a similar traits/personality, she then finds out that that very guy is still her cousin.. and she has her heart broken yet again.

Klein wasn't a beater so it would probably be more focused on him growing his skills in SAO. That being said I would have watched but probably be less interested because the whole Kirito and Asuna thing would have never happened and the show would have a completely different outcome.Klein wasn't at all aware of what happened in the end of the SAO arc with Heathcliff so they may have all ended up dead by floor 100.  Summary: Would have stilled watched but probably enjoyed a lot less"
swordartonline,3e3vis,Angwar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:25 2015 UTC,You know I think I actually like Klein more as a character than Kirito from first impressions (not counting later in the story because that would be unfair) but the lovestory between Asuna and Kirito is just to good. If something similar happened with Klein it would have still been fun to watch I am sure.
swordartonline,3e3vis,Starkiller2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:10 2015 UTC,Klein having more focus would be interesting to me in part because he maintained a powerful clearing guild while also running the only guild with a 100% survival rate.  Trying to do one of those is hard enough.

I would expect the next few bosses to be easier than the Skull Reaper, but still stronger than the Gleam Eyes.    The difficulty of the floor 75 boss would probably be reached by floor 85, considering the 10 level safety net (which many players were probably over, there's no way each player only levels up once per floor)."

There is a whole second season with 24 episodes that is partly dubbed into English. As far as I know they are currently at episode 15 with the dub. And even better, that won't be the end of it! The original novels are already developed much further in the story and the author says that he is far away from finishing the story. Also the creators of the anime confirmed that they will keep producing the anime as long as the novels continue!   As for recommendations I can't help you to much as I have not watched a lot of anime either. I can however recommend Rosario Vampire and Elfenlied. That said a lot of people are recommending Fate Zero and Danmachi/Is it wrong to pick up Girls In a Dungeon? I haven't watched these (yet) so I can't give you my take on them."

swordartonline,3dyhmg,RealityRush,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"and the author says that he is far away from finishing the story.   Er, correction here, he's never said that.  In all likelihood he's rather close as he's discussed his options in interviews about what he's doing after finishing SAO/Accel World, and he's nearing where the web novels themselves ended.  But the story is still progressed far past the anime itself, so there's at least another couple seasons of anime planned for certain.  Maybe even 3 more.  Though I dearly hope not longer than that because SAO needs a proper ending.  Edit: Also, Fate/Zero warning.  Unlike SAO, it is the most tragic and depressing thing I've ever seen, be forewarned.  Still an amazing show, 10/10.  It's definitely worth watching, but it isn't a cute love story and happy ending like SAO ;P"

I just finished reading the arc last night and I have to admit it is probably one of the best arcs imo I cant wait for Volume 16 to be translated it really is amazing!!

I know that's partially the fault of the medium (anime isn't great at conveying the complex descriptions of things like game mechanics present in the LNs) and partially the fault of the fact that the source material was old and primitive (hence the existence of Progressive), but after watching it I couldn't help but start thinking about how I'd write the story.  Add that to the fact that I don't read the LNs (it's not that the material doesn't interest me, I just really don't like they way they're written/translated, the style irks me) and I had all I needed to try my hand at writing a story myself.    Granted, the fanfiction I intend to write is more of a ""let's start from square one"" fanfiction where I start from the beginning with some very distinct changes to make the characters and the later stages of the story more coherent.  A prime example of this is planning out how the end stages of Aincrad play out so as to include the last 25 floors, because I think that's a place that can be expanded upon easily.  At the end of the day, people's interests vary, so whether or not fanfiction tickles your fancy (or what type therein, since fanfiction is a broad term) is entirely up to you.  If you like it, more power to you.  If you don't, there's no need to read it.  Some prefer to stick to canon, while others like to see what people can do with the series.  It also goes without saying that there is a very wide range of quality within fanfiction, and I'd venture to say the vast majority is... below average.  Even if you like fanfiction as a concept, finding one that really resonates with you can be difficult, but hey, that's half the fun of searching."

swordartonline,3dtqcr,Handuer,6,Sun Jul 19 14:33:12 2015 UTC,What people seem to forget that putting someone inside a virtual world has already been done multiple times. It's getting that world to provide physical stimuli that will be the real challenge.
swordartonline,3dtqcr,unkillable94,2,Sun Jul 19 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Sources please? Closest to virtual I'm aware of is Occulous, or Augmented Reality, but nothing quite like SAO styled VR, physical stimuli not withstanding."
swordartonline,3dtqcr,TheDrellAssassin,2,Sun Jul 19 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"Oculus Rift is a product intended for consumers. There have been military devices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars' range that could be very immersive.  Also, please do try Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. They are actually very good, or so I have read about the Vive at least. I have only tried Oculus Rift DK2."
swordartonline,3dtqcr,roberh,2,Sun Jul 19 18:22:17 2015 UTC,"I've tried the Rift, and it is definitely immersive, as can the military grade stuff. It's definitely cool technology and a step in the directions of VR... But I wouldn't quite say we've sent people into a virtual world yet, by any stretch. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing cool tech, and I'm super excited for it, but its hardly sending people into a virtual world in the sense we're usually talking when discussing nerve gear."

swordartonline,3dtqcr,unkillable94,2,Mon Jul 20 03:53:30 2015 UTC,Couldn't you achieve by mimicking the signal the brain sends to paralyze your body so you don't act out your dreams? Only thought of this cause of a /r/askscience.
swordartonline,3dtqcr,Dauntless236,3,Sun Jul 19 18:59:44 2015 UTC,Oh i have never heard about that.
swordartonline,3dtqcr,Handuer,3,Sun Jul 19 19:01:37 2015 UTC,Yea your brain sends a signal when you fall asleep to paralyze your body so you don't move in your sleep.
swordartonline,3dtqcr,Dauntless236,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:22 2015 UTC,I assume it must send a similar signal when you wake?
swordartonline,3dtqcr,Davixxa,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:21 2015 UTC,Or at least a counter signal. So at least that part of the nervegear problem is solved. We just need to be able to input now I think.
swordartonline,3dtqcr,Dauntless236,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and that's the problem, we still need to be able to even input that signal at all xD"
swordartonline,3dtqcr,Davixxa,2,Mon Jul 20 07:18:37 2015 UTC,SAO is at least 10 years away. As much as I hate to admit it but it is the truth. Stay healthy so you can enjoy the glorious age of VR!
swordartonline,3dtqcr,Squat1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd like to see some invasive procedures done in this line of work. An idea I had was to research into the chemicals that the nerves interact with each other with. The nervous system we're interested in works through chemicals been released from axon 1 and being received by axon 2 (simplified). If we could differentiate between the chemicals being used by the body (if there is such a difference) E.G. chemical a = Right leg, chemical b right arm ect ect and surgically attach something to the spinal cord that could transmit this information to a computer we could help paraplegics  and quadriplegics with the help of exoskeletons - at the start it would be very basic, but I'm sure even walking slowly would be a dream for these people. With this comes funding for furthering research to develop a nervegear type of thing and puts us in a position to have a better chance to get the nervegear by a reasonable date."
swordartonline,3dtqcr,DATorment,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"We already know which chemical makes you paralyzed while you're sleeping so we could use this ,but we still need to transfer images to the brain which would be hard now."
swordartonline,3dts20,GnarlyBellyButton69,25,Sun Jul 19 11:32:06 2015 UTC,"What's-his-face could have been adopted into the Yuuki family, but also not become a creepy sonofabitch by letting his sexual fantasies out on duplicate NPC asuna instead of scarring the best character in the series. That way, ""Hero-kun"" would get the prize, and get to actually spend time with Asuna and marry her, the Creepy guy could just get adopted and inherit the business as expected.   You're forgetting that it's not just that he was physically attracted to her, though. What he got off on was making her suffer. There's a reason he didn't just wipe her memories and make her his slave as soon as he was able to - he wanted her to resist.  I mean, in the last rape scene he specifically says something like ""You can't make NPCs make these facial expressions"", so...   Like it's saying ""LOOK! THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE SERIES IS GETTING GROPED AND RAPED! PULL OFF YOUR PANTS AND START SWIRLING YOUR HOTDOG TO AND FRO!"". I had started to grow on Asuna because of just how adorable she is, and seeing how strong she was in Sword Art Online and pretty much in fact being stronger than Kirito on top of having the most human personality in the series, and seeing her get raped started to actually get on my nerves and start to ebb at me mentally. It started to make me legitimately uncomfortable. Seriously, who thought at any point during making this show did someone think ""Let's have the deuteragonist, the best character in the whole series, get pointlessly raped for an entire arc!""   I don't think you really understood the point of Asuna's situation in Fairy Dance. The scenes with Asuna and Sugou are supposed to show how hard she's fighting against him mentally. It isn't pointless; it shows just how strong of a character she is, even when she's basically powerless.  There's maybe one real fan service scene in that arc, and it doesn't involve Sugou."
swordartonline,3dts20,OmegaVesko,4,Sun Jul 19 12:32:32 2015 UTC,"There's maybe one real fan service scene in that arc, and it doesn't involve Sugou.   Er, while they don't involve Sugou, there's definitely more than 1 fan-service scene in FD.... there's like 4 or 5 just off the top of my head, probably more ;P  Unless you mean like a whole scene devoted to it and not just boob/butt-shots, then I guess there's only one O.o"
swordartonline,3dts20,RealityRush,4,Sun Jul 19 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"Despite how the arc went, people often forget what Sugou's end goal was. Money.  Why did he want to marry Asuna? Because her family owns RECT, and in this situation he can inherit the company directly, as the legal son.  Having Asuna was a bonus. But she's defiant and spiteful, so he kept her in a cage until he could finish his research on mind-control, that way she could act the part of an obedient wife when she got out.  Of course, Kawahara was never good with writing characters, and he went overboard with Sugou. He went from calculating evil-goatee villain, to fuck-retarded ""please hate me as much as you can"" evil villain.  He was meant to be hated, and you can tell with the cheap writing meant to set him up as the villain."

Sugou went so overboard as a stupid evil character that I found him pathetic and weak way more then someone I could actually hate. I even felt bad then the hero maimed him."
swordartonline,3dts20,SasoriTheOverlord,5,Sun Jul 19 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"Instead of letting Asuna turn into a Class 87 sex slave, why didn't he just duplicate her, and turn that duplicate into an NPC, and bang that one out left and right instead of molesting Best Girl Asuna?   Er, first off, Sugou enjoyed seeing her suffer as much as he enjoyed Asuna's body itself, this wasn't just about sexual gratification.  Otherwise he would have just wiped her memories and made her into a robotic sex slave.  It was about power, as rape usually is.  He wanted her to remember all she had lost and suffer for it, because he's a lunatic and a sadist.   seeing her get raped started to actually get on my nerves and start to ebb at me mentally. It started to make me legitimately uncomfortable.   Then the show/character did their job.  Sugou was very obviously meant to be hated, and apparently the show succeeded at making you feel as such.   Yes, we're supposed to hate him, and he fulfilled his purpose, but it started to make me actually hate the show for a while.    Eh, here's the thing though, SAO handled it fairly tastefully I found, ignoring the aforementioned tentacle scene which was terrible and should never have existed.  They didn't eroticize it like they could have, they made it detestable, which honestly I have to give props to A-1 for taking the high-road when it came to the actual sexual assault.  I mean, I can't tell you what you should enjoy, that's your prerogative, but wanting to avoid art because it touches on sensitive subjects I find kind of sad.   ""Let's have the deuteragonist, the best character in the whole series, get pointlessly raped for an entire arc!""   It wasn't pointless, it was to show her inner strength.  We've already been accustomed to her personality and physical skill, it was to show what her mental game was like.  They just went a really dark route to do so."
swordartonline,3dts20,RealityRush,2,Sun Jul 19 15:45:22 2015 UTC,"In a choice between an imitation and the real thing, which would you pick? Sugou had all the power in that game and he knew it. He kept all that was going on from Asuna's family so he had no reason to create a fake. He was also a lunatic. That arc didn't diminish Asuna's chraracter at all. The fact that she made it through that and kept going shows how strong she is. Sugou tried to break her and it didn't happen. She won."
