RandomActsOfPizza,3dkkov,DPStrogen95,3,Fri Jul 17 00:48:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have much knowledge of what community services are available in Canada, but you can probably get some food vouchers from a local community service organisation (such as a neighbourhood centre) or find a place that sells food at lower prices to people with a low income.   Most people are not aware these services exist, but they usually do in some form.   If you get to the point where you can't afford food, there are always homeless shelters and the like that might offer food for free. It may not be ideal, but neither is starving.   In general, seeking other support can be helpful, too (to assist you in navigating your situation, not just the immediate issue of lack of food).   You have internet access, so that's a good start. Search for what's available in your area, and ask around. A local library or welfare office (even a church) might be able to direct you to the places I mentioned above."

RandomActsOfPizza,3ddb0v,ladypage16,5,Thu Jul 16 13:01:00 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you! This is really, really awesome for you to do, however I feel like you should know than many places will not accept a pizza. At least with the shelters I've volunteered at, they wouldn't accept a pizza because 1. They can't split a single pizza. 2. Many shelters will only take food that won't go bad. 3. Pizza can be really harsh on the stomach of someone who has been starving for a along time.   I've only worked with shelters in two states, so I have no idea if that's true to every shelter or area. But if you don't get any people to take you up on the offer, don't think negatively about it, or like it was a waste of time. It's really great that you're willing to do offer up your services to help them. Have you considered offering them to local shelters in your area? An hour or two could definitely help them out, I'm sure!"
RandomActsOfPizza,3ddb0v,ericb45696,2,Wed Jul 15 15:21:40 2015 UTC,I'm sad to hear about the shelters not accepting pizza part but any form of charity pizza giving would be nice.  I currently live in asia and I was thinking there has to be some place that accepts pizza for charity.   Anyway my offer stands until the 2nd of august (right before my start of classes).  I also don't mind them giving it to their local volunteer fire station or any charitable institution.

I go across the street to the taco bell or next door to the starbucks or maybe i walk down the block for some subway. anyway every time i buy a little extra food, maybe 2 extra tacos or another footlong or 1 more coffee with a muffin and i give it to this homeless guy 2 blocks down. his name is roger and i have been bringing him lunch every day for the past 6 years since i was 15. i would sit with him and we would talk, he'd give me advice and id give him company and acceptance. yesterday i went out to lunch 12:30 like always, got 2 footlong subs a 2 large drinks from subway, but when i went 2 blocks down roger wasn't there. instead their were E.M.Ts and cops. i asked one what happened and they told me that a homeless man had been killed last night. that homeless man was roger. roger often talked to me about how he thought his life would have turned out, what he hoped for, and what he feared. he was afraid that when he was gone nobody would care or miss him. well im hear to say the i care. and every day at 12:30 i'll think of roger. every day at 12:30 i""ll go buy my lunch and i'll buy a flower.

He also ate very little, which made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from bad breath.  This made him a super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis.  My sob story is I had to go to the DMV today to renew my permit, and thanks to their fees, I don't have money for dinner. Thanks DMV. As if your customer service wasn't bad enough already, now you've driven me broke."

RandomActsOfPizza,3cmmua,DarcDiscordia,2,Thu Jul 9 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"When lack of pizza causes me to sigh,  Bereft of cheese, and meat, and flaky crust,  And hunger makes me feel as if I'd die,  My stomach shriveled up, and full of dust,  My mind then turns to thoughts of dough and sauce-  There's nothing in this life quite half as great.  The ignorant must suffer such a loss,  To live and die unfulfilled is their fate.  Ah, pizza- beauty in eight equal parts,  Which I could eat until I'm nearly dead.  The pinnacle of culinary arts  Is simply cheese and sauce on hot flatbread.  All wise men know what's best for you or me-  It soothes the soul to have a slice or three.  (I don't know why my mind immediately went ""a poem, you say? Well, that's not difficult enough, how about a fucking sonnet"" but here you go. I call it ""Musings on Ravening Hunger,"" and it took me a good 10 minutes to write, which is about 9 more minutes than I normally put into a post.)"

RandomActsOfPizza,3bpn2m,KevinSays-,2,Fri Jul 3 08:59:18 2015 UTC,Lego is a fickle bitch. I have to admit that ldd has a steep learning curve. Never used it myself. Haven't had to. Currently have over 1000 sets. We are getting out of lego for what its become.   Now we will be doing some things such as winter village. Every year lego puts out a Xmas themed creator set. We will keep that tradition alive. As well as a few others. Doing a yard sale today. Hopefully selling more lego then I give away unlike last week.   Kids show up I gotta be able to make them smile right? All and all we made 1100 last week. So wasn't all bad right? More importantly we made quite a few kids go home happy.   PS the build style you did there we call minimalist or micro scale in the world of lego

RandomActsOfPizza,3bn537,DenverBronco,5,Tue Jun 30 15:54:13 2015 UTC,Its to be expected. I was amazed at how many sob stories there are. Look I been there and I know what its like but pizza isn't the answer. That is two day max food.   Get your ass to a food bank or call a church. Get out of your comfort zone and admit you need help there are so many that will help you I found out. All kinds of places it just requires some damn effort. I don't want to give a pizza to someone that needs it cause they don't have food.   I want to give it to someone that just wants a pizza and maybe will pay it back.
RandomActsOfPizza,3bn537,Not_MyCabbages,3,Tue Jun 30 16:05:36 2015 UTC,Yeah look how many are offering in here as opposed to asking for a hand out. That's just sad to me.

RandomActsOfPizza,3bocf3,fickle_fuck,2,Tue Jun 30 23:20:16 2015 UTC,"Ow, ow, ow. Looks like that would have been mighty painful... And that's literally how I got into my one and only car accident, driver waved for me to make the turn. Huh.  My knee is just a jumbled mess.. I slipped and fell on some ice over 2 and a half years ago (yeah, you read that number right) and did some massive ligament damage to my right knee. Every ligament save one was either torn or completely severed that day as well as a bunch of other not-so-fun stuff. Over the course of the last couple of years I have managed to sever my remaining intact ligament simply by using my leg more than I should have (as in.. using crutches instead of my wheelchair for little things, etc).   So I have been waiting for surgery ever since.. It's a complicated one, I have been to over 10 specialists and they have all told me that this one surgeon, the one I am waiting on my surgery with, is the only one in the country (Canada, where I am) that can tackle something like this. We've gone over the basic game plan and I am supposed to get a bone graft, skin graft, and massive jointed metal rod attached to my leg to hold it all together. Basically, my bones are just sitting on each other right now with no stability. Wanna see something weird? Watch a lady's knee go out to the side at a 90 degree angle.. You get some terrified looks from strangers. :P  Anyway, that's my little sad story. I'm more angry than anything with it now... I'm only 23 and have had the injury since I was 20 so I feel like I am wasting some of my better years. And when the surgery is finally completed I have a 2 year recovery time (including a 6 week hospital stay directly after the surgery) with hopes that I'll get 80% function back. But, honestly, the apartment building where I was living at the time was 99% people over the age of 70. If someone had to go down it was best that it was me, an injury like this could have killed a different resident. Crazy stuff."

I honestly don't mind helping out my fellow redditor in a pinch, but please add a few sincere lines (plus location!) as to why you're in need of pizza.  A good needy story will land you a pie a million times over compared to - ""I'm hungry, could use a pie"" or ""Does this really work, could use a pizza"".    And personally speaking, your comment history speaks volumes. Redective anyone?  If you're overweight or subscribed to shady subreddits,  then you're probably not gonna land a pie - at least from me.    One last thing, if you request a pizza, please check often.  Nothing more frustrating than never hearing a response back from someone I sent a PM 4-5-8 hours ago,  Just how hungry are or aren't you exactly."

RandomActsOfPizza,3b72e4,Mhoku,5,Fri Jun 26 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"Fred started out as a normal potato. A particularly evenly rounded potato, sure, but otherwise normal. No one is quite sure what made Nathan pick him out of the bag in his mother's kitchen, but pick him he did, and it was all downhill from there.   See, Nathan loved to dance, and for some reason, he latched into this potato. He carried it everywhere with him, and called it Fred. At first Nathan's mother tried to take it back, but eventually she decided she had to pick her battles, and this just wasn't one of them. Fred went with Nathan outside, where Nathan danced around the yard. He went with him to watch tv, where he danced to every jingle and theme song. He went with him to bed, where Nathan danced in his dreams.   There is great power in the imagination, you see, and Nathan had a mighty powerful mind, so as he danced with Fred, Fred slowly became aware.   At first he was barely conscious, just the sensation of movement washing over his starchy form as Nathan swung him around. Over time, though, he truly awakened, and Nathan, with all the wisdom of a four year old, thought that if Fred was going to be holding conversations with him, well, shouldn't he have some arms and legs to dance with him as well?   Nursery magic, as we all learned from The Velveteen Rabbit, is a powerful thing, and so Fred got his arms and legs, and oh, did he dance.   He danced under the trees in the front yard with Nathan. He swung wildly around the furniture in the living room with every commercial jingle. He cuddled in close under Nathan's chin at night, and they dreamed of dancing together.   But then, a terrible thing happened. The worst thing happened. Nathan grew up.   It started slowly at first -- he'd forget Fred on the table when he went out to play. Nathan's friends didn't understand why he'd want to carry a potato around, after all, and Fred tried to be understanding. Then Nathan got a stuffed Hulk doll for his fifth birthday, and suddenly Fred was relegated to the floor at night while that green monstrosity tucked up next to his boy. One morning when Nathan got up, he accidentally kicked Fred under the bed.   Fred waited there all day, but Nathan never came back for him. During the second day, he wiggled himself closer to the edge of the bed, where he might be a little more visible, but still, Nathan never came. On day three, Fred felt his arms and legs growing weak without the belief of a child to keep them strong, and he knew he had to do something.   That night, Fred levered himself out from under the bed, and into the red backpack Nathan kept by his desk. He carried it with him every day, and Fred could only hope it would take him somewhere he could get some help.   The next morning, he was jostled around as Nathan ran for the school bus, not noticing the root's added weight to his bag. Fred waited patiently throughout the day in the cool, dark backpack, then when the room went silent after the teacher announced something called 'recess', he began his long climb out.   His arms and legs were weak from too many days without play, but he climbed the spine of the spiral-bound notebook and heaved himself out into the floor with a thud. It had taken him too long, though, and he could hear the children returning. In a panic, he chose a nearby bag, shabbier than Nathan's but close enough to get to, and slid inside just as the teacher opened the door.   The wait seemed interminable as the school day dragged on, then he was once again jostled and tossed around as the bag was brought home.   This home was different, though. There was no mom or dad fixing dinner, no bedroom for each child. Here children were in beds lined up in a long room, and when he climbed out of his bag after dark, he heard one of them crying.   The tears were coming from a girl a little younger than Nathan had been when they first met. Fred clambered up into the bed, and exhausted, tucked himself under her damp chin and hoped for the best.   Fred couldn't have planned it better if he'd tried. Laura was the first of many children he would end up with over the years at the State Group Home. Many had lost their parents, pets, toys, even siblings, and some had begun to lose their hope. Where a grain of imagination was left, though, Fred would step in. Their imagination and innocent belief kept him strong, and his friendship gave them hope.   They all had to grow up eventually, but there were always more children coming in when that happened. The caretakers never knew what caused the change, but it was often remarked upon how a new child would suddenly love to dance. Outside, in the rec room, even to jingles on commercials. Fred the dancing potato danced on through the years, bringing joy to the children that needed it the most."
RandomActsOfPizza,3b72e4,kika988,2,Fri Jun 26 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"""Dance.""   Fred wouldn't move.  ""I said DANCE!!!""  Fred shook as the potato he once called his friend now aimed the gun straight at his wife's forehead. He had no other option. Through the tears and blood streaming down his face, he put on a fake smile and began to dance.  ""Good.... keep dancing, my old friend...""  Gordon began to laugh beneath his breath. After all these years, he was finally getting payback for what Fred had done to his family. The heartbreak, the backstabbing, the humiliation... those were all things of the past now. Gordon had the cards in his hand now, and he wasn't going to let Fred or his family live through the night unless they got everything back to them they had coming these thirteen years.  ""How does it feel, Fred? How does it feel to have your life flash before your eyes?"" Gordon began to show his anger now.  ""I... I don't know why you're talking about. I swear, Gordon! Why are you doi--""  ""YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHY I AM DOING THIS, YOU BASTARD!"" Gordon paused for a moment to catch his breath. ""You have lived the last thirteen years in happiness and success with your family while I have done nothing but lived in humiliation and despair. All thanks to you on that night.""  ""Gordon..."" Fred could barely speak. He was running out of breath and blood. ""You know that... that was not my fault...""  Gordon was losing his patience. ""How could it have not been your fault! It was--"" Gordon cut himself off and thought for a moment. He looked over at Fred's oldest son, William. He was over to the child and brought the gun barrel to his head. ""Perhaps your son can help you remember.""  ""Please! I'm begging you, Gordon. Please stop! PLEASE!"" Fred yelled. His tears ran harder now, but not as hard as his wife's, who Fred could tell was trying to scream frantically through the gag in her mouth. ""Gordon, I'm serious, I don't know what--""  ""KEEP DANCING OR YOUR SON DIES THIS INSTANT!""  Fred danced like he never had before. Moving to the right and to the left with all his might, his arms flailing up and down, and a completely dead but convincing smile on his face. He wiped the blood and tears from the view of his children. He had to be strong for them.  ""Perhaps I'll do the reminding for you, Fred."" Gordon kept the gun firmly placed against William's head. ""Do you remember my fiance, Fred? Clara Starch?""  Fred dropped his smile for a moment. ""Y-yes... I remember... how is she?""  ""The hell if I know! She left me that night and took my little girl with her. I haven't seen them since."" Tears began to roll down Gordon's face now.  ""I... I'm so sorry, Gordon. I didn't mean for that to happen...""  ""My parents no longer speak to me. Every one of my friends stopped visiting."" Gordon became increasingly frantic in his speech. ""I lost my job, I couldn't make payments on my car, my electricity, and then my house. I lived on the street for 7 months, I begged for pocket change! I robbed a local pharmacy to get some damn penicillin! They put me in a mental facility for nine years! NINE FUCKING YEARS, FRED!!! Do you know what that's like? To have your entire life stripped away from you, put in a cell where you can't even see the light of day for months at a time, slowly losing every last bit of your sanity, all because of a FUCKING PRANK YOU PULLED THAT YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER!!!""   Gordon couldn't hold back any longer. He pulled the gun away from William, aimed at Fred, pulled the trigger, and fell to the ground as William lunged forward at him. But the shot had already been fired. It was too late. The bullet had missed it's target-- Fred's heart-- but instead hit his neck, and ultimately, his spinal cord.  William ran to his father and fell on his chest.  ""He's still alive!"" he called out to his mother. Barely, though. He needed to get to a hospital fast. William heard a sound behind him.  ""I don't regret what I have done."" said Gordon. He grabbed the gun as William raced toward him, but another shot was fired, this time, into the back of Gordon's throat. Gordon got what he wanted-- his revenge-- and could live no longer.  Four months later, William, his mother, and two younger sisters crowded around Fred's hospital cot as he began to wake up. His eyes opened, but there was something wrong with him still. He had not died on the outside, but through those eyes, there was no doubt he was dead inside. He smiled, but it was the same smile he put on when forced to dance in front of Gordon. Weeks passed, and he was able to get out of bed, and eventually walk. No words left his mouth at any time. One day, his leg started to twitch. He stood up and began to rock back and forth. His arms swung up and down as he began to dance.   And dance.   And dance.   He couldn't stop. He never would. He had no soul inside him. All that was left of him was his final memory before being shot-- dancing away with a gun pointed at his family, never knowing whether he or they would live through that night. Truth is, Fred never did. For the rest of his days, he would simply come to be known as Dancing Fred, for never did he cease dancing until the day he fried.   The End.  Edit: spelling"

RandomActsOfPizza,3b72e4,GreatCatch,2,Fri Jun 26 22:49:43 2015 UTC,"Potatoes Aren't Just for Eating  A Love Story  Fred hated his ordinary name, hated his bumpy skin, and hated himself. When he wasn't more than halfway through potato puberty, he had already sunk into depression. He felt so uncomfortable in his own skin, and he longed to be different.   Something was wrong with him. He didn't like the things that other potatoes liked, and it had been this way for years. The other potatoes hung out in cliques, not letting Fred near their underground tunnels. He wasn't cool enough for them because he wouldn't take their dares and get drunk.  One day, Fred was extracted from the damp, muddy soil by a human. The farmer, Matt, was an idealistic young man who had moved to the country a few months ago. Matt had never harvested potatoes before, and was so pleased at Fred's size, shape, and texture.  At first, Fred pretended to be dead. He didn't know if this man was a threat. After receiving numerous compliments, Fred felt he should thank Matt, so he stuttered out a thank you. Matt jumped and almost dropped Fred.  To make a long story short, Fred and Matt became best friends. Matt needed a friend who understood the life on a farm, and understood how to increase crop health. Fred helped the crops so much. Without Fred, Matt would have probably moved back to the city, because Matt was not exactly a green thumb.  Having a good friend helped Fred overcome his baggage from those dark underground days. Fred smiled when he was around Matt, and couldn't imagine life without him.  Incredibly, the feeling was mutual. Matt had to go slowly because Fred was inexperienced sexually. Fred had only tried kissing and making out with girls, because of peer pressure, and realized he didn't like it very much. Now, Fred was able to explore with someone he trusted and loved very much.  Fred even came to love himself, and his skin developed a healthy glow. Fred still has an unusually large nose for a potato, and small eyes, but none of that matters, because he is happy.  So today, Fred dances, because he is allowed to marry Matt legally. They have waited for this day, and it will be the happiest day of their lives. Fred knows that he will still get some nasty looks because he's a potato, and people look down on potatoes. Matt knows that they will get some nasty looks from people who make assumptions about their relationship. But every day, they are happy and thankful, they are together, and Fred dances."

RandomActsOfPizza,3b72e4,Broodd,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"The Latvian Potato  Early in the morning of August 24th, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.  On October 5th 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a ""mutual assistance"" pact with the Soviet Union.  They were ordered to send 10,000 barrels of potatoes a year on land that could barely harvest 5000 barrels.  World war II had just started, and there was much famine though out Latvia, and no potato. But then they found him.  They fucking found waldo and everything was really chill for like a day. But suddenly, amiss the mischief, a talking potato named Fred entered town.  Fred had a lot of knowledge about hydroponic agriculture and also dabbled in aquaponics.  Fred showed the Latvians how to properly harvest 20,000 barrels of potatoes.  But the war became more intense than anyone could have imagined, and famine still grew amongst Latvians.  One father told his daughter he would fly her to America, where there is abundance of potatoes.  She cried with joy, only for her father to use her tears to salt the very last family potato.  There was no plane in Latvia.  No dream for girl, just famine.  But Fred had a plan. Dancing.  If Fred could just dance long enough, everybody would forget about the lack of potato.  It's genius.  So he danced.  It did nothing.  Millions died.  He dances over their graves. Fred.  Fred the unstoppable.   Potatoes only bring war."

He was a small potato with aspirations of dancing anywhere and everywhere. Shortly after the tragic auto accident of '89, Fred was born anew. He had been given a new lease on life.   Fred made the decision to move to Austin, TX. A city he heard where no man,woman or potato feared discrimination by being either weird and outrageous.   Fred the dancing potato continues to live his dream on Red River street in the heat of Texas, loved by locals and tourists alike.

RandomActsOfPizza,3b72e4,AviationAtom,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:57:20 2015 UTC,"Fred’s lungs tightened as a cloud of smoke expanded into his lungs. He hung his head downward as the smoke escaped through both sides of his mouth and floated up from his front porch into the night sky.   “You know that shit’ll kill ya’, right?”   “Here’s hoping.”  John took a seat on the suspended bench next to the front door. He began to tap his finger against the armrest. Air jetted out of his nose as he chuckled lightly.  “Do you remember when we used to go out on nights like these? You, me, Russet. Doing some sort of crazy ass thing to get in trouble? Like the night we played mailbox baseball. Those cops were pissed, man, I tell ya’.”  Fred put the cigarette to his lips and inhaled deeply. He hadn’t looked up once since John had arrived. John put his palm against his forehead and sighed.  “Come on, man. It’s been months now. We miss you.”  Silence filled the air as Fred stomped out his cigarette. Shaking, he turned toward John who was still tapping his finger against the armrest. It’s not that he was impatient, in fact, he seemed deeply concerned for Fred’s wellbeing. Fred smiled as he thought about how John was a serial fidgeter. From the pencils he would tap against the desks in high school, to the foot that he tapped against the ground when he came up to his door to tell him that he accidentally hit his dog. Even at the dance competit-  Fred winced and hung his head downward again.  “I know,” Fred replied, “I just don’t even know what to do with myself anymore.”  “You can’t blame yourself Fred. You’ll drive your self insane that way.”  Fred snapped his head toward John.  “Then who do I blame, John? It was my fucking fault! I knew that the move was risky, and I let her do it anyway!”  “She knew it was risky too, damn it. She was a smart girl and we all miss her. Sarah was one of a kind. Fuck lighting a room with her smile, she could light up all of Manhattan... But you need to move on!  The empty cigarette pack flew across the front lawn as Fred threw it.  “I can’t!” Fred said through an exasperated sigh. “All she knew was dancing, and she was all that I knew...”   The tapping against the armrest of the bench stopped as John sat down next to Fred.  John looked at Fred; “Hey.” Fred’s eyes met John. “You can still be with her. She’s right here. You just have to do what you know, and she’ll always be right here with you.”  “What the hell does that mean?” Fred protested as John walked off of the front porch.   With a slight smirk on his face, John turned to Fred and said with a knowing look;   “Dance.”"

RandomActsOfPizza,3b3ph0,Sabnitron,8,Thu Jun 25 19:49:36 2015 UTC,Only explanation I can think of that makes sense.
RandomActsOfPizza,3b3ph0,StevenMulraney,5,Thu Jun 25 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"Well, you started by calling them junk on reddit. That's a good start. I'd have done worse.   I think, instead of the points, which come at $5 a piece (5x29= a lot), I'd relate the cost they'd be taking on to fix the problem to the cost of making a pizza. If they just let you have a pizza for carry out, they'd be resolving the CS issue for a tiny bit of money.   Granting you $145 in credits is way more than $1.5-$2 in pizza. They probably have a lower barrier to making nice with customers with that way smaller price tag, and the representative is probably more willing to be accommodating then because ""it's only two bucks"".   The franchise owner probably wouldn't miss it either."
RandomActsOfPizza,3b3ph0,StevenMulraney,6,Thu Jun 25 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"The current promo code is supposed to give 25 points after one order, which is where the 29 comes from, which would equate to one pizza anyway, plus the 4 points from the actual order.  I'm just upset because, not only am I not getting my points, but that manager is basically calling me a liar by claiming that the order was cancelled and/or never paid for, which is simply untrue. A transaction was made, and that particular store needs to honor it.  I don't think I was too rude in my post, so I'm not too worried about language."

I'm just glad I hold on to my receipts."

But most of all he was a stubborn mother fucker. Two years ago, at age 99, the summer before he passed, he decided he wanted to go up to his home in the white mountains (New Hampshire, 4 hours north of Boston). No one was around to drive him so he stole my moms keys and got in the car. He technically had a license but the dementia had led us to confiscating his car a few years prior.  The second we noticed, obviously we called the police. We had the state troopers searching for the car all along the 180 mile trip to the mountains. But you know what? That fucker knew we would have the police searching! So he took a 7 hour detour through nowhere Maine, up to the Canadian border, then back down through the northern NH mountains, all the way to his house. The cops found him at his favorite bar the next day... That was the last time my grandfather drove a car, and also the last time he made it to his home in the mountains. I'm just glad the crazy bastard didn't kill anyone along his joy ride! But he had one hell of a last hurrah!"

So there's this painter, and he's just scored the job of his life when a Caltholic Cathedral hire him to restore a magnificent painted ceiling.  He loves it- dangling from the ceiling, restoring frescoes and fine art from ages past, the inspirational artwork a real privilege. As time wears on, though, he finds himself a little distracted by the activity in the Cathedral. Suspended from his harness, most people come and go oblivious to his presence.  One day, this old lady comes in by herself, when no-one else but the painter is present. She kneels quietly at a pew by herself - praying inaudibly. The Painter decides to have a bit of fun. Putting on his best booming voice, using the echoey chamber of the cathedral to fullest effect he calls  ""My daughter, this is Jesus. what do you desire?""  Nothing happens. Woman doesn't even flinch. Just carries on kneeling, eyes closed, praying inaudibly. The Painter thinks she must have let her hearing aid go or something, so he tries again:  ""MY DAUGHTER, THIS IS JESUS. WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?""  Still nothing! The painter can't believe it, so he tries one more time:  ""MY DAUGHTER, THIS IS JESUS - WHAT DO YOU DESIRE?  The irritated woman shakes her head and says ""Be quiet please Jesus, I'm talking to your mother!"""

RandomActsOfPizza,3aux89,malicetodream,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:29:31 2015 UTC,"So I received this text on my phone last summer right before bed at like 11:30pm that said, ""Keri's been in labor like 8 f'ing hours I am hungry and all I want to do is eat and go to bed!' I had no idea who it was so I just sent back wrong number. To cut to the chase after flirty text and some pictures I go to meet this random stranger at a birthing clinic to ""hang out"" and get some food while her friend is stuck in labor. So I drive up there meet her and we hang out in my car smoke some cigs and listen to the buzzard until I just go for it. We start making out and the next thing I know my seat is kicked back and she is straddling my face and blowing me super hard. This is in a parking lot of a birthing clinic at like 1230-1am and I blast off and just fill her mouth because I am that excited. So we kind of finish up get re-situated and she says she is now really hungry. The only thing open around us this late is Taco Bell. So we take the ride, get in line, order and things are semi-awkward at this point now that the fun is over. So we roll up to the window and pay, I hand the guy his cash and he's just looking at me like I am an alien. I am thinking,""wtf is this guys problem?' he snaps out of it takes the money, gives change and I roll to the next window. It seriously takes forever for this guy to give me our food and when he comes to the window guy from window 1 is behind them and they are not even trying to keep it together. I get the food, fire sauce and roll on out. So I take the chick back to the birthing clinic, dish the food out and she says she better go check on her friend, says it was fun and bolts. At this point I am tripped out, I though it was fun and she seemed real turned on even if it was some stranger danger fun, and what was with those taco bell fucks laughing. Ah who cares? So I roll home and get ready for bed, I needed to take a leak so bad! I walk into the bathroom and take my whiz and go to wash my hands, and I see it. It looks like I have clown make up on my face, red wings to beat the fucking band son. I suddenly realize why everything was so awkward. I just kinda of yell ew! wash my face and go to bed. I am pretty sure my last thought was at least I got off. TD;LR : late night hooked up with random texter in birthing clinic, went through taco bell drive through with red wings."

Fortunately, he's very close to a mechanic, so he pushes his car over there.   When he gets over there, the mechanic says that he'll find out what's wrong and that the penguin should be able to come back in two hours. The penguin says,  ""Well, alright. There's an ice cream parlor across the street anyway."" Which worked out because he loved ice cream.  Well, the time passes, and the penguin makes his way over to the mechanic again. When he arrives, the mechanic says ""Looks like you blew a seal.""  The penguin replies, ""No, no, that's just ice cream on my face!"""

So last might my friend and I were starving and had no way of making money so we were trying to sell people the only thin we had...a magic bullet. So we end uo do icing around and hanging out at a park. The park was full of homeless people and they told us to come over and hang out so we went over and kept them company for a little bit as they passed us around a bottle of Yukon Jack. Eventually my friend and one of the guys gets to talking and the homeless guy says that his drug dealeroften makes trades and buys random things off of him and other customers. So we drive over to this dealers house and the homeless guy gets out of the car and runs in to talk to the dealer. He had no idea what a magic bullet was and he was convinced it was called a magic bowler so we had to run through his sales pitch for him multiple times before he headed in. My friend and I wait there for about 30 mins until the guy comes back out gets in the car and say ""fuck guys im so sorry I thought for sure he would guve us something for it, i know for a fact he loves bowling I dont know why he didn't take it!"" My friend and I just look at each other laugh and drive the guy back. After he gets out of the car I was telling my friend how rediculous of an idea thay was to try and sell a homeless guy a magic bullet. What could hw possibly need a blender for haha. I told him I would be been absolutely shocked if it worked out and he claims that in his mind there was a 30% chance that he would be able to off this magic bullet to a homeless guy's drug dealer. It was an interesting night to say the least."

RandomActsOfPizza,3aojy0,fractals_of-light,2,Mon Jun 22 13:58:49 2015 UTC,"Many ways! Shoot who you want a PM asking for their email and what pizza places they have around them. If they have one of the main chains I recommend getting them an e-card. If not you can always order it for them, but screenshot the payment and order placement so they can see its paid for and how long to expect when it gets there. And make sure you look at their account first, check out their history so if someone tries to make a fake account close to theirs you can call them out on it. I'm not sure what else I'm missing but there's many ways to go about this"

RandomActsOfPizza,39z4y0,TesticleTophat,2,Mon Jun 15 23:33:45 2015 UTC,"I think we're not allowed to ""apply"" via PM so I'll just post my situation here. It's not so much a sob story (I think?) but more like a series of unfortunate events.  Background info, which is kind of pertinent to my current situation: I'm a 27 year old female. I grew up in an extremely twisted, verbally abusive household, had to endure multiple days of sleep deprivation and was ""borderline"" sexually abused...more like harassed, I guess. (I've been told by counselors that my father sounds like a paranoid schizophrenic.)  For years I ended up drinking and doing drugs to deal with my depression and severe anxiety.  Today: I have been sober for almost a year, am engaged to a wonderful person, and am going to school for social work so I can help others deal with their addictions.  The ""sob story"": I only get money when I'm in school. It's the summer. Today I quit my job at a call center, nearly in tears, because none of the programs were working and customers were livid. I was basically told to just make excuses and end the calls without really helping anyone. I can't take that environment where I'm helpless to help people and getting yelled at. So obviously, I'm broke. I need to work at least 20 hours a week to get food stamps, but less than 30 or else I earn too much. (I never land in either acceptable bracket.)  Also, I am at least eligible for free therapy, but I don't even have money for the bus. Today has been rough, to say the least. I have about $6 in my bank account until Friday, but at least that will be a decent (""last"") paycheck.  But, I'm generally happy, and life is pretty great despite everything. It's just going to be a rough 10 more weeks and life will go back to ""normal."""

I hope that more people in a position of giving to others will do what they can because even if it is just a pizza it really does make a difference.

Well that wasnt gonna happen. In order to finish my financial aid application they wanted tax documents that I wasn't sure existed from my mother. (still havent resolved this issue and as a result I'm now two terms behind graduation)  So now I just want to go home. Well before that happens I need to renew my ID cuz its expired( and lost in storage.) I go to the local DMV to get an ID and well I need a certified copy of my birth certificate. (All I had at the time was a xerox copy) Okay no problem, I'll just phone home, to Maryland, and ask them to mail it. Wait a week, no mail, phone home again to see what the deal is. . . oh, it's been lost.   Okay sure. I can deal with that.  I'll just content the department of Records where i was born, in Oklahoma, to send me a certified B.C. Apparently you need a state ID to get that. Okay no pro- wait, wait wait thewhole reason I'm calling you guys is to get a  BC to get the ID but you're telling me first I need the ID??  As it turns out there are forms of secondary ID that you can provide(provided you have them) to request a BC but this takes significantly longer to verify and produce so here I am, squatting in my brothers' fraternity's house trying to sort this whole mess out, waiting to receive a BC from another state, so I can get an ID from a this state, so I can get on a plane to my Home state, so I can find some tax records so I can finish school before I'm an old man. All the while, just wishing I had some pizza to fill my stomach and stop distracting me. ಠ_ಠ I can't even get a job because I would just be leaving in a couple weeks to get this thing moving so of course money is getting tight.That makes this easier, naturally.   Oh wow, I hope I win cuz this is sobbier than I remember it being.    Edit: whether I win or not, OP is super dope for doing this. Few people are  this giving for so little is return.

RandomActsOfPizza,39yada,ander3jc,3,Mon Jun 15 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Nope, you'll have the points you already have on your account plus the bonus 25 points they're offering.  The 25 bonus points will expire on July 12th but, your earned points from past orders will not expire nor be cancelled out/capped out.  So yep, you'll have 40 points, 25 of those you'll need to use by 7-12-15 others won't be affected at all.  PS thanks for posting this to the sub!!"

RandomActsOfPizza,39seh7,AdmiralCheesecake,11,Sun Jun 14 12:36:22 2015 UTC,"The downvoting used to be worse than it is now if you can believe that.  We disabled the downvoting in our sub about a year ago.  Prior to that, the downvotes were horrible compared to what they're at now.  Unfortunately, aside from disabling them (which is already done) there isn't anything we can do.  The people who are doing the downvoting are either disabling our style in the sub or going to folks profile pages and downvoting that way.  If going to a profile, karma isn't affected but...I realize this isn't about the karma.  I too agree the downvoting shouldn't be happening but, there will always be a few in the bunch who do it.    They could be downvoting because they don't like the post, they have a post themselves and think downvoting others will bring more attention to them or even, for no reason other than they're bored and have nothing better to do with their time.  It sucks, I know but....up and downvoting is part of reddit.  I do notice that those who complain/comment about their stuff being downvoted receive more downvotes for complaining/commenting about it.  Is it right?  Nope.  Is it fair?  Nope.  However, such is life.  Try not to let the voting get to you, especially if you are a person requesting in the sub.  Don't take it personally, people sometimes do it to get a rise out of you and if you give them that...they've won.  Brush it off and keep pushing forward is my best advice."

Also, we have mod messaging as well where you can write in about any issues you are having or see happening on another thread.

Now that I'm in college and an ""adult"" this is how I feel...  http://imgur.com/7kRsttI  Anyway, tips for your freshman year...   Show up to every single class, even if you think you don't need to. The only times I ever skipped class was when I was extremely sick. Always take notes even if you think you'll remember what was being discussed. This is especially important if you have to write essays. Also, make sure your notes are well organized and legible. My first semester of college I made the mistake of just scribbling down notes which didn't help me any since I couldn't find or read them. CLEP tests! These are absolutely fantastic and it amazes me that so many people have never heard of them. https://clep.collegeboard.org/ Basically, you can take a test to ""test out"" of your required general education classes. They are fairly inexpensive and if you don't pass, it doesn't show up on your transcript and you can try again later. You don't get a grade, it's just pass or fail but you get college credits for it.  I recommend not getting a messenger bag. Sure, they're cute, but it will give you back problems eventually.   Good luck!"

RandomActsOfPizza,39tiho,Neighborhoodpedo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"1. Drink water after a night of boozing. Alcohol actually dehydrates you and then you go to sleep and your brain is just suffering during that time then you wake up with a hangover. The only time I had a real hangover I didn't finish the night with water.  2. Do things out of the classroom: A job, extra/co-curriculars, volunteer, internship, anything. A high GPA means less and less every year if you don't back it up to show you're well-rounded and shit. They also like to see leadership shit so stick with clubs/groups for years so you can work your way up to president/something else with a fancy title. A large part of getting a job is bullshitting. All you might do in internships/club is fucking make photocopies, but you can spin that in a million different ways in a resume to make it sound better (""technology-proficient,"" ""task-oriented,"" ""point person for scheduling"").  3. I'm a night owl and hate the mornings. Night classes would be a charm, right? Not really, they meet less often, sometimes once a week so then it's 3.5 hours of effin' Chemistry at night which is way worse when it's pitch black at 5pm. I'm not saying don't do them, but be careful about taking a bunch of them every semester and taking boring-ass subjects like economics or accounting (unless of course you focus much better with 1 long class a week vs 4-5 shorter ones).  4. You're probably never gonna be in a position where you're surrounded by so many new people every year. After you get a job you kind of have the same social group outside of work and you'll be hard-pressed to find people at work that doesn't make you want to jump off a bridge talking to them.  5. This should probably be #1, all the freshmen will be wearing their lanyards/keychains with their ID cards and keys around their necks the first few weeks. Don't be a noob, pocket that shit. Nothing screams freshmen louder than wearing lanyards.  6. If you come across the tuition bill you'll see a bunch of little fees that's a very miniscule part of the bill ($2 for library fees here, $3 for student activities there). One of them will be the gym fee. If your school is like most schools, you already get charged for it whether or not you use it. So go to it at least once just to get your money's worth. I'm the most out-of-shape person but there was a 2 week period in my life I stuck to a gym routine and enjoyed it. Gym memberships in real life are expensive as shit, this shit is (basically) free.  7. Rateyourprofessors.com  8. DON'T BUY BOOKS FROM THE BOOKSTORE. I think this is conventional wisdom by this point, but in case it's not. Buy from Amazon. There will be some minor 'teacher packets' that only sell in the bookstore, but for all those $350 books, buy amazon and buy used (you might be able to get away with buying old editions). Be on top of the logistics to make sure you get your books on time (some classes require you to read x number of chapters before the first class, some of those professors will care and others will assign but not give a flying f). If worse comes to worst, order from amazon, buy from the bookstore during the week of/before class and do whatever assignments you need and return it within the 7-day return window while waiting on Amazon to deliver  9. With all that said, rules and lists of what you 'should do' are bullshit. Figure out what works for you  10. Above all, have fun. Or not (see #9).  Shit, I can't believe I stretched that out to 10 items. Pretty much sums up how I finished papers requiring x number of pages. Bullshitting, it's a vital life skill."
