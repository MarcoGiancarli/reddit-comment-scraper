killingfloor,3dz6j5,cky3191,7,Mon Jul 20 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"Since you didn't cover HoE in your video, here's something that works pretty well: parry locking (this is /u/qqnowqq's video). Might get removed with the next patch though. Then the only option left is kiting, which isn't too fun. It's not that it's hard, but it takes so damn long that it's boring.  For general advice, check the description of the video:   -Don't get near Hans, two people near him trigger an instant AoE nerve gas which can kill both players  -Break LoS when Hans finishes leeching players to prevent him from using guns and grenades.  -Don't shoot Hans during the Hunting or Healing phases.  -Have the commandos or supports focus on killing the 10 zeds Hans spawns before shooting him again.  -Try to make him heal near a corner, so you can run around and be safely healed.  -Have extra weapons ready. He's a bullet sponge."
killingfloor,3dz6j5,poyepolomi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:32 2015 UTC,"Parry locking is very exploitable right now, I was able to parry Hanz constantly with my Commando knife. They need to make it more difficult to parry him, with it only being a reasonable chance of success when a zerker parries"
killingfloor,3dz6j5,Mozzykins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:39 2015 UTC,"Simply enable him to use gas nade / explosive nade even if the target is at melee range solves that. Also, make him switch target even if some guy is in melee range.  As of now the AI of zeds are very, very horrible."

killingfloor,3dz6j5,itonlygetsworse,2,Tue Jul 21 02:03:41 2015 UTC,Is there a reason why they are using knife? Isn't the pulverizer a better damage reducing block and has just a slightly slower parry windup?
killingfloor,3dz6j5,AsiaDerp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:39:50 2015 UTC,"The real reason you may want to ask him. What I suspect is he wanted to show how easy it is to parry lock Hans, if he can do that with a knife that have less damage reduction, you can do it with the pulv even easier."
killingfloor,3dz6j5,Centias,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:52 2015 UTC,"Just in case I missed it in the video, I want to point out that after his last heal (Orange -> Red), he will always spam like 15 explosive grenades. Every single time. And every single game, someone forgets this. These nades are almost impossible to see where they land, and a few of them can easily kill one person. Your best bet after his last heal is to simply run the fuck away until all the grenades go off.    The main thing that seems to have been left out is that he has a Poison Nova attack that he will try to use any time more than one person is standing next to him. Two people getting in close will almost always set off this nuke and it does a ton of damage. If you're going to get in close to use the short-range syringe on the person he grabs, make it fast and then get away before he lets go or he might just do it then."
killingfloor,3dz6j5,Centias,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"With your first point, my general tip to just run away whenever Hans throws grenades should suffice but thanks for pointing that out.   I have never encountered the Poison Nova attack. Are you sure that isn't an HoE thing? It could just be that my friends and I just try to keep distance whenever possible (minus my Berserker footage in the video of course)  Thanks for the feedback!"
killingfloor,3dz6j5,Centias,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:35 2015 UTC,"Most people tend to miss that he starts throwing nades after that last heal, but in my experience he always does it right after he lets the person go. At which point a ton of people are crowded in at about 5-10 feet and trying to finish him off quickly instead of paying attention to all those nades landing at their feet.    The poison nova definitely happens on Hard, though he might be less likely to do it on Normal. It's usually not an issue unless everyone goes Support or you have more than one Berserker, since Medic and Command stay back farther, and Support at least has decent enough spread on AA12 to hit him from outside the poison nova's range."

killingfloor,3dsa1j,mokahless,2,Mon Jul 20 06:16:20 2015 UTC,lol at least he contributed fairly well for being a late joiner on the final wave.  So you got that goin for ya.  Most people in my experience will join mid-round and then when people start dying in the final waves they leave because they think it's lost.  Can't tell you how many times we still ended up winning after they left lol.
killingfloor,3dsa1j,Shaojack,2,Sun Jul 19 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"I've noticed people leaving a lot in KF2. This never happened to me in KF1 but for some reason people seem to join and leave a lot and most people don't stay past one game.  I can't count the number of times I've started a game solo, had people joining until we are nearly full around wave 4-5, finish the game then when the new game loads, they start dropping out one by one right before the match starts. I once had 3 people join my game, leave, and rejoin my game again about 3 times in a row.  One of my favourite things about KF1 that seemed to happen a lot was finding a fun group and playing with them for a good 2-4 long games.  I run my own server sometimes too. Used to run a KF1 server also. In KF1, my server was usually always full. When KF2 first came out, my server was mostly full, sometimes empty. Now for some reason, it's always empty.  Kinda sick of playing solo now so lately I've been server jumping to check out all the cool user-created maps people have up."
killingfloor,3dsa1j,LightningBolt101,2,Sun Jul 19 04:01:33 2015 UTC,"This is definitely an issue, mostly on HoE.  The achievement hunters that don't want to or can't actually achieve it try to cheese them.  If you play a lot of HoE you see this non-stop, wave 1-6, no one new joins, then wave 7 hits and people start joining in.  I don't always mind but more often than not it's a player with little to no HoE, suicidal and often probably Hard mode experience and they get murdered.   The only solution atm I have is private password protected servers and seeking other players that actually want to play HoE, however it makes it harder to meet new players since we really don't have a very good in game way of doing this without joining pub games."

killingfloor,3dry6c,AsiaDerp,11,Mon Jul 20 09:00:53 2015 UTC,"The current top-level meta revolves around assault rifles, pulverizers, and emp nades. Support isn't particularly good at any of those. It's not a good reason, and you didn't say you were playing sui/hoe, but this might be it."
killingfloor,3dry6c,Armisael,3,Sat Jul 18 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"It took me 24 levels before I discovered that support isn't particularly good at anything. I was halfway into grinding out level 25 in suicidal custom pubs before I realized how completely worthless I was as a damage contributor when things get rough in later waves.   Here are my thoughts on the matter:  You can't use your AA-12 as your primary weapon, because you don't carry enough ammo. With controlled shooting for the best possible accuracy, it costs almost a full mag to kill a Scrake, and at least two to kill (that is, contribute a portion of damage against) a Fleshpound. On wave 10, you'll be completely out of ammo after the double Fleshpound spawn, and you can't pick up ammo boxes because the berserkers and medics need grenades. I have no idea how to use this weapon effectively given its limitations.  The hunting shotgun also doesn't make a suitable primary weapon in most cases. You have to be close enough to stick the barrel in a mid-tier zed's eye if you want to kill it without reloading, but a Commando can do it just as easily from max range. You can solo a Scrake with three double blasts, but it's high-risk and very situational, and groups don't need superhero lone wolves anyway. This weapon is for exploding a gang of low zeds, as long as they cooperate and go all Three Stooges in a doorway for you.  The M4 is too heavy. It can't be used unless you take +5 carry weight over 10% damage, so that's completely out of the question. I guess you could use M4 + pump-action/hunting shotgun as your loadout and be the bane of Clots and Gorefasts?  Finally, your grenades go bang and hurt Fleshpounds more than anything else you're carrying, but only five times per wave. So there's that."
killingfloor,3dry6c,Gogmagog,4,Sun Jul 19 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"Firstly, you are doing it wrong by shooting FPs at all.   Support is just there to support atm. Or you can buy AA12, AK and DBS so you can shoot all wave long. But this doesnt change the fact that you are not as effective as commandos. You either use your shotgun on single target by trying to head shot (aiming up) and waste all the penetration bonus, or you shoot the body and even a siren require around 10 shell to kill. Most of the time, AA12 is used on EMPed scrake for most supports. Again, single target.  Getting to point blank range is also a NONO for siren and husks. You dont want them screaming/burn the ground even you can kill them in the next second. That's damage you dont need to take. Alternatively, you can AK EMPed scrakes, and AA12 trashes. But TBH if you have trash constantly get into your effective range that means your commando is not good enough. Then good chance your team get swarmed by trashes when the big guys shows up.   Now, most of the support AK trashes, and shoot single target with shotguns. I dont even know why am I am playing support.....I could be zerk for extra EMP and faster FP killing, or I can be the 3rd commando to help killing everything except FPs. Hell... I could even be a second medic for extra medic nade tanking/offperk pulv."
killingfloor,3dry6c,AsiaDerp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"You are not supposed to be the only one doing damage,  you say you need 2 full mags to kill a flesh, well.. in reality you should only need like half a mag since the rest of your team will do the rest. Or do you mainly play solo?"
killingfloor,3dry6c,big_phat_gator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"I don't solo, but I play mostly on pub servers, so sometimes I am actually the only one putting damage on the big zeds. Letting a Fleshpound run tear-assing through the holdout because support isn't the optimal choice for dealing with them isn't going to fly, not that it would matter since I typically expect to lose in any case. There is no organization, there is no communication, the comp makes no sense, but I have to try anyway. That's pub life.  But this only matters if you play support, which I don't anymore."
killingfloor,3dry6c,Gogmagog,0,Sun Jul 19 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"I usually only play 7 round games so it may not apply to 10, but hunting shotgun is completely adequate as a primary weapon IMO. Even on HoE it blows through all the trash pretty easy. Only exception is Husks.   Although you do have to get pretty close to Sirens and use the alt fire, which can obviously be problematic."
killingfloor,3dry6c,textbooksforrent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:52:27 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the problem I have with it. The only thing it's good for is trash cleanup, which I could accomplish more efficiently with the pump-action, or offperk AK, or even a medic pistol. It's not good enough to be a tier 2 perk weapon."
killingfloor,3dry6c,Gogmagog,10,Mon Jul 20 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"What's really bad right now is that people believe medics and supports are strong. This is only the case for suicidal and below. This is because the damage increases from both passive leveling buffs and active perk talents is way too low. Couple this with the fact that scrakes rage at much, much lower percentages on lower levels (50/75/75/90) and that they have much much lower health and it creates this huge belief that medic and support are overpowered. Because this simply doesn't work at all on HoE, higher level players avoid it. Sounds like some people may be aware of this and unfortunately mocked you."
killingfloor,3dry6c,qqnowqq,6,Sat Jul 18 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"That's why I dont like the different mechanics of different difficulties in both games. When people learn that a certain zed will rage at ~75% health, they base their tactic around that, the problem is ""how to dealth with a scrake with 75% health"", but then when they go to HOE, it not only increase the total health, they also make them rage faster, so its now ""how to deal with a scrake with 90% health with increased base health"". This screw up the tactic entirely because it is easy to burst down a 75% sui scrake by simply focus firing but a 90% HOE scrake requires a lot more than that.  This creates an overly huge difficulty jump in both games together with other buffs zeds get like damage, speed, new skills longer waves, etc. That's why everyone who dont have enough experience on HOE keep using the suicidal tactic and think that might work. Because all they think is ""I just need to improve ?% of my aim to adjust for the health increase"". But in fact the gap between suicidal and HOE is a hell lot larger than people think.   People who constantly play on HOE only will found suicidal extremely easy. Its not like ""I beat suicidal no problem, I should be doing decent on HOE"", its several level higher than suicidal. On suicidal manor for example, people can camp the underground trader, demon statue, U shape hallway, even the piano room or the spawning location. But on HOE you need a pre-made 6 to camp anywhere that is not the U shape hallway. Camp anywhere else teams get wipe as soon as wave 3-4. This really shows how much of a difficulty jump between sui and HOE.  As of medic.... perks with speed bonus and more survivability is always better when going alone/solo. But if you put the medic back with the team, they dont actually do as well as you would think. Yes, if all hell break lose, the medic is the only viable perk to finish the wave, but in most cases where people stick together, medic isnt that good."
killingfloor,3dry6c,AsiaDerp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:22:17 2015 UTC,That's really funny it works that way because zerk and commando has been known to be underpowered by popular opinion. Makes sense considering most players don't play HoE.
killingfloor,3dry6c,shamoke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:13 2015 UTC,Stacking medics or supports on HoE is essentially a guaranteed loss tbh. It never works unless you kite.

They are a must have if you camp, but for the wrong reason. Melee SUCKS atm, after the rework, may be you will have an edge, but you still have better options like.... have an AR and pop their heads instead of trading hits....   People who consider commando underpowered, even on lower difficulties, are players who cant aim. Because they can spam shotguns and get away with it by having shorter waves."
killingfloor,3dry6c,AsiaDerp,8,Mon Jul 20 01:51:36 2015 UTC,"It's because on Hell on Earth support isn't useful against Scrakes and Fleshpounds, you just waste your ammo. Commandos and berserkers are much better at killing them quickly with EMP and headshots for Scrakes, and Pulverizer spam for Fleshpounds. You can still be useful in emergency situations and with high volume Zed traffic management, but usually whatever you do a commando can do better. So people may feel that you take the spot of a more useful perk.   However on lower difficulties it shouldn't be an issue. Even on Suicidal you can nicely help killing Scrakes and Fleshpounds as a support. It's not optimal, but if you play with other people who don't know the best ways to kill Scrakes and Fleshpounds and who won't coordinate to do it, you may be better off spamming AA12.  EDIT: Though I agree that it's not a reason to be mean to you. They should have explained at the very least."
killingfloor,3dry6c,poyepolomi,5,Sat Jul 18 22:24:25 2015 UTC,Could you explain that first part? Why isn't Support good against Scrakes and FPs on HoE? (I usually play Suicidal or HoE.)
killingfloor,3dry6c,poyepolomi,8,Sat Jul 18 22:26:38 2015 UTC,"For Scrakes, the best way to kill them is with headshots because they have much less head health than body health. And the best way to headshot them is to use an EMP to put the Scrakes in stasis, they won't rage for the whole duration of the effect which leaves enough time for commandos to kill them with SCARs. While you do this, you have to keep a certain distance from the Scrake, otherwise he will attack and lunge forward, which makes aiming for headshots harder. And if you keep your distance as a support, your AA12 shots have too much spread to deal as much damage as what commandos can do.  Some people try to dance with Scrakes or to circle around them as supports, but it takes longer, it's less ammo efficient, and riskier.  As for Fleshpounds, they have a 50% resistance to every type of damage (including bullets) except explosives and piercing from which they take 50% more damage. Therefore killing them with AA12 is long and wastes ammo, whereas Pulverizers are very fast, it takes about 5 seconds with 2 or 3 people spamming Pulverizers because of the explosive weakness, about 14 Pulverizer shots in total on 6 players HoE."

killingfloor,3dry6c,qqnowqq,5,Mon Jul 20 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"His damage is too low and he has a low ammo pool. Support really isn't any good at all against fleshpounds and he's almost entirely unimportant for scrakes. For fleshpounds, he deals very negligible damage. It's much more efficient to have berserkers just lure them in and spam pulverizers m2 on them. Also, supports can kill scrakes quickly sure but only with an emp grenade and optimal distance. And even then the optimal distance without making scrakes lunge requires you to expend much more ammo compared to the commando for which can kill at any distance. Support can do well enough on suicidal and below because the scrake and fleshpound healths are very low comparably. Also, zeds run more often and scrakes rage at 90% health instead of 75% so you can get away with spamming more AA12 at him. Having a support or two can work on medium HoE games if you regulate your ammo well and even use offperk weapons like the medpistol though, but overall the support is entirely outclassed by the commando on HoE."
killingfloor,3dry6c,AsiaDerp,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"I think people need to go into the test map or something to see how much ""damage"" the AA12 is actually dealing to scrakes and FPs. Using your entire AA12 mag cant even kill a scrake, you need 3+ mags to kill fleshpounds. Now add in the fact that in a real game you cant head shot scrakes without EMP (circling is glitching and will be fixed), and you cant safely 1V1 FPs, so no head shot for FPs too. And with EMP, commandos is killing scrakes at any range while you need to be at a very specific distance to prevent him from attacking and still able to land most of your pellets.  So yeah, support is not effective on HOE at all. In theroy, it only take very little ammo to kill scrakes/FPs IF and ONLY IF you score all headshots. So please, dont bother shooting them, just clean out the trash. But then again... with half decent commandos around you dont even have many zeds actually going into your effective rage.   Because in KF1 supports have the ammo and enough damage, thanks to the double hitting bug, to be all and kill all. In KF2 they nerf almost every aspect of support. Resulting in support being non-effective on HOE. The weapon switch speed alone is killing the ammo count of support because you cant switch to another weapon to save ammo without taking a million unnecessary damage, thanks to faster zeds.  If you argue that you can land perfect head shots, try it with commando with SCAR, you will be surprise that everything's head pops in seconds up to scrakes and even FP's head seems to be very weak. Also, no RNG pellet spread, works at all range."
killingfloor,3dry6c,textbooksforrent,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"Probably just trolling you, Support is very powerful. Only glaring weakness I can think of is that they go through a lot of ammo, which can be a problem on HoE."

Hunting shotgun clears large packs of trash mobs and AA12 lays out damage quickly.   You really don't want to be the only person fighting a scrake or FP, because it can take an entire clip or two, but the damage is still good as a complimentary source (hence the ""support"" title).  If you have a beserker tying up the big mobs, it's easy to aim the shots at its head, I've found."

killingfloor,3dsb8a,cheesellama_thedevil,2,Sat Jul 18 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"AK hits 600 rpm, meaning DPS hits 350. The Bullpup's 660 rpm gives it a DPS of 275. However, the Bullpup's advantage lies more in ammo capacity- the Bullpup's full-ammo-reserve damage sits at 9,000 with base stats, while the AK has only 8,100. This difference is only amplified with perk buffs.   Due to these two advantages, the question shifts to the playstyle you want. If you want to burst down FPs and Scrakes, or the composition of perks on your team means you have to play closer to that role, take the AK and hope you don't run out of ammo. If you're comfortable with playing a more mobile, kite-focused Commando playstyle, you'll be able to sustain yourself into just a bit more damage with the Bullpup before having to switch weapons.  Players interested in diversifying their playstyle can pick up the Bullpup as a counterpoint to the SCAR, given that the SCAR already occupies the burst damage role, and does a better job of it than the AK. However, it's worth mentioning that you will feel like you're doing substantially less damage in the short term."
killingfloor,3dsb8a,majorscheiskopf,2,Sun Jul 19 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"The AK's higher damage does generally save bullets against bloats, sirens, and husks.

killingfloor,3dsdpt,ZeBastard,8,Sun Jul 19 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"It doesnt matter. Because KF2 is 6-man vs 50 scrake simulator for a lot of players right now. The whole ""make it require more teamwork"" thing is not doing much good for them.   ""You need to have enough zerk to EMP scrakes"" and ""stack enough explosive in the team"" is very easy to figure out by KF1 HOE players and gets old very fast. And the other ""ways"" involves glitching or kiting. And because scrake is dangerous and tanky to a point that the safest way to do is just to leave all 10 of them till the end of the wave if you are kiting.  I cant really say which one is harder, but KF2 is clearly more boring. Its not about having more perks or not, its the core gameplay. Even when SS is here you still need EMP because SS will NOT be one shotting scrakes and the head shot will surely rage scrakes. If you need EMP anyway, why would you not have a perk (commando) that can also kill trash? Martial artist you may say, but all it will happen is more effective/easier parry. And after all the mechanic they add in (parry/stumble, and soon, knockdown) you think they can make the scrakes' head stay in place?  Unless they adjust the balance of everything siren/husk or higher, this wont change. All they did is bump all med-big zeds' health to ""add teamwork"" which is a very lazy way to do so."
killingfloor,3dsdpt,AsiaDerp,24,Sun Jul 19 08:01:01 2015 UTC,"Simply because the current way to beat KF2 is either spamming AA12 on scrakes and fleshpounds or spamming headshots on stasis'd zeds. Both of which are heavily mocked for being extremely inefficient. There's a lot more finesse in KF1 with flinch combos and a lot more consistency with reliable stuns.  Also, stunlock scrakes with a katana? You hard difficulty player, lel. There's no such thing."

There were several testmaps made for KF1 simply to refine your skill and master combos and situations. There's almost no need at all for testmaps in KF2 right now. Also, it doesn't help at all that almost all players just play as if medic and support are the best perks-spamming AA12s and whatnot.

So when we are going for EMP, why not have a perk that also kill trashes effectively?   And do you really think after all these stupid stumble/parry and soon knockdown some how martial artist perk will have mechanics to keep scrakes' head still?

killingfloor,3dsdpt,qqnowqq,3,Mon Jul 20 14:07:59 2015 UTC,"First shot will surely rage the scrake, now the second shot is very sloppy given the head keep shaking when the scrake is raging. So, you either EMP it or not shoot it with the SS at all. Because if you rely on the SS instead of EMP, sooner or later you will miss. There's around 50 scrakes in a long game. You think you can have 100% rate on a shaking head with a randomly moving hand? If the scrake is not targeting you, no headshot again.  If shooting the head of a raging scrake is that easy commandos should have no problem at all to kill them without EMP because its less than a clip for it and you can even pop a few shots before raging the scrake."
killingfloor,3dsdpt,alive442,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, shooting wobbling head is hard. But that's where you can apply you personal skill, and it would also require a lot of practise."
killingfloor,3dsdpt,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:46 2015 UTC,"All speculation. Can just as easily say they're relegated to parry or stumble roles (which suck). You have to take it at face value as is. And right now, KF2 is a very sloppy game relatively."
killingfloor,3dsdpt,Retrikaethan,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:55:53 2015 UTC,"How is   AA12 on scrakes and fleshpounds or spamming headshots on stasis'd zeds   Different from   flinch combos and a lot more consistency with reliable stuns.   Other than one being single player skill and team cooperation?  Im not saying that kf1 wasnt more single player skill oriented, And I do think there needs to be some changes made to stasis. Just you mention stuns as a bad thing in kf2 but its a good thing in kf1."
killingfloor,3dsdpt,qqnowqq,0,Sun Jul 19 00:59:16 2015 UTC,Bad? I never said anything bad about stuns. You're confusing emp with stuns it seems. And please understand the difference between KF1 combos and KF2 tactics. They're fundamentally different.
killingfloor,3dsdpt,Tommygun329,-5,Sun Jul 19 02:36:25 2015 UTC,"i might just be horribly desensitized but for me dealing with scrakes/fp on kf1 is genuinely easy. spawn zerk, grab dwarfs axe, katana, flaregun. WIN FOREVER. im not so good at combos via other classes but that's more a fuckitmyfingerstwitch thing than fuckitihavenoideahowtodothatshit thing. if you throw in appropriate use of the zedgun mk2 anywhere in there, everything up to and including wave 10 becomes a joke. i don't want to be able to steamroll the zeds just because i know some clever bullshit, i want to have to fight for the win. of course, only having one or two ways to deal with big shit is unacceptable but it shouldn't come back to ""want kill skrrks? go sharp/lawdemo/huskbug. want kill feeps? go support/m32demo/GETAMEDITANK. want both? ZERKADERK/mk2spammywhammy.""   something i would have liked to see is the ability to limb zeds like you can headshot them. shoot a leg off? FUCK THE FUCKER ON THE FLOOR FUUUCK!!! shoot arm off? lost balance/weaker attacks. shoot both arms off? THEY GET TO HEADBUTT YOUUUUU! might be a silly thought but it would make sense in a horror kinda way. cuz, yaknow, we are shooting clones of humans who happen to be really angry. still human, though, so lost limb would be expected if we're talking lots of realism in the flesh vs bullets/blades corner."

killingfloor,3dsdpt,AsiaDerp,0,Sun Jul 19 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"What a ramble. And yeah, despite that bad loadout, the skill floor to win is pretty damn low in KF1 - xbow + m32 teams didn't have to worry about anything. But the possibility for better loadouts and combos exists there too. There's actually a considerable difference between skill floor and skill ceiling in that game. In KF2, you're presented with two options - spam bodyshots and hope it dies or coordinate with a berserker and spam headshots. The main point is that KF2 has essentially been taking the worst of the worst combos from KF1 and has been making them the optimal tactics for KF2."
killingfloor,3dsdpt,1wsx10,4,Sun Jul 19 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"KF2 is very incomplete at the moment, and basically everything is subject to change, so I don't think any comparisons are entirely fair.  Keeping that in mind, I will say that KF2 in general feels much faster paced.  I feel like the homing medi darts are in the game to compensate for the increased movement speed and more frantic feel.  Clot grab auto turning makes it easier to kill the clot, but it also makes clots more disruptive.  I wouldn't say that KF2 is easier, but it's different"
killingfloor,3dsdpt,AsiaDerp,3,Sun Jul 19 22:52:40 2015 UTC,"you say everything is subject to change, but take the speech wheel for example. right from the start the community made it very clear that they didnt like it, and that the kf1 way was more usable/had more options and such. guess what? they put necklaces around all the maps instead of making a simple menu that you can toggle on and off in the options. yeah they dont have all the voice acting for the menu but its in early access they could at least add it in and do the extra voice acting later"

killingfloor,3dsdpt,AsiaDerp,3,Sun Jul 19 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"Umm, the Stunlock Scrakes with katana does not work on Suicidal or above. One shotting scrakes with XBow is the same. Does not work on higher difficulties.  M32 was generally not enough to kill the FP. But again I fail to see the problem here. It isn't that it was hard to do it was that demo was VERY specialized. You simply did not have enough ammo to do everything.  I think these arguments are pointless. KF2 is long ways off. There will be a lot of balancing, new guns, perks and whatnot added before we can see how KF2 is even gonna play.  What we have now is a very, very limited demo of the game."
killingfloor,3dsdpt,_ROG_,3,Sun Jul 19 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"I don't equate difficulty to casualness. Flappy bird was a casual game because it had no depth, despite being difficult, requiring fast reactions and even skill. KF2 may be statistically harder in some ways (keyword: may) but it certainly doesn't feel like it has the depth KF1 did, which in certain circumstances allowed for more forgiving play, but required more knowledge and trained responses. Casualness for me is something that lacks interesting complexity that takes time to master. Consequently difficulty is a required component in making something not casual, but they are by no means equivalent.  Without meaning any offence, the reason many see the viewpoint of the hardcore HoE community as just crying about needing to adapt, is frequently due to being a casual player, playing 2 different games in a casual manner, not realising that there is nothing of long term interest in one of the games. You cant just adapt into nothingness. There are no complex tricks to keep in mind to keep fleshpounds at bay, so the result is ""lets empty our clips at its face"". All the time. Every time.  I live in hope that lots more interesting elements will be added, and I think some will, but the choices Tripwire has made do not give me an abundance of that hope. Currently kf1 is still the superior game.  As a side note, some camping players like to shit on kiting, because of how the vast majority of kiting games went and vice versa. Both styles can be really intense and enjoyable if you do them right."

Both styles can be really intense and enjoyable if you do them right.   Its not like KF1 kiting, because KF1 kiting you dont need to leave all the scrakes alone. In KF2 you are taking so much risk for trying to deal with scrake while kiting. You can have double siren + bloat poping out at the next corner. You dont want to shoot any scrakes in the middle of the wave. They are dangerous to a point that even a single trash blocking your way you get cut down in your prime. Its a instant combo kill with not enough armor. So either you tell yourself commando or support is useful in kiting or the whole team clear their mind and go 6 medic.  And this is why kiting in KF2 is lame and always results in 10 scrakes at the end of each wave, you go for a easy way out and spend most of your time trying to split them up, and then you circle them one by one. Its all because of scrake being broken. Its not like I want to shit on kiting, but it is boring. I am one of the people defending kiting at the beginning and I think kiting should be a viable and fun tactic. But given the setting of KF2 kiting is just lame as hell. I like both camping and kiting in KF1. I dont dislike kiting because its kiting, I dislike kiting in KF2 because its broken."

I wasn't aware of how broken kiting in kf2 is as I stopped playing until the next gameplay patch comes out. I loved both strategies in the old game. Camping is fun when its not a boring spot (I'm looking at you aperture), kiting is fun when you dont decide to kill 1 clot every 10 minutes. Hope they make it more viable in kf2"

So when a level 0 joins such a game, they're screwing the team over and should really be playing normal difficulty at least for the short while it takes to get to level ~5.

If demos can solo fleshpounds reliably and quickly, zerkers won't need to carry pulverizers to kill them. Eviscerator still kinda sucks as is atm though.

Remember if you shoot a zed once you get as much xp as killing it.  I always felt like support had little ammo and it is what it is.  Commando has a ton assuming you grab the ak and scar.  Use all ammo before you sell a weapon.  I personally save my aa12 for scrakes and fp or just emergencies.  I don't think you have the faster reload yet and that really helps support imo.

killingfloor,3do7sj,qqnowqq,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:35:10 2015 UTC,"Start with pump, pistol as much as you can, buy double barrel asap, save for AA-12, sell pump action, buy AA-12.  Pump+double barrel is fine for trash until you get an AA which coincides for when scrakes start spawning generally. From then on, double barrel penetration can carry your trash clearing when they group up. Remember that shotgun damage falls off incredibly quickly (especially on the double barrel), so you need to get meat-shots if you want good ammo efficiency.   When your support is 20 you can have the pump action too as a 3rd weapon. Tap bloats any time you see them for easy exp."

There is absolutely no reason to ever purchase one.  Support was the first perk I maxed and I found that Medic Pistol > Double Barrel > AA-12 was the best build to carry around. Use the shotguns wisely and there's plenty of ammo to last the wave on difficulties up to and including Suicidal.  If you're having problems with ammo conservation in your shotguns and need something to take out the trash, just use the medic pistol. 200 Dosh gets you a weapon that can decap Clots + Variants, Gorefasts, Stalkers, and Crawlers with one headshot, Bloats with 4 headshots, Husks with ~10. And that's completely ignoring the pump shotty that you're running around with from the time you spawn in.  Use the Double Barrel as your main trash clearer, just line up shots to take advantage of your penetration. If you have a single clot, switch to your pistol, no sense wasting a shell on that. Three or four of them lined up? No sense in using MORE THAN one shell on that. Line of crawlers? Crouch and take them all out with one shell.  Support has plenty of ammo to go the distance, you just have to be wise with using it."

You mean like the nearly weekly now WWAUT's that come out with graphs showing the expected amount of time left to complete each of the features they're working on? Something like that?

killingfloor,3dkovx,1wsx10,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:19 2015 UTC,"If you want to be everyone's favorite person on the team and be able to keep the useful people on your team alive while hopefully saving the idiots from their own bad decisions, you should go medic. Just don't forget you can heal yourself too. Many medics seem to ignore their own health bar, die, and then everyone else quickly follows.    Now as for what class actually feels fun to play, I would want to say Berserker because it's very in-your-face action with a lot of weaving through enemies learning when to parry and when to distance yourself, and feels very rewarding when played right. Problem is, Berserker just isn't good enough yet. The only useful part is the EMP grenade for Scrakes, which is very limited in how many you can carry. Berserker defenses are way too low right now unless every parry works (which they often won't, for whatever reason). Hit detection is also a bit weird and you oddly require headshots to quickly take out even basic enemies.    So far my favorite is Commando, because it feels like the nice middle-ground, solid DPS option that is effective at dealing with most of the zeds. It feels like the nice in-between of the long range that Sharpshooter and Demo will prefer, and the short range of Support and Berserker. You can adjust your fire rate to suit the distance to your target, and you usually have plenty of ammo to spare.    Support would be more fun if it actually had the ammo to play around with, like Commando does. For some reason, you're made to choose between a fairly small amount of ammo for yourself (not even one full reload of AA12) and giving ammo to your teammates, when no other class needs the ammo more than Support does. Even the medic shotgun has the same problem. Shotguns just plain need more ammo. Even a 20-25% ammo increase for all shotguns would be a modest and very reasonable increase."

killingfloor,3dkovx,beatuhse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:43:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like the SMG is moderately good in feel but not good in practice because the damage is a little too low (two headshots to kill trash doesn't work when they instantly recoil after the first bullet), the shotgun has never felt very good to me and has the same ammo problem as other shotguns, and the rifle has too much recoil for its damage. The pistol makes a good starter weapon and space filler, and the homing darts are usually great except when you can't tell who it locked on to (player A near death or player B standing closer to you missing a sliver). Healing darts doing poison damage feels like it should be a default thing."

killingfloor,3dib05,ReverendDuckworth,0,Fri Jul 17 11:29:57 2015 UTC,"Same, especially with what they are doing supporting the Nvidia Physx Flex proprietary solution which blocks out all AMD people. Awesome stuff supporting such harmful practices from a company who did some really shady stuff with the 970 and the 3.5 GB vram fiasco as well as encouraging such proprietary solutions.  They claim to have slowed down the updates due to wanting to spend more time bug fixing it, but this is ridiculous. I much rather want a somewhat buggy update than no update at all, especially considering this is early access and therefore expected to be buggy."
killingfloor,3dib05,hak8or,2,Thu Jul 16 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"Nvidia might be considered shady but they brought a consumer-ready product to the table that works well with UE3. This also does not hinder AMD users playing the game whatsoever. The gore in the game already looks amazing, this is just some extra intestines and blood (which a lot of people don't enjoy the appearance of anyway).  It doesn't ""block out"" AMD users in any way. You still have exactly the same gameplay as everyone else, you just can't run certain visual only features.  I've yet to see a single person actually recommend an alternative physics system that's as advanced and market ready. It's always ""Tripwire should just make their own and have it work better!"" or ""They just shouldn't use Nvidia software."" So then what should they use instead, nothing?

Additionally, I'm pretty sure they're not even the studio developing the new RO.  The game is perfectly playable and definitely worth $18 even in its current state (if that other guys voucher works too). The content will come eventually, but regardless of how you feel about that the value is there. You wont get that many hours of entertainment out of nearly any other type of media you spend that much on.  The final say is up to the buyer, but don't just blatantly listen to this naysaying bs. Tripwire has been updating slow but the base game is plenty fun and extremely solid for an EA build. The next patch for the game is bringing 2 new classes and skill trees as well as 4 new weapons for each and 2 more maps. They're also completely reworking one of the 4 classes that are currently in-game.  I'm a big KF fan. I bought it as soon as it was available and Steam says I have 279 hours (some spent idling I'm sure). It's my most played early access title ever and I've spent $30 on dumber things many times since I bought it.  If you like killing zombies and you're considering it, buy it, imo.

Mod support is still lacking, linux support doesnt even have an ETA... they stopped us from having fun in 20 player+ servers. yada yada. My point being, as an early access title, until now this doesnt deserve its price. I spent 30 bucks on this game and i dont regret it. i just wish i had waited longer."
killingfloor,3dib05,NobsiTheUnitato,4,Thu Jul 16 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, the game in a meta-game sense is a step backward right now in amount of detail because the classes are lacking. Its also just different so far. In terms of the direction the game is going and the graphical quality I think it's a huge step forward. It's a whole new base to build on and has much potential.  Like I said, if you want the game don't let the naysayers stop you. People are acting as if the game isn't even fun yet and that's just not true.  I simply couldn't wait to buy it because it's one of my favorite series and I could pretty much wait forever (and between 1 and 2 did feel like forever). I remember me and my LAN buddy talking about the mythical KF2 If it ever came around and I'm glad to be on the edge of the new potential the series has.  I know games are pretty cheap on PC, but we honestly have it pretty great compared to other forms of entertainment. I think people get a little spoiled when you actually look at cost to maximum entertainment hours. There's not a lot of other places you can squeeze that many enjoyable hours out of so little investment.  I just think if you have a job the minimum 18 dollar investment, even at current content level, is totally worth it if you're into zombie games.  Generally, the mod support is good but not great yet but I know it will only improve. Also, custom mutator servers were disabled mainly because that was an unintended way of loading mutators and possible cheating vector/vulnerability."

killingfloor,3dib05,ReverendDuckworth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:22:55 2015 UTC,Updates coming slow is far from it being in a terrible state. The game is in a very fun and playable state as is.
killingfloor,3dib05,Kvasir94,2,Fri Jul 17 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"Ark's updates are coming too fast on he contrary 1 to 2 upates per day seems too much to make a game anywhere near stable.  I'm spending a lot of time on Ark and that fast paced updates are somewhat not confortable. Those guys don't know the concept of ""release"", atm it's just them pushing every bit of codes they produce, barely testing it.  Perfect counter example of Killing Floor."

So why the hell you go for early access? Contents are FINISHED AND POLISHED, just release the game then? What's the point of doing early access? Its a totally playable game, with decent content, I cant even understand what they want from us beta testers. Does any of you pay for waiting? We pay because we want to help TESTING things out, but they want ""quality over quantity"" so they FINISH the contents then makes it live, so all early access players just pay to ""wait for the next patch notes"" instead of actually test things out. Just like any other games that is fully released."

I commented something similar to this on the tw forums and I got bashed horribly by people who couldn't read.  So I'll back him up A little.  Yes, it does seem that the updates are taking a while. I agree with that, but at the same time I know that tw is doing their best and making things great. Maybe they could release content a little less perfected at coat intervals so we can try them out?  I also agree with what was said about the time frame.  They said the full game would launch later this year. Well 7 and a half months into the year and only soon to be 6 perks and 6 maps. .. sure seems like this game will be in EA a lot longer,  with a release date several months into next year.  Again.. see my first comment.  All in all,  I think tw is doing a terrific job, and KF2 is turning it to be one hell of a awesome game. I just wanted to back the poster of this thread up,  because he clearly said he is not mad or flaming anything.

It's a pr stunt, releasing updates every fucking day which are tiny and untested.  Anyway, never mind that ark almost entirely uses DEFAULT UNREAL ENGINE 4 assets lol. Trees, rocks etc are not even made by the ark devs. It's disgusting. The game only looks good because of the engin, not the devs work."
killingfloor,3dipfx,LittleBigPerson,2,Tue Jul 21 01:28:13 2015 UTC,"You realize what an alpha actually is, right...?  It's early access. The users are testing.

killingfloor,3dipfx,Akronis,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:24 2015 UTC,No. I just see an overhyped shitty game when I see one.

killingfloor,3dipfx,Armisael,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"Its actually really impressive. They made a hefty change to taming in a patch, and it caused enough (justified) outrage, that they hot fixed it in less than 6 hours.

killingfloor,3dipfx,Lazer726,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:55 2015 UTC,Too bad they didn't make any of their assets and the game only looks good because of the engine. It's an unoptimised piece of trash.
killingfloor,3dipfx,LittleBigPerson,2,Tue Jul 21 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"But that's what you should expect from an EARLY ACCESS game. The point is that it shouldn't be beautiful, it shouldn't be perfect, it shouldn't be done. They have made constant and notable improvements to the games optimization. And saying it ""only looks good"" because of the engine? The game looks decent, and that's not a bad thing, I don't understand why you would think that's an insult. That's like saying that a car is only fast because of it's engine, but it's not pretty to look at. Oh well"
killingfloor,3dipfx,Lazer726,2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:48 2015 UTC,"Please understand that Tripwire clearly stated, the point of their Early Access is NOT primarily about bugs. It's about balancing.  So, they are polishing the updates themselves, releasing them, and if something doesn't feel right balance wise (in this case, the next update completely redoes Berserker, and other melee) they will focus on that (without having to worry about a ton of bugs).  You and I may not agree with it, but if that's what they feel most comfortable with, then I trust them. I loved all of their games so far, so I have complete faith in their methods."

I dont really think they will change this anytime soon because this dont have the overwhelmingly high percentage of players to agree on like the Beserker UP/M4 shotgun/teleporting issues. There were literally 10 new posts per day about those.   In the meantime, just use <setbind C say Scrake Incoming!!!!> and press C everytime a scrake comes (or any key you want to use).  And finally, dont expect everyone to share your language. Your team lose not because they cant shout ""SCRAKE!!!!"" into the mic, its because the team dont know what to do. If the players know what to do the mic is not needed. We have enough random people that wont stop talking and nobody understand them."
killingfloor,3dehte,HatlessZombieHunter,5,Thu Jul 16 04:02:35 2015 UTC,"THIS, THIS, THIS AND AGAIN THIS.  The voice menu is CLEARLY made for controllers... This console parity needs to end. In general it's being dumbed down to match controllers and console crowd. Auto aim for healing, automatic turning back when clots grab you etc... I think Tripwire forgot on which platform they're developing"
killingfloor,3dehte,ZeBastard,3,Thu Jul 16 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"Don't tell em you enjoyed trying to manually aim darts and fast moving players who wouldn't bloody hold still?  Auto-Turning isn't a Controller consideration, it's to make you face away from more dangerous threats.  And the Voice-Wheel was used in RO2, a very much anti-console game.  They probably just reused the concept from then.  Then again, a Menu would be better at the same time."
killingfloor,3dehte,drthunderthecan,3,Thu Jul 16 02:20:50 2015 UTC,"Darts felt a lot more instant in 1 than they do in 2, Because they auto-aim now, They now take time to track, 1 They moved like a crossbow bolt, It was a skill to be a good medic and heal across the map at a moving player, It was something you played to perfect and felt satisfying when you landed that heal from a distance, Now it's just hardly aim towards a player and just fire, It lacks the impact it had in 1 that made being a good medic feel great.  The Clot grabs are very disorienting and really take away from fighting real targets, I want to focus on the real threats around me, Not the little bugger biting into my side trying to give me a tickle while a Scrake is about to use my body as a holster for his chainsaw, The time spent being forced to turn around then re-orientate yourself to the target is costing the player precious time that is borderline essential if your up against a charging Scrake, Or FP, This could be fixed by using a little damage indicator on screen to show which direction they are hitting you from so you can just swing back when you have the time and choose to.  Circle Module for quick chat takes away from the precision of 1 where you could choose perfectly for what you wanted from the 1-5-1-5 Menu, Now it's a little watered down with the selection, Keeping the essentials, But not giving the full menu of what you could call out limiting the player to what they want to truly say in the heat of the moment."

killingfloor,3dehte,_ROG_,9,Wed Jul 15 17:37:31 2015 UTC,How exactly was it confusing? After a couple of games the old voice menu was very easy muscle memory.  v-5-1
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,2,Wed Jul 15 18:21:42 2015 UTC,Don't bother arguing with this guy. I've tried it once before and he will not abandon an obviously flawed statement no matter what.
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,-2,Wed Jul 15 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"amidst my trolling and herpderping, i have a point! very simply, the old system won't work on the ps4 and TW seems intent on keeping the two versions as equal as possible. there's also the problem that seems to be getting ignored is that if we do get the old system, we won't have any more voice commands than we do now (defeating the purpose of the old system, which was to give access to a large number of voice commands) or, if we do, then TW needs to figure out a way to have those new voice commands be accessible to ps4 players as well. the point is, if they figure out a way to get it to work on ps4 with more voice commands, why wouldn't that be good enough for PC players, too?"
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,-8,Thu Jul 16 14:37:56 2015 UTC,"i love how you skip all the other problems with it and go right for how it was confusing. most people wont even use most of the commands that were available, there were far too many choices and you had to look through each thing to find out what you want to say. yes, shit gets to being muscle memory after a while but that shouldn't be a prerequisite for using an npc voice communication thing like that. right now in kf2? the dial works quite well, all the options are there and relatively easy to see. yes, we could use more options or maybe even customization options for them, no we should not go back to the old system. it won't work on playstation anyway."
killingfloor,3dehte,Serf070,7,Wed Jul 15 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't skip through the problems with it because there weren't any problems.  Compared to the dial menu which every player could list several problems with right off the bat.  If v for voice, 1-5 for a self-explanatory section and 1-6 for a command is ""confusing"" for you then I'm really sorry."

killingfloor,3dehte,Serf070,6,Wed Jul 15 18:44:13 2015 UTC,It won't. And TW has specifically stated that they won't make the game worse for PC players due to PS4 limitations.
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,-8,Wed Jul 15 18:46:02 2015 UTC,doesn't mean they're gonna fuck over ps4 players because the game is also on pc though :D
killingfloor,3dehte,richertai,6,Wed Jul 15 18:47:26 2015 UTC,Then have the old system on PC and the new one on ps4.
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,-8,Wed Jul 15 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"see above statements of fucking one or the other over. old system on PC means they can't give it to PS4, fucking them over. pc gets more voice commands while ps is stuck with just what is on the radial.   i'm not saying we don't need more options, i'm saying that whatever happens has to happen to and be usable by both platforms."
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,2,Wed Jul 15 18:52:23 2015 UTC,"No.  They already will have to make some code changes just to get it to work on console.  The voice wheel can remain, as-is, for console.  The two don't have to operate exactly the same."
killingfloor,3dehte,richertai,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:28:07 2015 UTC,"problem is that it does have to work the same for both. there isn't gonna be a ps4 beta afaik, so whatever they do to pc they're gonna give to ps4 outright. replacing a system which kinda works for both with one that only kinda works for one is a terrible plan. even if they do different setups for one or the other, we still need to feedback/beta on them both before they finalize it."
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,4,Wed Jul 15 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"Q: What are the differences between the PC and PS4 version?  A: There will be some differences between the user interface and of course the PS4 version will support gamepads (as will the PC version for SteamOS/Big Picture mode). The difficulty will be tuned on the PS4 to take into account the different playerbase and controller. So far however we've got what we think are some pretty good gamepad controls, and can actually play the ""PC difficulty levels"" pretty well with a gamepad.   Q: Are you going to ""dumb down"" the PC version because you are making a PS4 version?  A: Short answer - heck no! Longer answer, the PS4 version has no impact on the gameplay of the PC version. PC is the lead platform, and the game will be separately tuned to play well on both the PC and the PS4. PS4 gamers are likely in for a harder game than they are used to. With that said, we feel many developers underestimate gamers on the consoles, and we feel that console gamers are ready for a challenge. Hell on Earth on PS4 will be HARD. With that said, the game will scale on easier difficulties for more casual gamers.    Please do your research before asking stupid questions. TW already said the UI will have differences between PC and PS4. The voice command menu is part of the UI.  Also the problems you complained about with the old voice menu were not related to console functionality."

killingfloor,3dehte,richertai,-5,Wed Jul 15 23:30:48 2015 UTC,I have over 100 hours in KF1. I couldn't tell you what any of the voice commands are and I hated them. Being unfamiliar with them forces you to stop the game and go through 2-3 menus to find the command you're looking for. You're dead in that time.   Now you press one button. It's very l4d-esque. Should there be more options? Sure. I agree. Was KF1's system objectively superior? I definitely don't think so.
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:30:35 2015 UTC,You clearly didn't use voice commands frequently then.
killingfloor,3dehte,richertai,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:25:00 2015 UTC,Which is what new people are exposed to. People finding it cumbersome won't use it... Like I didn't.   The new system allows new players to figure it out instantly and people that played some other coops have already been exposed to the dial menu. It seems pretty reasonable.
killingfloor,3dehte,Retrikaethan,7,Wed Jul 15 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't take long to learn at all. If you're a regular voice command user you will get to grasp with it within a couple of hours of gameplay tops. The only people that will find it challenging are people that don't use voice commands frequently, which may or may not be the majority of people, but what's the point in designing a system for people that don't use it anyway?"
killingfloor,3dlh78,Mrblurr,22,Fri Jul 17 06:03:07 2015 UTC,"There are solid ways to consistently take down zeds solo on 6p HoE. There are existent flinches, melee flinches, flinchlocks, stuns, and melee locks. None of these are very usable if at all present in KF2. High level KF2 uses methods that were openly mocked in KF1 for being both unnecessary and sloppy - emp and team spam. There was simply no need for it at all in KF1 since there are more reliable and quicker methods. KF1 has a very heavy reward for individual skill - if you were good enough you could always win in pub games. KF2 does not - it has a much higher emphasis on team coordination and some RNG; there's almost no individual skill needed in this game. The skill ceiling is a lot higher in KF1 - something most higher level players absolutely loved. The skill ceiling in KF2 is pretty much the skill floor."
killingfloor,3dlh78,qqnowqq,3,Fri Jul 17 07:08:20 2015 UTC,Very well said!   There was simply no need for it at all in KF1 since there are more reliable and quicker methods.   I would go so far and say more elegant methods.
killingfloor,3dlh78,Rodario,2,Fri Jul 17 11:52:47 2015 UTC,did you like the med darts? i see so many people saying they like the lock on med darts and die a bit inside. i find medic in kf2 is no fun now :|
killingfloor,3dlh78,1wsx10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:14:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not decided on that one yet. It certainly is unfamiliar to me.  On the one hand missing fewer darts is nice. On the other hand it's less clear to me who I actually healed, and it was more satisfying to get a heal in halfway across the map in KF1."
killingfloor,3dlh78,Rodario,2,Fri Jul 17 15:58:14 2015 UTC,"i really enjoyed the kf1 medic, getting good at not missing and such. the high risk/reward (especially with the m7a3 slow recharge) made it a very fun to do most of the time.  i was more of a medic for a competent team that would only get in trouble occasionally because i would also tank and shoot.  the m79 goes very well with the m7a3"
killingfloor,3dlh78,1wsx10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:19:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hated medic darts in KF1. To be fair though, that was much more due to the hit detection being so bad. I don't like it in KF2 much either though, but it's a slight improvement."

killingfloor,3dlh78,Dicktron2000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:33:46 2015 UTC,I agree. The one thing in KF1 (other than more weapons) that I like much more than KF2 is that it relied more on skill than teamwork. All players doing well is more important in KF1 than all players working together.

killingfloor,3dlh78,1wsx10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:26 2015 UTC,"Probably because all those extra lines of dialogue weren't recorded. If we get a KF1 voice chat system, it's probably going to just have the same messages as the ones currently in the KF2 voice chat wheel."
killingfloor,3dlh78,qqnowqq,2,Fri Jul 17 15:53:55 2015 UTC,well they dont have to add them all immediately - this is in early access remember? i thought that was the point of early access  they should at least add the functionality and expand it later because its requested so much
killingfloor,3dlh78,1wsx10,6,Sat Jul 18 01:22:07 2015 UTC,"KF1 controls are actually tighter in my opinion. The gunplay is a lot more punchy and responsive (particularly the double barrel; the difference is like heaven and hell). Sprinting is a bit of a weird feature, you move way too slow for how much you're waving your gun around. I would rather if you just pulled out a knife for movement speed. There are a LOT more variety between the perks surprisingly, despite KF2's ""choose special perks every 5 levels"". Also, the perks are a lot more distinctive because the bonuses are so strong. A sharpie can use a Lever Action to take down pretty much anything short of a FP, and even then he would have a good chance if he knows how to kite and time his shots so it doesn't rage. But if a medic used a LAR, he'd have a far harder time because of the 75-100% damage increase that Sharpshooter gives to the LAR.   KF2 has half of the classes that KF1 has, and it completely lacks the distinctiveness between the perks. There's no reason to play berserker when you can play medic and start with better base stats. The patches are so goddamn rare that I actually REGRET buying KF2. And this is someone that spent maybe 300 hours in KF1. Instead, I can always boot up KF1 and have some LAR plinking fun.   Tripwire seriously needs to get their shit together because the influx of FPSes coming out in the near future will drown out KF2's popularity. Hell, it's already nearly dead."
killingfloor,3dlh78,ParaBellam,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"have you tried the modded servers? i got nearly everything to 6 and stopped playing stock kf years ago. there are almost triple the amount of perks and an absolute fuckton of weapons, most are interesting too. one reason I'm not thrilled with kf2 is because there are like 5 weapons. shit got old fast, especially when the shock from the graphics wore off after a few hours."

killingfloor,3dgqnr,JackPux,20,Thu Jul 16 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"Because it doesn't get updated enough. I'm ok with big content patches taking a while, but one of the big advantages of early access is that you can do regular small updates for fixes and balance tweaks.

But mostly for the reasons other people stated. Unfortunately, early access means there is limited content and plenty of bugs/exploits the devs might want to iron out. So while the first month or so you could have found tons of games to join, you could also find some people making custom maps, there just isn't enough content to keep the casual player (like me) continually interested."

Either HP or DMG. But I understand that people disagree with that and I'll wait before the other classes are out before fully deciding.  The current boss to me also is an absolute waste of time.

Once that hits, the player base will surely grow exponentially."

killingfloor,3dgqnr,AsiaDerp,6,Wed Jul 22 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"Because bad players find the game too hard and moved on, good players have nothing else to play in this game. Every game is ""EMP scrakes and shoot his head with other people"", repeat it 50 times until you win or you get wipe out. Oh, or, you can kite 15 minutes per wave, some people find it fun to do.  So, one way or another, people get bored. Because most enemies are not even fun to fight against.  You know what the sad thing is? The new patch wont change this too much. After the players get to lv 25 they will leave again. Because right now the game is centered around ""6-man vs 50 scrakes"", and demo cant do shit against them (50% resistance is A LOT), and most weapons of both perks cant even headshot. And then, we have 2 slots reserved to zerk because of scrakes, so we dont need more FP killers. And knockdown is just like parry stumble or dodging attacks, you cant headshot. Any mechanics that hinder your ability to headshot are bad mechanics. You waste way too much ammo or even get kill if you cant headshot, now you add smoke and flame in there that cant do damage to the head..... players will revert back to the current tactic quickly and get bore again very fast if they dont have something that can actually change this."
killingfloor,3dgqnr,Flipheal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"just want to say something here. while I agree with you for the most part (BTW really liked your 2 video's on HOE, i learned a bunch from them) in the same way I feel they changed the zerker from KF1 into more of a team oriented role (instead of being able to solo scrakes, they made him more of a team player by allowing the EMP to help the team kill the scrake)  they might take a similar role on the upcoming firebug perk. in KF1 they usually didn't usually attack scrakes ( could be wrong here) dues to the on fire mechanics,but possibly a burnt up scrake in KF2 might be more manageable to kill as a group, thus making him more useful and changing the meta a bit.  I feel your original assertion of the situation will probably be what actually happens, but I'm hoping something similar to what I just said will happen, we shall see"
killingfloor,3dgqnr,AsiaDerp,-5,Thu Jul 16 09:58:45 2015 UTC,"they changed the zerker from KF1 into more of a team oriented role (instead of being able to solo scrakes, they made him more of a team player by allowing the EMP to help the team kill the scrake)   Then they introduce all those parry stumble knowckdown that all work against headshotting. And then they make is so no headshot = no kill for anything bloats or higher. So after all that meleeing become very ineffective. I cant even explain how annoying it is when I want to shoot the zeds then a zerker go in and melee a crawler, hitting all the zeds around it in the leg, then every single one of them get stumbled and I have to wait till they stand straight again to shoot them as the zerker gets forced to back away by husk/bloats/sirens.  As a result, people found out that no matter what perk you use, you should first buy an AR, then buy something works well with your perk, like AA12/pulv. I am calling it now, if nothing is done to address scrakes and FPs, you will see M32 + assault refile berserkers in the next patch. Berserker is very strong and a must have if you want to camp, but for totally wrong reasons."
killingfloor,3dgqnr,textbooksforrent,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:33:11 2015 UTC,"So don't powergame the shit out of KF2.  If you purposefully find the most efficient way to end the rounds as quickly as possible, disregarding any and all other tactics, disregarding the intended roles of classes in an early access game, is it any wonder why the game has gotten boring so quickly?  If you're going to kite Scrakes around for 15 minutes or buy assault rifles for every perk, I can't feel bad when you're bored of the game."

Finding a effective way to beat the game is our fault now?  Yes, lets only use the knife and 9mm!!!!  I dont disregarding any and all other tactics, but I wont go for tactics that DOESNT WORK or involve glitching. Countless time I see people who think they can use suicidal tactic on HOE and die over and over again. Yes, there are tons of tactics on suicidal but most of them dont even work on HOE. I dont want to kite scrake for 15 minutes, it just happens, as long as some people started running.   You being bad and I should get punished because I pay attention that FPs are weak to explosives and scrakes cant rage if you hit it with EMP? LMAO. All you need to know is TWO THINGS. The current way is not only the most efficient way, its the only reliable way to play HOE long at the moment unless you kite for 15 minutes and leave 10 scrakes at the end of the wave. (or, play with 5 friends so you can do whatever the hell you want)  The problem I always complaint is scrakes always kill the team, when a team gets wipe, its always at least one scrake involved because they are simply too strong at the moment. So most players who actually think about how to play, dont go straight for the circling tactic and go for EMP. And you think its our fault. Your thought process is soooo funny."
killingfloor,3dgqnr,RoDDusty,4,Thu Jul 16 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"Supposedly 'crisping' a zed increased the damage you dealt to it in KF1, we'll see if that carries over to two.  So it's at least something."

killingfloor,3dgqnr,Kvasir94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:08 2015 UTC,Exactly what happens after double clicking the game?  I've had to fix a few crashes now between me and my friend's games.  Run the game as administrator from the folder and maybe try compatibility made for 7. Reset your graphics driver and try deleting the Killing Floor 2 folder in my games and verifying steam files. You might also have to install some prerequisites again manually in some cases. Look in the kf2 folder for _commonredist
killingfloor,3dgqnr,DankJemo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:13:42 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not I've tried all that and much more. I've gotten pretty desperate with this. I've went through all the recommended fixes listed on steam and even tried some of my own stuff that isn't listed there, that affects KF's run environment. nonoe of it's worked for me unfortunately. I've even replaced DLL files that a guy had posted to steam, which i figure should absolutely not need to be done.  Game launches normally, I get through all the opening splash screens and then it hits the Killing Floor 2 screen, with nothing populated but the background. (no menus or text) the cursor is unresponsive and it crashes. The other one that I see much more often is that the game seems like it works, I can sit in the menus as long as I want, spent 10 minutes browsing servers, check settings, all that stuff. But when I join a match and start actively playing the game gives me about 5-7 minutes of playtime, then without much warning just quits. Crashes my Nvidia drivers. I have determined it's KF2 that's doing it. I can't reproduce the crash with other games and spent the last few nights benchmarking and stress testing my hardware without so much as a blip."

My card (GTX 760 oc) does your first example after crashing out of the game (like your second example exactly) which happens rarely to me.  When it happens for me disabling the card and reenabling it in device manager resets the driver and fixes it luckily. Have you tried using an older version of the driver? I would definitely muck around with that and maybe see if the windows event viewer contains some any useful info as to why the driver crashed. Also, is your card OC'd? My OC seems less stable and more likely to cause crashing in kf2 in general."

Definitely don't use the matchmaking, it's not set up very well. Always just use the server browser, select your difficulty, desired game length, and HIDE EMPTY SERVERS.

killingfloor,3deea9,Limpinator,7,Wed Jul 15 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"I really dislike the idea of modded weapons, just overall seems unnecessary and has potential to be game breaking. Plus we'd eventually just reach a meta that everyone'd use and if someone didn't they'd be scolded for it and probably kicked every now and again."

But yet again, dosen't every game have a ""meta""? Hell even KF1 had some form of meta in terms of what weapons to buy and classes to run..Honestly I don't see that much of a difference."
killingfloor,3deea9,Dicktron2000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure, all games have metas. But depending on how strict it can get is where the line between 'what you do because it works well' and 'this is what you have to do because it works best' begins to blur. KF1 had a meta yeah, but not once did I see anyone go nuts over another person using what they wanted to. Modifications to weapons could create an environment of  ""You're not using X attachment? What are you fucking retarded? Change it you moron"". This could happen with just the guns given to us but it makes it alot less likely for there to be a single best strategy when you just have options that more or less do the same thing or do it in different ways. Weapon mods could work, they'd just have to be done very carefully and somewhat limited."
killingfloor,3deea9,Kyouji,3,Thu Jul 16 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"As far as Teleport goes they're trying to fix some problems KF1 brought. Teleporting zeds is meant to make sure they will always be near you/in front of you. In KF1 you could kite extremely easily once everything was behind you and slowly kill it off. They want to try to fix that since it was a issue. I will agree though that right now they teleport way too close to the player and in rare cases will teleport right in front of you(On multiple occasions I've had bloats spawn 2 feet in front of me and immediately puke on me, good times).  For XP I don't see a way for this to be fixed since its just a core problem with melee vs ranged. It was a issue in KF1 and it will always be one. Its the reason most Berserkers(in 1 and 2) stay by themselves. The only way for this to be fixed is if other players let a zerker take a side all to themselves. They gave them a ranged weapon which I guess is their way of trying to help ease the problem but a melee class at its core will always be in melee range.  Other than a lot of exploits/bugs that need to be fixed and some perks that need to balanced the game is going in the right direction. Just wish Tripwire would deem fixing massive exploits fast rather than letting everyone use them and make other players quit. The game might be EA but the more I see people use them and rage at others when they don't is slowly starting to drive me away from the game."
killingfloor,3deea9,katanamaster312,3,Wed Jul 15 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's some proper feedback.  The modifying weapons could become a pain though. Just imagine players always just modding whatever they want. Making the perks loose their own identity. I mean. The medic weapons, make the medic perk. Without those weapons his is not the medic perk anymore. And just giving him an aa12 or scar from the other perks arsenal. Will just result in the loose of personally those perks have. Also nerfing all this will be trouble for nothing.  I would be hoping for some executing moves by the zeds. Just imagine a scrake pulling you up with one hand. And look you straight in the eyes. When he forces his chainsaw in your stomach and throws you. O you can do some really nasty stuff with that. It would give me the creeps at least.  What I would like to add to the list is, the fact that we can still strafe-lock the scrake and sometimes Hans from attacking.   That ammo disappears, when playing commando while switching weapons.  When playing HOE. That the aa12 ammo is empty in just a matter of seconds. And forces supports to scavenge for ammo. Or pay to god his teammates have some ammo for him. Mostly resulting in becoming useless for the team. And causing them to get killed by scrake or fleshpounds.  And of course, the teleporting from zeds."
killingfloor,3deea9,geatki,5,Thu Jul 16 01:01:36 2015 UTC,I like the Bunker Down mode idea. It reminded me of the movie Aliens.
killingfloor,3deea9,CreamNPeaches,3,Wed Jul 15 18:25:25 2015 UTC,Like horde mode in Gears of War. That would be awesome in KF2.

killingfloor,3djn7m,Hi-Fi_Jacob,11,Thu Jul 16 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"Unpopular? I've been reading these suggestions for weeks. Funny you complained about leveling slowly. It's so much faster than in KF1, and there it was widely accepted as very good pacing. Also, duno where you've been, but for the last like month or so TW has been stating that the Berserker is getting a huge overhaul. Even last week it was revealed exactly how it would be buffed, too."

killingfloor,3djn7m,AsiaDerp,7,Fri Jul 17 01:33:54 2015 UTC,"What? 2 levels per hour is pointlessly slow leveling? And if you really play the game enough, you will know level dont actually help you that much in KF2. When you are level 10-15 (which basically means you finish all maps on hard/suicidal), you have your main perks and you should not have much trouble to play on HOE if you really know what to do.  Medics are only op on solo. Not because they heal too much, but because other perks' heal is garbage. We had 100 health across the board in KF1 and we have 20 self heal while most damage can be avoided. Now we have 120-150 health for most perks and we still heal for 20 while all zeds are faster then you so you take unavoidable damage."

killingfloor,3djn7m,Retrikaethan,3,Fri Jul 17 01:40:36 2015 UTC,1 level per hour is normal in most other games I have played. Why would I? When they buff the berserker I will remove this from the list of the many games that the game has.
killingfloor,3djn7m,skyoctopus,3,Fri Jul 17 06:18:07 2015 UTC,"-better AI: circle strafing makes the enemies too easy -nerf the f*cking scrakes: they are worse than the flesh pounds   Isn't that contradictory? You can't circle strafe FPs. Also try circle strafing a scrake mid game its not that easy.   -nerf the f*cking boss: being killed almost instantly by him is ridiculous   No, he is suppose to be hard. The only unfair thing about him is that its hard to see his grenades. But he does not need a nerf. He is suppose to be extremely difficult. This follows from KF1.   -faster leveling: 0.5 levels per hour is too tedious   No. Want to level faster? Play on a harder difficulty. To get to max level, level 25, that's 12.5 hours. That is inline with other games like MMOs."
killingfloor,3djn7m,skyoctopus,-7,Thu Jul 16 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"The only unfair thing about him is that its hard to see his grenades.   I DISAGREE! damage reduction is bullshit, just saying. he gets it when he needs to heal which results in an incredibly confusing state for players not familiar with his mechanics. specifically, they unload into him hoping to get extra damage which means they don't have ammo later in the fight when they need it. i'm not sure what a fix for it could be but i hope they address it at least. but yeah, the grenade's visuals are bs too.  other than that, i completely agree."
killingfloor,3djn7m,skyoctopus,3,Thu Jul 16 23:39:31 2015 UTC,True I forgot about that. That's a little unfair. I guess maybe its a way to force players to go through his 3/4 stages. But since he sucks at grabbing people they should just make him either take significantly less damage mitigation or damage mitigation for only like 5-10s.
killingfloor,3djn7m,skyoctopus,-2,Fri Jul 17 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is contradictory in that if you circle strafe the scrakes they are too easy but if you do not then they are too hard. Yes, it is easy.  The boss desperately needs a nerf.  No, just no. the leveling takes far longer than that."
killingfloor,3djn7m,MrPickles82,3,Fri Jul 17 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"the leveling takes far longer than that.   That's using your number. Also it took longer to level on KF1, so relative to KF1 it's faster.    Yes, this is contradictory in that if you circle strafe the scrakes they are too easy but if you do not then they are too hard.    Well wouldn't that mean it is only easy to deal with them?   It's like saying: ""It's hard to kill a fleshpound with the medic's scalpel, yeah you can use an AA12, but it still hard to kill with a scalpel"" Just use the AA12, don't use the scalpel!  On KF1 you had ""easy"" ways to deal with scrakes, like xbow and LAR which was much easier than circle strafe, less ammo and faster.   On KF2 one of the ""easy"" ways is circle strafe. So technically are they really hard?   Yes, it is easy.   Also try suicidal and hoe. Circle strafe is not always easy with a full chaotic team and having to deal with trash. And even if, once again it is still harder than in KF1. KF1 scrakes were breezes.   The boss desperately needs a nerf.   The boss on KF1 was not an easy one either. It would just be boring then if they nerfed him."

The fact that you could stun chain scrakes in KF1 with a LAR is still easier. Is that more broken?  Also as they release more classes I expect the dynamic to change. Others have shown how to deal with scrakes using beserker and support w/o using circle strafe on 6 man hoe.  I'll concede they are much worse than in KF1; They don't bleed out and their attack chains can do more damage. I just don't think the circle strafe is that broken, compared the cheap ways to deal with them in KF1.   the current boss is boring since all you do is run away from him constantly so he does not kill you instantly.   Well if you solo play its pretty boring but in a team fight you can try dodging his attacks, while others light him up."

killingfloor,3djn7m,cky3191,6,Fri Jul 17 09:32:37 2015 UTC,"Well the reason KF2 got made was because of KF1's success. It was in their best interest to stay close to KF1. I don't think it needs to always be FP > Scrake. I think it is interesting to have the scrake to be a real annoyance and a serious threat at times.    ""at least it is not as bad as KF1""   I would actually argue that it was too easy in KF1 and KF2 did it right.   But FPs are now much easier than they were in KF1. So I'd argue if they want to nerf scrakes it'd be consistent to at least buff FPs.  Honestly what is missing in the picture for me is the sharp shooter, which was the simplest way to deal with scrake. What if they nerf the scrake and then the sharp shooter is release and the scrake is easy again."
killingfloor,3djn7m,v4lor,3,Fri Jul 17 09:41:37 2015 UTC,"Running away from him gets you killed.  Circling him like a scrake will kill him.  Or that's how I did it in hoe on all the maps.  I circle him with a medic so I can lay down a grenade and heal if needed and blast with aa12... and escape fast when he decides to throw gas or grenades...Then I go back to circling.  If he pulls out his guns and you can't get to cover but you can get close to him, get close and he will put them away"
killingfloor,3djn7m,BlueAura74,2,Fri Jul 17 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"2 hours for a level isn't all that tedious, by the time you hit level 25 you are meant to be good at the game not be level 25 and suck at your class."

killingfloor,3djn7m,danyearight,-2,Fri Jul 17 06:22:32 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI: Your frame drops on the 970 are due to the newer Nvidia drivers tanking performance. On 347.88 I run the game at 1080p/60 every setting maxed with no problems whatsoever. I rolled back after the driver post-347.88 because  (aside from also crashing constantly) I went from a locked 60 (I got around 80ish, unlocked) to around 52. Something about Realtime Reflections on drivers past 347.88 just ruin performance for no discernible reason.  In addition, texture streaming shouldn't need to be disabled for a 970. When I tried disabling it for testing purposes, it actually made performance on the card -worse-.  Also FXAA is awful in every game ever, you shouldn't be enhancing it, you should be disabling it in-game and forcing your own AA in the Nvidia Control Panel.  As for the gameplay changes, can't agree on them, especially with enemy changes since you don't actually even talk about what specifically you see as the problem. They've said they're examining circle-strafing here. Also that they are revamping the Beserker here.  For the servers, 99% of them are custom servers not run by TW, so I'm not sure what you want them to do about them if they are bad (an issue I haven'tpersonally experienced, and my net isn't close to 60mbps). Matchmaking is indeed broken, however. Honestly, though, matchmaking is more of a console feature as I see it and I expect that to be very low on the priority-list considering most EA buyers will have been fans of KF1 who are used to using the server browser all-day-erry-day."

Maybe i'm alone in this opinion, but i feel if you're actually going to release a game into early access you should do it fast, rough, and dirty. The entire premise is to release buggy piles of crap we can give feedback on to make better, not play a stripped down version of a game before it's released that's more of an early demo than anything.  You don't need to spit polish your updates to a blinding shine when you're in early access, it's the entire point of the program."

Thousands of posts all over different forums suggesting how to improve berserker and a lot of them are very good suggestions. And congrats, all the ""feedback"" they can get is ""berserker need a fix"", might as well withhold how we want to fix it until its set in stone.   Most of the time I dont even bother to suggest anything even if I think its a good idea because all they need to know is ""X is broken"", and they will fix it their way. So all I need to do is agree that X is broken or bring it up to attention. And then, wait for the next patch notes with random changes."

killingfloor,3db97q,textbooksforrent,2,Wed Jul 15 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"Hilariously enough this is exactly what starbound does, i have no idea why.   I always felt that testing different levels like that were for testing different things about the game. The nightlies would be for finding immediate game-breaking stuff, unstable would be trying out new features and seeing what might need changing about that, and major stable releases would be for testing game progression, and other larger-scale features of the game that would otherwise be hindered by bugs. It'd be difficult to test game progression when you literally cannot progress due to a new bug introduced, right?   I never felt early access was all about finding bugs, after all. There's more to be tested than basic stuff like ""x is broken, fix this"".   Maybe Killing Floor 2 is the type of early access that wants feedback on overarching gameplay features, and isn't focused on bug bashing. They certainly got feedback regarding Berserker, and seem to be responding accordingly with the new perk choices and such. I could be wrong as I've not been following development or the developers closely, but just some ideas that come to mind."

You put up early access for player's feedback and test the game for you. So why the hell you only release things when they are done? What's there to test?   When the most popular wording is ""its Early Access"" its the biggest excuse for your to keep pumping unfinished content for players to TEST it. Not release it after you add a million detailed objects in the map or release totally polished perks that only your staff have played. Because the perks will most likely be broken when they first release (or break other things). You let players play it too see what is the biggest problem and fix it together with the polished content (such as textures) with small patches.  The current approach will only result in new content is broken one way or another, and will stay broken for a few months. This is the best way to lost players, and with new games poping up everyday, a lot of them will be gone for good. No games can survive only with hardcore fans."

If they do let you enable it even though you have a AMD gpu it will run off the CPU and that usually means a big performance drop.

killingfloor,3d9wvi,NostalgicMaps,5,Sat Jul 18 04:47:45 2015 UTC,It will probably be available for AMD GPUs as well but with horrible performance. In Witcher 3 I can enable HBAO+ and Hairworks on my AMD card so I would imagine it's the same case here.
killingfloor,3d9wvi,emorium,4,Tue Jul 14 19:58:41 2015 UTC,I believe it runs on your cpu and not your amd gpu. At least that's how physx works in borderlands

Even if it was meant to be blocking, the zeds would, as you said, never bounce off like that.  The alternative, however, is to create a unique animation for every zed attack being deflected based on their direction of attack for both the player AND the zeds, so you can see why they opted to go with a much simpler yet still understandable ""block and rebound"" animation."

If they do want to fix it, its one animation to make for the bigs zeds (because small zeds get bounce off is not as bad).   Because real parrying dont need you to be stronger than the attacker, and as you are parrying a chainsaw or drill arm, it also make sense you take some damage too.

Do people really think a horde mode game is something that is going to last a long time game wise?.People can throw up numbers like 500 hours or 1000 hours but the vast amount of players aren't going to play that much, not that devs care once the money is spent."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,itonlygetsworse,2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"I dont really feel like Tripwire did this tho.  I agree that a lot of games never leave beta.  I played heroes of newerth for freaking ever and it was always in beta. i quit and a year later it was finally being officially released.  IMO, KF2 is in good shape for the content we've been given.  Nothing is honestly game BREAKING.  Also, this doesnt really feel like a game where the devs can trickle out content.  What do you want them to do to sate everyones appetite?  Releasing a whole class or a new character/skin takes a lot of time.  Nothing in this game can really be released half assed.    Most of these ""early access"" complaint posts will talk about how x, y, and z mechanic is broken or needs love, but by the end of it they always argue for ""needed another class added asap.""  Great, so you want a new class to experience all these ""GAME BREAKING"" mechanics? please... just go play another game if the 4 classes we have bore you.  Alternative: you couldn't be playing any class at all.  Personally, im happy for what we have, and TW as a company has always seemed to do great things for their customers."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,flippwn,17,Wed Jul 15 04:04:10 2015 UTC,"They give feedback every 2 weeks, some of the stuff they're bringing in isn't so simple, they're working on new bosses, fixing the Scrake, overhauling the zerker tree, (including Volter Manor) 5 new maps, 2 new perks and god knows what else. I'd rather them take a little longer to make better content than have them release Demo and Firebug tomorrow and they're both broken."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Mozzykins,7,Mon Jul 13 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"I meant feedback from the players. It's okay in my opinion for early access stuff to be broken, because it's an early version. If we had weekly versions/updates, the players would be able to mess around and see what works and what doesn't faster. Though perhaps this method is better for a closed beta?"
killingfloor,3d5oqw,MSB3000,0,Tue Jul 14 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"I really wish more gamers thought like you. Such an entitled bunch. Where is this standard of development time that I keep seeing people referring to? ""3 months between updates is too much""...by what metric? I think we get spoiled by games like TF2 where there is an update ever week (that have nearly no tangible change to the game), but we gotta remember TW are a small-ish team with multiple projects. Am I frustrated that new content is taking a little while? Sure, a little, I guess. But I have faith in TW, and feel like they're probably working day-in-day-out for this."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,joelunchbucket,5,Tue Jul 14 11:40:32 2015 UTC,"""Spoiled by games like tf2"".... There hasn't been a substantial update in that game for a long time. Although it is being ported to source 2 so it's ok.  I agree that putting a timeframe on development is pretty much impossible. Although tripwire also just announced a new game... Cmon guys finish the one you started first, people already paid for this.  I don't even care that much about that, although I would love more frequent updates on how development is going. Paying for early access makes me feel like a tester and investor. I like to know where my money is going."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Flowers214,3,Tue Jul 14 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, TWI is a big company and has multiple teams working on different projects. It seems like the Red Orchestra/Rising Storm team is separate from the Killing Floor team. KF2 was in development at the same time of Rising Storm (I think. I could be wrong). I'm not sure that development on Rising Storm 2 has that much of an impact on the KF2 development team.  That being said, I wish they had an ""experimental branch"" that was updated daily. It would totally be broken and buggy, but at least we'd be able to test out what TWI was up to. I appreciate that they're updating us through community announcements, but I wish they would let us try the WIP content."

Although, there's always the risk that people are going to bitch and moan even more when the experimental version is buggy and unpolished (Who would have thunk?). I feel sorry for game developers in general. Having to deal with a game community must be exhausting."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,TokyoUD,2,Tue Jul 14 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"More like they're used to League of Legends getting a new champion every 2 months. I'm not overly frustrated at all with how long it takes them to release the full game, as long as the game is fantastic when they release it."

Now thats not going to be everyones opinion, but for me, its only positive things to look forward to.  ""beta"" and ""early access"" really brings out the entitled side of people.  every other day theres a ""i want my cake and to eat it too, gimme gimme gimee"" post."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,flippwn,74,Wed Jul 15 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"It's better if you forget this game even exists for like, the next year and just come back when the content is there."

I figured one of the new perks or Sharpshooter would've been in after a few months so I got the game, but there's still nothing new besides one map....   Some of us don't have much money to spare for games so it's a constant annoying reminder with their pace/priority of releasing content that I could've spent it on literally anything else and not gotten as much disappointment. Yeah ""blah blah it's EA you should've expected it"", but really.....four months and still nothing significant?"
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Zelphyre,20,Mon Jul 13 21:19:25 2015 UTC,So you purchased a game knowing it had no current content/classes you liked?   It's been three months.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Quacktard,4,Mon Jul 13 22:13:47 2015 UTC,"It's actually closing in on four months now, and if you actually read it all you would've noticed how I said I bought it with the plan something would've been out after a while of waiting, not it coming up on a third of a year with nothing to show besides some balance tweaks. If they had not been working on Demo and FB simultaneously, the two most graphically demanding perks of the game which require the most work to animate/etc, any other one of the perks probably could've been out by now. (Like SS, or one of the new perks)"
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Zelphyre,5,Mon Jul 13 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"My theory is that they still haven't completely decided how SS and the Gunslinger will be different, and they're still working out the fine details. If there's no concrete vision for those two perks, then doing the Demo and FB would be a lot quicker, as it's a lot easier to reproduce an existing perk than creating an entirely new one."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,darth_static,5,Tue Jul 14 00:01:57 2015 UTC,"I've recalled them mentioning how sharp and gunslinger would be different in the first pcgamer article over a year ago.  Essentially, gunslinger is that dude with dual pistols going rambo with speed and agility.  Sharpshooter would be the sniper, standing in the back with a rifle popping heads off bigger foes.  And a possible perk skill: the longer the SS stands still, the more damage they do.  Still not sure why SS isn't added in earlier, but I'm patient.  I'd rather they do it well rather than rushed."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Kuebic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:43 2015 UTC,"It's probably one of the easier perks to put in the game, FB and Demo are more graphics intensive, so they want to get the hard ones out of the way first.   I loved SS in KF1, but honestly, I've gotten pretty attached to Commando in KF2, you still get to pop heads, and there's even a scope on the SCAR."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Mozzykins,13,Tue Jul 14 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"It's actually closing in on four months now   It came out on April 21st, the fourth month of the year. It's currently July 13th, the seventh month of the year. It hasn't even been three months yet.   and if you actually read it all you would've noticed how I said I bought it with the plan something would've been out after a while of waiting   I don't know how you think this justifies it. You went in assuming TWI's schedule would fit yours without knowing anything about it. You were wrong. You have no one to blame but yourself.   If they had not been working on Demo and FB simultaneously, the two most graphically demanding perks of the game which require the most work to animate/etc, any other one of the perks probably could've been out by now. (Like SS, or one of the new perks)   I feel like this is a very good reason to work on it early. Get the most difficult patch out of the way first, then start pouring out the other ones since they'll be easier.  There are multiple ways to tackle development. I don't know why people on this sub can't understand this. Making video games isn't all sunshine and rainbows. God knows what complications they've come across trying to put all this stuff into the game."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,LightningBolt101,-4,Tue Jul 14 00:06:14 2015 UTC,"It came out as EA officially at that time yes, but they had that month of early testing invites which was only just getting the servers and the like tuned to the main playerbase so that ties a little bit into the timeline since the game was still the same.   And as for putting a timeline on them, like I said in a different post I bought it with no expectations of ""quick"" content. If they had worked on either Demo or FB and then a different perk instead there's a chance one of them would have been out by now, why does it sound whiny or entitled that 3+ months with nothing still?   I do understand things can happen which delay it. Like I  said elsewhere if they released it even like a month later it probably would've been easier in the regular viewers eyes for how long it's taken for content outside of tweaks."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Zelphyre,6,Tue Jul 14 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you haven't got much money for games, why would you be buying Early Access titles at all? You're never going to be getting all your moneys worth up front anyway."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Forrell92,0,Mon Jul 13 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"That's fair to an extent. At the time I had some extra money laying around  and nothing else was on sale worth buying at that time, and since I loved KF1 I figured why not? I was hoping Support would actually be able to keep me entertained for a bit, but they went the route of AA12 or gtfo once again leaving the combat shotgun, my favorite shotty in the first game, in the same pathetic state.   Is 3 months expecting even one perk really asking for that much? At this rate the content is going the game won't be finished for at least a year at this exact point, and that's kind of weak. Even though the base gameplay is solid, this feels like early access to the early access and they should've waited another month or two before putting it out and done some more invites to get the early kinks out of the way."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Zelphyre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand how long dev TAKES. It's a long and hard process. Games can cause complicated and annoying bugs even if you know the engine well. Tripwire is using UE4, which is brand new. There were huge changes between 3 and 4, too, so their exp with UE3 is limited in usefulness. If they add something, as a general rule it breaks 3 other things, that then must be fixed. The games that take 2-3 years have HUGE dev teams compared to tripwire, and even then often come out shit. Stop whining unless you can do it better. And don't use Obsidian or Lucas Arts to compare; Lucas Arts devs went through literal hell and all left afterwords, and Obsidian are an inhuman aberrations that made deals with Satan for their superhuman skill."

The quest design is beautiful and expansive, the world is believable, the characters fleshed out, and they didn't railroad the player. There are some flaws: the legion isn't as fleshed out, you can't live in legion lands or explore them, Ulysses from lonesome road is meh-tier and kind of flat, and some quests feel empty.   Then you find out that they made the entire game in 18 months. Ulysses was planned as the legion version of Boone, the legion lands were planned, as expansive as NCR lands. There were a lot more quests and more in each quest planned. Then they found out they had 18 months and made New Vegas in that time."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Eain,2,Tue Jul 14 20:50:38 2015 UTC,That's what I did. I played alot the first few weeks but when I realized that patches would be more seasonal than monthly I decided to stop playing till they at least release all the classes. By the time that happens it could be a year or two from now and I will have completely forgotten about paying for the game. It will feel like I got it for free.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,cromwest,10,Wed Jul 15 16:07:36 2015 UTC,you have a point. i dont care much for dosh bling and dont mind it being there but i would much prefer the balance patches.  they are apparently redoing the whole zerker tree but why not change a new choice for the tree every few weeks instead of doing it all at once? that would feel like actual content is being worked on.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,1wsx10,7,Mon Jul 13 23:44:02 2015 UTC,I just want them to get rid of this OP zed teleporting that is rampant atm.  Feels a lot more like I'm getting screwed by 2 scrakes appearing in front of me rather than messing up and dying on harder difficulties.  With that change I would be 100% fine with the game as it stands (as an early access title).  I trust TWI and I don't believe they are part of the new trend of scummy devs.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,orcaaaaaaaa,7,Tue Jul 14 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"It does appear like TWI is treating KF2 no different than other games they've released.  They just get to slap an early access label so people don't get too mad about lack of content in its current state.  Definitely not an ""ideal"" early access structure but the amount of thought going into their patches and their track record are both very promising.  Only issue here is time, but it's easy to remain confident in the final result."

They added the Dosh Bling thing earlier than the overhaul of zerker because it is infinitely easier to do. People think buying an early access game is akin to getting an incomplete game that will be complete in the near future. I am 140 hours into this 'awful' early access and I still love the way the boomstick makes a corpse fly.

killingfloor,3d5oqw,avalanches,3,Tue Jul 14 16:49:07 2015 UTC,Didn't tripwire have terrible communication beforehand and a tool who ran the company before he either got kicked out or cooled down? I would hear non-stop that the way they've handled red orchestra is dog shit.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Kellervo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"The way they handled the launch was poor (buggy, so incredibly buggy), but they did give it a ton of post-launch support to remedy the issue - plus, KF1 had a metric ton of free content and post-launch support as well.  Their communication could use some work, but they have a good track record of supporting their games. The people going around claiming they have it out for their playerbase and don't intend on finishing the game / supporting the playerbase are making a bit of a reach."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,avalanches,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:03:16 2015 UTC,But let's agree to find the truth somewhere in the middle of both sides. There could be more communication with the community. I don't feel like the feedback they talked about wanting/needing is falling on anything other than deaf ears.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Kellervo,2,Tue Jul 14 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"They've definitely been communicative, I just feel like some people are expecting / demanding too much from them on that front and reacting far too negatively when the answers they receive aren't to their satisfaction. Tripwire is right up there with Digital Extremes in my mind - both studios do communicate a lot, much more than other studios.   But they both draw a bit of heat because they don't communicate well, which is just a natural outcome when you have developers - people who aren't necessarily trained in marketing / communication - responding to the questions and demands of the internet.  The truth is definitely somewhere in the middle. The only issue I have is with people going around saying that TW is malicious / lying just because they aren't saying what they want to hear."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,avalanches,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, good example. Tripwire can learn from DE. For example, DE do at least one live Question and Answer a month, regardless of update schedules. These are usually 2+ hours long, on top of having a weekly show with their community manager, who is VERY active on their boards and their reddit. Apart from the FREE CONTENT UPDATE where Tripwire addressed the zerker feedback it has been pretty dark. Tripwire are nowhere near DE, and DE isn't even the best themselves when it comes to community communication. Shit dog, DERebecca -will straight up ask- the devs sitting in front of her -burning- questions from the community. At least they communicate effectively. Tripwire does not communicate effectively. Digital Extremes will say 'Look at all of this art we've made for something we haven't even announced or will even be out for months.' and they're doing it for the people who have already spent money, and will continue to spend money. KF2 will share a lot with Payday 2 in this regard down the line. They have my 30$, and they more than likely have some 5~7$ content packs with guns and maps in the pipeline for post release. Tell me what I'm looking forward too beyond 'expect an update in august' and that's it."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,AsiaDerp,8,Tue Jul 14 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"""the right way of early access"" ----Its just another early access game  ""free content pack"" --- Its an UPDATE FFS....  ""we dont care about player count"" --- Let me just say I dont think the sudden increase in frequency of WWAUT posts is a coincidence.  I am ok with fairly slow updates (not THAT slow however), but people also need to know that they have an early-early access for a month before the public early access. And the problems that is there for FOUR months are still yet to be fix. Instead, they think adding dosh bling is more important.  They put all that gimmicky mechanics that players from KF1 or good teams in general won use, like stumble, parry, knockdown (its already in the game), even dodging attacks fucks you up because on HOE you NEED headshots and all of the above fucks up your head shot.   And from what I heard, the engine they are using requires a total recook of the whole thing even what you want to do is a basic number change. So, balanced update will also take forever. This also explain why KF1 is still unbalanced as hell after 5+ years.  So yeah, let's just praise everything about TWI and make them another EA games (the game company). Seriously people, we need to tell them when they fuck up, where they fuck up."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,ILikeTastyBread,3,Tue Jul 14 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, tripwire modified unreal and created a the brewing system, which allows them to update maps and features without forcing players to re download half the game"
killingfloor,3d5oqw,chromeshelter,6,Tue Jul 14 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah they should release something at least every two weaks. Fine tuning and balancing takes time and they will basically release their first balance patch with the next update which might not even be the good direction (only time will tell). They are wasting loads of time, many of these balance issues should have been addressed earlier, even if they cannot release any new content with the update just the balance changes. Really disappointed so far."

killingfloor,3d5oqw,textbooksforrent,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd say this is wrong. Because trying to balance something in a vacuum rather in the larger context of the finished (or at least ""more finished"") game is a complete waste of effort.   Balance involves the power of classes/weapons in relation to each other. Things we think are under or over powered currently could change instantly with the release of new items, without anything having been done to the original item directly.   They adjusted a few things here and there in the context of the current game (med grenades balancing), but they can't just balance one piece at a time... that literally doesn't make sense to do when you have nothing to compare it to."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,chromeshelter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:02:14 2015 UTC,Well that's just the way things work. Really imbalanced stuff should be instantly balanced because it leads to players leaving due to the bad experience. I don't think changing three values on a merc's sheet should be something they should not spend time on.   Also the matchmaking issue is here for like two months at least and it is a core part of building a competitive game not to be overlooked.

This is what I have been saying to the people complaining about scrakes and fleshpounds and Hans needing balance. At least wait until all the classes are out before you complain about difficulty, one redditor said to me that I have no proof scrakes will be easier when Sharp is added, although it takes one emp and a mag from the Scar to take one out now. How fast will it be with a lvl 25 sharp with his headshot boost and an emp. Unless they give scrakes headshot resis then that's all I could think to make it harder for sharps to kill them, but that would go against nerfing them."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Kyouji,5,Mon Jul 13 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a die hard KF fan but thus far KF2 is almost to the point of making me quit the game because of the way they're handling this ""Early Access"". I understand things take time but when I see so many bugs/exploits being used by ALL players it really ruins the game for me. The worst part is if you ask them about this they will just say ""its EA"" like its okay to let these massive exploits/bugs to be in the game cause the game is labeled as ""EA"". I can only watch players circle strafe Scrakes/Hans so many times and watch the players think they're awesome before it drives me away.  I'm okay with perks/maps taking a while to release but when the core game is so broken and unbalanced I can only handle it for so long before its time to move on. Sure, these issues might be patched one day, but the fact they don't put these things at a higher priority tells me they don't consider them a real big issue."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,TheRybka,3,Tue Jul 14 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they necessarily wanted an early access.    Let me clarify. TWI clearly has their own way of doing things. They have their own workflow, their own goals, etc. I think that the fan hype for KF2 was so strong, and they wanted to make their fans happy, so they more or less released a polished, playable beta so that we could enjoy it now.    But that's the thing. A polished, playable beta is so unlike early access. They said ""early access done right"" but this isn't the same as other early access titles. I think that they spent time polishing up our client version, getting it ready to ship, and giving it to us...and the second it was out the door, they said ""alright, back to work"" and went right back under the hood of the ""real"" KF2, which is likely pretty rough and is still being tinkered with. They can give us a map and some small tweaks, but they're probably iterations ahead in internal testing, but that version isn't as polished as the one we have now. They'll probably spend some time porting that back over to our client, and then go back under the hood again for whatever's next.    tl;dr I bet there are two versions, our highly polished and playable version and the WIP version where more content and balance is being iterated. Taking that progress and porting it back over will take some time. Speculation."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,textbooksforrent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Content wise, the game is a bit light, yeah. I think that's why they're going with the ""Early Access"" tag.  But mechanically? The game is 99% done. The animations, weapons, perks, zeds, maps etc. all work as intended. There are some bugs here and there, but there aren't really any game systems which are incomplete right now."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,exnx,7,Wed Jul 15 14:22:25 2015 UTC,At this rate Kf2 will be in early access for years.  That is frustrating.  Honestly the game shouldn't have been released at all with this little content.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Calizorz,4,Mon Jul 13 21:29:39 2015 UTC,Years is too dramatic. 2 perks + 3 maps in 3 months isn't terribly bad. They could release 4 more perks and 6 maps in half a year which would be close to a complete game.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,textbooksforrent,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Once that patch drops, the game will have as much content as KF1 did when it first launched. Maybe 1 less perk and 1 less map? People are being so dramatic."

Its easy, you put 30 things on a map and youre done, I think that may be blowing it out of proportion to overstate its importance to TW"
killingfloor,3d5oqw,LightningBolt101,2,Thu Jul 16 15:37:41 2015 UTC,"The problem is that if you just release a bunch of smaller patches all the time, people are going to then get upset that there's no content being put out. Now you constantly have to fix your most likely broken patches alongside working on content. Talk about a QA nightmare. TWI had to pick which route they wanted to take (many small patches vs few big patches) and they chose to take their time.  One reason this patch is taking so long is because they're working on Demo at the same time as Firebug. This is most likely because the community was demanding at least Demo/SS be put into the game, and they knew if they only released Firebug there would be a total shitstorm. People are complaining about the tankiness of Fleshpounds (pro tip: Pulverizor) and they decided Demo would be the better choice. They also have to completely rework Berserker because what they had wasn't what they were expecting. Combined with the fact that they decided to add two maps to this release, and you get a pretty long build time.  We don't need lots of small patches that just break the game. The only real game breaking bug I've come across so far is the glitch where a melee attack from a Zed will instantly kill you, and it's pretty rare. Minus the awful teleporting and cheap spawning (which was also in KF1), most of the game is relatively balanced and doesn't need to be overhauled every two weeks. You patch when you need to, not when you want to. Patches aren't easy and have a tendency to break more things than they fix."

Compared to TWI who are taking an ungodly amount of time to say anything even when they have barely any other stream of income. Having less income should mean they should be working to get more content out to increase sales.  edit: can't disprove. so downvotes me -.-

killingfloor,3d5oqw,TokyoUD,-2,Wed Jul 15 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"I understand your frustration, but please remember that development takes time. Try to have some patience.  I've done mapping for shooters before (for mods). A single map for a multiplayer environment (from cradle to grave) can take from as little as 100 hours to as much as 1,000 hours. Sometimes more.  The crazy thing about EA is that if they treated paying customers like actual testers they would probably catch a lot of shit for it. An alpha test for a map would look like this. Pure geometry to test the flow of the map - how players can use the environment combined with how the enemies handle pathfinding.  Now, if they released something like that for us to test, how do you think most of the community would react?  EA is a weird mix of test and a product you pay for and that makes things difficult as a result. If they release something unpolished like that for testing they'll catch hell for it."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,Ihmhi,2,Tue Jul 14 03:52:24 2015 UTC,This is definitely a good point that is often forgotten.  Making good content in a game takes time.

It takes at least a week of testing to take a rough prototype to something that has some sort of semblance of flow.

Some modern companies would have said ""Eh, fuck it"" and just tried to build on a broken codebase but they had the balls to step up and do what needed to be done."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,katanamaster312,2,Tue Jul 14 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a big supporter of Early Access personally. It really just boils down to the team behind the game. My personal favorite Early Access developers are Vlambeer (Nuclear Throne), Introversion (Prison Architect, and Nornware (Space Beast Terror Fright). There's a handful other developers that are just as good, but those three are my favorite because they're good at communicating and they deliver.   I can appreciate TWI taking the time to deliver quality content. They might be pretty slow, but at least they're communicating. Hopefully we can get our hands on the new perks soonish. I'm excited to see how Demo and Firebug change the flow of KF2."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,eronth,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"Okay guys, listen up. I'm not trying to defend them. But they did say that the development process to the final version will take a lot of time. Neither did they or we know, that it would take so much time. BUT! there is hope. They announced at the E3 that there will be a new gore system upgrade. And the firebug and demo are coming soon Youtube. They said this. 6 More perks! And their weapons! More Maps! Crawlers do not yet walk on walls (we are currently planning this) Siren Scream pull has been turned off (while we work on a new implementation) plus a lot of fixes Source They are also addressing the berserker class as mentioned before. If you want to know what they are up to, look here. Link The way how they handling the development of killingfloor2 is admirable. They absolutely try to keep a close line to the players and their wishes. ""Shout out to Yoshiro for doing a great job""  I come from killingfloor1. And I can tell you. I was happy with how killingfloor1 turned out. There were a lot of free content updated ""Seasonal"". Even after full release. And don't forget. The amazing community that made all those cool modded servers. The only thing that made some people mad at killingfloor1. Was the fact that some weapon updates weren't free. But mostly they were just skins. Also most of you guys that are whining. Didn't even completed all maps on all the difficulties yet ""No offense. But I'm not a fan of saying there is not enough content. When clearly it's above your level"".  It's a early-access. And they never lied. They are a loyal and great team that still focuses on the pc platform that most developers have abandoned. And they really are putting in the hours of work. I can tell you. Because I am a 3d modeler/animator. And it does take a lot more time then people can imagine. The quality is there. All they need now is your feedback and time to improve an already great game. And not just ranting from people that get frustrated. If you want to help. Come with constructive feedback. I did that before. And they listened. I said the welding exp was too much. They changed it. I said that the medic healing exp could be better. They also adjusted that. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. But the point is. You can help them make the game better. So if you want that. Give them that feedback. And remember. It's just early-access. Give them time.  EDIT [Update from Yoshiro about this topic and others] Link to the post"

killingfloor,3d5oqw,eronth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:28:05 2015 UTC,But.... They announced another game at E3 2015... Without even finishing this one..

Splitting a already small team while you have a unfinished game released.....  Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripwire_Interactive . The wiki page states TWI only has 50 employees.
killingfloor,3d5oqw,ReverendDuckworth,-3,Wed Jul 15 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"Y'all need to stop whining. The best-received EA games have been in EA for literally years, and while maybe they release more consistent updates than KF2, KF2's updates look like they're going to be absolutely giant. Increasing the available perks by 50%, available maps by 100%, and available weapons by 30-40% is an enormous amount of content to add within a few months of EA release, and that's what we'll have when the FB/DEMO update drops.   All of that, including effort spent on balancing, which is, by the way, based at least somewhat on feedback and performance metrics according to TW themselves, is great. I personally like the fairly comprehensive approach they're taking with KF2 (see update comments on the Berserker). If you want a game that has flavor-of-the-month style balancing which feels like it can be adjusted in perpetuity without ever achieving actual balance, go play League. However, if you can wait a couple months for a meaningful update, you'll get a better result at the end, and that's the route that TW seems to be taking with KF2.  As for Dosh Bling... what? Why do you care about something that takes up such a minute amount of time? I can't possibly imagine a way to implement dosh bling that would take more than a couple man-hours per map- if you're seriously upset about the grand total of... maybe... 20 wasted hours of work over the course of the last few months at this size of a company, you might as well crack down on employees who take excessively long bathroom breaks. Don't be that guy."
killingfloor,3d5oqw,CptCarmex,0,Mon Jul 13 23:12:25 2015 UTC,I've abandoned hope for this game and TWI as a company. I really wish Steam Refunds were available when this pile of trash was over hyped.   This isn't the correct way to do Early Access

killingfloor,3d5oqw,Jibsie,6,Tue Jul 14 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"50% more content, wow, holy shit, considering the game had 4 perks and 3 maps on ""release"" it's not that hard to reach the 50% number"
killingfloor,3d5oqw,gjoeyjoe,-1,Tue Jul 14 05:02:00 2015 UTC,When KF one was first released it was released as a full game had barely half the guns (the revolver and mk21 pistols were late editions as an example) and was missing at least the demo perk if not one more had maybe 10 maps and hell less difficulties . If you ask me KF 1 was an EA game disguised as a full game the only difference is there able to be honest with KF2   It also comes down to not being able to please everybody if they updated like you want them to another person would get upset at all the small frequent updates they were doing and would like them to do large infrequent updates. The company has a way they enjoy working and it works for they allow them to continue that path and it will all work out
killingfloor,3d5oqw,King_Pumpernickel,-1,Tue Jul 14 06:42:22 2015 UTC,I don't share this sentiment. Did you read about their implementation of the nvidia physx? Not exactly easy.

There is little content right now, because it's EA. Community gives feedback. TW responds to feedback. They're fighting a two front war, fixing numerous bugs and features people don't like, as well as adding a ton of content. They're trying to avoid a total shitshow at full release, because most AAA games have been like that recently. Fuck, I've never seen a more impatient game community."

killingfloor,3d4jys,poyepolomi,3,Mon Jul 13 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"While it could be better, it doesn't bother me nearly as much as some other people. I find it straightforward enough to just press A or D for a split second to activate the horizontal swing, it's short enough to not really hinder my forward movement. Sometimes I even look sideways with the mouse at the same time to completely keep moving in the same direction and go back to looking forward as soon as I launched the attack.  Also I don't think that the forward attack is useless. I prefer using it against Bloats with the Crovel, or Fleshpounds with the Pulv for instance, I find that I am more consistently hitting their head this way. With a side swing you gotta look upwards to hit the head.  If they find a better way to do it, by all means. I don't find this mechanic inherently good, it's just that it doesn't bother me."
killingfloor,3d4jys,poyepolomi,3,Mon Jul 13 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing, may be some people find the vertical swing better on head shotting bloats, but for FPs you are not actually doing anything by headshotting (with the pulv M2 at least). I dont think the explosive part can head shot and I dont think the headshot damage itself benefits you unless you and your team able to deplete the FP's head health which basically never happens. The slight damage from the hammer headshot itself is nothing.  I actually did some testing with unperked pulv, its always 13 hits of M2 to kill 6-man HOE FP, but if you go for the head, it will be 14 hits most of the time. I guess its about the explosive radius, but even if it isnt, you still dont need to head shot FPs. You can also hit the zeds around the FP by doing the horizontal body hit."
killingfloor,3d4jys,MrRotch61,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"Oh good to know, the difference sounds really negligible. I already killed a Fleshpound by blowing his head up, which is why I assumed that it's better. Guess it's not worth the trouble! Thanks for the details."
killingfloor,3d4jys,Modestyiswimpy,3,Mon Jul 13 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I would rather there be an option to enable KF1-style melee. IIRC, the light attack with the katana did vertical hits, while the heavy attack did the same reliable horizontal attack every time. Made it easier to time when to step forward for the attack to hit where you want it to."
killingfloor,3d4jys,Centias,2,Mon Jul 13 19:22:42 2015 UTC,My only request would be to change forward strafing (W+A||D) to a sweep attack vs the power attack it is now.
killingfloor,3d4jys,Vannilazero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think this would be the simplest change that could make it work out much better. If you're moving sideways at all, you probably want that side swing."

It's ALWAYS some kind of horizontal swing (with blade or blunt [ayyy]) even if you're moving forward, because it's a game about killing zombies and the devs realize that players realize that horizontal cuts are most efficient for beheading, killing multiple zombies at once, or both. And if you want a stronger ""just for this guy attack,"" hold down the button for a slower but stronger vertical strike. It's great and a good 60% of why I play Dying Light is because the combat is just so much fun. There's also a quick dodge button which I hope starts to become standard in more melee combat games."

That way people on higher difficulties have something other than multiple AA12's to invest in late game. Everyone having the option for much more expensive night vision and cheaper flares would be best.
killingfloor,3d28ok,H_Grunt,2,Mon Jul 13 20:10:14 2015 UTC,Then the flares should have a moderate active period (30 seconds to a minute maybe?) and cost more so they aren't used all the time. There should also be a limit on the amount of flares active at the same time to prevent them being spammed and potentially killing performance.
killingfloor,3d28ok,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Seeing as how each round lasts 3~5 minutes you could reasonably determine ""yeah 4 flares are worth 100$"", that's like two minutes of being able to shoot zeds without relying on a flashlight"""

killingfloor,3d21m3,SuperGiraffe,3,Mon Jul 13 05:43:53 2015 UTC,"Don't even really need to. Just shoot in burst of ~8 shots. Almost no recoil to control, especially if you crouch+ADS."
killingfloor,3d21m3,qqnowqq,4,Mon Jul 13 05:44:35 2015 UTC,It's funny that you got downvoted for this... but right now it's absolutely commando for general purpose if you land the headshots consistently.
killingfloor,3d21m3,jorgamun,6,Sun Jul 12 23:29:20 2015 UTC,"Because most people are still shooting FPs with AA12 and think that's doing a lot of damage. In case people dont know, you are NOT doing much damage. Body spamming scrakes and FPs on HOE only make you run out of ammo when there's still half a wave to go. And if you run up to FP/Scrakes's face for head shot, you get kill. But in the case of scrakes, AA12 could bring the most DPS for a short while. For FPs, buy a pulv and you out damage AA12.  And commando only need 1 mag to kill a scrake while having.... 20 mags? Yes, support can headshot too, but for support to actually do damage to the head without most of the pellet missing, you need to be at a really really narrow range of distance (so he dont start swinging the chainsaw). If you are using EMP head shot for scrakes, commandos are doing most of the work unless again, you are at that perfect distance somehow.  What I have notice is teams that get decently far (make it to wave 8-10) have more and more commandos. Teams with a bunch of supports dont seems to go very far on HOE. On most of my wining games on HOE there will either be only one sup or no sup at all.  EDIT: Now come to think of it... may be AA12 still out damage pulv to FPs if you really dump all your ammo on one. And if we go full DPS race (such as for Hans), AA12 seems to be the best here."
killingfloor,3d21m3,AsiaDerp,2,Mon Jul 13 01:51:20 2015 UTC,supportsux (at least relatively)
killingfloor,3d21m3,qqnowqq,6,Mon Jul 13 05:53:08 2015 UTC,"They nerf support in everyway possible. Some intentionally, some not.  Weapon switching speed, which is very important in KF1, get at least tripled the time while increasing zeds speed by a lot. You simply have no time to switch weapon without taking a lot of damage, so, after you AA12 whatever you think is worth it, you either shoot that lone gorefast with another shell, or you hope your team kills it for you. Yes, I know you can bash, then another clot is in your face, what do you do? Bash again? You just want to switch to the DBS to kill that siren, now she is in your face and start screaming.   Ammo count. As mentioned above, you run out of ammo too fast, yes, this is a needed change, but you need a lot more shots to kill med-big zeds.  Reload. In KF1 you can switch as soon as you finish reload. Now you have to pay very close attention to the number at the bottom right corner and switch, and the reload is slower. And if you are 0.1 seconds too fast, congrats, your AA12 is NOT reloaded.   Effective range. In fact the spread is wider in KF1 for AA12, but you double hit with each pellet so the effective range in KF1 is actually a lot longer. Now you have to be at a very very specific distance so the zeds dont start their attack (which move their head A LOT) and still do full damage.   Zed health, because bump up health is the only way to make the game harder and fun to play, all zeds that is bloat tier or higher has crazy amount of health compare to KF1. So now you either use the shotgun for single target by aiming slightly up, or you body spam and waste your ammo. Both make shotguns ineffective in what they do. You cant even guarantee to kill a gorefast ~8m away with the DBS. Body spam = running out of ammo. Headshotting = single target. Now you either waste all the AOE potential or you use an AOE weapon for single target.   I like shotguns, but the more I play with shotguns in KF2 the more I find it ineffective. I hate the fact that my AA12 is only used when a zerk EMP a scrake. I end up buying ARs and shoot the heads like a commando and only use my shotguns on single target (scrake mainly / sometimes FPs). I also tried the style of AA12 trash and use AR on EMPed scrakes, but most of the time I am hoping something get into the effective rage before they are decaped or dead. Most of the time I am still shooting single target with one shell."
killingfloor,3d21m3,AsiaDerp,2,Mon Jul 13 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"As supp, I usually use medAR for scrakes and AA12 only for pushing back zeds during chaos. Total waste of ammo for AA12 on scrakes and fleshpounds. Support was very overpowered in KF1 though; he definitely needed these nerfs imo. I think KF2 support right now is fairly balanced, though. What really needs nerfs is commando haha, but most people still don't see their power and believe support is OP. best DPS. lel."
killingfloor,3d21m3,qqnowqq,2,Mon Jul 13 06:26:57 2015 UTC,Doesnt the medic AR prevent you from getting the third weapon? I do agree that KF1 sup is way OP (which I agree need some adjustment). But in KF2 they dont bring enough benefit to the table. Or should I say shotguns in KF2 is the problem. They cut the ammo count but make everything that is not trash requires a lot more ammo to kill.
killingfloor,3d21m3,AsiaDerp,2,Mon Jul 13 06:30:53 2015 UTC,"medAR+AA12 puts you at 17/20, enough for a med pistol or med smg or katana. Besides, you're a support, you should be supporting the team killing off things they need help with, not killwhoring every zed possible."
killingfloor,3d21m3,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:44:16 2015 UTC,"And that's why support is bad right now....why would you want a support who can only ""support"" the team instead of actually helping? Even a pulv medic can help to burst down FPs / panic stumble scrakes.  The funny thing is the supplier perk is only useful if you have multiple support. With only one support its not that useful, you may as well have another commando or medic."
killingfloor,3d21m3,AsiaDerp,3,Mon Jul 13 07:47:50 2015 UTC,"The support specialist helps by supporting the team kill zeds that need to be killed. This really means he helps with emergency crowd control, specific trash killing management (dangerously close trash or sirens near scrakes), and partially the supplier perk. But yeah, there's really no place for support in the optimal meta at the moment. Commando and Berserker both extremely outclass him. IMO, it's more about them needing nerfs than support needing buffs. (Mando should have less total ammo and do less dps.. and Zerk is already getting a heavy set of buffs.. so w.e..)  The support's role has really shifted from a do-all killwhore and FP/SC quick-killer to an actual supportive role. I think this is totally fine."
killingfloor,3d21m3,qqnowqq,2,Mon Jul 13 07:58:09 2015 UTC,"It's a support class, I would be disappointed if it had the best damage.   Support is great for clearing out all the trash. The Boomstick clears a half dozen small zeds in a single shot, and the alt-fire can kill husks and sirens in a single hit if you get most of it in the head. The AA-12, while not as effective as the Scar, is still great on Scrakes and FP's without losing it's ability to clear tons of smaller zeds.   Other classes will likely deal more damage to a single target, but nothing touches it's AoE ability at the moment (which may well change with new Perks). When the group is on the move and you absolutely need to clear the way, nothing beats the AA-12/boomstick combo."

killingfloor,3d21m3,jjb985,2,Mon Jul 13 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"Uh, good question. AA12 is a complete beast right now, but the high fire rate means you rip through ammo way before the wave ends if you use it on trash. Commando can have 2 or 3 machine guns at a time, which they can switch between to destroy every bit of trash you see. Only stops to reload, which gets faster the higher leveled you are.

Everything feels slicker and shinier especially with the dynamic gore system. The rework of the XP system is probably the main reason I bought the game in the first place. I just don't play enough KF1 to get myself any higher than I am in any reasonable amount of time so it's nice to finally be able to pick up KF and feel like I'm actually progressing.

killingfloor,3cxud7,lone0001,2,Sun Jul 12 12:22:47 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize, that's why we're here right? Discussing our opinion on the matters. :)    My biggest gripe about KF1 med darts is how sometimes it will fail to register; you'll hit the person but no name will appear at the bottom, or no cloud puff will appear.  Both of these things indicated that the dart did not hit, even at pointblank. Aside from leveling to a 6 medic, I spent my fair share in norm/hard public games helping to carry newbie teams. Suffice to say, they move. A lot. I will give credit to KF1 med darts for being able to aim them where you want them to go (KF2 darts sometimes lock on to the wrong person/someone closer to me) but in terms of sheer reliability and panic moments, KF2 darts have yet to fail registering for me, except when another teammate runs in front and blocks them.  I will admit I may be bias; I haven't touched KF1 medic in the last several months because I found that they aren't really needed for very experienced teams who sustain very little damage, and know when to shoot and when to heal other teammates (since self-healing is actually frowned upon unless absolutely necessary). Random public games, however, are a different story.  Holy crap I'm defending something from KF2, someone help me."
killingfloor,3cxud7,lone0001,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:35:41 2015 UTC,ugh its terrible when a puff of white smoke appears on your friends ass before they die. maybe they could make it so medic darts only lock on if you turn the mode on in settings or something? or maybe they could make it so that sui/hoe it doesnt lock on. i just found that kf2 took all the fun out of medic for me :/

For one thing, kf2 feels much faster paced, and people move faster, so I'm not sure if non lock on darts would actually be viable.  It would be interesting if the tier 5 skills for medic let you pick between lock on darts vs more effective healing.  I feel like that would keep everyone happy."

I turned off bodycount awhile ago (they just disappear once they're dead), and I can't really say that I miss it, plus you get a negligible performance boost. :D   As for the gun sounds. Hopefully it's something that will eventually be changed (I believe I've read several comments about it already). If not, I'm sure someone will make a sound replacer in the workshop."

killingfloor,3cxud7,qqnowqq,2,Sun Jul 12 01:05:34 2015 UTC,"Things I like better about KF2.  The melee system is much more fun and takes more skill  The game feels much faster paced  The berserker has some nice weapons even if he needs a buff  It's now easier to use the numbers to switch weapons  Enemies aren't bullet sponges on high difficulties  Leveling is less grindy and just overall better  Ways KF1 is still better.  Fleshpounds are too easy to kill in KF2  Fleshpounds only rage in KF1 if you take too long or attack it.  Now they just rage every 10 seconds  Fleshpounds in KF1 were scarier because they moved very akwardly, and they mowed down zeds in their way while raged which was awesome  (Basically the KF1 fleshpound was just better in every way)  I feel like in KF2 scrakes rage too easily, either that or there aren't enough/any stuns yet  In KF2, as you walk forwards, your aim seems to go left and right very slightly, and some guns don't seem to always shoot at the center of the screen.  It's a bit weird.  I wish uppercuts would come back.  I know that they were a glitch, but they were a fun glitch and I think made a nice feature."
killingfloor,3cxud7,TheTroesma,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"the guns shoot where the gun is pointing, which changes and is not always the center of the screen. its a feature that was built into the game on purpose.  i actually find the numbers harder to switch weapons because your main gun is always on 3, no matter how powerful it is. in kf1 the less powerful ones went on 3, then the big fuck-off guns were on 4 - it made it a lot easier to chose what you want in the heat of battle"
killingfloor,3cxud7,RandomSadPerson,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:33:44 2015 UTC,"My problem with the numbers was I would often have multiple guns per number, and in order to use the buttons to switch weapons it would be extremely slow, since you couldn't double tap the keys to get to the second gun down  Edit:  I'm referring to KF1."
killingfloor,3cxud7,EvoEpitaph,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:35:39 2015 UTC,"so why did you say:   It's now easier to use the numbers to switch weapons   i think you should be able to customise it by dragging weapons into a certain slot, and be able to chose the order it comes up in too. would have made the first game a whole lot better and it would make kf2 better too"

killingfloor,3cxud7,ashes1032,6,Thu Jul 16 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"IMO, it doesn't really cater strongly to either the KF1 Hard players or the KF1 HoE players. The game is too hard/random without easy, reliable stuns, encouraging players to cling onto the terrible circling exploit. Also, the game lacks any sort of finesse and variation for higher level players. At the moment, there's only really one clean way to deal with scrakes and fleshpounds each - emp>headshot spam and m2 pulverizer spam, respectively.   The groundwork is all there for stuns, flinches, and other sorts of new statuses that can be applied, but right now it's very hard to convince people of either world to try to enjoy this game. What makes this even worse is that a lot of the cleanest play revolves around a base level of knowledge almost entirely neglected because of the existence of the circling exploit. Almost no one who pubs ever wants to use the emp takedowns because pubs hardly ever follow suit by either making scrakes lunge or just circling them.   This makes it very unappealing to play pub games at all.  tl;dr - It didn't do a good job of pulling in and retaining KF1 players, but it might in the future with firebug or sharpshooter scrake stuns and m32 demo fleshpound kills. (The RPG7 is most probably going to suuuuuuck imo)"
killingfloor,3cxud7,Anonymous_freeloader,3,Sat Jul 11 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"From my very limited anecdotal evidence experience, I'd say that the majority of retained KF2 players are the ones that don't like or haven't played KF1 (because they don't own it, don't think the graphics are good, or what have you).    Anyways, so you're saying that you like the groundwork? Positives, qq, we're looking for the positive. ;)"
killingfloor,3cxud7,JayrassicPark,3,Sat Jul 11 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the framework is all there for something I think a lot of KF1 players will really like and come back to. I really like this. However, in its current state, there's not much to like for people from a very deep background of KF1. There's really not that much in common at the moment besides the zeds and wave-based hoard survival.   Guess I really side-tracked, but uh, what I really like the most about KF2 is that it really emphasizes activity and teamwork. One of my biggest gripes about KF1 is that if someone tried hard enough, people could really just AFK or come help whenever necessary. However, in KF2 if anyone really becomes inactive, you might get overrun. With the current meta, each perk is necessary for the team to do well (besides kiting obviously).  The other thing I really like about KF2 over KF1 is that scrakes and fleshpounds aren't a total joke. A big misconception about KF1 is that scrakes and fleshpounds were the toughest to kill and could really wipe the team. In actuality, there are a multitude of combinations to kill them in pretty much any way you wanted to as long as you understood the rage, flinch, and stun mechanics of both of them. In KF2, they can be very easy to deal with but are always the reason a team wipes. The scrake does so much damage that if you can't kill him quickly, he becomes a powerhouse that can kill the entire team; half-ass a scrake? now you've got a raged scrake let loose on everybody. In KF1, you just had to re-stun them. The answer to raged scrakes in KF2 is to circle them, which is not only being removed but is also impractical to really take full advantage of in game with how fast other zeds run. The fleshpound is very simple to kill in KF2, but he's extremely easy to deal with - lure him to the back and beat him up. The main danger of the fleshpound though isn't the damage though; it's the fact that if you don't draw him far in  enough, he can body block for sirens, husks, and worst of all scrakes. In KF1, raged fleshpounds just needed a half-loaded m32 to kill and save the day.  Lastly, the last major thing I like about KF2 over KF1 is the pacing of the zeds; it's very fast. Makes it hard to go back to KF2 suicidal, let alone KF1. Really hope the zed sprinting speeds and mechanics aren't nerfed in the near future."

It got to the point that after an hour playing I had to stop because I'd get headaches from the eye strain.  Better hitboxes are probably my favorite.  More standardized health/damage from ZED's per difficulty was a huge bonus.  I thought the old way of just 1.x was pretty boring and a cheap challenge.

The only thing I really don't like are his guns because they give me flashbacks to KF1 where the Patty would absolutely melt you with his chaingun. That's a thing I'm not too happy to see back.  Other than that, I actually really like Hans. His voice and personality are spot on and he feels like a boss that you can actually fight, not just run away from constantly like the Patty. Slamming him in the face with a sledgehammer is really satisfying. In KF1, taking a Claymore to the Patty's face would just get you killed instantly."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,LightningBolt101,7,Sat Jul 11 20:57:16 2015 UTC,Honestly I would love a exact copy of the Patriarch back in KF2.
killingfloor,3cxlo6,I_Mean_I_Guess,9,Sat Jul 11 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"What throws people off about Hans is that he's so different from Patty and, because he is unfinished, doesn't indicate state well.  For Patty, you could run up and kill him off before his first heal phase.  It was entirely possible.  If you worked well enough, you could cut the boss battle short with brute force and quick movement.  Makes sense.  With Hans, they've changed it to the point where it is practically impossible (i.e. not impossible but not an advisable strategy) to kill him without going through the whole rigmarole.  As far as indications, I'm not talking about his actions.  He always says certain things before shooting, nading, and healing.  He throws smoke bombs before hunting, and says unique dialog beforehand, so that's quick to learn.  I'm talking about his invisible damage reduction.  Even now, among higher level players, people still shoot the hell out of him while he's in the Hunt/Heal phase, so it's obviously not clear enough.  There need to be better indicators that he is resistant to damage.  The force field should have been within the first update they did, and it's still not here.  People in this thread are talking about ""games have always had bosses with phases and special tactics"".  That's true, but they're almost always telegraphed or indicated directly in some way:  Shoot the giant glowing Fuck-Me light, don't shoot it when it's protected by a magic force field, or the visible health bar is increasing or it changes appearance to show a different phase.  It's not enough to say ""Well it should be obvious that he's invulnerable because why would they leave him as a big open target"".  KF1 players will be thrown off by this because it hasn't been the case, previously.  New KF players (and even old KF1 players) will be thrown off because the general gaming indicators for invulnerability are not present.  Expecting us to approach a boss battle from a game designer perspective is unreasonable.  The iteration time (time it takes to get back to Hans) can make it frustrating to learn these lessons, as well.  Once you figure out how he works (from forum posts, discussions, and the wiki), you can find ways around it.  However, it is unarguable that players are being expected to know things that are never indicated or told.  Having to appeal to out-of-game resources to learn these simple things is not a reasonable expectation.  As they update the game, it's been indicated that these things will be improved.  I like how Hans has been done and how distinctly different he is from the Patriarch.  I look forward to seeing new bosses with their own new styles and requiring their own special tactics."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,richertai,4,Sun Jul 12 06:26:17 2015 UTC,"Honeslty my biggest problem with Hans is his machine guns. Gas and nades are announced and can be avoided but it seems like those things just shred down your health with perfect accuracy and the only way to avoid them is to hide behind corners, wait for him, maybe get a few seconds to shoot him and deal some damage then run away again. Then there's also the problems of his damage reduction and speed increase and stuff you just would not know about if not for reading about it online which is stupid."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,mayonetta,6,Sun Jul 12 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"2 ways,   1)you get one player to parrylock/circle him, boring.   2)you kite for 15 minutes, even more boring.

I never really played KF1 and then a friend decided to buy the 4-pack for us so we could all play as most of us were interested in at least trying the game. The boss is fairly easy to understand, shoot him and stay out of bad stuff, heal your ally who is getting choked by him.  part of the fun for us was learning how to do it properly but it only took us two tries before we got the hang of it, why should the boss have easy mechanics or hand hold you through what to do?"

How are we meant to know that he has a MAJOR damage reduction buff while he drains people and chases them, if not for the wiki? The first reaction of shooting someone while he drains them is to try to help them, but really thats the worst thing you should do. Again more backwards mechanics."

If him going to phase two and regaining health is a ""hard mechanic"" to grasp, that's not the devs fault (sorry bro).  We didn't learn about the damage reduction buff until the third or fourth time killing him when we noticed his health bar goes down slower than normal, and using deductive reasoning we came to this conclusion that he has damage reduction.  here's how you beat the boss in killing floor: Shoot him, don't stand in bad stuff, shoot him some more, kite him around, heal your friends, shoot him more, beat him and shower him in leftover cash. It's really that simple dude."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,Mozzykins,14,Sat Jul 11 19:00:48 2015 UTC,because it makes sense to let him attack you in order to kill him?

killingfloor,3cxlo6,jorgamun,6,Sat Jul 11 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"The mechanics of the Hans reminds me of WoW raid bosses.  That said, it isn't anything overly difficult to get. I do agree that there should be a visual indicator of some kind that shows when Hans takes less or no damage, but the fight itself is easy to learn, difficult to master.  Your healer needs to be on point with his heals, zerker needs to parry correctly, and support needs to save AA12 ammo for the final phase. Everyone should work together to heal the captive team mate.   The Matriarch sounds twice as complicated as Hans, so it won't get easier as they come out with new bosses."

You're trying to ask ""why"" and complaining that it doesn't make sense. This game isn't for you, and in fact, many aren't if you can't suspend disbelief and learn to play by the developers rules.

In order to defeat the boss you have to intentionally get damaged.  2: Grappling a player to steal health should be a desperation move of someone on little remaining hp. Being near invincible 'just because of reasons' shouldnt be a side effect of  that desperation, let alone while he chases you. You should be able to kite him and do normal damage, or do normal damage while he drains, negating his drain.  3: there is zero indication on his model where he is taking reduced damage.  4: You have to read the wiki/steam forums/reddit to actually learn this outside of the 'hard mode get good scrub' of trial and error of the 'fun' way of dying over and over to it till you learn it.  5: you can kite him forever when hes in his damage reduction state, implying that he isnt taking reduced damage. If he were so desperate, he would move faster than the players.  6: the only way to actually see he's taking less damage is by using 1/4 of the classes in the game and having a specific perk on.  enough reasons?"

killingfloor,3cxlo6,FIuffyRabbit,9,Sat Jul 11 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"There is no clear and universal indication that Hans has massive damage resistance while healing. Bullets will still sink in with the same blood-spurting reaction. It's unreasonable to expect everyone to make the jump in logic that intentionally allowing the boss to heal is a better idea than taking advantage of the fact he's standing still.  It only makes sense with knowledge of Hans' mechanics in mind, and those mechanics aren't communicated well through the game itself. If he's going to have damage resistance, he'd better make it clear he's resisting damage and that allowing the heal is directly tied to the fight's progression, or the mechanic ""makes no sense"".  Because it doesn't make any sense that he looks exactly the same, yet reduces incoming damage sixfold. Showing something this simple should be done within the game, not outside of it."

Nothing changes about his character model to signify that hes in a state of damage reduction when hes running other than the colours of him, and even then that doesnt explain anything besides him being on low health, which to me means to stop and shoot him, not kite him for another 5 minutes trying to kill him hopelessly because of the damage reduction that isnt said anywhere but on the wiki."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,justrobo,5,Sat Jul 11 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"I'm legitimately curious what kind of game you usually play. Unique mechanics in boss fights are staples to a number of genres. MMORPGs come to mind in particular, because they usually involve a lot of teamwork, but they're also core to dungeon crawlers, single player RPGs, Hack-and-Slash games, sidescrollers, etc. They're not usually meant to be picked up on the first go-around (though I do agree that a bit more of a visual indicator would be nice for Hans). I do think that KF and KF2 have a lot in common with MMOs and dungeon crawlers if only in the sense that the team has to work together to handle threats, and often times you'll find yourself in a situation where a zerker or medic has to function as the ""tank"" to take aggro from bigger targets. The core gameplay becomes repetitive, and so boss battles serve to break the flow and provide a different, unique kind of challenge that required you to approach the situation from a different angle and think in different ways.  This is where Killing Floor comes in. KF1 had the Patriarch. The Patriarch naturally caused a disruption to gameplay because of his ranged attacks and AoE melee attacks, but he also had a healing mechanic which many players weren't quite sure how to handle. In a way, the Patriarch's healing provided players with an optional risk in pursuing him to use less ammo and save more time, while also giving up any beneficial position they may have been holding. The mechanic was subtle enough that many (particularly newer) players didn't always take advantage of it.  In KF2, it's important to note first and foremost that Hans is not the Patriarch, and it's important that they function differently. The key difference, more so than the types of ranged and melee attacks each has, is Hans' damage reduction and grapple to heal. One could say that Hans' healing mechanism is more classic for a boss because it's almost necessary for players to recognize and play around to beat the boss. It forces players to act a certain way -- quite differently than the way the rest of the game is played -- so that they can achieve success. It requires players not only to understand the boss but to work together when he charges, and to communicate at least on a rudimentary level. His charge is signaled first by his dropping smoke grenades, giving players a brief moment to re-position themselves. Hans will almost always charge the closest player to him, and in a team that works together, that should never be the sole surviving medic. Medics should always heal players being grabbed instead of shooting, and everyone else should stop using ammo on Hans. I agree that he's too bullet spongy in general, but this mechanic itself is perfectly reasonable when you stop looking at KF2 as being a traditional FPS and recognize that it has a lot of its roots elsewhere. I'm not saying that this is the only way Hans could function, or that it's necessarily wrong to change him, but his current functionality is well within the level at which most core gamers could handle him if they work together.  tl;dr KF and KF2 have more in common with RPGs and dungeon crawlers than they do with FPS games, at least regarding bosses and coordination. Thus, bosses should be viewed in terms of multiple genres."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,AsiaDerp,3,Sat Jul 11 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you just want the boss to be a fleshpound with guns and gas. The whole point of boss fights is to adapt or die. There's nothing wrong with how Hans is, you just need to adapt your playstyle to fight him. That's how it is in every game with a boss. In fact the way Hans is coded it's incredibly generic boss mechanics, almost to the point where when I play, he's a joke to fight."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,Ceridith,8,Sat Jul 11 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"Getting hit by a boss on purpose is not ""every game with a boss"", bosses usually means get the hell away from their attacks or you will be majorly hurt, not punishing people for dodging attacks.

All of his attacks are OK themselves but he's a lot of HP and having 3 stages of basically the same pattern is boring (well yes he goes berserk and spawn mobs for next stages but w/e). Not that a boss has to be defeated quickly but when the only way to make him vulnerable to a damage phase is by having a berserk chain stunning him (which feels like cheating really), something's wrong.   His dual rifles are fun killers. I wish he could not moved and just punish anyone who's in his LoS after few secs of prepping rather than an aimbot godmode run for your life for damn long.  Here's my suggestion, take it with a grain of salt : he could have 3times the current maxHP he has and trigger his dash+regen at the two thirds mark and one third mark of his life and you could deny it with enough focusfiring on legs.

His damage scales way too much with groups, which makes him aimbot accuracy too damn powerful for last man standing scenarios.  Sure, he's still killable as the last man standing, but the way to do it is way too gamey. On more than one occasion I've spent about 15 minutes abusing his shitty pathing while taking pot shots at him to kill him of, while having to intentionally throw myself at him to get through the heal phases because of his damage reduction. That's actually the only way to kill him in those situations, to abuse the game mechanics. It's fun for the first 5 or so minutes, but it just drags on way too long. Not to mention I felt bad for having to make everyone else on my team wait, even though I did finally kill him. Honestly at that point it's better for everyone just to take a dive, and that's not how the game should be in my opinion.  If players want to be able to kill him, or the other bosses, with sheer brute force like in KF1, we should be able to. That's what made KF1 fun."

killingfloor,3cxlo6,SEALSniper07,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:11:29 2015 UTC,"I somewhat agree with you, my main gripe is that it's always the same boss.   IDK if there are any plans to implement something like this but I think each boss should have it's own unique boss.  I know it would be a pain but for me the current boss just seems to bland. he was kind of cool the first and second time I fought him but now he's kinda boring"
killingfloor,3cxlo6,qqnowqq,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:07:19 2015 UTC,"To kill Hans, generally everyone in the team has to pull their weight.   I don't like his healing phase, only slows down the fight, I also don't like that he can shoot through several 3m thick walls, but if he has to due to balancing, atleast make the bullets deal less damage.   I really do like that Hans can do everything, he can fuck you up in melee, he can outrun you, he can throw grenades and acid bombs, and he dual wields two AK47(?)."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,SEALSniper07,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"Hans is OK, bit I'd really love to see something like a custom themed boss for each level. Might be asking for too much, but the game can get repetitive at times. More monster types could fix this. It's why I only play on custom servers. They have ""regular"" enemy variants, like gorefasts that are tinted yellow and run at 3x the normal speed. They are called goreallyfasts. Vanilla needs more stuff like that"
killingfloor,3cxlo6,qqnowqq,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:02:07 2015 UTC,"I think you have the wrong team comp, try 3 lvl 20 supports with the AA 12 shotgun and he will go down super easy. You can add a healer or what ever you like. I always switch from my main perk Commando to support for the boss, would never use any other perk for him."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,SEALSniper07,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:26:45 2015 UTC,"Tbh I don't think he should have the damage reduction while going from one stage to the next. At least not as drastic of one as he does now, you should be able to wipe the floor with him without him healing. Him stealing health should be team decision where you let him do it because the he no longer has that damage reduction buff (making it slightly easier) or a reason to kill him in one go so that the fight isn't prolonged."
killingfloor,3cxlo6,qqnowqq,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:15:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's really what is turning me off from the game right now because you basically need a premade team with voice chat to get through the last few waves and the boss in a HoE game. Hans right now simply cannot be soloed in a timely or reliable manner. Did your team just wipe from the boss? Whelp, looks like you're going to be kiting for the next 15-20 minutes shooting at him when you can and looking for ammo.    This in comparison to KF1, where you actually have a chance to kill the boss as soon as he spawns, and can also kill him without taking any damage.  We only have Early Access to blame right now.  They purposely made it this difficult, and while doable, it's just not that fun."

Fucking sweet. And super happy about the passive immunity to clot grabs. Berserker sounds like it's going to be so much more fun, especially if the parry detection gets sorted out."
killingfloor,3ctmrl,Centias,7,Sat Jul 11 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"Summary:   Alas poor Berserker! I knew him, community, a perk of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. Or one might say “Out with the old, in with the new!”. It is no secret we’ve been redesigning the perk tree for the Berserker. I am pleased to announce we are now testing those new designs in game. Now keep in mind, what you are about to see is still subject to change before the content update as we will be playtesting and iterating on the design. That is why final numbers are not included here as they are very much a work in progress, and the skills themselves could go through changes.   Berserkers who have reached the first skill tier (level 5) will now have their pick of resistances. X% Sonic or X% poison resistance. Which do you feel is the greatest threat to your playstyle, Bloats or Sirens? After you’ve made your choice, fear not your hated foe!  At the next skill tier (level 10), the choice comes down to additional max health or to regain health everytime you make a kill. Is it time to wade into that clot horde or go toe to toe with the large zed menaces?  At the halfway point (level 15) you must decide if you want to be a “striker” with fast hits or being one who takes a blow to dish it back out harder in return. This means your choice is between faster attacks overall and harder hitting hard attacks or a large boost to your damage after blocking an attack.   Have you mastered the parry or do you just feel you need to hit harder so you don’t need to? At this tier (level 20) your options are between having a successful parry increase your attack speed for a time or having heavy strikes do more damage and increased knockdown potential.  So when you’ve made it to the end and Zeds fall before you if you so much think of stepping their direction with a swing of your favorite weapon. The final tier (level 25) skills are your Zed time skills. So which option will you pick? The first option will grant you (in zed time) increased attack speed, successful parries will cause enemies to be knocked down (instead of a stumble back) as well as the ability to move in real time. The second option will grant an increased stun power on head hits, increased stumble power overall and the ability to move in real time as well.   Overall we feel zerker lovers will have much to be happy about as we finalize the new skill tree. As mentioned previously we are still working on the final numbers and percentages for the initial rollout of this new tree and we will likely be making tweaks up until the release.  It was pointed out we forgot to mention the changes to the passives. These now (ALL SUBJECT TO CHANGE) include the following:  Increased Berserker Weapon Damage  Increased Melee Attack Speed  Increased Movement Speed  Increased Damaged Resistance  Not being able to be grabbed by clots  Night vision (this will be a toggle if you have a weapon with a flashlight so you can have both)"
killingfloor,3ctmrl,squidthesid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:05:09 2015 UTC,I've gone ahead and added that.
killingfloor,3ctmrl,squidthesid,2,Fri Jul 10 22:43:59 2015 UTC,"I hope that zerks losing that stupid night vision perk means the rest of the classes will too. NV sucks, I'd much rather use a flashlight in the dark. It's way more atmospheric. But for that you need to balance all classes with flashlights, it's really stupid that only some classes have flashlights on their higher tier guns."
killingfloor,3ctmrl,TempestWrath,4,Fri Jul 10 22:46:27 2015 UTC,I thought everyone decided that the max health is a no brainer over health regen? Sad to see it's going to be one of the berserk skills too =/
killingfloor,3ctmrl,ayutzia,16,Sat Jul 11 07:22:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the values are. If the health gain on a kill is substantial, then it can be quite useful. If it's anything like the current values for HP regen perks, then max HP is the way to go."

killingfloor,3ctmrl,SEALSniper07,5,Fri Jul 10 18:07:21 2015 UTC,I'm up for it. Increased attack speed plus health regen on every kill.
killingfloor,3ctmrl,Jmcglosson,6,Fri Jul 10 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"The regen looks like it will be more useful during the earlier tiers when it's just a ton of clots, while the max health will be more useful when you're facing say.... 3 skrakes at once."
killingfloor,3ctmrl,Tyrfaust,2,Fri Jul 10 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"it may also depend on if the value of the health given back is static or if it scales with the HP of the monster you killed ""kinda like a lifesteal"" - i could see the scaling system be a bit better solution as otherwise everyone will probably pick up the increased health (as scrakes and FPs are more dangerous than trash generally)"
killingfloor,3ctmrl,Sneemil,3,Fri Jul 10 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really care about the Berserkers perks so much as I care about the fact that movement is tied to the orientation of your weapons swing for no other reason than that one of the devs can't achieve an erection without knowing that someone, somewhere is slicing vertically at a group of clots while being forced to walk backwards.  Left click = Horizontal Swing  Right click = Vertical Swing  Holding down the button or using a modifying key causes a heavy attack.  Almost every fucking melee game has figured this out. Why are you reinventing the wheel by replacing it with a fucking tetrahedron."

Using the SMG can sometimes stun enemies or take off enemies' heads with careful ammo usage. Reasoning for AA-12: It becomes pretty mandatory for taking down Fleshpounds and Scrakes.

killingfloor,3cuop1,Landriff,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:07 2015 UTC,"AR, shotgun, pistol. You can either save up on pistol-only or picked-up weapons and go straight for the AR first, or buy the shotgun earlier and save up again for the AR. A lot of people seem to think they should go medic and not heal anybody, and focus on damage instead,  or use other classes' weapons. This is wrong. So I'm going to assume you're not planning on doing it wrong. The AR can fire four healing darts on one charge, the shotgun three (I think?) and the pistol two. With this loadout you can effectively constantly fire 2 darts a second making for full-time healing duty, plus small bursts when it's really needed.

killingfloor,3cs5t4,Landriff,6,Fri Jul 10 14:28:25 2015 UTC,"Modify XP rewards so kills on enemies give reduced amounts and completing objectives gives a nice boost. You could decrease the XP rewards from enemies over time so there would be incentive to complete the objectives faster. After X minutes on an objective, the reward might fall to 10% of normal XP."
killingfloor,3cs5t4,skivian,3,Fri Jul 10 16:58:02 2015 UTC,I think the easiest solution would be that the zeds gradually get harder until it's just scrake city.  good luck farming that.
killingfloor,3cs5t4,fattyhead,3,Sat Jul 11 00:55:23 2015 UTC,Its weird people keep pointing out how these suggestions lead to easier xp but the players could very well just go into a leveling map and get xp even faster...

killingfloor,3cs5t4,skivian,2,Sat Jul 11 00:54:38 2015 UTC,until you run out of ammo and die.
killingfloor,3cs5t4,jjb985,3,Sat Jul 11 00:55:57 2015 UTC,Even then either confine the mode or just reset abs kill another 500 enemies. Just saying you would need an anti camp feature of dome sort
killingfloor,3cs5t4,skivian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:00:08 2015 UTC,"how is that, realistically, any different than playing survival, really? if the monsters are coming at approx the same rate, then it's pretty much the same XP/Hour, without the minute breaks every now and then. except now you have to hunt for ammo."
killingfloor,3cs5t4,Landriff,5,Sat Jul 11 10:52:30 2015 UTC,"Mmmm. This sounds pretty cool. An ""infinite zeds until objective is complete"" mode would be great, for sure, but I'd like something more map-dependent that designers could implement for each map. The Objective mode from KF1 was kind of neat, but I think your idea is more replayable and would help utilize the full map more. One thing I didn't like about Objective mode is how linear the maps seemed. It felt rather unlike KF and seemed like the maps wouldn't play as well in Survival mode.  As for map-specific objectives, for example you could even implement something like this in Biotics Lab:    The lab's production has gone into overdrive! Shut down the various parts of the facility before you're overwhelmed by Zeds.   Every round you'd have a couple of different objectives to complete. There might be one per room or maybe even more than one for certain rooms. It would randomize every time you played, so every round would be different and send you to different parts of the map. Some of the objectives might repeat, but others might have once-per-game limitations.  Example objectives could be:   ""Shut down the mixers in processing""  ""Kill 100 clots coming from the cloning vat on the cloning rails"" ""Defend the security room computer system while a virus is uploaded"".  ""Prevent the DNA storage from overheating"" could give you an indicator that would increase any time you used explosives or fire in the room, and any time Husks shot at the central core.    You could also add in some less map-specific objectives like: ""A huge wave of <zed-type> spawned! Kill <amount> of them."" Suddenly you might have a wave of 100 stalkers, 150 gorefasts, 40 sirens, or 15 Scrakes in addition to a trickle of other enemies.   This way you could build a map that would play really well for standard Survival mode's general layouts but also had an objective mode. You could definitely do a supply-run style map in a larger environment like Wyre was in KF1, but I don't see a reason to limit it to a specific objective type, because it would limit the kinds of maps you could design for it."
killingfloor,3cs5t4,Landriff,3,Fri Jul 10 16:55:12 2015 UTC,"I like your idea, and although the thing i liked the most about the ""supply run"" missions is that one of players has to carry the pack in order to avoid players sprinting through the maps, it could be easily implemented in your scenario just by changing the pack into a hacking terminal or demo charge that has to be deployed into the generators."
killingfloor,3cs5t4,Landriff,3,Fri Jul 10 17:06:45 2015 UTC,I'm not sure anyone is going to want to stand and hack a terminal or plant a demo charge. I'm thinking you just periodically have them hit E on it (sort of like Payday Drill restarting if you've ever played Payday).  But I think you also underestimate how badly Zeds can swarm you when you move around a lot as a group. :) Sprinting isn't always the life-saver you think it is.
killingfloor,3cs5t4,jjb985,5,Fri Jul 10 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"It should be pretty easy  for Tripwire to implement a new gametype that requires the players to pick up Supply Boxes that spawn randomly throughout the map where Ammo and Equipment normally spawns. They could probably implement this within a week and test it within two to three. I wouldn't expect it to be perfect in that short of a time, but they could at least get a playable prototype out.  Higher difficulties could require you to pick up more supply boxes. They could also tweak the spawning logic over several updates so it guarantees the boxes spawn farther away at higher difficulties."
killingfloor,3cs5t4,richertai,3,Fri Jul 10 17:07:36 2015 UTC,They sound take some notes from the mini objectives in the lfd series.  Go to point x to open door y etc and keep the players moving around to keep from camping.

killingfloor,3ctwpm,MetalDaddy,3,Fri Jul 10 19:11:37 2015 UTC,"Image 2  /u/TW_Shuu answered most of these.   For the lighting volume, make your Brush bigger than your map and click the ""Add Volume"" button under ""Volumes"" in the left toolbar. Add either a TWIndoorLightingVolume or TWOutdoorLightingVolume. You can look at BioticsLab for a quick example of how that's set up. Basically there are two main lighting channels - Indoor and Outdoor - and you can use the volumes to help separate things.  For error 2, you just have to build the Production lighting quality to get rid of this - but there's no point in doing that at such an early stage of your map.  For error 3, you don't have a pathing node close enough to one of the Zed spawn points. I wouldn't worry about pathing until your basic layout is finished.  Image 3  Basically this means your map or one of your assets isn't in the main KF folder. It's an annoying error you can basically just ignore while you're working on the map. Before you try to play it in-game you'll need to copy your map to the Maps folder. The ""external package"" error will occur even if you're not using any custom assets because the shadowmaps and splattermaps the game builds get saved to your map file, which is probably not in the Maps folder. Even if you think you're saving under BrewedPC\Maps, your map actually gets saved to C:\Users<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Unpublished\BrewedPC\Maps  If you try opening the map from this location, you'll get the build error.  Image 4  The lighting volume can fix this, but also add a Skylight to your map. Open one of the existing maps that most closely resembles yours. Do Edit -> Find Actors and search for ""Sky"". Double-click the entry to select it, and copy it, then paste it in your map. This adds an ambient light to your map so everything is lit. You'll want this to be pretty dark for your final map, but while you're working on it you can set it to a dim light color so you don't have to place tons of working lights.  Image 5  I save my map in E:\Levels\ but I don't have the problems you're talking about. Are you using custom textures? You'll need to save those textures to a package or inside your level. If you save them in a package, open the package before opening your level. Don't save anything in the official packages.  Don't use any BSP/CSG (""blocks""). Only use static meshes. The only thing you'll use the Brush for is creating volumes."

I may have done something else incorrectly to cause this, just be aware, if when you're playing shadows are casting through walls, it's probably the sky light."

The easiest way I have found to do this is to just make a large volume that encases the entire map. Then add volume>indoor lighting volume. I also make another one with volume>precomputed visibility volume just to be safe, and everything always seems to work out.  That should fix your lighting problem.

Make each tier either have only team-oriented or selfish skills, e.g. Level 5 you pick from 2 selfish skills and Level 10 you pick from two team-oriented ones. Give us two choices between two skills per tier, 2 selfish (pick one) and 2 team-oriented (pick one). Give us only team-oriented or selfish skills to pick between, and give us the other kind passively.   Selfish skills don't really make a lot of sense to me in a cooperative game like this...

Selfish skills are okay - after all, killing zeds is a good way to help the team - but making that a choice not simply dictated by player count is a tricky proposition."
killingfloor,3cq42f,Landriff,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"The other one that gets me is having to coordinate multiple people using some of these skills. Having to figure out or coordinate which Commando uses Call Out is a bit annoying, and there's no reason to stack it.  Also, would people use the Berserker low-health bonus perks when you have a good medic on your team? It's all a bit weird to me.  Choosing between selfish perks with team-oriented passives would be nice too. Then all commandos would have Call Out and all Support would have Supplier."
killingfloor,3cq42f,Centias,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"If my understanding of it is correct (that Call Out spots stalkers in range of the Commando for everyone, rather than within a matching range for each player individually), it's not technically true that there's no reason to have two players with Call Out, it's just that it provides no additional benefit when they sit next to each other. If the Commandos spread out a bit, the total area covered for Call Out expands to cover two large circle areas around each Commando. But this probably only matters in lower difficulty levels where you can spread out a little more.    Berserker's health based perks need to provide a passive bonus at max health if they don't already. Maybe with reduced effectiveness at full health, (5-10% vs 15%), but better than nothing."
killingfloor,3cq42f,Anolis_Gaming,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:02:51 2015 UTC,This is especially true for lower level commandos.  There's no reason not to have 2 level 5-10 commandos with callout on either end of the group.
killingfloor,3cq42f,v4lor,2,Fri Jul 10 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Selfish skills don't really make a lot of sense to me in a cooperative game like this...   What if it went that way, though, as a way of customizing each class to your specific strengths and weaknesses as a player? At the same time, you get Passives that are automatic and aimed at the team.  Just a hypothetical: Commando Tier 1. Currently, you have the selfish NV perk, and the team-oriented Call Out.   I would propose something like this (again, this is just hypothetical): Tier 1 Commando gets to choose between, say, Night Vision or seeing the health bars. You as the player get to pick whichever you feel helps you perform the best. Simultaneously, unlocking that Tier gives a Passive Call Out ala Killing Floor 1. It's always on, provides a benefit to the team regardless of your Perk choice, and still lets you customize your own playstyle."
killingfloor,3cq42f,Landriff,2,Thu Jul 9 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's kind of like my #4 alternative. I don't mind being able to customize my character to my play style, but having team-oriented perk and selfish perk options on the same tier basically takes the choice away from the player - someone like myself will always pick the team-oriented one, and selfish jerks (:p) will pick the other one.  And I don't really see anything wrong with selfish upgrades in general, KF1 had a lot of cool ones that just happened passively."

killingfloor,3cq42f,Centias,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Really there are a lot of self-oriented passive skills that, particularly as a KF1 player, feel like they are mandatory to the identity of the perk and how they function. Larger Mags for Commando, extra weight capacity for Support, unable to be grabbed by clots as Berserker. Medic probably makes most sense to get Combatant for free armor at spawn and cheaper armor upkeep. Most of the other self-oriented perks hardly even matter except for some of the damage ones, and those probably only exist for lack of better ideas (Commando damage boost based on rate of fire is still completely illogical, night vision should be a purchasable item, starting ammo for berserker and medic is a freaking joke)."

killingfloor,3cq42f,Landriff,5,Fri Jul 10 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"My main takeaway based on this thread, it seems like a lot of people feel that the KF1-passives-which-became-KF2-skills are mandatory such as Berserker not being grabbed by clots, Commando mag upgrade, Support carry capacity, etc.   General response seems to be ""grant these passively at certain tiers in addition to the choices"".  Thanks for listening. :)  EDIT: Wanted to add - in my mind, having passive skills unlocking per tier (in addition to the flat % bonuses) would make each tier seem way more interesting.  But more importantly, I think the passives-per-tier model would work great if it followed this design goal: Passives per tier should help differentiate BETWEEN the different perks, and the choices should help differentiate WITHIN a single perk."
killingfloor,3cq42f,Landriff,7,Fri Jul 10 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with Combatant (Medic). It doesn't make sense to pick anything other than medic for the first round of a game when it's unlocked, for two reasons:   Free Body Armor and cheap refill of body armor at the end of the wave before switching perks. Medic Pistol. It takes up the least carrying capacity, is most useful to other classes, and never spawns in the world. This means you have something that's both useful for a while (or forever) and won't prevent you from picking up extra weapons to sell like the other starting weapons might. It's also more than enough firepower to take out the first wave of enemies, so you'll never regret it."

Damage based on fire mode for Commando (doesn't make sense, weapons should just be balanced without them, they offer no interesting choice) Flat damage boost skills (like Tenacity) don't make interesting choices. Ammo for Support should be removed and each weapon should just have an extra 20-25% more ammo.    Skills that should be improved:     Berserker skills based on health should have some (possibly smaller) passive benefit at max health Supplier should have an indicator that you can still get ammo from that Support player Lacerate should probably do more bleed damage   Other changes/ideas:     With NVG and Bulk Ammo removed from Berserker, move Furious Defender and Formidable to the first tier, so early Berserker gets some extra survival With NVG Removed from Commando, give a new skill like Call Out that shows health bars for other players Commando needs more team-oriented skills Support could probably do with a couple of welding-oriented skills (faster welding, or repair door health even when broken) Move Medic's Regeneration next to healing surge Medic could probably use a perk for more max ammo, larger mags, or a lingering heal over time effect on a skill next to Lacerate"
killingfloor,3cq42f,Anolis_Gaming,2,Fri Jul 10 15:01:25 2015 UTC,I like the idea of NVG replaced with a health bar call out. That way if you have 2 commandos they can each take a different team skill

If the extra damage is necessary, it should just be there without selecting a skill for it. If it isn't, then we aren't really missing out on anything. They really don't create interesting skill choices, rather they just make you feel locked into a fire mode or a set of weapons to fit which one you choose.

killingfloor,3cq42f,Kvasir94,3,Thu Jul 9 22:01:51 2015 UTC,All level 25 skills do not need to be reworked. A large number of them are pretty excellent already. Before you say zed time is random read some of the writeups on the chance of it being triggered. It happens pretty dang often and all skills are retriggered for every extension (including all the extra ones commando gives you)
killingfloor,3cq42f,Retrikaethan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"i understand how they work i understand that they can be used and abused, problem is they're unreliable because people are random and people are what ultimately trigger zed time. if you don't have a competent commando you can end up with absolutely no zed time to use and abuse at all, rendering the level 25 perks completely useless in such a situation. hence, the rework need. something more reliable would be to apply the buffs for a period of time longer than the zed time lasts, applied each time zed time is procced stacking additively with itself so, say zed time lasts 3 seconds, make the buff last 10, 6 zed extensions and boom, a full 60 seconds of buff. reliable, practical, and probably a bit over powered. which it should be. cuz, yaknow, level 25 perk. of course i have no idea how long zed time lasts and i doubt 10 seconds per proc would be appropriate but the idea itself would work well in/with combat. boom. instant improvement idea that probably wouldn't be too hard to implement."
killingfloor,3cq42f,Kvasir94,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:28:13 2015 UTC,"I like your idea but I would say you get your usual zed time buffs, then a set duration afterwards a slightly weaker buff ""sticks"" for say 10 seconds instead of your 60. It would be a different effect than the actual zed time buff (for perks like supports armor increase it wouldn't make sense to use the same buff because it's a skill that triggers passively and instantly) or a weaker version. Zed time happens very often so applying that 60 second buff would leave you always buffed if it lasted that long. I think just a little extra bit of a buff on the end in normal time would make people happier."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Nightmarelia,48,Thu Jul 9 14:47:55 2015 UTC,"Pulv and Nailgun.  Melee or single shot most mobs, use single nails to keep Bloat/Siren/Husk Stumble locked while you close in then switch to the shotgun mode and head shot them once or go Pulv and right click. Dont forget that aiming down the sight helps reduce recoil, so when shotgun nailing them in the head momentarily ADS. This is an extremely effective way to use the Nailgun (switching firing modes often) and most people don't do it. Make sure to aim lower versus higher with nail gun shotgun headshots, especially on EMP'd Scrakes (more on this below). Better to hit 4 headshots and 3 body shots in a spread than hit 4 headshots and have the rest of the spread go over his head.  Rebind middle mouse to an extra mouse button or a key, it's way better for parrying and switching modes. Mine is on one of my special extra mouse buttons on the side.  Keep in mind certain mobs can not be Stumbled if they are initiating an attack (Husk cannon, Siren scream etc) so just wait until they're just about finished to start throwing nails if you're closing distance with Stumbles. Sirens also seem to be able to break out of their own Stumbles by attacking even if they are Stumbled currently. Cat_is_fine made a bug report post about this.  Don't parry small mobs unless it's a hit you can't avoid that will kill you. All trash mobs Stumble from a single melee anyways.  Use your nailgun like it's a puzzle you're completing, trying to hit as many things as possible with lethal damage with as little ammo as possible. Always shoot single nails through multiple crawlers unless theyre spread out a bit. This is a good tip for support too. Make sure you use your mobility to line up multi head shots and the like, and never waste nail gun 7 shot spreads by shooting them from too far away.   Nail gun spreads can, however, help if a teammate is surrounded. Spam as many spreads as it takes their way and ADS if you can afford to, this will hit the crowd and stumble all of the trash giving everyone longer time to react and escape.  When SCs come call them out and when your team is ready throw an emp at the SC, switch to Nailgun and stand just outside it's melee aggro range (if he swings at you you're too close and it makes it harder to head shot him. DO NOT emp and try to pulv stumble him immediately. Pointless.) and unload a mag into his head in shotgun mode, switch back to Pulv when the emp is fading and as soon as it fades if he's not dead move in and right click him to keep him from charging your team.   STUMBLES BREAK EARLY IF THE ZED TAKES ANY DAMAGE so be very aware of this when you're engaging him with your team. You often will not have time to parry again unless you strafe around him or back up just a bit. When his stumble breaks early the cooldown doesnt end for another 2 seconds or so meaning only parries will stumble him again (not melee or any guns) until the rest of the 3 sec cooldown finishes. Don't stay in front of him when teammates are engaging unless you know you can keep him stumbled/parried somehow. He also likes to do the ""gut buster"" attack where he just shoves his chainsaw straight out if you're very close and in front of him, and it bloody hurts. The gut buster has no real signal it's coming but can be parried at any point in the attack if you catch it fast enough before you're dead. Just be on the lookout for it and try not to stay right up against him with him facing you. The uppercut with his off-hand is another one that hits with little warning when too close.  Your teammates shooting will break his stumbling in about 1 - 1.5 seconds instead of 3 - 4 so be ready. This also means as the last one alive (nobody to break the stumble early) you should take your time and let the animation finish before hitting him again and he will instantly stumble again. Just make sure there's no other zeds around to biff it up.  EMPs the best way to kill SC right now it just requires your team to actually have game sense and focus the emp SC. If done right they go down before the emp ends. SCs resist 50% of the Pulv explosion damage so only resort to that when you need to Stumble and contain him! I repeat: PULVERIZER IS NOT A GOOD SOURCE OF PRIMARY DAMAGE ON SCRAKES. The only time you should be solo Pulverizing a Scrake from the start is if you're out of EMPs or living teammates. Scrakes can only be stumbled every 3 seconds, but always stumble on a parry. Never run straight away from them when raged unless you're level 15+ med or zerk. Instead, always try to dodge around their right or left (his left is usually best because his chainsaw is on the opposite hand meaning a wider swing) just before they lunge and they'll miss.  For FP I pretty much wail on them if we have a medic. Usually hit them 2+ times with Pulv as they start to rage, then parry once and repeat. FP attack are almost all timed the same for parries. Their jump attack that is triggered by you being just out of range hits at 3 points in the attack and is unparryable.  Always start to parry and then jump in the air just after to avoid the complete attack. Make sure you hold block until he's done! He almost always follows up with another melee thats fast and hard to parry after you recover from the block so I usually just continue blocking until that last attack is done. Standing right next to him while engaging makes him not use this attack, and all the attacks he does use are timed about the same and predictable, so if you can safely be right up against it go for it.  Another tip for Nailgun use: turn on your crosshair. You might get some flak for being a ""scrub"" but the crosshair can potentially benefit the Nailgun a lot considering it isn't hitscan and is harder to aim. It also doesn't show up when using melee weapons, only nailgun/eviscerator which is nice.  One more good thing to remember is that Gorefast's stumble cool down timer is longer than it takes them to recover and attack again. If you hit them once and don't kill them make sure to back away for just a second or finish him off before the stumble is over to avoid being chipped by him, because he won't stumble again quite yet. Also, remember that Gorefasts sprint at you when within range or when damaged whatsoever, so just keep that in mind.  Be aware of when you can't outrun certain zeds and make sure to keep checking if any are trailing too close as you kite (if you have to kite). Listen for the Gorefast metal scrape ""shing"" sound. It seems like it almost always is a cue that they're about to attack someone and it's a great way to hear them sneaking up.  Oh yeah, and for early waves, always hit bloats in the head with the crovel primary attack (slashing damage bloats are weak to) and hit crawlers with the secondary attack (bludgeon damage they're weak to). Both can OHK on any difficulty.   Here is the spreadsheet of stumble values and tons of other useful info: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GDpg2mN1l_86U_RaDug0glFx8cZCuErwxZLiBKl9SyY/htmlview# Simply compare your weapon's stumble power to the zed's stumble resist. If power > resist then he stumbles."

killingfloor,3cojs8,SEALSniper07,12,Thu Jul 9 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"The berseker is an extremely strong and needed perk in the current meta. We actually run 3 berserkers for our long hoe games. Other 3 spots are 2 commandos and 1 medic.  Anyway, pulv with MedAR is the best loadout hands down. Can easily handle trash with pulv or medAR depending on the situation; medAR adds great damage for killing scrakes; medAR stumbles all mid-tier and lower zeds, including bloats, husks, and sirens; medAR can heal in extreme emergencies; and the pulv is both good for killing fleshpounds quickly and emergency m2 crowd control. Other great loadouts include having the bullpup, ak, scar, aa12, or even the varmint for better team eco.  Playing berserker with mostly m1 pulv is a bad thing; you require too much healing. You have a lot of tankiness but you have to earn your damage resistances and pick your spots carefully. The right way to play berserker right now is to use him as a gunzerker. Also, nading scrakes, staying out of their attack range, and spamming headshots with a rifle is fundamental. It's almost entirely unimportant to parry or stumble scrakes, so please don't rely on them primarily. Also, if you use the AA12, zerks can entirely solo scrakes effortlessly.   When not soloing scrakes, your zed-killing priority is as follows: sirens>trash in front of scrakes or near commandos>scrake headshots. This is to ensure that your emp nade doesn't get blown up and that commandos can easily and efficiently land as many headshots as they can. It's also important to land headshots to kill them faster as well, but a decent commando can solo a scrake all by himself with just your emp nade.  The berserker excels at raking in early dosh since he can easily kill anything up to wave 4 or 5 with just his shovel, so you should consider donating money to your commandos or medic so they can get their end-game loadouts faster. You don't need a pulverizer anyway until fleshpound waves. In early waves when you might just have a shovel, it's okay to use emp nades on husks so you can approach them without fear of dying by their flamethrowers. However, scrake waves and onward, make sure to solely use your grenades on scrakes. You should at least have a bullpup or varmint at this point for trash.  When taking on fleshpounds, try to rage them early on so they can get into the center of your hold. This way you can mash m2 on fleshpounds while the medic keeps you healthy. This also lets commandos and supports get past the fleshpound in the center and deal with trash and scrakes again normally.  The other berserker weapons - the eviscerator and the nailgun are not optimal in  the current meta. True, the nailgun is quite strong and can stumble most zeds, but there are better options for damage and stumbling, namely the medAR or even the scar. The buzzsawbow/eviscerator is nearly worthless atm. It can rip through a bunch of trash, but this really is just half your job. You still need to kill fleshpounds quickly. As of now, there are only two things that can deal extra damage to fleshpounds - grenades and pulverizer m2; anything else deals 50% damage. By using the eviscerator you arguably get better at dealing with trash with the cost of not being able to kill fleshpounds quickly anymore.   For Hans, you excel at both circling and parrying him so the team doesn't have to worry as much about random guns and grenades, leading to very easy wins.  tl;dr - don't play this like KF1 zerk with braindead m1, lel."

The med rifle is a great tool to have in general for all the reasons you listed, especially on HoE when getting close with nails isn't optimal. It grants a lot of extra utility and head shot dps"
killingfloor,3cojs8,Kvasir94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"Zerk is strong and needed, but not because their close combat ability or damage out put or tankyness.... its only because they have a nade called EMP and happens to have a perked weapon that does explosive damage. Which is pretty stupid setting if you ask me.  You know how happy I see people who really know how to zerk right now? We can assume all the stupid scenarios in our mind or go to the test map to show people how ""easy"" it is to deal with stuff in melee, but right now, in a real game, Gunzerk is the way to go on HOE. Melee zerk just doesnt work (able to win a game doesnt mean its effective, I beat solo HOE with no trader, but I wont say T1 weapons are good). Main reasons being:  1)you are not tanky enough, you need healing non-stop, if the medic takes 3 seconds to heal players on the other side, a single sneaky crawler can combo your back for 30+ damage. You could die in seconds by trash without armor because you keep losing it  for going in melee range.  2)you are blocking bullets, and unlike KF1, you dont kill trash fast enough because zeds are faster now. With slow zed in KF1 and your swing speed, you can block one side no problem but in KF2, you cant kill trash fast enough with melee. And now you need to hit their heads, or else even a gorefast takes 3+ seconds to kill. Now add in the fact that their head hit box is not at the same level for different zeds, all the fancy jumping attacks and the stumble animation cause by you hitting them.   3)like I said above, you are drawing most, if not all attention from the medic. The medic could be shooting with you and nobody take damage at all, but instead you are baiting siren scream, husk flame and bloat charge. Now everything is harder to hit (because they charge, or stumble by you) and you shut down the possibility to nade.  Husk itself is stupidly dangerous for anyone who try to melee him, you miss one head shot you are dead. Unless you are using some kind of glitchy spot like the manor hallways blocking just ahead of the spawn, the reward is totally not worth the risk. And if you just want to body block, why zerk? You only have 100/100 which is garbage compare to other 3 perks. You die quicker than the medic dart hits you even if you are just missing one single parry.   I hope more people actually think more about effectiveness instead of going ""zerk is love, zerk is life"" and assume everything is fine. And TBH I dont think the zerk rework will change this ""EMP and only pulv FPs"" meta at all because its simply too effective against the currently imbalanced zeds. Unless, they give us a real method to deal with scrakes, like a stun.  Dont believe what I am saying? Search ""killing floor 2"" ""HOE"" and ""bereserker"" on google or youtube, you will either see someone theroy-crafting or see the background of a test map. Other videos you see people are either glitching or kiting for 15 minutes."

killingfloor,3cojs8,Kvasir94,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:34:42 2015 UTC,That's what I use. I never had a lot of luck with the saw blade. I love that you can run and gather up the ammo again but the Pulv is great and the nailgun is fun for shooting around corners or if you're below a ramp you can shoot up at the ceiling and they ricochet down to get 'em.
killingfloor,3cojs8,Moeparker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"Until the eviscerator gets some kind of accuracy improvement, and the blades stop landing in unreachable locations, I wouldn't recommend using it much. Besides, Pulverizer is one of the best options for dealing with a FP right now. But since everything else is basically being covered already, here are some things worth knowing in case you do want to play around with it:   Try to save shots for bloats, sirens, and husks. Direct hits and possibly shots that pass through one or two clots first can instantly kill these normally annoying zeds, even without aiming for the head. Anything smaller can be easily mopped up by using the alt fire and shoving it in their faces. Use V (bash) when enemies are light. It doesn't use gas, but it does ~90 damage and can easily kill any of the lighter enemies with one or two hits. This helps quite a bit in saving gas, as running the alt fire uses a bare minimum of ~4 gas every time you hit it. Any ammo box or resupply from a support will always give you 150 gas. This will save you tons of Dosh, which you can then throw at your teammates. Firing blades (primary fire) can be a nice way to briefly stumble a scrake, but it doesn't seem to work after they rage and scrakes take reduced damage from slashing, which is all the eviscerator does. You can fire leftover blades into the ground/walls at the end of a wave, so that you have some extras sitting around during the next wave. Just be aware that even with full ammo, you will still pick up blades you walk over. Blades stick around for 3 minutes."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Centias,2,Thu Jul 9 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"Scrakes gain +10 Stumble resist when raged (aka low hp) which is enough to push it out of the Stumble power number range for both gun bashes and eviscerator blades. If you run Furious Defender, it should still always Stumble raged SC at either 85hp or 70hp (don't remember) because of the increase in stumble power.  The perks that say ""Stumble chance"" are not random chance at all, they're a very tangible, flat stat boost. There's a spreadsheet that contains all weapons and zeds stumble values.  Edit: found it https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GDpg2mN1l_86U_RaDug0glFx8cZCuErwxZLiBKl9SyY/htmlview#"
killingfloor,3cojs8,Kvasir94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention that part even after just looking over it. The stumble power of the shot is just barely too low without Furious Defender but just barely high enough with it to keep stumbling raged scrakes. I think the bash doesn't have enough stumble power unless you're missing some health, though (if that 90 for ""saw melee"" is the right number for it)."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Centias,2,Thu Jul 9 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's actually kind of odd because the saw has a lower stumble value on the bash than any other gun bash, afaik."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Kvasir94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, seems that way. That's kind of depressing."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Centias,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not sure what the weapon has going for it versus pulverizer and nailgun, except maybe the ability to kill bloats/husks/sirens from slightly further away. I mean, Scrakes resist 50% of slashing damage as well and FPs already take an extra 50% from the Pulverizer explosion. So what exactly is the Eviscerator that good for? Not much, considering it's a bad choice on all boss type zeds.  If you could carry it with the Pulverizer it might be a viable choice (but probably a bit overpowered having both).  Definitely think we'll see it get buffed when the zerker changes come around."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Kvasir94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really thinking it needs some serious attention. Right now it really only works well as a trash clearing tool, and even then it still has accuracy issues (why can my saw blade randomly fly off 30 degrees above my target's head?). Whether it becomes better suited for big zed killing, or becomes lighter/cheap so you can use it earlier for effective trash clearing, doesn't really matter too much. It just matters that it gets improved, because right now they balanced its weight and cost like it was your best weapon, but the way it's designed and the way the mechanics are set up make it a worse option than the pulverizer. I could see the nailgun being slightly lighter so you could use both together as a mid-short range trash clearer, but probably not eviscerate + pulverizer. Or I could see them coming up with some way to make it better for those big targets, like more damage and stumbling power. But really, with the slashing damage reduction on both scrake and FP and the huge stumble resistance on the FP, I'm not sure it would be enough to matter unless it was basically guaranteed to stumble both, which might then be too much."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Centias,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:52 2015 UTC,Bash doesn't have stumble power at all. The one you see is the Stun Power which so far is too low to stun anyone. Bash featuring high Hit power instead.

killingfloor,3cojs8,Cao_Cao_Mengde,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"Berserker isn't THAT bad right now. It's just not as good as the other classes in the game. I am currently leveling my Berserker since I have hit 25 on the other 3 classes.  When I play online, I try to stick with the medic so I have a better chance of surviving.  This also allows me to hold the line instead of kiting. When I play Solo, I can usually hold my ground until wave 5 (I play on Hard, best xp for the effort) when the scrakes start coming. If the scrake doesn't have any Zeds around him, I take him out immediately. If he does, then I start kiting and clearing Zeds around him and then take him out.  I always use the Pulv and Nailgun. In its current state, I do not like the Eviscerater. They should remove the gas ""ammo"" from that weapon and make it be able to just last forever (like the chainsaw in KF1). If this means they need to reduce its damage, then so be it. I mainly use the nailgun to clear trash (the penetration and stumble effect are awesome) and the pulv to take out Husk/Scrake/Fleshpounds.  My Berserker is level 13, currently, and I can easily finish 10 waves on Hard. As mentioned above, I usually end up kiting around the map when Scrakes/Fleshpounds come. Once I clear the trash around them though, I can easily take them out (especially fleshpounds, super easy).  For fleshpounds, I kite until they go out of rage mode and then get in their face and parry their first attack. This causes them to stumble. I follow that up with a hard overhead swing to the skull with the pulv. This causes them to start their ""I'm getting angry"" animation. That usually gives me enough time to hit them two more times with the pulv and they are dead (this is on hard solo). While online, I coordinate with my team when I am about to engage it and with their extra nade/weapon damage, fleshpounds are usually easily taken care of.  For Scrakes, I deal with them in one of three ways. My preferred way is to start the fight with a heavy overhead swing to stumble them, then continue to parry/heavy attack until dead. This usually works, but sometimes I notice the parry doesn't register or the stumble effect isn't applied (even though it's not on cooldown). The second method I use is the ""exploity"" (as the devs call it) method of spin locking them and continually hitting them in the head with heavy pulv swings. This keeps them in perpetual spin lock/stumble mode. The last method that I use is the ""hit and run"" method (only viable on Solo). Start the fight by hitting the Scrake in the head with a heavy pulv swing, which stumbles him. I take this time to turn around and sprint away. I count to about 4 (stumble cooldown), and then turn around and wind up a heavy pulv swing again (the scrake should be right on your tail). This will stumble him again. Repeat until dead. I prefer to do the first method, as it is more engaging and high risk/reward type battle. Method two seems kinda cheap. Method three isn't as high risk/reward, but doesn't feel as cheap as spin locking.  For trash, the Nailgun is great. It has a large ammo pool, penetration, and stumble. I mainly use it in single fire mode, but will switch to shotgun mode if a group of gorefasts/ a siren is in my face to easily dispatch them. Hans is surprisingly easily on Hard Solo. I just stay in his face and dodge his attacks (by spinning) or parry the largely animated attacks. It only takes about 4-5  heavy pulv hits to the face to cause him to change stages and finish him off in his last stage.  My biggest contention with the Berserker class is that his perk tree skills are pretty much useless. They mostly rely on the Berserker being at low health which means you will most likely die very soon after gaining the perk benefit. If you have a good medic on your team, you will usually never even receive these perk benefits. There are also ones that are a chance to occur instead of a constant perk benefit. When I was leveling my other 3 perks, I was excited to hit a perk gain level because I knew I was getting something awesome (50% magazine increase and tactical reload for commando are HUGE). Not so much for the Berserker.  TL:DR: Berserker isn't THAT bad, just not as good as it should be. Know your classes' strengths and weaknesses and play accordingly. Berserker Perks are fairly useless and the revamp cannot come soon enough."
killingfloor,3cojs8,Kvasir94,2,Thu Jul 9 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"The skills that say ""chance"" are not random, just poorly worded. Look up the KF2 spreadsheet for weapon damages and zed stats. Every weapon has a stumble power rating number, those perks increase that power by a flat percentage so it's not actually chance or random at all. This allows you to Stumble things you couldnt. For instance at I think it was 70hp, furious defender causes you to Stumble Scrakes with a single nail literally forever in a cycle. Every perk that has a Stumble boosting skill currently also causes every gun butt attack to Stumble SC (even after he rages). Without them the bash stops working when he rages (he gains +10 stumble resist is why). This effect will apply every time without fail (Barring how scrakes sometimes avoid Stumbles if they're mid-attack)  Intimidate also mitigates 25% of zed damage, not 15% which is a typo. Best perk ever. Most of the low health perks are noob bait, furious defender is situation as hell but powerful, still not very good in practicality.  Oh and for SC on high level multiplayer the EMP and communication become your most valuable tools.  Here is the spreadsheet of stumble values and tons of other useful info: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GDpg2mN1l_86U_RaDug0glFx8cZCuErwxZLiBKl9SyY/htmlview#  Simply compare your weapon's stumble power to the zed's stumble resist.  If power > resist then he stumbles. Every time. Notice some Zeds have lower leg resist. Body stumbles and leg stumbles both have separate cool down timers too. This means you can Stumble a SC,  then 1 and a half seconds later leg stumble him even though his cool down is 3 sec. Pretty sure this does not work on SC with the Pulv or is at least limitingly difficult to pull off but it works well on FPs or on any zed if you're using a gun. (Note that the cool down for fp is 15 sec so you can't exactly juggle stumbles, just get an extra one by going for his legs)"

They modeled it with the flashlight attachment, I guess just for simplicity in case they changed their minds. With the AA-12, it seems like a balancing decision, but personally I think it's still a mistake. Interesting that both weapons are the top tier options for their class. I could almost understand the SCAR not having a flashlight if it wasn't already on the freaking model. There should be classes that provide lighting for other classes which don't have the options, like the berserker or the martial artist or whatever other classes they're adding with non standard weapons without picatinny rails for mounting attachments.  I thought the intention was for a class like support to provide the lighting for other classes. But commando also seems like a class that should have it's own lighting, especially when it's so obvious that a flashlight should be attached that the artists even attached one despite not making it functional. I agree, it's dumb, but sadly I think they're working so much on expanding the game that they're not going to bother with such small tweaks until much later."

Getting 90 fps in one game doesn't mean you'll get anywhere with other games.

Making the game run flawlessly on iGPUs, while reaching the heights of excellence TW has achieved thus far with KF2's graphics, is an unreasonably mammoth project. Video game graphic design is a game of picking whether you want a pretty cake or you want to make sure absolutely everyone can eat your cake, but the two are almost always mutually exclusive.  TW chose to make a pretty cake. I know it's frustrating, but you're honestly just going to have to come to terms with the fact that it happens to be a cake your computer can't fully appreciate."

killingfloor,3ce9ga,mokahless,5,Tue Jul 7 10:09:24 2015 UTC,This being missing from KF2 has had the most effect on my play style
killingfloor,3ce9ga,HeyApples,2,Tue Jul 7 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"YES, glad someone else mentioned this"
killingfloor,3ce9ga,Helghost,5,Tue Jul 7 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"My main issues are beserker in general, the bullet spongey rage machine that oddly enough is not the fleshpound and how strange most weapons feel when you actually aim down sights. I swear I can't aim as well in this one as I could in the last one, just jumpy as hell.  Also the fucking bullet tracers that throw me off constantly when not in zed time."
killingfloor,3ce9ga,zeronic,8,Tue Jul 7 09:43:48 2015 UTC,"I swear I can't aim as well in this one as I could in the last one, just jumpy as hell.   A lot of that has to do with the fact ZED animations are a lot faster, and that there are more of them. As well as heads generally not being in the same place screen-wise as they were in the last game. I too found it harder to aim at first since the zeds are a lot more active with their animations, making it overall harder to get headshots.  In KF1 Zeds were a lot more subdued by comparison, and generally just followed a single walk cycle. Here they seemingly bounce all over the place. Definitely more realistic, but it takes time to get used to the much quicker animations."
killingfloor,3ce9ga,Gogmagog,8,Tue Jul 7 12:09:57 2015 UTC,"Zed animations are much more varied in KF2, so the hitboxes change position more often. I find that dealing with it is as much about memorization as it is about undoing motor patterns I  developed by playing KF1.   I feel like my brain is broken when a Clot falls over after missing a grab and I just wait for him to stand up again because I have no idea where the head hitbox is going to be."

Just aim near the head and let it fly, it has a surprisingly big attack-box, and seems to apply the increased damage modifier as if you'd gotten a headshot with a bullet. Saves me a ton of ammo on early waves, actually."
killingfloor,3ce9ga,Helghost,0,Tue Jul 7 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"Nah, animations are fine, but the guns just seem to recoil incredibly hard real fast. I mean, the only real way to consistently land shots is single fire mode on assault rifles."
killingfloor,3ce9ga,zeronic,3,Tue Jul 7 12:44:29 2015 UTC,"Recoil is certainly a lot higher than the last game, extremely so. I haven't played in a while so i forgot about that bit."
killingfloor,3ce9ga,Helghost,0,Tue Jul 7 12:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll admit I've not fired a SCAR full auto before but I feel like this is a bit too much for a video game."
killingfloor,3ce9ga,LOLtex,3,Tue Jul 7 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly... The recoil in game for the scar is probably less than that in real life.  Look up some YouTube  videos, make sure its the 7.62 version.  The scar is a battle rifle and shoots a meaty cartridge.  Haven't shot one myself (they're expensive) but I've shot the cartridge before and it packs a whallop."
killingfloor,3ce9ga,Anolis_Gaming,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:15:15 2015 UTC,Yeah the 7.62 is the SCAR H. The SCAR L is 5.56. That's the reason it only has 20 rounds. 7.62 are big.

killingfloor,3ce9ga,Anolis_Gaming,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"Zed bouncing is such an old problem. I had always thought it was due to some oddity in Unreal Engine 2, so I was disappointed to see it again in KF2. I guess it has less to do with the engine than it does with whatever pathfinding mechanism Tripwire developed to control how Zeds move over terrain objects.  I really hope a fix for this comes down the pipe eventually. It's very high on my wishlist."

I paid to get early access but also to support a good company. Some people are desperate the devs aren't pooping guns out every other week, if in the end they fuck it up I will grab my pitchfork too but right now it's silly.   For those that are not strong on the patience level, I suggest a great game by the same team (sort of) called ""Killing Floor""."
killingfloor,3cc4rd,TheRMF,8,Mon Jul 6 19:53:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. People seem to forget that the game is in EARLY ACCESS, also known for OPEN DEVELOPMENT."
killingfloor,3cc4rd,MrSoupSox,8,Mon Jul 6 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, and if Tripwire was pumping out horrible content every week, people would be even more upset. They provide really high quality content, and that takes time (which you're right, is the point of Early Access). Manor is a fantastic map for example, and yet people still complain of not enough updates. Quality over quantity, every time."
killingfloor,3cc4rd,Celtic_Beast,7,Mon Jul 6 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"There is no argument over quantity vs quality here, but I think the priorities are not perfect in this early access. Would you say the point of early access is to release a part of the game such as perks, abilities etc, balance and fix it over time even if it isn't aesthetically perfect and move on, perfecting the looks later? That's what I thought the point of KF2 being in early-access was, but I can't help feeling that TWI are spending 90% of their time polishing how the content they are making looks, and yes this shows since everything in this game looks AMAZING. However I feel like the priority should be fixing the countless bugs and balancing such as skills that don't work, skills that are horribly underpowered, exploits (circle strafing scrakes, a few god-spots on the official maps etc) rather than making the game look great. I would prefer if they even had not-perfect models, lights, and sounds just to get all the main gameplay elements working rather than dealing with matches where people just dupe weapons in wave 1. I love what you're doing Tripwire, but imo there isnt much point in EA if they are literally just releasing chunks of finished game rather than fixing what is out. All that said, I still fucking love playing this game. Jesus fuck I'm sorry for the text wall."
killingfloor,3cc4rd,MrSoupSox,4,Mon Jul 6 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you're saying, and I do agree for the most part. What I will say though is that with only 4 perks in the game atm, I wouldn't be surprised if they wait for more perks, not to mention weapons, to be added before they go about making game balance changes. I have no idea how their prioritization works, for all I know, the incinerate and detonate pack could fix a lot of the issues. They did specifically say they're working on perk balancing in one of the WWAUT posts a while back, and I doubt they wouldn't be currently working on stuff like the scrake circling, but that being said, the base game is incredibly polished. That's not something I see very often in Early Access games. For many games, the base game is fundamentally flawed, whether or not they have lots of content stacked on top, and that leads to a really poor experience THROUGHOUT Early Access (Dayz, Rust are two examples off the top of my head, even though they're a different genre).  I totally agree that balancing needs work, but at the same time, with a game that has an extremely polished base, and lacks pure player count and replayability in the long term due to lack of overall content, I understand why the marketed info from TW focuses more on the content side than the balancing side. The hardcore KF fans are the ones who care about the balancing, but I'd be willing to bet that most intermittent/""casual"" KF2 players don't care nearly enough about balance over sheer content (see the E3 trailer as a great example), and they probably make up 90+% of the purchases for KF2.   I totally agree with you about balancing. But at the same time, seeing as they have mentioned that they're working on it, and it's not as easy to show off (in videos, text posts, etc) the fruits of their labor on that front, as it is to show off new maps and guns and the like, I'm not surprised that we haven't heard much about it.  Text wall replies are the best haha"
killingfloor,3cc4rd,Celtic_Beast,2,Mon Jul 6 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"I agree on that balancing is definitely not as big as an issue since as you said not even half the perks are available yet so it isnt as easy to tell balance, but I meant to focus more on the games bugs which do affect my ability to enjoy the game at times. But yeah whichever route they take TWI is going to end up with the most badass game of 2016 (hopefully not later.) at the end of it.  My ideal idea is that they do continue releasing content at the rate that they do but less graphically polished since I think that everything added during EA should pretty much be a proof of concept and then tinker with it before saying ""okay this will work"" and making it look beautiful."
killingfloor,3cc4rd,itonlygetsworse,5,Mon Jul 6 22:21:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry if Tripwire was pumping out updates every week, I think people would not be bitching about updates, but instead be discussing what the next changes should be.

killingfloor,3cc4rd,ReverendDuckworth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:40:32 2015 UTC,"Open development is one thing. Slowly bleeding out the casuals/whiners/whatever due to terrible content release is another. Most of you that worship this husk of a game need to really start caring about the community. Without a strong support system the game ceases to exist. Developers don't make content for games that don't sell.  Vehemently defending the game is just as bad as whining. You're just on a polar opposite side of the argument, and just as unproductive. Me personally I've jumped ship and may consider playing in a year or so. But that shouldn't stop those that claim they love the game to better along the environment/community."

The pistols were always my favorite in KF1, and I want something other than the 9mm since I feel it's underwhelming in KF2 (both in power and sound).  Semi-related: Anyone know why you can't dual-wield 9mm's in KF2? Is it something that's specifically for Gunslinger now? Just curious if there was any kind of official word on that decision, or if it just wasn't implemented yet due to EA."
killingfloor,3ce6z5,v4lor,3,Tue Jul 7 06:36:24 2015 UTC,"I can't wait for more pistols to be added, the Mks were my absolute favourite weapon in KF1. The medic pistol is okay but the general pistol feel is a bit flimsy to me.  There's been no word on why they aren't in the game yet, to my knowledge. I'll be disappointed if they aren't added with the Gunslinger as his spawn weapon. They'd be useful enough along with the bonuses the perk would get for the first couple waves, probably.

killingfloor,3ce6z5,Celtic_Beast,2,Tue Jul 7 10:44:12 2015 UTC,"I never noticed until I went back to KF1, but the 9mm in KF2 sounds so dinky. The double tap to the head to kill trash also makes it seem significantly less powerful than the KF1 9mm."

Tier 3 weapon: Red Tape/Paperwork Assault - Sends a stream of high velocity contracts at the Zeds, slowing their movement and doing slow DOT while enraging them.  Perks:  Low level perk - Negotiation - All prices at the Trader are lower thanks to your silver tongue.    Medium level perk - Soothing Wordcraft - Ability to stop a FP or Scrake's enrage and calm them down. Lower Zeds have a chance to turn and leave the fight for 10 seconds to rethink their undeath.    High level perk - CounterOffer - AOE attack where low level Zeds will change sides and fight for you. Alt Fire is a time limited high end attack that has a chance to persuade a FP or Scrake to fight for your team for 10 seconds. At the end of 10 seconds they revert back to the Zed's side, but the remaining Zeds feel betrayed and will attack it as if it were a traitor."

Most likely the Zerker, since it doesn't seem to have much desire to be played. In KF everyone loved the Zerker, but in KF2 it just seems kind of silly. If the zerker had the ability to purchase heavier armor that was tougher to get to, I think that would be a neat idea. It would sure add a vital role for a team,  and would get rid the of circle staffing scrakes and pounders that everyone seems to not like. Make a class that actually has to stand up to the large enemies and force teams to have to rely on healing and dps from afar,  and it would be a bit more interesting than the current system of just running around a scrake.  A good Medic can easily kill 5 Scrakes without ever even talking a hit."

killingfloor,3ccjum,Anolis_Gaming,2,Mon Jul 6 22:19:06 2015 UTC,You can buy KF2 and ask for a refund within 2 weeks or keep it under 2 hours of playtime. KF2 at the moment is easier than KF1.
killingfloor,3ccjum,kdpha,5,Mon Jul 6 21:33:18 2015 UTC,I have to question if you've played them both. KF1 is a lot easier than 2 and we don't even have all perks unlocked yet.
killingfloor,3ccjum,Kyouji,4,Tue Jul 7 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kartesian/games/?tab=all  That's my Steam, with 100% in KF1 and 2.   Typically what kills teams are the FPs in wave 10 and the boss fight. FPs are easier in KF2. They don't rage for very long, they do less damage and their attacks can be parried. In KF1, You relied on a skilled berserker/sharp or pipes and demos. Not only that, but it's damn near impossible to outrun a raging FP in KF1.   Hans is way easier than KF1 Patriarch. If you break his line of sight at a certain distance, you can run and chip him to death. It is very hard to outrun the Patriarch and chip his damage at the same time. He charge rage is much larger. The lack of armor repair makes it even more crucial that you can't take hits from his chaingun."
killingfloor,3ccjum,kdpha,4,Tue Jul 7 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your insights, but the biggest thing separating the two games is one is complete and the other is still early access, so it's really not a fair comparison right now.  In KF1, the boss fight can be easily mitigated by a single skilled player familiar with the locking exploit, which can be done successfully with every perk with full weight. The Patriarch gives warning of his attacks prior to firing, and he runs away to heal, giving you time to fix up your teammates for the next go at him.  You can also cancel his heals if you're quick enough. In KF2, however, Hans is practically an aimbot with very little cooldown time between attacks, unless you exploit his turning mechanic. The only way to defeat him on higher difficulties is through a very planned and very long kite, and it's practically essential to let him heal on someone, as he gets a damage reduction when in hunter mode.    Scs and fps are just a chore to kill in KF2.  What were once simple one person tasks on a 6 man HoE team now take at least a few people and several more seconds to take care of. Fps are easier in KF1 because we've min/maxed the hell out of the dozens upon dozens of gun combinations, and once a fp hits you he instantly stops raging (which can also be door cancelled).  You can kill a fp within the time it takes for its rage animation to play (10 EBR headshots on 6man HoE), and you can stunlock scs."

killingfloor,3ccjum,Jmcglosson,13,Tue Jul 7 04:18:32 2015 UTC,"Kf2 is a casualized version of KF1   Are you kidding me? The beginner difficulty in KF1 is ludicrously easy. If you have armor, crawlers don't even do any damage! It takes 4 hits for the Patriarch to kill you without armor! If by casualized you mean ""plays smoother"" (A more traditional XP system, being able to switch weapons while reloading, etc.) or ""better graphics"" then you'd be right.   so I would recommend against buying KF2.   Wait, where's the logic in this? He wants a very easy experience to learn how to play. So by your logic, since KF2 is more ""casualized,"" shouldn't that be the one he should get? I agree that he should start off with KF1, but that's because the beginner difficulty in it is just too easy, so it's a great way to understand the basics of KF without getting creamed.   Especially because it's looking more and more likely that Tripwire will abandon it.   What the fuck are you smoking? If anything, Tripwire's going to abandon KF1 not KF2. Are you just saying that because it's in early access and some early access titles end up that way?"

Or the joke of community interaction(s).   Everyone appears to be under the illusion that we are in an alpha/beta. I can understand the confusion as most companies follow the same type of cash grab to finish a game (or more often than not don't finish). But there seems to be this looming cloud of fear from TWI to put anything in the game that isn't near polished. I signed up to be a part of development, offer suggestions, and experience frequently broken content. That simply isn't the case here and there is no sign of change.   I can GURANTEE you that if this steamy pile of clusterfuck was out when steam rebates were a thing, the devs would be more in tune with the community. I don't see a single person on steam that plays KF2 anymore that I played with in closed alpha. The decline of the community and the lack of content has assured me enough that TWI is spinning on loop track. It's a shame, but hey, indie studios are dime a dozen, the next great thing may actually be great. :D  Vote with your dollars people. Don't support what you don't agree with."

killingfloor,3cg74g,meeplol,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"KF1 mostly had a small dedicated group of active players, but had a lot of people that owned the game. I don't think there was ever any reason to think KF2 would be all that different. With the new updates to graphics/classes/etc. KF2 might have a slightly larger following than KF1 post release, but I don't expect it to be more than a close followers in the 4-5K range."
killingfloor,3cg74g,DoogieHueserMD,0,Wed Jul 8 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"They know they have an interested playerbase though, because KF1 was so popular, and KF2 is a gorgeous gorefast gorefest. I think they released it earlier because they want to make a game the players love, they've heard our feedback about the broken aspects and they're working on making it better. Maybe I'm just stupidly optimistic, but I think they're going to turn KF2 into a complete game that players love as much as KF1."
killingfloor,3cg74g,KillingJoke04,3,Tue Jul 7 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"But if they dont start working on releasing anything even if its a map by itself a little sooner theyre going to lose that player base.

killingfloor,3cg74g,shadow3467,9,Tue Jul 7 20:16:15 2015 UTC,Actually I've been disappointed.  Before KF2 came out I promised myself I would never buy an early access game again. Then they said they would do early access right and I bought into it. Now more than 2 months later and the game is basically still the exact same game that came out in early access with the addition of one map.  Disappointed to say the least.
killingfloor,3cg74g,Suparockr,-5,Tue Jul 7 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"They've had to fix a lot of bugs, plus they need to overhaul the entire zerker tree, that had to slow down development."

Compare that to Evolve's bullshit and TW looks like a saint. They have the Incinerate and Detonate pack coming out soon, plus they had to completely overhaul the Zerker tree and tweak at least 2 other skill trees.  The thing to focus on is they aren't trying to charge us for the Incinerate and Detonate pack, they're giving us all the guns, perks, and maps for free."
killingfloor,3cg74g,overjoyedlemur,11,Tue Jul 7 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"The thing to focus on is they aren't trying to charge us for the Incinerate and Detonate pack, they're giving us all the guns, perks, and maps for free   because we expected 10 perks in the base game.  It would be like buying a Mario game and being fucking grateful that they added in power up mushrooms."
killingfloor,3cg74g,jjb985,-8,Tue Jul 7 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"Right, but a ton of games are doing just that, making Mario games and then offering power up mushrooms in 25$ DLC. not only have they not started milking us with DLC, they say they aren't going to charge us for anything we need to play the game, only cosmetic DLC.  Don't get me wrong: this game is definitely in early access, and until they add another 6 perks and at least 12 more maps, I won't call it done. But with all the bullshit that devs have been giving us, I like what TW is doing so far, and will be crushed if KF2 turns into a DLC store"

I picked up kf2 and I think it's alot of fun it does help that people already have modded maps as it keeps it fresh liner but I do agree that 4 maps right now is pretty minimal with given the time its been in EA. I wood like new enemy's as well but that may be asking for too much?
killingfloor,3cg74g,vtx84,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:33:53 2015 UTC,It just sucks for people who played the original KF because right now KF2 has less than half the content that KF had on release.

In the original KF all of the perks were ""free"", and while there was DLC weapon packs they were nowhere near nessecary to play; you could do just fine without them. If they charged for the I&D pack they would lose  half of their community instantly, so once again it's nothing to pat them on the back for.  As for the other content, while the bug fixes and the like are neat, like Suparockr said nothing of hard note has been shown besides tweaks. I got the game when it hit EA because I thought cool I'll play it a bit then take a break because none of those 4 perks were interesting and maybe Sharpshooter or Gunslinger or one of the new classes will be out after a while.....nope. Instead they are working simultaneously on the the two most graphical heavy perks which will take the longest to do so there could've been more perks out by now but now we will have even more perks out that can clear up trash but not the stronger enemies which is what was needed.   For the amount of hours I put in (which wasn't too much honestly trying not to get burnt out early) compared to the rate of progress it really wasn't worth the $30. I would've rather not spent it at all if I knew the rate they were going to put the content out and just paid an extra $10 or even $20 months down the road when it was closer to being finished and actually had a perk I liked."
killingfloor,3cg74g,AsiaDerp,-3,Tue Jul 7 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"It's praiseworthy because, in an industry that's trying to milk us for dlc, TW isn't doing it. It shouldn't be praiseworthy, it should be standard, but it isn't. All the perks in KF were free because it was just a cool game built on top of another game. The weapon packs gave you retardedly good weapons though, and I never wanted to buy them because I didn't want to pay for DLC I didn't need. Now in KF2, they're saying they won't charge for any of the weapons or maps or perks. Again, it should be standard, but after some of the shit games the past few years, it's good to see a dev not milk the DLC.   I don't have a problem with that, tbh, there have been hints that they're releasing Patriarch and Matriarch eventually, and they've noted that the Scrakes are a little exploitable at the moment, I'm sure they won't be circle-jerkable in the future."

killingfloor,3cg74g,chromeshelter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"It should definitely be free, but lots of devs have been charging extra for stuff that should just be in the game. Nice to see a dev, as TW put it, 'do EA right'"

killingfloor,3cg74g,ReverendDuckworth,4,Tue Jul 7 21:02:52 2015 UTC,"I think TW has gotten much, much better in the last month with their weekly WWUAT update posts. What I think most of the community wanted was transparency (and content, obviously). That being said - I understand that it can take quite a while to create and then refine content, but the updates have been too few and far between. I think TW started EA too early just to meet summer sales and E3. The game's already down to 1,400 players as of this posting. Very, very low amount. Whatever the case though, TW has KF2 in EA right now, and the best they can do is ask us to be patient and ease information over to us. With it seeming like we're getting two perks in 4-5 months from the EA release, it's looking extremely unpromising that retail will still come out this year. Hopefully the game isn't rushed to meet deadlines and we still get some great-quality content. Overall, I'm glad TW decided to change up their PR and decide to fill us in with information instead of keep us in the dark, like they did in earlier in KF2 EA."
killingfloor,3cb2u8,OblivionArises,9,Mon Jul 6 14:55:04 2015 UTC,It's the same boss for every level and the trick is to not bother hitting him while he's draining someone and heal your teammates when they get grabbed.
killingfloor,3cb2u8,spoodge,3,Mon Jul 6 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree, to elaborate slightly for OP: Hans has (correct me if I'm wrong, anyone!) 85% damage resistance when he is in his healing phase running around, and 100% when actually grabbing someone and healing from them, so it's just a waste of ammo. Usually just focus on healing whoever Hans is draining."
killingfloor,3cb2u8,Comment_karma_only,3,Tue Jul 7 05:22:12 2015 UTC,"He actually maintains 85% damage res even when actually healing, not 100%. But I guess you could say it's effectively 100% since he's healing more than you're hurting him, haha."

If Hans sees anyone but the guy he leeched after he heals, he immediately starts using his guns and grenades. Can instantly kill the guy at low HP. Should instead wait until the 10 zeds he's spawned have died. Then go to killing him with whatever methods again."

He can even solo scrakes by himself with just an emp and a rifle, aa12, or combat shotgun.  Berserker just isn't a totally braindead m1 perk like it can be in KF1. He doesn't need to be tankier or stronger. He's so good right now as is. But whatever, TW caved and are gonna buff him anyway.  It's good that zerk isn't tankier anyway.

Coming from Payday 2 it's kind of weird to have guns that are un moddable. Though I understand that setting up a modular system like that would mean they'd have to redo all existing guns and possibly change their entire weapon art, animation, scripting and implementation pipeline. BUT, maybe as a massive DLC upgrade once the game is done?  I'd love to have it honestly."
killingfloor,3c7wch,Skamberin,7,Sun Jul 5 20:28:39 2015 UTC,"since every other FPS allows it   ""Everyone else does it"" isn't a good reason to include something in a game. If you strive to be a better game than the competition, you need to do things differently and take risks imo."
killingfloor,3c7wch,ButterMyBiscuit,11,Mon Jul 6 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"It's a growth of the medium thing, they included a sprinting function, because everyone has it and it's become a standard because it's a GOOD addition. Customization of weaponry and loadout isn't exactly a bad thing to consider for a game based around weapons."
killingfloor,3c7wch,Skamberin,10,Mon Jul 6 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"This is a common suggestion i saw quite often back on the KF forums, and there are a few reasons why it's not really a GREAT suggestion in terms of design, at least when it comes to KF.  The problem is, you're describing this as a fix to a problem, that allowing upgraded guns would MAKE WORSE.  You said in your post ""When you don't have enough dosh for the next weapon, and you really need a higher Tier weapon for the next wave, you could instead spend the Dosh on your current weapon by upgrading it"" ... y'know how you don't have enough Dosh for new weapons? Spending your money on stuff you don't need, such as off-perk weapons, body armor, or grenades, in the early waves. Adding upgrades would only further this problem.  For example, let's say first wave, you need 500 dosh to get a Tier 2 weapon, and you only have 400, so you instead spend 400 on upgrading your current weapon. Then the next wave comes around and you have 500, so you sell your current upgraded weapon for something like 250, and you've effectively LOST 150 dosh after only TWO waves. And then you need 1000 for a T3, but you only have 900, and you would've have 1050 if you hadn't spent it on useless upgrades... etc.  Plus, at the high level, this change would literally change NOTHING. Nobody who's playing on HoE would buy intermittent upgrades due to the reason I just described (not to mention losing a weapon when dying hurts bad enough, but losing an UPGRADED one is an even bigger waste of dosh). The only thing this would really change is ""Oh hey, I finally got my AA12/Scar/Berzerk-bow/etc, time to pump it full of upgrades"".  In a game that is mostly about ""I have to get this high tier weapon BEFORE high tier enemies spawn"" sidetracking players with ""oh hey, spend your money on upgrading your current guns"" delays getting the powerful weapons when you most need them. While a lot of newer players would love this feature because ""omg weapon customization!"" it would actually make the game HARDER for new players, since it would take them even longer to get their AA12 or Scar or whatever. If this were implimented, it probably wouldn't be uncommon to get into a game at wave 10, where people have two fully upgraded early game guns, instead of having any high-tier weapons.  I guess a good comparison would be something like LoL or Dota. If you have a carry on your team, and they just buy 6 doran's blades, or 6 wraith bands... yes, every one of those they buy TECHNICALLY makes them stronger immediately. But since the time cost of those makes it take longer for them to get the core items they need, they end up throwing the game to the enemy carry, who decided to work on getting their important, expensive core items, instead of building 6 bracers or something.  Upgrades are good in theory for FPS in general, but for KF's design and current structure, would be pretty bad in practice. At least, in my opinion."
killingfloor,3c7wch,retromenace7,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:18:58 2015 UTC,"What you said makes sense and is perfectly valid from a 'maximum team balancing' standpoint, but I think you've overlooked the fact that some players just want to play however they'd like - even if it's downright silly.  I'll use COD zombies (Black Ops 1 and 2) to illustrate my point. - There was no 'right' and 'wrong' strategy. Players could use whatever weapon combinations and upgrades they wanted as long as it kept them alive. Some wanted to pimp out the starting pistol, some wanted to get a better knife, some prioritized getting good armor (Juggernog), some wanted newer bigger weapons all the time, some wanted smaller upgraded weapons... ect.  Some strategies sucked, and some worked brilliantly. You had to play the game to figure out what worked for you - and it was fun to figure out what the best strategy was for ME.  Killing Floor could be great with a system like that. The game is kill zeds -> get a new bigger gun -> repeat. It works and works great, and upgrades would give players additional options without TWI having to add new weapons.  TL;DR - Upgrades would give the players more loadout combinations and give the game more depth."
killingfloor,3c7wch,AGFuzzyPancake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The problem with your argument is that, more of less, the weapons in COD Zombies were the same from an overall standpoint. One might have more recoil and also more damage. One might have a larger clip. Since the weapons were imported from the multiplayer, they were all intended to be SIDEGRADES to each other that had no inate advantages over each other. And in a PvE game where your main avenue of acquiring weapons is to get them out of a chest randomly, and then if you personally happen to like that weapon you keep it, the idea of upgrades works.   The problem is, that is not how KF is designed. The devs had said it before, on several occasions, that KF is about ""Get guns, kill a bunch of zombies, buy BIGGER guns, kill BIGGER zombies."" So, some guns being naturally stronger and better than other guns in every single way is a core part of Killing Floor's design. And setting a player back 200 dosh that they need to break into the next tier, for .4 seconds off a reload, would interrupt this part of the design and confuse new players."
killingfloor,3c7wch,retromenace7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:50:01 2015 UTC,"You're over-complicating this. The name is the game is ""bigger guns"", but when players only have four choices and nothing else to spend money on beyond that there is a problem. Upgrades very adequately fix this problem AND allow more loadout options to fit different people's play styles. Everyone wins.  And players are not stupid. They'll get that they can upgrade weapons or buy entirely new ones real fucking quick.  And as if a "".4"" second faster reload upgrade would be entising to anyone. I'm talking about damage, rate of fire, clip size, and recoil buffs. Fun stuff."
killingfloor,3c7wch,AGFuzzyPancake,0,Tue Jul 7 07:40:01 2015 UTC,"The reason why there's nothing beyond 4 guns is because the game is in early access. And if they had to develop a BRAND NEW system of ""weapon upgrades"" something they've never done in their games, that's gonna take longer to develop than something they're used to making... more weapons.  Besides, with how many weapons the game will eventually get, the weapon upgrade system would honestly be a little redundant. Looking at KF1 as an example, we're going to eventually have 3-5 weapon choices for each tier, for each class.  Using the Commando as an example, the Bullpup, T-Lead, and Tommy Guns were all cheap tier 1 weapons. The M4 Carbine, AK47, and Mkb42 were tier 2 weapons. And for tier 3, there was the Scar and the FnFal. Since at the tiers, the weapons were relatively as powerful but with SLIGHTLY different stats, that's where player customization came in.  You like having huge clips? You'd probably get the Rising Storm Tommy Gun for a T1. Do you prefer doing accurate single shots over spraying, for T2, you'd probably get the AK. By giving players a bunch of different weapon choices, they will filter through the tiers to find the weapons that play the best to their own play style.   Adding upgrades to an environment like that is completely redundant, since then the weapons pros/cons would barely matter. The Bullpup's clip is too small in comparrison to the T-Lead? Just upgrade it. The MKb42 doesn't have the same single-shot accuracy as the AK? Just upgrade it."
killingfloor,3c7wch,retromenace7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think you're worried that if they do implement some sort of weapon upgrade, they'll do it the wrong way. Have some faith and trust the devs to do it right, and even if they don't, they'll be hearing from us players ;)."
killingfloor,3c7wch,retromenace7,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:03:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, implementing weapon upgrades that could be bought during a match, in ANY way in KF2 would be doing it the wrong way. It directly contradicts the game's main gameplay loop. Which is why I'm speaking so harshly against it.  At the absolute most, MAYBE there should be a system that is done out of game where you can customize the type of scopes and sights that different guns have. But even then, some will point to the sights on certain guns in KF1 and go ""that gun would've been pretty OP if it didn't have the awful sight it had"" so even then I'm not confident that would be a great addition."
killingfloor,3c7wch,the_dogeranger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this is a case where devs should just see that players will like this and be wowed by extra bells and whistles but the idea is dumb.

killingfloor,3c7wch,NachtJager,5,Mon Jul 6 08:28:30 2015 UTC,"My idea for upgrades would be things like different ammo types, all guns should start with iron sights and you can choose the optic you want, for the double barrel you can get an extended barrel, the triple barrels would have to be a different weapon. You should be able to get laser sights, and flashlights for all guns with a few exceptions like the flamethrower and crossbow, or lever action rifle, I also think that all classes should be able to sell the 9mm and get an upgraded pistol for their class, like commando a glock 18, which you can upgrade to extended mags, support a  Taurus Judge, etc."
killingfloor,3c7wch,LE_FANTABULOSO,0,Sun Jul 5 20:14:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe have it so attachments depend on class? Optics on sharpshooter, vertical grip for support, or maybe a flashlight, etc.?"
killingfloor,3c7wch,LE_FANTABULOSO,5,Sun Jul 5 23:24:26 2015 UTC,The thing is... this ain't COD. Having a flashlight on the weapon is pretty valuable and is a factor in how strong a weapon is. The Combat Shotgun has a flashlight while the AA12 doesn't. So you trade some utility for damage. Gives each weapon more character really.
killingfloor,3c7wch,VersionThree,3,Sun Jul 5 23:40:06 2015 UTC,"Of course it wouldn't be on all weapons, but to have some change style based on perk would be neat."

And c'mon, attachments aren't as cool as fullfledged unique upgrades? ;)  Adding a grip to a Double Barrel to reduce the recoil, nah I'm not feeling it. It's supposed to have a huge recoil because it is a huge shot. It's what gives the weapon flavour, it's what makes the Double Barrel the Double Barrel.  Add another barrel and make it do MORE damage and have MORE recoil and at the same time make the weapon look BADASS :D."

Haven't really seen it be worth it to stasis fleshpounds since they can de-rage automatically anyway with time or swinging. Also, they don't deal nearly as much damage as scrakes, haha."
killingfloor,3c8i19,qqnowqq,5,Mon Jul 6 17:15:05 2015 UTC,"Which is very stupid. With CMD/SUP, sometimes I nade FPs, sometimes I nade beside a scrake to kill that 3 clot and 2 gorefast beside the scrake, sometimes even a far away siren. But EMP is ONLY used when scrakes shows up. Use it on any thing else is a huge waste of nade and dont bring much results.  If FP can be affect by 1 EMP, then sometimes, it could be useful against FP, but most of the time you will still EMPing scrakes. Requiring 2 EMP for 1 FP is basically saying ""dont ever use EMP on FPs people""."
killingfloor,3c8i19,AsiaDerp,2,Tue Jul 7 04:05:00 2015 UTC,Which seems a little silly. Huge waste of EMP grenades when 2/5ths of your entire 'nade inventory is used to pause one FP. Especially since you're probably already being overrun by sirens at that point.
killingfloor,3c8i19,handstobattlestation,2,Mon Jul 6 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"yea but it isn't worth it to use two, because one successful parry will send him back to an un raged state, then a right click with the pulverizer will make him do his little ground punching animation, and then you parry again and rinse and repeat, EMP's are a waste on FP."

My main focus is on healing though. I just spray my assault rifle around to tag everything I can. You should look at the ""Assists"" column to determine if the medic is focusing more on killing than healing. My assists are usually like 80% of my ""Kills"" column.

It really needs a UI indicator so people actually know it's available.  Because of that I don't usually use it and really appreciate the extra ammo for myself which I know has a guaranteed benefit.  This is probably self fulfilling though since I assume people aren't using it and don't bother getting ammo from team mates.

killingfloor,3c8i19,AsiaDerp,4,Tue Jul 7 03:51:19 2015 UTC,Following is only for HOE because ...... suicidal is easy enough to fool around and still win. And this is the reason why people thinks they can just do the same thing on HOE and keep screw up the others.  People try to circle a EMPed scrake.  Zerker who dont EMP scrakes.

You have to have skill in kf2 and at least be able to hold your own as for the perk bonuses they're good and helpful but you can easily play the game the same without them IMO. But don't step right into an. HoE server without trying out the game especially with the way scrapes are in 2 compared to 1 and fps etc. also since they don't have all the perks into 2 you'll need to know how to be able to handle everything and help the team with the little that is in game.

I would much rather try to solo a scrake with parrying then try to coordinate a bunch of pubs with the emp grenade, although i still throw it out whenever there's a scrake. parrying is a big part of berserker and if you can't parry then you can't berserk well. i feel like i'm gonna get a lot of downvotes for this. but i think the reason why people don't like parrying is because when i parry a scrake and it stumbles people shoot the scrake and this unstumbles him 90% of the time leading to an unexpected attack and fucking up my rhythm"
killingfloor,3c8i19,AsiaDerp,3,Mon Jul 6 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"It's not like you shouldn't ever parry, but because of that instant unstumble coupled with the his head hitbox moving around so much, you end up wasting so much ammo, missing a lot of the time. Parrying can be really useful if you've lost space and need to push back or stall scrakes, fleshpounds, or Hans. Also even just parrying to get past a scrake or fleshpound if you're kiting is really good too.   Parrying isn't a useless mechanic entirely, it's just extremely overshadowed by the superior emp nade. It doesn't help that sometimes dying or reconnecting can entirely break the ability to parry and block at all, and even if you do go for parrying, you're still taking a huge buttload of damage especially if people aren't ready to shoot.   What's worse though is circling, by far."
killingfloor,3c8i19,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:35:23 2015 UTC,"yea but i'm just saying i'd rather go 1v1 on a scrake with parrying then trying to coordinate with pubs, cause 90% of the time i'm playin with pubs that don't communicate well, and the way you said parrying was very vague so it rather annoyed me lol"
killingfloor,3c8i19,steelblade66,2,Mon Jul 6 05:39:32 2015 UTC,"If you're going to 1v1 a scrake by parrying, you will surely die. You're simply not dealing enough damage to him to parry and kill him fast enough. (assuming you do primary>parry>repeat) You can even just solo scrakes as a zerker with an emp nade. However, if parrying garners you more success in games, then cool. But whenever I play with people that immediately go for parries and circling, it never bodes well and usually have to resort to kiting or sloppy emergency raged scrake takedowns."
killingfloor,3c8i19,downvotesfordinner,2,Mon Jul 6 07:55:52 2015 UTC,"Unless you are ramboing, your parry is instantly canceled by teammates who shoot at him. And because his head move all over the place, people cant head shot. And scrakes requires stupid amount of body shots to kill on HOE. That's why most of the time parrying is not a good option. Yes, if the scrake is already rage and targeting you, it could be useful, but dodge his attacks and keep firing at him is a lot better.  EMP>circling>parry>stumble. If people actually know what they are doing, you dont need the ""communication"". People dont share the same language all the time. People keep crying about bad communication and keep speaking on the microphone and expect everyone to understand their language really bothers me (usually a guy speaking Russians in my region). If the players dont even know what to do on a HOE game you cant win anyways, if they do, things happens automatically. You dont need to tell someone to buy a pulv, you dont need to tell the zerker to EMP a scrake, the second the LOS is clear, you will see the EMP effect. The second an FP shows up there will be a medic nade on the ground and 3 pulv ready.  What end up happening in those game when people ""communicates"" is when nobody know what to do, they end up kiting around for 15 minutes on WAVE FIVE leaving 5 scrakes behind and spent another 10 minutes to split them up. I have yet to win a game where people keep leading the team with microphone because that's the first sign of people dont know what to do."

killingfloor,3c7i6l,Blockyz,5,Sun Jul 5 18:43:10 2015 UTC,I just bound next/prev weapon to something else. Does anyone really scroll all the way through their weapons?

killingfloor,3c7i6l,imakeelyu,2,Mon Jul 6 22:45:25 2015 UTC,"There should be a separate alt fire and change fire mode/block button. I tried to change my X button to block so I could parry more easily without clicking that hard ass mousewheel, but it also changed the alt fire and switch firemode functions.   All 3 functions should be assignable to separate buttons, would really make things simpler"
killingfloor,3c7i6l,mrheadhopper,0,Sun Jul 5 17:18:20 2015 UTC,Why don't you just set that command to multiple buttons? You'd be able to block/parry with one button and still be able to use alt fire/mode switch on other buttons.

If someone likes Demon Hunter, then I feel comfortable suggesting that they also try listening to Zao, August Burns Red, Of Mice & Men, or Bring Me the Horizon because those are all considered metalcore bands, too, and there is a reasonable expectation that a Demon Hunter fan may also like those other bands.

For instance, Before the Dawn's creator Toumas Saukkonen described Before the Dawn's music as ""melancholic Scandinavian metal."" That's an oddly specific way to describe one's music, but I think he was just saying that was the ""style"" he aims for. Before the Dawn is - at its core - death metal, or melodic death metal if you want to be more specific.  In the case of Demon Hunter, they kind of dabble in various areas of metal, at least based on what I've listened to. But I would say they're metalcore more than anything. I do see Metalcore as a very defining fusion genre (it's essentially metal and hardcore punk combined). I'm not personally a fan of Demon Hunter, but I do respect their work.

killingfloor,3bympr,squidthesid,9,Fri Jul 3 05:48:30 2015 UTC,"Body of the (Sponsored) Interview:   It seems that whenever you might be beginning to wonder if we've reached peak zombie in games, another undead army comes lurching out of the shadows. The latest can be found in Killing Floor 2, Tripwire Interactive's sequel to its multi-million selling co-operative survival horror FPS. Set in continental Europe after an undead apocalypse, it takes the basics of Killing Floor and turns everything up to the maximum to create a compelling and graphically intense slice of gore-filled action, in which you and your teammates battle against waves of increasingly brutal Zeds. It's available now on Steam Early Access; we caught up with Tripwire vice president, Alan Wilson, and art director David Hensley, to find out more.  For those who've just joined us, can you give us a quick intro to Killing Floor 2?  David Hensley: Killing Floor 2's a six-player co-op survival horror game with an emphasis on realistic gunplay, visceral combat, extreme gore. The gameplay's arena-based and it's random every time you play it; the way the spawning works. So even though there are only a few maps, the game's got an immense amount of replayability. You also have persistent stats, so the game tracks your progress and you can level up and unlock skills. It's really about surviving against horrible monsters with your friends, and really cool environments.  It feels like a massive refinement of the original; was that your aim?  DH: Our original vision for Killing Floor 2 was not to reinvent the wheel, it was to take the really fun core concept of KF1 and fully realise it as much as we could. We didn't want it to just be Killing Floor with better graphics; we wanted to improve on a few key features. The perks system has been heavily expanded, so now you have more levels, you can unlock skills... The AI itself we've focused on a lot; as you ramp up the difficulties in KF2, the AI has new attacks and new behaviours. In KF1 we just scaled their health and speed and stuff like that, so we wanted it to be a different experience on each difficulty. But yeah, that was the core idea: take what worked with KF1, don't mess with it, get it really polished and add a few new cool things that really make it work to go into the sequel.  Alan Wilson: Someone asked me recently what we decided to change about KF1, and the start point wasn't about what should we change, it was actually that we sat down and thought, what are we not going to change; how do we define that core that is KF1 that's so simple yet so fun and so addictive. That was a big piece of it this time around; we've done sequels before and you learn lessons as you go. This is about thinking about, what are the things that we have to preserve, and then, as Dave said, then it's about, okay, if we preserve that, what can we now layer on top of that base? So yes, it's take the original game, take the pieces that we think really attract people, and then it's about refinement, it's about adding new twists and new tweaks that fit with that core base.  What have you done to improve the online experience?  DH: KF1 was kind of difficult to find a server with the old server browser, so we've included a party system where you can invite your friends to the party and search for games together. It makes finding an online game to play a lot easier. So while that doesn't really mess with the gameplay it's something new that we've added that just makes the overall experience a lot better.  Is there any sort of matchmaking going on?  DH: Right now it just throws you in the best server based on the options you picked, but it doesn't take perk level into account. It really just looks at, you have a couple of filters you can search for, it looks at that and then it takes the best ping server. And that's something that over time, through Early Access, we'd like to improve; to match you with better players, players that are more on your playing level.  How do you balance attracting new players with keeping your existing fans happy?  DH: That's a tricky one. I think all the updated graphics and animation went a long way to attracting new players. And the new gore system. I think not changing the core of Killing Floor is how we kept the original players.  AW: And that part of it as well, about keeping those core players, it's interesting that in the ramp-up to this, once we announced last year, that core player base – you know, we sold quite a few million units – they were all huge evangelists for the game, and that made a very big difference. Those millions of people started talking about it on Reddit and 4chan and anywhere else, about, ""Oh God, KF2's coming,"" and lots of people who still hadn't heard of Killing Floor 1 are going, what's that, why should I care? And a lot of the fans were telling them, this is a game I've played for the last five years, from a developer we love who gives us lots of free stuff; you should take notice. And so people did, which is very gratifying.  You've been on Steam Early Access for just over two months; have you been getting lots of feedback from players?  DH: We've been getting insane amounts of feedback. Players are really vocal about the perks, and specifically the Berzerker perk, so we're taking a lot of that feedback into our future updates. We're still trying to process all the feedback, because there's so much of it.  AW: There is a point worth making, which is that we were looking for feedback, we hoped we'd get a lot of feedback, and we have got an enormous amount of feedback, and most of it is constructive. Dave's hideous task is planning, how do we actually take that feedback forward, which pieces do we pick out , which do we tweak, how do we do it effectively, because we don't want to get into the thing of, okay, so we'll tweak this number today and if you don't like it we'll change it back to something else tomorrow, because it'll never settle down, and you'll never get a consistent opinion of it that way, so we're trying to do it in bigger pieces, which is challenging.  DH: One thing that I thought was really interesting is the sheer amount of YouTubing and streaming there's been, and there are a lot of feedback videos that are really well articulated on YouTube. The tricky part is that some feedback some fans will like, and then when you change it you piss off other fans, so we need a process to decide what's best for the game, based on what the community wants.  And has the community started making maps and mods yet?  DH: Yes.  AW: Someone did a quick count yesterday; there's already 60 maps released, and you're going, excuse me? We've just got the basics of the editor out there, we haven't even finished the editor, it's fairly staggering.  DH: We don't support code mods yet, but players have decompiled our scripts and they're already making code mods even though we didn't release the code SDK yet. So they're kind of unstoppable.  Rather than use Unreal Engine 4 you're using a modified UE3; what's been modified?  DH: We've done quite a few changes; probably the biggest one is the rendering. Unreal Engine 3 is a forward-rendered engine and it doesn't do dynamic lights that well. We have a deferred renderer and all of our lighting is dynamic. So we really wanted to have all the lights flickering, swinging and destructible lights, and the only way we could do that was get into deferred. The deferred rendering affects the look of the shaders quite a bit too, and that's what helps give KF2 its unique look. We also have the gore system, which is something we've put quite a lot of work into, and we have a persistent blood system, where instead of just decals, which is the way the regular Unreal engine works, we have a blood map that covers the entire level, that you can kind of reveal as you're shooting Zeds and spraying blood everywhere, and it never fades away throughout the whole match. And that's something that's built into the base of the world geometry. It's been our dream since... even in Red Orchestra 1 we wanted blood that never faded away.  AW: It's always been your dream...  DH: We finally figured it out.  Killing Floor 2 uses quite a few NVIDIA GameWorks effects; what sort of results will we see in-game?  DH: One of the ones we shipped is HBAO+, which is this really high quality ambient occlusion. We're really using GameWorks effects to just level up the look of the game; some of them are only available on Ultra setting, so you've got to have some really good hardware to run it, but it really does make the game look a lot better. We've been working with NVIDIA to integrate FleX into the engine, and we haven't shipped that yet; that's something we're in the middle of working on now. The game already looks gory but when we add FleX it's going to take it to a whole other level. If you know about FleX it's all about a unified physics system, for fluids, soft body dynamics, so there's a lot of cool stuff we're doing with that. Actual physical fluid blood, ragdoll intestines... It's really some of the coolest stuff I've ever seen.  Sounds fantastic; so it's been a fruitful relationship with NVIDIA?  DH: Yeah, it's been really great working with NVIDIA, they've actually helped us add FleX to the engine, and they've done quite a bit of work. It's really a collaboration, more than us just using their technology. They actually get really excited to work on the gore; I think artists just love working on gore!"
killingfloor,3bympr,_entropical_,2,Fri Jul 3 05:51:09 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in how the new gore additions will work, but as an AMD user I am weary of how it might perform on my system.  I urge the developers to test these effects on AMD cards and use due diligence to ensure that ~30% or so of their user base isn't going to be shafted. Using money I, and many other AMD users, contributed to KF1/KF2 to develop effects which (potentially!) only work well with Nvidia would be something of a slap to the face.  Again, I could be very wrong and these effects could work wonderfully on both brands, but I would be at least a bit disappointed if not."
killingfloor,3bympr,wraith9699,3,Sun Jul 5 12:56:25 2015 UTC,"That's my biggest concern as well.  I have a hybrid setup at the moment, but I have a feeling that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to configure KF2 to use my nvidia for dedicated physx.  Although most of the physx stuff these days is offloaded to the cpu, I'd expect something like flex to be mostly gpu side."

killingfloor,3bwik4,brucewaynewins,10,Fri Jul 3 06:21:00 2015 UTC,"Welcome back to another fine edition of What We Are Up To. This week I bring news of recent advancements our audio guru has been up to as well as some quality of life improvements that are heading your way with the next content update!   Our Audio Director, Mark Muraski (guru and recent hire who has joined us to level up our team's ability to create and deliver an even better audio experience for our fans!) has been looking under the hood of the game and spending his time in there reworking many items from the ground up!   One of his highest priorities has been to find areas where we can improve performance. During his investigation he has found ways to reduce our CPU load from the audio system which should result in noticeable performance gains from those users who are CPU constrained, particularly dual core CPU users.   Beyond that he has been looking at the general audio balance of the game and making sure sounds are balanced correctly against each other (loud things should be loud compared to other items, etc). This has gone a long way towards improving positional accuracy of where zeds are approaching you from in the world as well as improving the overall audio experience.   But that isn’t all. He’s also been looking at how to improve in-combat sounds and several improvements are heading your way. Impacts on zeds will now play different sounds depending on where you hit them (flesh vs metal)! We also have something planned for the melee lovers who just love to get in nice & close. Melee sounds have been enhanced to make them more visceral. On top of that, the gore sounds have been reworked as well to improve the experience and immersion.   Next I want to talk about some quality of life feature additions/enhancements. As part of the next update we are adding voting to the game. This includes map voting and kick voting. Map voting is fairly self explanatory, players will now be able to choose which map they want to travel to next when their current one ends (if the server has that function enabled). Want to play your favorite map (stock or custom)? Vote for it! We are also implemented client vote kicking. After a player has initiated a vote from the lobby menu, other players will be prompted with a yes or no response (via key prompt).   And to top things off, we would like to get players a better idea of where we are at with the update progress. First I would like to stress somethings:   EVERYTHING on this list is an estimate and is subject to change at any time. Work can go faster, or work can take longer to complete than originally estimated.  This graph does not represent ALL work being done, only work related to this update. Those with less time could be working on future content, taking a vacation, etc.  The graph is based on a daily triage where we look for problem areas and how we can fix them (offload work to others, scope items out of this update, etc).  Building a public release is a fixed (and unfixed) cost as we have to lock down a build, make a shipping build, test, and possibly do it all over again if fixes have to be made. The more of these we do (ie: faster updates) the slower overall content will be delivered.  This graph does not include QA time after the update is “complete” to verify that all features are working and no bugs to existing systems have been introduced (and an attempt to find any bugs with new systems and get them fixed).  Below you will find a graph of the devs working on items for the Incinerate ‘N Detonate update. On the bottom you will find the position and on the left hand side you will find the dev days of work left:   http://tripwireinteractive.com/media/2650/Dev-Days.png"

killingfloor,3boxzd,nakedlarissa,2,Thu Jul 2 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling damaging the zed triggers this function. SetEnemy()'s only purpose is to decide the following question: ""Do I want to change targets to this new target?""  As far as what exactly executes this function... I'd have to take a look. I'll definitely update the document when I look tomorrow and make a new response when I do.  Also, the command stuff is what the AI has in its buffer. So it seems to boil down to ""if my AI wants me to do a melee attack command, don't allow me to change targets"".  Hopefully this helps!

killingfloor,3bo251,PlatinumDaikenki,2,Tue Jun 30 23:12:34 2015 UTC,I mean if you really think about it with an empty reload you would just toss the clip where as tactical reloads you have to put it in a pocket or somewhere on you for later use so if anything it's realistic.

The varmint rifle reload, for example, takes longer than it should because whoever designed it thinks you have to pull the charging handle every time.  Either they didn't realize it, or they did and just decided to keep it in to artificially lengthen the reload time.  Either way:  not realistic and it slows down the player.  Besides, when has Killing Floor EVER been about realism?  KF1 was a game where you could run super fast and kite fleshpounds around while shooting them in the head with a crossbow.

Also, haven't recorded the fleshpound kill but it's very simple. Just have 2 zerk m2 the fleshpound. One aims for the chest and the other aims for the legs. This will keep him from attacking a bit since he gets flinched from one and stumbled from the other. It should be noted that whether alone or in group, you should try to block or parry after 2 or 3 hits as well for survivability.  And to address your other questions - scrakes rage at 50%/75%/75%/90% on Normal/Hard/Sui/HoE; fleshpounds have a 10s rage duration if they don't swing at things; and fleshpounds rage if they haven't tried to hit anything in 10s, regardless of LoS."

killingfloor,3bn7ty,jewboselecta,30,Tue Jun 30 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"From the amazing spreadsheet /u/cat_is_fine_too has put together:   Penetration - Weapons has Penetration Power and ZEDs has Penetration Resistance.  If weapon has Penetration Power its bullet or projectile can pass through ZED as long as Penetration Power is greater than ZED's Penetration Resistance. Once passed through ZED, Penetration Power of the weapon will be reduced by amount of ZED's Penetration Resistance. As long as it greater than Penetration Resistance of each next ZED it will continue to penetrate. Support's passive skill adds 0.25 (or 25%) to the weapon's Penetration Power per level.  With each penetration damage get reduced by percentage of Penertation Power left compare to its base value. For example - Shotgun (Penetration Power - 2) penetrate the Clot (Penetration Resistance - 1). Penetration Power that remains is 2-1 = 1. Damage that will be done to the next Clot is 1 / 2 = 0.5 or 50% of the initial weapon damage. This means that Support's passive skill not just increase amout of bodies he can penetrate but also decrease damage reduction on the each next penetration kill."

Same problem here when its 80 degrees outside it'll shut off my machine if I play too long.  The entire game runs hot and nobody knows why.  I mean hotter than games that are even more demanding do.  Just today I was testing on my 660 with GPUZ and Afterburner forced to 74% fan speed (max) and GPUZ reported a high of 97C.  Mind you from the 600 Series on up you are limited to 98C, not 105C.  Either way for an UE3 engine game it shouldn't be running that hot.  Everything tells me this is unoptimized code causing it since in 15 years it's the first I've ever seen this myself.  Unfortunately, the developers have not responded to any complaints acknowledging or dismissing them on their end for 2 months.  Last thing I want to do personally is upgrade unnecessarily or be limited to only playing in the Fall/Winter months."

You could cook on it while playing some games.  Using an ASUS GTX 970 now (even clocked at 1500) but these cards run way cooler. I get around 50c on 50% fan speed which sounds exactly the same as 0% (fans turned off completely)"

killingfloor,3bmzww,Supports4life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:59:38 2015 UTC,What's your temp after you play a game? Or during the game? You can use MSI Afterburner or some other software to overlay the temps on the screen while you play. This can help you tweak your clock speed and set fan speeds as well. Worth looking into since you're getting BSODs while in game which isn't good.
killingfloor,3bmzww,NightmareP69,3,Tue Jun 30 19:08:07 2015 UTC,Try downloading something like MSI afterburner and switch the fan from automatic to manual and increase your fan speed to something high. (Somewhere around 70-80%)
killingfloor,3bmzww,Misoru,2,Tue Jun 30 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"Go download something like furmark, set it to run on a heavy pattern and monitor your GPU temps (with something like MSI afterburner, with that you cna also monitor fan speeds) and see if that causes a BSOD.   If that doesn't cause BSOD then its something else, also a BSOD indicates a more fundamental problem, the Kepler architecture that card runs on automatically throttles if your GPU gets too hot anyway."
killingfloor,3bmzww,Anonymous_freeloader,2,Tue Jun 30 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"My 760 GTX is running at 80-83 C while playing and it never BSOD'd.  Your card's temperatures are actually very,very low. I'm not sure how you even managed to achieve such a temperature. So, i really doubt your BSOD problem is related to your GPU's temps.  Regular reference GPUs are designed to usually run around 80c when playing demanding games, only time it might get dangerous is when you start hitting the 90-95 C maximum temperature recommended limit (depends on the GPU)."
killingfloor,3bmzww,Nbaysingar,2,Wed Jul 1 09:54:21 2015 UTC,"Turn your cards clock down, you're pushing it too hard, which will degrade its life (you've already damaged it if it's BSOD'ing). Look up guides on overclocking to learn how to change your cards clock speed and voltage, if you don't already know how. These guides will tell you to increase your clock speed and voltage, but you should do the opposite (""underclocking"" would be the correct term, I guess). This will decrease your performance, but your card shouldn't get as hot or BSOD."
killingfloor,3bmzww,Akronis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"That's not something you can do with the 600 Series cards.  Boost 1.0 limits you to power and scales the frequency regardless of how low you set it.  So putting a -500Mhz would literally do nothing.  I've tested this myself having this issue from Day 1 on my 660 and it'll just scale it back up.  Even changing the power draw from 100% to 50% will do nothing.  Very glitchy.  For those that haven't been following the overheating issue is common across a whole range of cards from Nvidia/AMD.  Mostly what I've seen are from the 600 Series and below and the HD 7000 and below.  Don't expect much help OP.  Not even the Devs have commented about this multiple times on their own forums.  I'd probably look into a new card like I am, else be limited to playing the game for 6 months out of the year."
killingfloor,3bmzww,Nbaysingar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"Does your card use a blower style cooler, or an open air cooler? Blower coolers are intended for cramped areas, while open air coolers work best when the card has room to breath. Naturally, having enough cool air coming in to your case is essential. It's possible your card is suffocating from lack of proper airflow, or it needs to be cleaned thoroughly due to dust buildup."
killingfloor,3bmzww,ZeldenGM,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:54 2015 UTC,I doubt it is dust. It has been doing this since I built it. All of my other components hang at around 40 degrees in game.

killingfloor,3bmzww,bellator_custodiam,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd say try and have a program record your temps and monitor it as you play to see what temps you're getting. If they aren't abnormal then it could be driver related. Also, did you happen to over clock with an unlocked version of MSI Afterburner? That has been known to cause issues like yours. In fact, I had a pretty similar problem with my old HD6950 because I OCd it with Afterburner unlocked. It stopped as soon as I set the speeds and voltage back to stock."

killingfloor,3bl10r,LeungGaHo,7,Tue Jun 30 02:13:23 2015 UTC,"I can't claim my understanding is the law of the land, but I can claim it's close. Get ready for a long read haha  It's important to note that, when it comes to game theory and dominant strategy, the M14 is completely out-shined by a full pistol loadout (my prefered pistol loadout is Handcannon, MK23 and Dual Magnums). Being 8 weight blocks, it essentially trades having 3 pistols worth of ammo and clip size plus all their penetration capabilities for a lower base damage but higher headshot multiplier.  Handcannon -> M14 is as follows:   Damage Range: 95 - 115 -> 75 - 80 Headshot Multiplier: 1.1x -> 2.25x   This can be worth your time if you're quick to land headshots but, otherwise, you might just want to stick to spamming pistols.  If you want to improve using the weapon, all you can really do is practice in-game. On Hell on Earth, zeds move much more fast than the lower difficulties, so ""training"" on a lower difficulty can be detrimental if you get into habits when it comes to tracking a target. Although I made a test map called SteamyTestMap, which I recommend if you want to practice combos, I don't recommend using it to get good when it comes to the M14. SteamyTestMap was intended as a means to improvise, discover and optimize zed-specific combos (primarily Fleshpound and Scrake combos).  If you want to know what sort of habits you need to get used to, I'd recommend removing reliance on aiming down sights (ADS) as much as possible. You can use it to recenter your aim, but the laser pointer can be used to do this effectively as well. If you can put to muscle memory where the center of your screen is, and refocus it once and a while with the laser pointer and weapon sight, you'll be able to spend more time assessing and prioritizing threats that are coming towards you and spend less time tunnel-visioned through your sights. A lot of people still use ADS in the HoE community so this isn't mandatory, but it's very useful.  After that, figuring out head hitboxes is your next step. KF1 uses an interesting system (at best) when it comes to hitboxes. To learn specific zed hitboxes and practice shooting them, SteamyTestMap has a feature to display head hitboxes (they follow KF1's hitbox system so, even if it looks weird, it's actually where the head hitbox it is). Once you get a feel for them, I recommend turning hitboxes on and off and practice with both, to get a good feel for what the game will be like without the large spheres giving it away.  After that it's combos and threat assessment. Combos can be really simple with the LAR/Musket and M14 when it comes to Scrakes. Mixing it up is fun - I like to stun the scrake with the LAR/Musket and follow through with M14 headshots until dead. Fleshpound combos with the M14 is just practicing nailing headshots will it plays its rage animation (which is not as easy as it sounds). If you don't feel comfortable with that - use the Musket. It's 5 headshots on 6-player Hell on Earth, so it's much easier.  Threat assessment can't be taught, as it simply requires experience and time. Prioritizing what needs to be killed first changes between scenarios and someone who claims to have the end-all list either has a list several volumes long with thousands of exceptions or is just lying to you. It is completely situational and is effected by a lot of different things. Over time you should be able to naturally do this, I don't think anyone has much trouble with this. Just don't panic!"
killingfloor,3bl10r,SkellSkell,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:39:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, i understand that feeling that the pistols just feel superior (or at least easier to use) to the EBR. I think i found your testmap on the workshop. Ill definitely give it a try."
killingfloor,3bl10r,SkellSkell,2,Tue Jun 30 12:40:18 2015 UTC,It's important that you practice on a dedicated server as hitboxes change between solo and dedicated (and even listen but it sucks even more than the other two). The only public server with it I can recommend is a friend of mine's. You can find it at 24.24.254.5:7713  Enjoy!
killingfloor,3bl10r,xFleury,3,Tue Jun 30 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"The M14 EBR has a laser-sight pointer that isn't turned on by default; with my keybinding, ""v"" toggles it. Not sure what the default is anymore.  Apart from that, keep in mind that KF1 has wonky headshot collision detection; you sometimes have to aim a little off to score a headshot, there's some articles about it on KF1 wiki, and it also seems to vary by the models used (christmas / halloween / etc).  The M14 EBR is an incredibly powerful and efficient weapon, insofar as you can consistently get headshots."

killingfloor,3bl10r,i_upboat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:27:32 2015 UTC,"The M14EBR is a terrible gun, and that's precisely why I've been using it for the last few months.  If you're comfortable with nailing headshots on trash zeds, the only things you really need to practice are headshots for the Scrakes and Fleshpounds, 7 and 10 respectively on 6man HoE (because if you can do it on HoE, you can do it on every other difficulty). Also on 6man HoE, Sirens and Husks need 2 headshots to decap. If it's 5man and below, only 1 hs is needed.  My loadout usually consists of a secondary LAR or musket specifically for stunning Scrakes or for when I get lazy, like for clearing crawlers.    Aside from that, it's mostly about enemy prioritization because in testmap you can practice one or two fps at a time, but in-game you need to see what surrounds the fps and what will reach you first. It's also going to depend on your team/if they know to clear trash and leave that fp for you.  Public games are a gamble after wave 4, but it is possible to solo with EBR/LAR or musket.

(As I heard)Medium game is balanced by the dev because they test the game on medium. Short and Long games however is just copied from KF1 and the zeds spawned is very very different.  The difficulty (not number of zeds) gap between HOE medium to HOE long is almost the same between suicidal and HOE. For one, in long game you have double or even triple amount of scrakes. And scrakes almost always spawn together with FPs. In HOE long games scrake is literally spawning once every 10 seconds in a 6-man game. And it is a lot more likely to spawn double sirens or bullshit spawns like siren husk bloats with scrake/FPs. (and you can study the google doc. to know that's because there's a lot more possible squads contain scrakes and the squad contain FP also contain a scrake in long games)  If only consider dosh, short is hardest because you need to find quite a few weapons on HOE PER WAVE to fund T3 on wave 3 (for scrakes) and T4 on wave 4 (for FPs). Otherwise, you either fight scrakes with T2 (so its possible to get T4 last wave) or you fight FP with T3 (because no way you can get 1100+1500+ammo without massive number of weapon found on the map).   The dosh system is broken IMO, both late joiners and short/medium game dosh need to be increased."

killingfloor,3bngtb,KFG-JedIMart,33,Tue Jun 30 17:04:45 2015 UTC,KFG did not distribute any prizes in their last tournament - consider this a warning.
killingfloor,3bngtb,qqnowqq,7,Tue Jun 30 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"you mean they didnt have any, or they didnt distribute them to the winners"
killingfloor,3bngtb,figoravn,23,Tue Jun 30 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"They refused to distribute. Massive Log & Proof.  tl;dr - their system for winning wasn't ranked-based and skill-based, instead luck-based. So come finals day, a team won and was declared. But the morning after, organizers thought they were cheating and refused to give them their prizes and entry fee back (latter was given back after some heavy pressure on the TW forums).   It was largely proven that they did not hack and the referees were just very inexperienced shouting 'aimbot' and 'damage hacks'. (Damage hacks are impossible with how KF1 calculates it - it's all server-sided) But they decided to withhold their prizes and simply ban who they didn't like. They've even included this in their current ruleset - ""H2. KFG reserve the right to refuse entry to any clan/team or player, for whatever reason they see fit. In addition KFG reserve the right to remove any clan/team or player, for whatever reason, from competing in any event organised by KFG.""  It's very surprising that TW would sponsor these people again after such shady behavior and terrible PR. If KFG2 could be summed up in one phrase - ""guilty even if proven innoncent""."
killingfloor,3bngtb,qqnowqq,14,Tue Jun 30 19:41:01 2015 UTC,I had no idea about any of this. Thanks for pointing this out - I'm curious as to what Jedi Mart has to say about it.

killingfloor,3bngtb,Xhu,2,Tue Jun 30 19:51:02 2015 UTC,I just read through all of that thread. It's... pretty damning. Especially the posts by KFG's staff themselves.  A shame. I was genuinely tempted to enter.
killingfloor,3bngtb,qqnowqq,2,Fri Jul 3 20:41:30 2015 UTC,"They might be better now. But the overall premise is still the same - entirely RNG for getting a good map, and then more RNG with getting a good spawn rate. The most skilled team may not win this type of tournament. It's just 'Test Your Luck'."
killingfloor,3bngtb,Xhu,3,Fri Jul 3 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"Though I can see those being a problem to players, KF really isn't really an ""in it to win it"" type of deal to me. I'd mostly enter for a good time, and so am much more concerned with the attitudes displayed by the two staff posters in that thread. It really does seem as though they soured the whole thing. No good time there.  I'd certainly be interested if the admins had indicated they were part of the community, instead of drawing battle lines against it (""we won't back down"" was my favourite example) and digging in their heels. I don't hold much hope for their being significantly better beyond paying lip service to the players. Once bitten, twice shy.  (Also, all those jolt-admin-who-knows-everything appeals to authority from Flux kind of rub me the wrong way; I was involved with UT99 anti-cheats too, and it's pretty clear that the KF gameplay video ""evidence"" of cheating is nothing of the sort. Compared to UT, KF is incredibly slow. The pro players he claims to have worked with would have laughed in his face if he called that kind of thing aimbotting. We also had rules that all players had to recall and submit demo files from their tournament games, because spectator view was a crapshoot. Suspiciously absent here.)"
killingfloor,3bngtb,SkellSkell,3,Sat Jul 4 08:25:01 2015 UTC,"Despite being the one who made the thread qqnowqq linked to on an earlier post and all the things that come with the implication of making such a thread, I'll have to defend them against your last point:  TWI did a lot of changes from UT2k4 to KF1 and one of those things is particularly relevant to your point is demos. Short answer is they don't work. Somewhat short answer is they are not very reliable, can corrupt/bug out, and even crash the server that's recording them from time to time. TWI never fixed this because, well, KF1 wasn't ever seen as a game that would use stuff like demos so they had no reason to bother attempting a fix.  Apart from that, I agree. KFG decided to put themselves into an undefensible position and made it clear from the get-go that, even if it would be 100% proven their decision was an incorrect one, they wouldn't reverse it. And for that their integrity has been crumbled."
killingfloor,3bngtb,Xhu,2,Sun Jul 5 01:36:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. My ignorance of KF-specific implementations is showing! Is the instability true for client-side demos as well as server-side? I can't really see why a client-recorded demo would crash the server, but if they negatively affect the playability of the game to any extent, it definitely explains why they aren't used during tournaments."
killingfloor,3bngtb,SkellSkell,2,Sun Jul 5 02:24:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, servers can record demos as well so I thought you were referring to just them. I know for a fact it crashes servers, but I'm not sure about clients. I have a feeling the same is true for them, though. Glad I could clarify that!"

killingfloor,3bkpo3,TheFallible,9,Tue Jun 30 00:38:32 2015 UTC,"I was shocked when I finally found out there is no aim assist on keyboard/mouse   I'm guessing you rarely, if ever, used the mouse/keyboard for a shooter if you think that's surprising. Auto-aim on such a precision-based input system is infuriating. It makes you less accurate. Controllers need it because precision aiming with a stick is absolute pants, due to acceleration issues and general human physiology.  Hell, in my opinion, even auto-aim on controllers can feel terrible. Nothing like trying to make a crucial shot, only to have another enemy wander into your sight line and have the game go ""Oh hey! Another enemy! I know you were already lined up for a shot, but I just KNOW you wanted me to track him now, right?!""   analog stick for movement simply ideal, compared to WASD   I ..what? I mean it's personal preference, I guess.. but.. just no.  For the record, if a game supports a gamepad I'll use it 9/10 times just for comfort.. but not this game, never. On Suicidal/HoE the enemies are way too numerous, way too fast, and your shots/roles are so important that any imprecision can spell not only your death, but that of your entire squad. I wouldn't even be surprised if I started hearing about people being kicked from high difficulty servers for using a controller. (not that I'm saying I'd do that)  The controller should probably have an auto-fill button, yeah, but I can count the number of times I've clicked that button past Hard mode at maybe a handful. You just don't have the cash to spare. The money to patch up a few holes in your armor, or to pick up a grenade or two is probably better spent being given to a teammate to help them jump a weapon tier. Even at 100%, your armor disappears so fast when you get in trouble that it's more likely a well-equipped teammate will be your savior than a few percent of armor. So a dedicated button would be convenient, but it's honestly not going to see much use past a point (might even be a hindrance if you accidentally hit auto-fill and waste money).  The weapon-wheel delay is unfortunate, but it's just going to be an inherent problem with the fact that there just aren't enough buttons on the controller. I don't necessarily agree with the change to do either the wheel or the perk-only-switching. It should have a dual function, I just propose that it should be a Switch-to-Last-Weapon button on tapping (also TW, can we have one of these for the keyboard, pretty please?), and hold for the wheel. That way you set it up before a round so that you have a fast way to swap to another priority weapon in a pinch, and still be able to select whatever else you need when you have a breather."
killingfloor,3bkpo3,v4lor,6,Tue Jun 30 06:48:56 2015 UTC,Not a precision based game? This is one of the most precision based shooters. If you aren't getting headshots most of the time you are massively wasting ammo.
killingfloor,3bkpo3,Anolis_Gaming,2,Tue Jun 30 07:14:38 2015 UTC,"You are right in the movement being more precise with a stick, simply because of the nature of analog movement versus digital movement. If you were to have two players somehow equally good with the two movement systems, the player with the stick would be at an advantage.    However, Killing Floor 2 is incredibly precision based in its shooting. Play some Commando on 6-man HoE. You can get away with sloppy aiming as a Support, but the other classes need that careful aim a lot more if you want to pull your weight.    There's no situations in KF2 where ""gradual aimers"" will be at an advantage."
killingfloor,3bkpo3,jorgamun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"That'd be more true for KF1 but not really for KF2. At this moment the commando deals so much damage he can kill almost everything, save scrakes, with bodyshots. Like...he can one shot bodyshot crawlers with the bullpup.. Aiming is most important for commando now in KF2, but it's not really that important unless you shoot at scrakes."
killingfloor,3bkpo3,qqnowqq,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:08:57 2015 UTC,I don't think aiming being less important in KF2 than KF1 means that aiming is not important in KF2. However I don't really even try to bodyshot ever.
killingfloor,3bkpo3,jorgamun,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"With base damage being so high, aiming carefully is less of an incentive, meaning less important. If you want to do very well, aiming for headshots can be important. However, if you don't try for them, you can still win very easily because they all still die very quickly from bodyshots."

killingfloor,3bgbe1,NobleAvatar,2,Mon Jun 29 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a thing. However, PhysX has this habit of taking up a lot of resources regardless of what card you're using depending on the implementation. For example, I have a 970 and Geforce Experience tells me I really should turn it off for Metro 2033, where I have no problem in Metro Last Light. Batman: Arkham Origins is a similar story, with PhysX giving me massive frame drops when I turn it on. Add in the fact that they have been steadily upgrading the hardware that PhysX uses, and you can probably see why I'm concerned about this cool new form of it perhaps not running well even on what I consider ""High end."" Maybe I should just buy a 750ti as a dedicated PhysX card or something."

killingfloor,3bew0v,Landriff,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:36:18 2015 UTC,Will you by chance know the reason why scrakes sometimes cannot be stumbled (not recently stumbled) during their attacks?
killingfloor,3bgawc,tinktinkdotorg,3,Sun Jun 28 23:40:32 2015 UTC,What graphical setting do you have it set on?  If it's too low then that's probably the issue.  I also recall reading a post from someone that noticed bullet holes weren't forming when shooting a specific direction yet formed when facing another direction.  Sound similar?
killingfloor,3bgawc,Kuebic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:33:10 2015 UTC,"I think most everything is on Ultra and not sure about the direction thing, I'll have to try it. I just remember one particular instance I was looking at a table, shot it, only 2 bullet holes appeared, a new round started, the 2 bullet decals went away and I couldn't add anymore holes."
killingfloor,3bgawc,Kuebic,2,Mon Jun 29 06:48:18 2015 UTC,"I went looking for that post, and realized I recalled their issue incorrectly.  But I remember in KF1 a similar issue where the direction faced created a different shooting experience, I believe it was with dual pistols.  And it was essentially a faulty vector equation which took a while for TWI to fix.  But I don't believe that's the case for you...  The only other thing I can think of is searching through you .ini files and see if something is set incorrectly, such as in KFGame.ini the decal timer is zeroed out (I'm at work so can't remember actual variable... gotta ctrl+f that)."
killingfloor,3bgawc,Pickselated,2,Mon Jun 29 13:54:35 2015 UTC,TIL what a bullet decal was. I always thought it was like a logo on the bullet...

killingfloor,3bddzg,CLDBL00DED,16,Sun Jun 28 04:00:14 2015 UTC,"I had seen people complain about the teleporting in the past and had only seen it happen when intended (when stuff was well out of sight), but damn, lately it has been ugly. I figure either the server is laggy or the teleporting is just STUPID. Pretty sure I got killed by Hans because he just popped in and nailed me, because I was looking around frantically and saw nothing until I died.  Teleporting just needs to be completely disabled unless an NPC is determined to be stuck in an area. I understand that in KF1 it was made easy to kite enemies because they basically just followed the player, but how about instead of teleporting them, impletement a better path finding system or maybe put a timer on teleporting so that it doesn't happen so suddenly."
killingfloor,3bddzg,dumb_jellyfish,7,Sun Jun 28 04:27:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the same kind of teleport (the game mechanic kind). This just looks like the Scrake got ""pushed"" through the door and glitched by something."
killingfloor,3bddzg,Kvasir94,5,Sun Jun 28 04:36:51 2015 UTC,"Regardless if this is an extremely rare case where a scrake needs to spawn, everyone looks away from a spawn spot, and it ends up spawning inside the room because there is barely enough proximity LOS or something...teleporting and spawning like this needs to not be in the game.  But that being said, I highly doubt TW will do what's necessary to remove teleporting entirely as it doesnt seem like the zeds were designed to beat kiting."
killingfloor,3bddzg,itonlygetsworse,2,Sun Jun 28 07:56:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen it happen a few times where a zed will stumble into a wall, after a grenade or the like hit them, and get teleported out of the wall. Very possible something similar to that happened here."
killingfloor,3bddzg,StoringStories,5,Sun Jun 28 06:57:36 2015 UTC,"I've found that if there's a window into another room and I'm picking zeds off as they head in our direction, I can frequently watch zeds teleporting right into my vision.

killingfloor,3bddzg,BlunTman805,5,Sun Jun 28 10:27:45 2015 UTC,"The teleporting thing is worse with Bloats it seems.  Two zeds left at wave end and one is always a teleporting Bloat. Do they teleport when stuck, or just when you get too far away?  Because Bloats have the tendency to do both when in a pack of trash.  Not loving the teleporting Zeds thing.  Should be made into a Crawlers & Stalkers only ability, kind of makes sense for them but not the big guys."

killingfloor,3bddzg,AsiaDerp,4,Sun Jun 28 13:22:51 2015 UTC,So is there any reason to Weld doors this time aside from killing people?  The only use it seems to have after all the changes/nerfs to it between KF1 and KF2 is it seems to force the mobs to spawn closer and  faster.
killingfloor,3bddzg,Fatdap,2,Sun Jun 28 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"This is 100%, thoroughly unfair. It's a cheat to use against players for the singular purpose of undoing wave control.

killingfloor,3bddzg,Kuebic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not that bad, actually. It doesn't run as smooth as in the video and game sometimes freezes, but it's usually when I play the map for the first time during the game session."

killingfloor,3bdr7t,Slashermovies,5,Sun Jun 28 23:04:21 2015 UTC,I think it's something wrong with your drivers or your setup. I also have a GTX 660 and can run a constant 60-90 frames on 1920x1080 High. I only get 45 FPS if I crank it to Ultra.
killingfloor,3bdr7t,kdpha,3,Sun Jun 28 08:19:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a GTX 660 on High myself and it tanks performance from 60-70FPS consistently to 30-40FPS when the flamethrower is kicking.  Sometimes lower depending on how long the person is holding it down, how close I am to them, or whether I'm using it.  Every time I've seen someone use the flamethrower it turns into a gigantic lag/framerate drop fest for everyone on the servers I've been on.  To put it in perspective that something is wrong on its end.  I've been in 40-50 man games that didn't lag or drop frames even remotely close to a single person on a 2 man server will."
killingfloor,3bdr7t,Anonymous_freeloader,0,Sun Jun 28 21:39:00 2015 UTC,I'm not saying I'm getting constant fps drops. The majority of the time I get a solid 60 fps (apart from some moments where I shine a flashlight on a cluster of zeds).  I'm talking about something specific here: the flame's FX.
killingfloor,3bdr7t,zkid10,0,Sun Jun 28 08:36:07 2015 UTC,"Really? I get a constant 60 with my HD7870, and they're pretty much equivalent. Try turning off the real-time reflections."

Faster fire rate, slightly lower damage/penetration than the crovel, and maybe make switching to it take half the time, as an added perk. I think it just fits the intended theme of a get-in-there-and-wreak-havoc berserker character."
killingfloor,3bejyi,GoodApolloIV,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"Weapons switching is slower than KF1 and zeds are faster. Switching weapons all the time dont seems to be worth/viable anymore. You take a lot of unnecessary damage if you keep switching weapons.   So yeah, what's happening now is zerks are going ARs. AK/medic AR late waves. Pulv only for sirens (if main gun out of ammo and teammates are distracted by something else) and FPs. Going melee with the current setting is just doubling the woekload of your medic nad that is very bad on HOE. You want everyone to get heal as soon as they take damage. Not after some random zerker who keep getting hit."
killingfloor,3bejyi,AsiaDerp,6,Sun Jun 28 14:43:17 2015 UTC,"It's faster to just drop your weapon in front of you to weapon switch than actually weapon switch. Eliminates half the time since the weapon pull down animation isn't happening, haha."

killingfloor,3bejyi,AsiaDerp,3,Mon Jun 29 02:38:40 2015 UTC,"It's really not that much of an issue and hardly gets in the way unlike actually trying to switch weapons normally. If you have 3 weapons you'd just drop both to get to the one you want. It's extremely easy. And why are you getting pushed back by a fleshpound? Why are you dropping weapons if you might be getting pushed back? If you're getting pushed out and forced to kite, you've essentially lost anyway. But yeah, just use common sense when to drop weapons. And really, it's so fast to get your weapon back that there shouldn't ever be an issue of you leaving it behind. With all that said, TW should just make weapon switching like KF1. It worked well there and didn't need us to use workarounds to play more efficiently."
killingfloor,3bejyi,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:45:21 2015 UTC,uhhh the welding tool and the pistol don't weigh anything?
killingfloor,3bdgsb,geezerforhire,32,Sun Jun 28 04:30:35 2015 UTC,They won.t. Basically either sharp shooters will feel powerful or they won't. Either they will be able to kill scrakes and FPs from a distance or they will be subpar commando trash clearers.
killingfloor,3bdgsb,itonlygetsworse,5,Sun Jun 28 07:57:59 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm thinking.  I thought it was a dumb design in kf1 and I was happy to see that scrakes weren't irrelevant anymore.  I hope they do something interesting beyond just being ""best headshotter"", like maybe their weaponry has some unique perks.  I could imagine a bolt action rifle that has no magazine and requires a new round to be dropped in after every shot - with a fast animation, basically giving you a low ROF weapon with effectively no reloads.  That's not the coolest thing in the world, but I think they need niche things like that."
killingfloor,3bdgsb,Supastarpowa,3,Sun Jun 28 08:35:12 2015 UTC,"So similar in function to the M99 from KF1, except less stupid expensive and less damaging? I can get behind that."

They could also make it so that shooting the metal mask deals reduced damage to the head, which would keep happening until you break the mask itself."
killingfloor,3bdgsb,DrMostlySane,9,Sun Jun 28 05:01:18 2015 UTC,the mask idea would be cool. could have a commando or someone break the mask then have the SS take it out. would keep some coordination.  Something else i thought of would scrakes on higher difficulties covering there heads while they walk with their arms. so to get head shots you would have to engage it in combat first.
killingfloor,3bdgsb,Pybro5ever,3,Sun Jun 28 05:17:40 2015 UTC,"There was a mod for a specimen in the first game that did that (held its arm in front of its face), and it was a pain in every Sharpshooter's ass, which is a good thing because it encouraged more coordination.

killingfloor,3bdgsb,skivian,2,Sun Jun 28 06:47:46 2015 UTC,Im more concerned about high level play. with proper strategy and coordination HOE can be completed quite smoothly. If massive coordination is no longer required to kill scrakes than it will be MUCH easier.
killingfloor,3bdgsb,Kitsunin,5,Sun Jun 28 07:06:26 2015 UTC,"once incinerate and detonate drops, they're going to have to up the sheer number of monsters by quite a bit, otherwise Scrakes will literally be the only real threat to a decent team."
killingfloor,3bdgsb,MekaTriK,8,Sun Jun 28 07:09:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's going to be extra super duper horrible when you consider that Scrakes only take 50% explosive damage. If they don't rebalance things I expect to see 100% of threat come from Scrakes while every other mob is utterly useless.  Dunno why, but I hate the way zeds are balanced in KF2 compared to KF1. The Scrakes fit in well there, they were a major threat but could still be managed without too much difficulty if you weren't getting overrun. All the other zeds were similarly scary. In KF2 the Fleshpound isn't too hard to kill/avoid and every other zed can't do much more than tickle you. Meanwhile the Scrake is just constantly rekking everyone because you can't kill it before it gets close, and once it's close the only thing to do is abuse its AI."

killingfloor,3bdgsb,Kuebic,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:29:52 2015 UTC,I think we'll get buffs to some of the trash. Maybe sirens could reduce damage taken by surrounding zeds. Cysts/clots could get a slight movement/HP buff that keeps them in 1 hit headshot range but only high tier weapons can 1 hit body shot. Just small changes that make scrakes less of the sore thumb. It's really one of the only problems with the game. Make the scrakes have better compatriots and suddenly the game has a more balanced level progression.
killingfloor,3bdgsb,Smowy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:10:08 2015 UTC,"IMO, someone with very good aim should be able to make bigger zeds easy. What should be done is things to make aim harder, like zeds dodging around at the sight of a sharpshooter or special spawns that puts annoying trash on a sharpshooter while a larger one spawns. If you can work together to give the sharpshooter space and the sharpshooter can still hit a head of someone juking down a street then they should be rewarded for that."

killingfloor,3bdgsb,textbooksforrent,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:55:02 2015 UTC,"I'd hope that most sharpshooter weapons (or maybe all) will NOT be able to one shot kill a scrake.  I agree that it would make things too easy.  2 shots with tier 3/4 weapon would make sense to me - so some co ordination makes things easier.  They'll be balanced by their limited ammo - in kf1 the crossbow had 40 bolts if I remember correctly, so theres not much scope for trash clearing if you can only take out 40 zeds, which on higher difficulties isn't much."

killingfloor,3bf8pw,Cao_Cao_Mengde,2,Sun Jun 28 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"""really soon"" is a relative term. Seeing how they still have 3 more weapons to finalize for the two new perks and they haven't even mentioned what changes they have made to the Berserker skill tree, I would guess (on the safe side) that the Incinerate 'N Detonate patch won't be out for at least 4 more weeks. Which isn't a bad thing. So far, TWI has been QA'ing the updates very well. Hopefully, when it does come out, there will be very few bugs.  So, I wouldn't get too excited about the patch coming ""really soon."" We all have about a month or so before it will actually come. It would be nice if TWI actually commented on a date. It doesn't have to be an exact date, just a rough estimate. They have to have some idea of when they are going to release it. They can give themselves a really large buffer as well. If they think they could possibly push it out in 6 weeks, tell us 10 weeks to be on the safe side. But, TWI seems to play their cards very close to the vest."
killingfloor,3bf8pw,Kuebic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:46:13 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you.  Seeing how TWI usually work, i wasn't expecting anything this week or anything (would be nice though).  But given how those perks are actually talked about makes them ""sooner"" than the perks mentioned afterwards.  I believe TWI just got tired of the community idiots' backlash whenever their KF1 event or RO2 update date was off by a few days and thus stopped giving a guestimation all together.  I'd say just give a date really far in the future and release the features earlier.  Netflix did that recently and got praised for it lol"

killingfloor,3bbybj,Alzorath,2,Sat Jun 27 22:51:20 2015 UTC,I was about to say the same thing.  They have issues equalizing sounds and there's a lot of frequencies that clash and muffle each other.

killingfloor,3bapjm,Pickselated,3,Sat Jun 27 13:33:15 2015 UTC,You need to adjust your monitor brightness (white level) and gamma. You can look up color profiles for your monitor and apply them.

killingfloor,3b8uic,Tyrfaust,40,Fri Jun 26 22:25:34 2015 UTC,as I'm sure many of you are aware   I lol'd. It isn't common to run into people who know a lot about guns. Let alone people who know a lot about world war 2 era weaponry. Judging by the backlash of people thinking it makes sense to aim down the sights of a pistol grip 12 gauge shotgun I'm not confident you're going to get much support for your question.
killingfloor,3b8uic,Ryshek,6,Fri Jun 26 22:52:11 2015 UTC,"Aiming doing the sights on any weapon makes sense, even a blunderbuss. The whole ""point aiming"" thing doesn't really work that well, that's part of why the doctrine was abandoned in the '70s for anything except extreme close ranges.  Edit: Also, Winchester 1897. It predates World War 2 by nearly 50 years, though it did see action in the Pacific, the 1897 saw its greatest claim to fame in the trenches of France, however."
killingfloor,3b8uic,Ryshek,0,Sat Jun 27 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"Aiming doing the sights on any weapon makes sense   No, aiming down the sights of a PGO shotgun is a bad idea. You'll find tons of videos on youtube of people bruising their faces finding out what a bad idea it is."
killingfloor,3b8uic,Ryshek,2,Sun Jun 28 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's a bad idea if you're a fucking moron who can't figure out how to hold a firearm. Nearly every video I've seen of somebody getting knocked in the face with a shotgun is practically identical to the morons who get their eye smashed when aiming through a scope."
killingfloor,3b8uic,Man_of_Many_Voices,3,Mon Jun 29 00:31:04 2015 UTC,"The reason you'll find tons of videos of people giving themselves black eyes from aiming down the sights of a PGO shotgun is because you're not supposed to. Just like how you're not supposed to have your eye touching the sight of X high powered rifle.  The sights on shotguns are designed for the user to look down as they make a cheek weld with a stock. With no stock in place to direct the recoil into the shooter's shoulder the only thing that is going to cushion that recoil is going to be the shooter's right hand. By virtue of the fact that the forend in the game doesn't have a either vertical or angled grip the shooter's left hand is going to be mainly combating muzzle rise, not recoil.  So you've got one hand, with a wrist bent at an angle, trying to stop the recoil of a 12 gauge - it doesn't work well. To compound issues in KF2 the shooter isn't holding the shotgun further out from their face to compensate for the lack of a stock, they just use the standard cheek weld animation despite there being no stock in place.  Don't get me wrong, pistol grips are great fun to shoot from the hip, and you can get pretty damned accurate with them with practice, but they aren't guns you want to aim down the sights of. The closest thing i've seen to successfully aiming down the sights of a pistol grip shotgun is using a point shooting technique.  Feel free to find me some people successfully aiming down the sights to prove me wrong though, or better yet film yourself doing it, and make sure to shoot it just like you would as if you were shouldering it 0:  Edit: Don't forget to use double 00 buck!"

killingfloor,3b8uic,Pfheonix,3,Sat Jun 27 22:14:12 2015 UTC,"As someone that doesn't know a whole lot about guns, I'm looking at this from a coding/gaming mechanics perspective.  TWI does do a good job making each weapon feel unique and the ability to slamfire would be a pretty neat feature to implement.  But how would the devs incorporate it into the game?  While LMB is pressed, pressing another button will pump?  It isn't consistent with the rest of the game mechanics as there is no ""pump"" button.  Alt-fire makes the most obvious pump button, but should it require the activation of the fire button beforehand?  It makes controller ports very unfriendly.  One way I can see this being implemented is by holding down the alt-fire or fire and it'll slam successive shots.  But then it'll be interpreted as an automatic and probably get flamed for as I'm sure 95% of players won't know what slam-firing is.  It's a cool idea, but it'll be tough to add officially.  It'll be cool to see a mod for it sometime in the future though :D"
killingfloor,3b8uic,Blittzzo,3,Sat Jun 27 15:24:17 2015 UTC,It could just have an increased regular fire rate for certain perks with the slam firing animation
killingfloor,3b8uic,MekaTriK,2,Sat Jun 27 20:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yeh, that's what I would expect modders to do.  The only quark I have is the ""slam firing animation"" since the player can't see if the trigger is depressed or not, it's essentially the pumping action only it fires at an odd time.  It'll look more like a glitch than intentional and doesn't really give the shotgun anything special except increased fire-rate."
killingfloor,3b8uic,MrMustangg,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"From an animation perspective, you could have the pump not require a turn out from the sight, and the bounce of the sight is reset as much as it would be by the resealing of the chamber just before the next round is fired."
killingfloor,3b8uic,pickelsurprise,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:01:10 2015 UTC,"Mechanically, I'd imagine it'd be along the lines of ""hold LMB"" and you enjoy a higher ROF at the cost of practically no time to adjust for recoil.

killingfloor,3b8uic,shikamaruispwn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:35:03 2015 UTC,That would really cool. Tripwire has also been very particular with their guns so maybe the gun has an option to do this.

killingfloor,3b9hy9,BeardyDuck,9,Sat Jun 27 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Not using EA as a testbed for content updates feels odd, and it's a valid critique IMO. We should be seeing/testing things BEFORE they get to ""release status"", otherwise you run the risk of going too far down the rabbit hole to turn back without things taking massive amounts of work and effort to undo.   For example, some of the current imbalance/viability between the perks could've theoretically been avoided if we saw what they were going for before they finished it. Now, it will/has taken extra development time because they have to completely revamp things. It's not outside the realm of possibility that the Firebug/Demo could run the similar issues that the Berserker had at launch, simply because we don't know anything about them and therefor unable to voice any potential concerns.  The way EA is used as if it's essentially a Kickstarter project with debatably more accountability (see The Stomping Lands)."

Imagine if they released what they currently have now. People would instantly complain about demolition not having a proper tier 1 weapon, and would also complain about the RPG7 being overpowered/underpowered. This is already the case with the berserker. thankfully now that the weapons for the beserker are in place we can provide better feedback with the knowledge of how a beserker's match progressions (buying weapons is). We also commented on effectiveness of the Combat shotgun because we have other weapons to compare it to.  I know waiting sucks, but I trust in the dev's decision to know when to release content, and when they are able to make changes based on feedback."

No. They're doing exactly what I love them for doing. They're making a full, solid game and calling it early access because it doesn't have all the content they want. This game is early access in name only and that's exactly how it should be. The first game had about this much content when it first released and we should expect nothing more this time around."
killingfloor,3b9hy9,SilkSk1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"You do give valid points and I too wish TWI could move a bit faster.  But I'm taking into account the weeks before and after release they spent just fixing up the game so players can play.  Their original intent was ironing all issues before early access release so players and dev team can focus on content.  Well, as was apparent weeks after release, they had to spend considerable time fixing numerous launch and performance issues regardless.  And after most of them were patched, they released a new map and couple characters and since then attempted to address the numerous complaints from the community, such as berzerker class, parry system, melee/bash, etc.  As they mentioned some time ago, pushing updates are a chore for them so they try clumping as many as possible into one update.   If Tripwire keeps holding back content in order to make it as perfect as it can be, what's the point?   I think the critique they get from content they see as ""perfect"" is much more constructive than content that is far from ready.  ""We know there's this major animation glitch if you do this-and-that and sometimes the gun stops working for some reason, but besides those, what do you think of this new gun?""  The feedback from something like this is pretty goddamn useless.  But that's what some early access games do, release unfinished content that serve no real direction and take forever to get out of early access.  TWI may be taking a fkn long time to release content and ticking off the playerbase, but I think that's better than releasing too many unpolished content and seeing what the community likes.  It's like throwing wet noodles against a wall and seeing what sticks."

What if you kill all zeds in the first 5 seconds? You just sit there for another 16 seconds in slo-mo. It's ridiculously OP. Hell, after 10 seconds you can trigger Zed time again and still have 11 seconds left so it'd be boosted to 32 seconds. You could essentially play the entire game in zed time.

I know  KF2 has changed things up with the medic pistol -> SMG -> Shotgun -> AR thing but there's going to be more weapons in future and I don't see much room for other weapons other than the old medic SMGs.

killingfloor,3b8xul,qqnowqq,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:41:10 2015 UTC,Weapon despawn is exactly five minutes. Just grab some of them before that runs out and you reset it back to five minutes. Should be  sufficient.

killingfloor,3b4o2y,LeaveHeat,23,Thu Jun 25 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"You know, as much as I was against level caps for difficulties when someone previously suggested it, the amount of 0 hour kf players with level 0s turning up on difficulties above normal, shooting at everything in sight, raging everything, just generally fucking up has been intolerable.  In KF1 the odd one appeared every now and then and they normally listened to advice, but not the KF2 ass monkeys. You ask them not to shoot scrakes because rage mechanics, they will flat out insult you for even trying to help.  At this point I'd actually be glad if difficulties had a level requirement on them, not because higher level makes you a better player, but because at least if they're forced to spend x amount of time in normal they'll hopefully have learnt some basics."
killingfloor,3b4o2y,ZeldenGM,4,Fri Jun 26 00:28:07 2015 UTC,I agree. Some sort of level cap would be nice.
killingfloor,3b4o2y,TeaL3af,4,Fri Jun 26 07:21:19 2015 UTC,I think all they really need to do is default the difficulty to Normal the first time you start the game. I think most of the level0's that end up in HoE have no idea they are playing on the hardest setting.

If you're new and end up in a hard server, that's fine. It's not that much more difficult than normal. Enemies are pretty slow and have basic attacks, so it's pretty easy to carry.  I'm not going to be able to teach you how to play when you decide to join a HoE match. 99% of the time they die 5 seconds into wave 1 because they have no idea what they're doing, and instead of leaving they unfortunately choose to stay and fuck everyone over on wave 2 when they die immediately again.

However what I'm saying is that in KF2 I've found that most new players in KF2 that I've encountered have been averse to help/advice and will happily just spam insults at you for trying to offer them any help whatsoever.
killingfloor,3b4o2y,AsiaDerp,9,Fri Jun 26 14:51:22 2015 UTC,In quite a lot of games you need to beat the second hardest difficulty to unlock the highest difficulty. I think this can implement to KF2. HOE should require you to beat suicidal on at least one map to unlock.
killingfloor,3b4o2y,wanderer11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:22:26 2015 UTC,That's a really good idea. You have to beat a map on normal to play it on hard. Except solo you can do whatever you want

killingfloor,3b3biu,okungnyo,4,Thu Jun 25 22:20:04 2015 UTC,If Bethesda waited until the next e3 it wouldn't have been a release announcement though would it?  Edit: I'm dumb I get what you are saying Bethesda did the announment right by not announcing the game long in advance.
killingfloor,3b3biu,danyearight,2,Thu Jun 25 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"Weeelllll......it was kind of announced subtly long before that.  Before even Manor was pushed out the hype was, ""a bigger update on the horizon"" and that's been the excuse as to why there have been no constant bug fix and balancing patches.  E3 made sense, but it does still feel a little prematurely hyped.  Especially when you factor in the vigorous secrecy maintained by TWI since KF2 was announced and the way they know the community in the past has looked too much into things.  Thankfully Steam's Summer Sale has been able to keep most of us busy."

killingfloor,3b3biu,qqnowqq,3,Thu Jun 25 23:09:44 2015 UTC,That's because they have experienced it time and time again. Especially with RO2. They used to announce when updates would be coming. And they missed the mark a couple of times. Then the forums came flooding with tons of complaints just non-stop. It's easy to understand their apprehension after having experienced those days on the forums.
killingfloor,3b3biu,Moskeeto93,3,Fri Jun 26 03:29:48 2015 UTC,They should be. Because missing deadlines as a company is not good.

That's why you double (or triple) an estimate.  You always have a rough idea, like you could say the shotgun would go thru 4 revisions each taking a week. So expected that it would take a month for all revisions. Now this is where you double it or triple it, cause who knows, sick days, other priorities, unexpected bugs, issues, mechanics re-work, ...  Also doesn't need to be an official day, like it could be:   ""We anticipate the next patch to be release in about 2-3 months, as we get closer we can give you a better idea.""  But ultimately its their choice to do however they want to do it. If they wanted to absolutely silent and never ever say anything, just pop out patches, that their choice. But I'm still gonna complain/criticize or at least ask to see why I don't understand."

Before using the fan boy downvote button to express your emotions, consider how long of a lifeapan this game can realistically sustain at the rate of content release? Also, the lack of developer/PR involvement is questionable at most.   I have no involvement or bias towards the Early Access title ARK:Survival Evolved, but THAT is a game doing early access correctly. (With a smaller team)  I was a huge KF1 fan, but since preordering Red Orchestra 2 (the first game I ever refunded on steam) my faith has been slowly going down in this studio. (Same problems then as now, terribly planned early access, minimal involvement with community, game takes well after a year to be ""finished"", incredibly slow content release, etc)"
killingfloor,3b3biu,Kuebic,2,Fri Jun 26 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"I always welcome good discussions, especially over something that doesn't have an actual answer.  You do bring in some good points that I have not bothered to mention, since I was attempting to simplify my feelings and keep the answer around the player numbers rather than going into if TWI is doing early access well, what they can do better, etc. because I feel that's a whole other ballgame.  To me, it seems like TWI is doing what they usually do with all their game releases, early access or not.  And most of their games were deemed dead within a few months.  KF1? Barely left the ground.  RO2?  Disastrous release.  But given a few years, they both have a stable player base.  This time doesn't look any different.  This time around, TWI seemed to have learned a lot from the RO2 disaster which results in them being unusually quiet allowing them to keep focus themselves.  But that doesn't mean they are not taking community input.  The upcoming content update is riddled with features and fixes the community has been crying for since release: completely reworked berzerker class, extra melee animations, additional stumble animation/feedback, new maps, new perks, and new weapons.  The main issue, as you mentioned, is speed (or lack thereof).  The incredibly slow content release and the untimely PR responses appears to be a big factor in the players decline.  When hyping up for early access, I had expected at least 75% of the assets created and all they had to do was work on integrating them into the game, but that doesn't appear to be the case.  They spent a good week in beta fixing the servers memory leak, a good 3 weeks after release fixing many launch and performance issues before finally adding any type of new content.  It seems to me as if they are making deliberate steps to improve their games and add quality content and will eventually get to a game they can be proud of.  They are just more patient than most of us, myself included.  Hearing about how ARK is doing EA is quite exciting to be honest.  Looking at the multiple developers listed, it appears there's one main studio with many small studios located around the world in jolly cooperation.  Hopefully TWI can learn a thing or two from them."

killingfloor,3b3biu,CrowbarSr,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:50:30 2015 UTC,At this rate the game will be completed at the end of next year...
killingfloor,3b3biu,majorscheiskopf,3,Fri Jun 26 02:51:12 2015 UTC,"You bought an early access game. The most well-received early access games have been constantly updating for several years. This is early access- if the game's done by when you say, I wouldn't be surprised if that's early."
killingfloor,3b3sot,SilkSk1,5,Thu Jun 25 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"Scrakes should be able to be quickly killed if you can get an emp nade out to stop them from raging. On hard and normal you can just get away with coordinated team headshots though haha. But yeah, fleshpounds tickle and scrakes...scrakes deal damage haha."
killingfloor,3b3sot,qqnowqq,3,Thu Jun 25 22:58:48 2015 UTC,"When you reach high enough level for HOE servers(around 15 or 20)... you will notice Scrakes can only be killed with headshots. It takes ~60 of AA12 shell to the body with 6 people. Yes, scrakes are the leading cause of deaths and wipes. He can solo your whole team if raged at a bad time.  On the other hand, most people just 3 pulv gank rape FPs which only die in 13 un-perked hits. If 3 player perform a good enough combo, the FP will die before he do damage. Even double FP on last wave will not be much trouble unless you get some ""fuck you spawn"" like 2 more scrakes with sirens. Shooting FPs is a NONO. Dont do it, it takes away too much ammo. Try to have 3 pulvs in the team, and focus on how not to die from scrakes.  So yes, scrakes need a nerf IMO. In medium games their number is still manageable, but in long game you have like 15 scrakes (and I heard that is not intended because dev only test in 7 waves). Every time I play with experienced players, scrake is always the zed that cause a wipe. There are 300+ zeds per wave. We have a dozen kinds of zeds, and scrake is always the killer.  May be they plan ahead very far into the development but scrakes resisting to explosive and have no weakness (hope this is a ""yet"") makes them very unbalanced in the current setting."
killingfloor,3b3sot,AsiaDerp,2,Fri Jun 26 02:51:07 2015 UTC,"So yes, scrakes need a nerf IMO.    I agree with this, but I also think FPs need a buff. If it's not making me soil myself, it's too weak."
killingfloor,3b3sot,AsiaDerp,2,Fri Jun 26 13:59:55 2015 UTC,"FP need a buff on health, they do enough damage for something you cant out run and that tanky. They should be used to force you out of camping but they are failing at this right now because of the weakness.  Scrake on the other hand, is stupidly tanky and dont have a weakness at the moment."
killingfloor,3b3sot,cheesellama_thedevil,2,Fri Jun 26 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on trash, really.  If the remaining zeds in a wave are scrakes, then it's easy, just enrage one at a time, and focus fire, parry, and/or circle-strafe him.  Taking out scrakes is harder when there's things such as clots that might grab you or crawlers that might block your path."
killingfloor,3b3sot,MildlyInterestingFan,4,Fri Jun 26 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"When I first started playing, I felt the same way. However, once you learn to dodge the scrake attacks a bit and learn its vulnerabilities, scrakes die a lot faster than FPs. Try shooting it a few times directly in the head with the double barreled shotgun. Or empty an entire scar magazine on its head, or a few pulverizer M2's.   And of course, if you like to exploit the circle strafing technique, a scrake might just be easier to kill than sirens and husks."
killingfloor,3b3sot,MildlyInterestingFan,4,Thu Jun 25 19:24:25 2015 UTC,"Try shooting it a few times directly in the head with the double barreled shotgun. Or empty an entire scar magazine on its head, or a few pulverizer M2's.   Doesn't seem to be very effective with six players. Might as well be blowing kisses at it. At least FPs have an explosion weakness. By the last wave, I run out of bullets before the thing is dead and my team doesn't fare much better. Sure, concentrated fire takes them down, but when there's three of them at once it gets complicated."
killingfloor,3b3sot,NitrousOxideLolz,2,Thu Jun 25 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, I admit. It takes more skill to take down scrakes. Two fleshpounds can be dealt with if there is chaos, some people land some shots with an AA12 and grenades, and someone clears the trash. Two scrakes require coordination, focus fire and not enraging both of them at once. When you have these skills and good communication in the team, scrakes are easier. While I generally see that FP's are just big bullet sponges, whether you coordinate your attacks or not."
killingfloor,3b3sot,Anolis_Gaming,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Zerk grenade + scar/aa12 headshots. Dead scrake. If you don't have a zerk, or have a bad zerk, then shoot it until it gets close, sidestep, run forward, turn around and keep shooting. It should die in short order."
killingfloor,3b3sot,Anolis_Gaming,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:04:55 2015 UTC,I thought i read that both skrakes and fleshpounds were resistant to explosions.
killingfloor,3b3sot,textbooksforrent,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Nope. The opposite actually. FPs take 150% explosive damage, Skrakes only take 50%."
killingfloor,3b3sot,amberlamps03,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"Well shit, time to start tossing some grenades!"
killingfloor,3b3sot,amberlamps03,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"I think it depends greatly on your team's coordination. Dealing with a FP when caught isolated and unaware is much easier than dealing with a Scrake when caught alone.  However, when 2 Scrakes spawn next to each other and my team has been communicating well that round, I don't break a sweat compared to when two FPs spawn next to each other.  Even on Hell on Earth, a Commando with the SCAR, assuming good aim and someone covering his back, can take out a Scrake before it can do much damage. A full clip of AA-12 and it's down to less than half health.  Can't say the same about a FP that's charging toward your party. Scrakes also have the added benefit of not raging until they've taken a bit of damage.  Coordination is the key to defeating Scrakes. HoE is pretty damn chaotic, but on Normal/Hard you can ignore Scrakes until the end of a wave, and on suicidal you can do that about 50% of the time.   In the end, this game is still without several Perks. It's hard to know how FPs and Scrakes will turn out after those are added. Sharpshooter might make Scrakes a joke, demos the same for FPs in their current state."
killingfloor,3b3sot,PhetaJS,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"I find that Fleshpounds are a bigger threat than Scrakes right meow. Like others have said, a SCAR 30 round mag from a level 25 commando to the face coupled with AA12's brings down scrakes really fuckin quick. Fleshpounds do more damage and slap my shit with their double hit shit. This is my view from a suicidal difficulty level."
killingfloor,3b3sot,VegaPunker,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that's true. But as a low level commando having only played on normal and hard, the Skrakes need to be brought into line in those difficulties. The FPs need a buff as well."
killingfloor,3b3sot,SEALSniper07,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:42:53 2015 UTC,Oh trust me I was in your position when I first started. I was like wtf. As you advance in levels and difficulty you will learn when and where to attack scrakes and learn to successfully strafe and dodge them. I dont think a nerf is required yet...maybe after they remove the circle strafe tactic but we will see.
killingfloor,3b4uyl,EwDirt,3,Fri Jun 26 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"There is a 100 player server I was on that does this. Haven't been able to find it again.  It spawns an absurd amount of zeds per wave, something like 2000. Including sc and fp. There's an in-wave respawn timer, so normally clearing a wave isn't a problem. At wave 10, I think 5 Han's spawn and everyone dies.   Pretty fun."

killingfloor,3b4uyl,ChickenPuffs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"I don't believe kf2 has mutators whitelist yet.  With that said there was a debate about the leveling advantage when players wants the game to be harder.  Players are already awarded more xp playing on harder difficulty so as long as increasing zed count actually increases difficulty, the leveling advantage feels justified."

So, /u/kyolee to answer your question: can you get banned?  No.    Can you get heckled when you're level 25 and play like a newbie?  Probably.    Conclusion: use your resources wisely."
killingfloor,3b4w51,Kuebic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"What's sad is that I don't think leveling up even helps you learn the game properly. In both games, the mechanics/meta change so drastically that you're essentially re-learning the game anyway. A lot of KF1 fundamentals carry over poorly from lower-to-higher difficulties - m1 katana scrake flinchlock; xbow on fleshpounds; m32 on absolutely everything for no reason; etc."

killingfloor,3ayhn2,DasGanon,3,Wed Jun 24 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"If the issue is that you only really have the weekend to play, you need to look at it this way:     If they update Thursday or Friday you still have to wait for the weekend to play, but they have less time to fix any potential issues before you play.   If they update earlier in the week you still have to wait for the weekend to play, but they have more time to fix any potential issues before you play.     Neither option changes when you can play the game, but one of the options gives you a better chance of playing a stable build."

Having played the beta (excessively...) from the beginning, I've got to be honest, the early access release was a huge anti-climax. I thought ""finally, new classes, new content"", but no. I'm a huge fan of Red Orchestra, more so than I am of KF, but for the love of god finish one game off before you squirt out game footage of the next one – I'm referring to RO2:'nam.  I really like Tripwire as a dev, but I want to know when the new content for KF2 is coming out, if it's at the the top of their priorities list, and if not, why not?  My problem is that I like KF2 too much. Playing it any more as it is will kill the game for me. I get that the early-access model is great for TW's cashflow, but as a gamer I would have much preferred to wait until September or whenever and be able to enjoy the game in full. I get that there was nothing to stop me from waiting until the game's full release, but if you put it out there, ofcourse I'll buy it, and I refuse to own my frustration."

So far they have delivered a playable, incomplete, textbook example of an early access game. Updates are coming and aren't out yet. This is exactly what early access is. People that think that KF2 should be more by now should never have bought into it at the early access stage."

I am ofc familiar with the EA model, I think I just anticipated the content to come thicker and faster than it has. Or that the content that was out would remain as gripping to me as it needed to be until this new content comes out.  I don't harbour any ill-will towards TW, I'm just explaining how I feel about a state of affairs, and I'm not assigning blame, but again, that doesn't change how I feel! I know it's very easy for you to strawman me in your head as someone anti-KF2/TW, but the opposite is true, and I'd urge you to resist that easy temptation and the-call-of-the-zealot."

killingfloor,3b1c9j,AGFuzzyPancake,3,Thu Jun 25 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"Much agreed with your description, OP, but the title of your post is silly. Tripwire has not said that they nerfed guns and added health to zeds - the quotes were not needed.  More to the point - The sponginess of SC's and FP's is simply frustrating for a lot of us. They just take too many bullets to take down right now with the perks we have.  Now as others have said, Sharpie and demo perks will eventually be there to take them take them down swiftly. But that doesn't mean the present problem doesn't matter. And we don't want to have to rely on sharps and demos all the time when they are added. The perks should be somewhat balanced to kill all zeds, I believe.  Every time my team is pummeled, like OP, it's because of the SC's and FP's. Mostly scrakes though.  To fix this, I'd recommend three really easy patches for TWI.    Give the trashy zeds more health and the SC's and FP's less Or lower SC and FP health and spawn more per wave Or spawn less SC's and FP's and more of everything else.   I'd like to see #1, myself."
killingfloor,3b1c9j,emorium,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:03:30 2015 UTC,"By nerfing the guns I mean compare to KF1. In KF1 even commando and firebug can kill scrakes when needed, you may take a hit or two, blowing a lot of ammo, but the scrake will not stand after a reload.  TBH I dont have problem with KF2 FPs, they are not hard to kill (frankly they are easy to kill, like I said, every team has 3 pulv now, and you only need 13 hits in total), and you can run, their function in KF2 is to flush you out of camping, but they fail at this, scrakes are flushing people out, and being the main DPS, and kill the whole team, and being the tank, and being a distraction.   Also, people just assume:  1) As soon as SS is added scrakes will just drop dead as soon as they see the SS 2)SS will never miss 3)SS has unlimited health and will never die  Thats why we have all these ""when SS is added the problem will be gone"".  Which clearly is not the case. As they remove stun, SS weapons will likely to stumble, so, the commando beside you mess up the headshots, oh and if you miss, you rage the scrake. So how does this change the current situation? Basically only head shots can kill the scrakes, and everything in the game (parry,stumble, attacking) make their head swing like crazy. (or, you can spent 3 mag of AA12 on it, you have done well, now you spent most of your ammo to kill ONE ZED)  Not to mention, in KF2 you already force one slot to be medic (in KF1 you can do any perk combos or 6 of a kind), now you want to force another slot to be SS?"

The only specimens that are bullet sponges are Scrakes, Fleshpounds and obviously, Hans. All of them for good reason."
killingfloor,3b1c9j,ChickenPuffs,-1,Thu Jun 25 05:16:23 2015 UTC,"Umm.. good reason? So FP dies in 13 un-perked pulv M2, hence, 3 pulv, with a nade or two and a few shots, each zerk/medic with the pulv only need 3-4 hits to kill FPs (you dont actually need that much because you should have 2 pulv WITH perk bonus).  Now press G when scrake and everyone shoot his head, playing a long game? Now stack more EMP in the team. Is this the ""good reason"" you mention? There must me some way other than bumping the health to make the game harder and LESS BORING.   And Hans.... really? All I see is people complaint that Hans has too much health. Yes, he is easy, but still people are complaining about too much health, why is that? I wonder...  When you increase difficulty, yes, they run faster (or gain the ability to run), but all those ""special abilities"" like combo attacks from trash zeds are just a DPS increase, yeah, husk will suicide etc, but how often do you really see them able to do that without their head getting pop or out right blown away? Oh yes, dont forget the health increase.   When you start out at suicidal and play HOE for a while, every game is the basically the same. You know, people already suggesting unparriable attacks because ""parry locking is lame"". Just more reason to NOT parry and EMP scrakes and pulv gank Fps."
killingfloor,3b1c9j,Kuebic,2,Thu Jun 25 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"I think they meant they have to be more bullet spongy because theres no point in playing if they die in a few hits. Its also the same formula used in killing floor 1, so I can't imgain the devs want to stray too far from that.   That being said I do think some new attacks for the zeds could make for a neat challange. It defently wouldn't hurt to lower the big guys health a little bit and throw in some more devastating moves and weakness's too.   The old killing floor 1 scrake use to impale players, rather then dance around. I'd like to see the scrake do the same again sometimes. Hell maybe even hold a player still unless you move backwards, (to pull yourself out of it). Could make things interesting that's for sure."
killingfloor,3b1c9j,Kuebic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:36:52 2015 UTC,"In KF1 you can die to all kinds of stuff, mostly your team get overwhelmed. But in KF2 its always because a scrake raged in teams with experienced players. May be a siren hiding beind a scrake and destroy the EMP, may be double scrake spawn with FP, may be some one trying to parry a scrake and die to random trashes.   In other words, its always scrakes because they simply dont die if you cant hit the head. And parry/stumble/dodging the attacks all make his head swing around. As a result, the meta soon becomes EMP stacking. And berserkers have no other use other than EMPing, you dont want the scrake to attack you, you dont want to block the bullets from the team, and you want the medic heal players in need instead of focusing on you alone. So, berserkers use assault refiles instead of melee.   Personally, I think this is stupid."
killingfloor,3b1c9j,SEALSniper07,3,Thu Jun 25 08:51:41 2015 UTC,Berserkers are getting a total overhaul in an up coming patch though. For all we know it could fix these problems and make them more viable compared to their ranged counterparts.
killingfloor,3awjiu,BurndAndScarred,3,Wed Jun 24 01:58:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, dropping Hans is already a pretty sizable chunk of XP. Players already have plenty of incentives to not die, so I don't see the need for further rewarding basic gameplay."

I guess the bonus would be extra xp applied to the class you're playing, not that the bonus is needed really because leveling up is already a lot faster than in KF1 but it could be a fun little thing."

killingfloor,3awjiu,Kuebic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:36:25 2015 UTC,Exactly my thoughts. Something like XP is far too much of a game changer for those leveling and I personally don't believe we should mess with that.
killingfloor,3awjiu,ChickenPuffs,2,Wed Jun 24 21:39:55 2015 UTC,Why is everyone in such a rush to level up? I hardly see how leveling up sooner rather then later is a reward. You'll only get bored quicker honestly. Cosmetics create a long-term drive to beat higher difficulties even after you're max level.
killingfloor,3awjiu,ChickenPuffs,2,Wed Jun 24 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"It's a neat little idea with good intentions, but I do feel it could mess the way people play the game.  Sacrificing the rest of the team just so they themselves survive is going against the co-op KF2 is supposed to be about.  I can totally see these jerks not helping teammates so the rest of the team dies and they can get the rest of the kills for themselves.    I mean, people already do that!  They don't need more incentive to keep doing that.  Currently, if a team manages to beat Hans, there is a sizable bonus XP given to the team.

Also I hope they implement ""Swing holding"", as in I can left-click+hold to ""draw"" your weapon back (into the striking position) then let go of the  left-click to release. Also if they implement that  you can ""cancel swing"". Same concept as ""Swing Holding"" but once you clicked/holed the left click , and say a Commando just got a headshot on the zed you were going to hit, you could right-click to ""release/cancel"" the attack, and your weapon would just go to it's neutral resting spot."

Once you complete the map you see the real patriarch on a train with your charaters in a carriage behind. This was also how the zeds got from Britain to Europe the setting for killing floor 2.

Maybe there's a volter that fires a piercing laser beam at a target,so you need to find cover and not get teammates hit, maybe there's a volter that infects you with something so you take a small DoT, but everyone around you takes a huge one, so get away!"
killingfloor,3ar311,Anolis_Gaming,2,Tue Jun 23 16:53:40 2015 UTC,why is it the same boss for every map?    Already answered from other posts: answer found in Transit map.   Would it be too nontraditional or a waste of resources to even consider having a unique boss per map?  Or having a set of bosses where one is randomly chosen to be said boss for the final wave of a map?   I believe TWI is planning on expanding upon KF1 and selecting a random boss from a given set for the final wave is part of their plan for KF2.  Currently unused trader quotes seems to suggest a couple more bosses in the making.  The problem I see having a different boss for every map is custom maps.  Will they be using a borrowed boss from another map?  Then that boss is no longer exclusive to that map and ruined the point of creating a map-specific boss.  The way TWI is going currently I'm satisfied with.
killingfloor,3ar311,Kuebic,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:07:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with map specific bosses and mods,is that the boss  most likely will only be tested on that map, so if you put that boss is any other map the AI and pathfinding will Crap itself."

Its amazing, one shots bloats,sirens and husks on suicidal, and mows done everything else.  The only problem is really HP, you just evaporate as a zerker especially since you have to get close a lot of time. Like on HOE a couple FP hits and thats it, and since you are close to front lines you are likely to get hit by sirens and FPs that hang around corners. Also bloats MELT you, in fact even with the resistance (and because of HP) you are just a capable against bloat damage as a support.  Also scakes just destroy you.   Make it so zerkers get +20hp, and 50% damage reduction against scrakes and then suddenly they will be an amazing teammate to have that fill a core need at the current stage."
killingfloor,3aqr1l,skyoctopus,15,Mon Jun 22 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"I'd rather them get equivalent damage reduction than additional hp, because that makes healing more efficient on them.  Seriously though, why is every class tankier than the one that has to be in melee range?"

I thinks its that they gave the commandos and support a tacked on health boost before they released it to early access, and figured zerkers resistances where still good comparablely.   Technically if commandos and supports had just 100hp zerkers wouldnt look half bad, but the game would definitely be much harder and medics would be op."

killingfloor,3aqr1l,Rex_Marksley,6,Mon Jun 22 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats true in that i just doesn't feel like a melee weapon some of the time. Its sometimes annoying to use, the alt-fire requires you to be mobile to get more ammo, and the individual saw blade reload takes a while so if you miss a headshot on a siren your kinda screwed. Also there is no precise aiming when shooting the blades. Also doesn't do a decent job against fleshpounds and scrakes is so-so, since a scrake can do a 180 and pretty much 1-shot you with a special attack.  The main reasons i like it:   1) bloats are fucking OP on HoE (they can sprint, they block all you shots, their dying bodies block your shots, and they block you path, getting consistent headshots on them is not easy, and teleporting bloat is more annoying than a teleporting fp), and this easy one shot solution is amazing especially since it completely destroys bloats so they don't block shots or path (good luck getting past a bloat after you take off his head).  2) Alt-fire and spining around is a great way to stun a group of gorefast while you get back control. Against a group of crawlers and gore fasts, if you do it right, you take no damage.   3) Alt-fire is an amazing way to get out of a bad situation. I surivived will like 10 HP for so long just cause i could keep fending them off, long enough for my teammate to heal me. And I can push through a group of enemies blocking my path. (edit as a side note, yeah you can do this with any class, but when you get trash+bloats and husks after you, being able to snipe the husk/bloat with the blades and run down the trash with the alt-fire is something i'd end up running out of ammo really quick with an AA12 or scar)  4) You can run fast with it, which makes no sense, cause you cant run fast with nail gun."

killingfloor,3aqr1l,Ironfungus,2,Tue Jun 23 01:54:36 2015 UTC,Yes but you are complaining about something that doesn't need to be complained about. If you can't time a parry that doesn't make it a bad feature.
killingfloor,3aqr1l,kdpha,2,Tue Jun 23 11:06:10 2015 UTC,"Again, mate, it isn't about timing the parry, It's about the ping required.  When you lag in this game, shit jumps around, Gorefasts jump over telephone booths, bloats turn around in circles never missing their mark, it's a shit storm.  Now try relying on a 2 second parry that if you don't hit perfectly you will die.  Go turn on utorrent and a bunch of other shit to purposely lag, go try and fight scrakes and come back to me. Add a few glitchy gorefasts in there too."

I would like them to change up how zerker works, parrying is cool. However he definitely needs a massive buff."

killingfloor,3aqr1l,qqnowqq,2,Mon Jun 22 20:03:54 2015 UTC,"Sui/HoE KF1 scrake has a threshold that if you can deal a certain amount of damage in 1 hit, you can stun them.   For berserkers, heavy melee attack with Fire Axe, Scythe, Claymore and Dwarves Axe. You have to hit the head. If you miss, they will unstun. If you're using a Katana, heavy melee from the back (you deal 2x damage when striking from behind)  You can also stun them with: headshot xbow, LAW and charged huskgun."

killingfloor,3aqr1l,Kvasir94,5,Wed Jun 24 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"No, please do. It's one of the only reasons I ever played with randoms, so we could finish the game regardless if my team failed miserably in their jobs. I realize KF is a team game, but I don't want my success determined solely by the competency of my team.   The Berserker was balanced. It was only ever as good as the player wielding it, and became superhero status in the hands of an expert who no doubt spent many many hours of practicing to get to that level of play. Otherwise, any moron could pick up the berserker class and finish the 10th wave on HOE with your whole team dead, or solo the patrirch for that matter.  You really think it was as easy as that? We needed to memorize every map and kiting route, and the spawn points of the reds, in order to survive. And soloing Patty as a zerker was often most dependent on your latency.  Seeing how borderline useless they are now, yes, I would say we do need to revert to KF1 zerker. Because despite all its potential strengths, most people could not play it well."

We needed to memorize every map and kiting route, and the spawn points of the reds, in order to survive.   You make that sound much harder than it actually is. All you have to do is know the popular maps, not every single one. Recognizing a spawn location is easy, so you just forever stay away from it. Knowing a map isn't hard, at most I'd only ever need to play on a map twice before knowing how to use the map to my advantage.   Seeing how borderline useless they are now, yes, I would say we do need to revert to KF1 zerker. Because despite all its potential strengths, most people could not play it well.   ...Or we could instead buff it without going overboard.  I'm liking how in KF2 every class is roughly effective while playing solo, rather than having one powerhouse class that dominates while playing alone."
killingfloor,3aqr1l,Erik_Dolphy,3,Mon Jun 22 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"Bleh. Incoming damage res increase, health increase, and stun power increase, haha. Really though, if anything they just need to let zerker cause a one-time melee flinch, allow pulv alt fire (expl) headshot get a true scrake stun, and .... I think that's all it needs, tbh."
killingfloor,3aqr1l,AsiaDerp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"Zerk isn't nearly as UP as people say IMO.  A little squishy, but otherwise fine.  They're pretty much necessary on HoE.  I think a lot of people get chopped down because they don't kite enough and don't go for headswings"
killingfloor,3aqr1l,TeaL3af,4,Mon Jun 22 22:05:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Zerk just needs to be changed a bit and maybe slightly buffed, but honestly I love how he plays currently (other than a lot of perk choices being less than optimal and the Eviscerator being passable). Nailgun is a solid weapon and so are the Pulv and Crovel. With the coming blocking walk speed buff coming I think the Pulv will be even better."
killingfloor,3aqr1l,BrighterthanMoon,2,Mon Jun 22 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best Zerker but I can assure you it isn't nearly as easy as you seem to think, and we aren't necessary at all, which is part of the problem, we can't tank and we don't deal good damage, the only reason we're needed on HoE is for emp grenades, but we don't need level 25 for that. There isn't any reason to level Zerker right now, but that doesn't mean we should make it ridiculous (yes it was a little silly in kf1, take off your nostalgia glasses.) I made this thread to remind people that we like the zerker the way it is, it just needs a hug.  I admit that I am not particularly good, but you don't have to be good to see that playing as Zerker right now is way too hard for the purpose it serves, which by the way i'm not even entirely sure what that purpose is. An extra commando or support with a few medics would always do better then having EMP's, however good they are."

killingfloor,3ao9ek,mlerb,12,Mon Jun 22 03:40:46 2015 UTC,"Ammo and weapon are respawning at the beginning of each wave. Each time you are picking up an ammo box, respawn timer activates, at the end of each new ammo box is spawned somewhere. Ammo respawn time depends from living players count: 1 player: 30 seconds 2 players: 15 seconds 3 players: 10 seconds 4 players: 7.5 seconds 5 players: 6 seconds 6 players: 5 seconds It means that after you've picked ammo box in solo mode, new ammo box will be spawned in 30 seconds in random location. Times are constant though the difficulties. If I understood correctly from the code, then weapons use the same respawn mechanics as ammo, but initial spawn rate is different: at the beginning of each HoE wave 25% ammo boxes and 10% weapons are spawned.

This is coming from someone who used a level.0 zerker in HoE and had the most kills by wave 4 with no deaths. The shovel is perfection for the starting rounds honestly, just keep using the slide slashes and the heads will start rolling than just buy the sledge hammer. Berserk is maybe level.6 now and I always use it for the first few waves and tend to too the leader board while helping out with scrakes and FP."

killingfloor,3anbuc,Cortexplosion,2,Sun Jun 21 22:23:20 2015 UTC,"Ignoring the strange request to squish the 16:10 ratio inside a 16:9 monitor, this is something you set in your scaling options in the Catalyst Control Center. You want something like ""Stretch to Screen (Ignore aspect ratio)"".  The black bars are your computer's attempt to run a 16:10 inside a 16:9 without warping the proportions of everything on display. i.e making everything short/pudgy (as opposed to forcing a 16:9 ration to fit a 16:10 monitor, which results in things being extra tall/slender)."
killingfloor,3anbuc,v4lor,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"I suppose I might clarify that my monitor is probably, definitely 16:10. Windows likes to think that 1920x1080 is the optimal res for the monitor, but setting it to that creates black bars. 1440x900 or 1680x1050 is probably native res, likely the latter. I'll edit that, thanks.  Anyhow. In CCC I've got the stretch-to-screen setting enabled, and overscan is set to maximum (probably did it for another game a while ago). KF2 remains black-barred at all resolutions. Even on native ratio, where the black bars are pretty equal in size (1"" margin or so around entire screen). I did notice that switching between 1440x900 and 1680x1050 makes no change, as if it's not registering 1680x1050 being larger.  Thanks for the comment, if you have any further advice it'd be appreciated."
killingfloor,3anbuc,v4lor,2,Mon Jun 22 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"That is extremely strange.. It sounds like the monitor isn't correctly reporting itself to the OS. It could be a conflict with your Video Card drivers, too. I would try a clean install of the video card drivers just to rule that out.  For the Overscan options in CCC, try setting your desktop to the resolution you desire in-game, and then adjusting the Overscan values to be correct. You should then be able to reset your desktop to your default resolution, and the black bars when running the game should (in theory) go away. That's what I used to do when I ran Radeons on games that wouldn't scale properly.  Lastly, you can try Borderless Windowed mode, though that will run at whatever your Desktop resolution is at. If that's too taxing on your GPU, an (annoying, but sometimes useful) workaround it to set your Desktop resolution to your desired in-game resolution, and then run KF2 in Borderless Window mode. You'd have to change it back in-between sessions, but it might be all that ends up working."

Biggest problem to these stutters is, in some rare moment they don't just happen for a split second but cast last up to 4 or 5 seconds which is horrible when it happens in HoE.  I would also like to note the stutters are primarily related to the texture quality, if i set my texture quality to medium the stuttering goes away for good.

Drives have mechanisms to correct these so you dont loose your drive but it will come at the cost of performance. And it makes perfect sense why. An error that causes the platter to spin 3 times to get a peice of data instead of just once will add latency, and thats the performance hit.

Eletrical aoe slow mines. (like zerkers nade) I wouldn't dare suggest lazer guns buut...maybe (kind of like the husk gun but electrical).  I guess they would act as a pure support class, not a damage dealer but a crowd controler. Slowing hords of zeds down, with a little amo or maybe a large reload time. (could be a recharge time!)

Many of the zeds possess cybernetic augments which grant them almost magical powers. This could be exploited both ways.  I'm imagining a weapon which bears an aesthetic resemblance to Nintendo's Power Glove. The weapon would work by casting electromagnetic pulses which interfere with certain neuronal processes. (Alternatively, it could interfere with the cybernetics our zeds have installed.)  In either case, it could be balanced around accuracy making it a very high-skill weapon. Pulses aimed at the head would deal good damage and have a good chance of impairing zed mobility provided they are not enraged. Body shots would likewise be much less effective.  Alt-fire could be a cool-down based ""save me""-wave which consumes greater ammunition, deals very little damage, and stuns nearby non-enraged zeds in an AoE. Damage and effect-effectiveness could be tweaked so that the class doesn't end up as a more effective Sharp Shooter.  Other weapons could be designed around the theme as well. KF has the ZED gun, which is a bit strange already. Additionally, Tripwire isn't shy about exercising its creativity. (Caulk 'N Burn? Yummy.)"

Big time crowd control, does less damage but slows big groups of zeds in return. (Could have an ice pick as a melee too, would be fun.)  Maybe an engineer who can use sentries or walking turrets. Can hold down chokepoints really well, could have to run around to restock the sentry's ammo. Big wrench, relies less on firepower of his own and more on smart placement. Maybe other utility, and could buff door defenses or something.  Maybe some jack of all trades, master of none. He can switch playstyles to suit needs at any given moment, but has weaker bonuses when compared to more specialized classes.  Last one I can think of is some kind of mind controller. Uses beacons or some kind of dart gun to confuse zeds and make them attack the nearest thing to them. Maybe have a designated thing to control a ssingle zombie.

killingfloor,3aidj3,Subzer0o,2,Sun Jun 21 04:03:18 2015 UTC,A class based around buildable objects.

killingfloor,3aidj3,EmbryonicMisanthrop,2,Sun Jun 21 08:30:48 2015 UTC,"how about playing as one of the zeds? A Patriarch that isn't affected by the virus, but still has the classic weapons.  Since he is a failed subject, his guns have been stripped away. With hiw new earned dosh, he can install new weapons on his body and eradicate some zeds. weapons would be (strapped to the arms): 1. light machine gun 2. shotgun 3. minigun 4. rocket launcher"
killingfloor,3aidj3,ShoweredInDownvotes,2,Sun Jun 21 10:58:39 2015 UTC,"It may be a stretch given the weapons specialized for other classes, but I'd like to see some sort of Breacher or Assault class.  Give him the increased combat stats for say Shotguns or SMGs. Maybe include a grenade similar to a flashbang to stun zeds. Then include a breaching tool as a melee weapon which could be used to quickly open welded doors if a quick exit is needed.   I think this would increase the use of the welding mechanic because I don't really think (experience from KF1 and KF2) that many people utilize this tool."
killingfloor,3aidj3,eblausund,2,Sun Jun 21 16:29:05 2015 UTC,I just want the original classes for now and anything else super creative and interested could be implemented later. I was pretty happy with the announcement of firebug and demo and I'm looking forward to sharpshooter. I hope that when they add that blade user class it feels more like berzerker from KF1.
killingfloor,3aidj3,ShoweredInDownvotes,3,Mon Jun 22 06:26:52 2015 UTC,Please god I need explosives or pyro.  Maybe even a class that can set traps.
killingfloor,3aidj3,KitsuAccalia,9,Sat Jun 20 14:01:20 2015 UTC,"They could call a trap-based class ""Tripwire"" and give it a special crossbow which fires pairs of bolts which link together to form a utility oriented trap. (Press RMB to fire the first bolt, release RMB to fire the second.) (Only loosely inspired by this thing.) The grenade could be a sticky designed around the same sort of utility.Perhaps the class could be designed around maiming and disabling zeds? Balanced around low fire-power with good utility."

killingfloor,3al43s,great_mighty_wolf,2,Sun Jun 21 06:55:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on whether you want the extras or not. If you want an extra copy of KF1 to give away to a friend, get the DD version.   If you're interested in the soundtrack, it comes with the songs listed here: http://www.tripwireinteractive.com/news/killing-floor-2-official-game-soundtrack-announced!.aspx. The soundtrack comes in both MP3 and FLAC formats. However, the game actually contains a lot more tracks than just those 25, so you might be kind of disappointed that some of them are missing. Also in the game, you can choose to disable vocals in the music, so each song has a special instrumential version, but the soundtrack contains only the normal versions with vocals.  There's also some extra in game cosmetics and an artbook included in the DD version (the artbook currently contains only art of the content that's been released up to now, so there's no spoilers about upcoming stuff).  If you're not interested in any of the above, just get the normal version."

I've never gotten the second error though.   I would guess the first error is unrelated to the second error.

killingfloor,3alif0,mercurial_minnow,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:04:35 2015 UTC,It's pretty easy for them to keep that promise too.  Just don't ever press that big red reset button.  Unlike the PD2 example where they had to finalize content.
killingfloor,3alif0,Kuebic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:48:52 2015 UTC,What happened with Payday 2?
killingfloor,3alif0,Ihmhi,3,Sun Jun 21 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"The example OP gave was an interview during the development stage promising many heists and destructible buildings, etc.  But when the game was ""finished"" it lacked many of the promised features."
killingfloor,3alif0,Kuebic,-1,Sun Jun 21 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate. I'm glad I never bought that game, then. Thanks!"
killingfloor,3alif0,Ihmhi,6,Sun Jun 21 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"It's a great game, despite lacking those features. They've tons of content and many new heists since launch."
killingfloor,3alif0,Duecez24,2,Mon Jun 22 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty common in games unfortunately.  The devs have these ambitious goals and hype them up early in development.  But by release that feature is very buggy, running out of funds, and/or unsalvageable and end up getting cut from the final version.  PD2 though, they added many features later, often in forms of DLC's.  Granted, destructible buildings was an idea that was scraped, but the number of heists, they've been added for free during events.  I actually haven't followed them very closely, but that's the gist of it."
killingfloor,3alif0,Kuebic,4,Sun Jun 21 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"What you're discussing about being burned in pay day 2 is in a different category of its own.  That is the game developers hyping the game up too much during development and unfortunately not being able to deliver.  Many games fall into that trap, most notably Peter Molyneux games.  He has become something of a joke. He’s infamous for promising incredible things in his games and failing to deliver.   For example, Fable for Xbox.  Peter promised incredible things, like “trees that grow in real time”, “rival factions that go to war with you”, “characters that age over time” and so on.  The devs of those games have a huge vision for the game but nothing working to back it up.  They ended up scrapping those ""promised"" features and disappoint a lot of fans.  In KF2, TWI is not trying to fall into that trap.  They have been very limited on what they are telling us what is going to be in the final version of the game which is frustrating, but that's because many features they sort of have working might unfortunately get cut from the game, such as crawlers crawling on walls, extra gore features, specific weapons, etc.  The promise of perks not being wiped coming from an actual developer is probably as high in authority you can go.  And it's relatively easy for them to keep that promise since it's not promising content or features, just a promise not to hit the red reset button."
killingfloor,3alif0,Kuebic,2,Sun Jun 21 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"Peter Molyneux doesn't hype, he just lies out of his rear end about everything regarding game development.  Also, I could have sworn they started putting crawlers crawling on walls back in a few patches ago >.>"

killingfloor,3alif0,Ihmhi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:56:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty much need to trust recent developer statements. Anything else is dated or unofficial. They originally wanted to wipe stats at least once though, so there's a chance they can change their minds again, considering they've done it once. If you really don't want to expend time playing with a potential reset, just wait for the full release later this year."
killingfloor,3af712,Ceronn,16,Fri Jun 19 17:11:35 2015 UTC,"I know this is the killing floor 2 sub, so  you guys are a little biased, but is it worth the price yet?  Or should I wait till the game is out of early access?"
killingfloor,3af712,deadby100cuts,12,Fri Jun 19 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"I do recommend it, even for the full price. I enjoy the game, the maps are fun and detailed. I enjoy the combat. I am also making my own custom map,. so I get a lot of value from the sdk. So if you get bored of the maps, you can jump to a custom server."

killingfloor,3af712,fearachieved,6,Sat Jun 20 01:56:39 2015 UTC,"It's plenty fun. It's worth it at this price. The community is cranking out a steady stream of custom maps, so it's not like the only content is the official maps."
killingfloor,3af712,flyingbarmitzvah,10,Fri Jun 19 18:44:58 2015 UTC,No and it will not until 75% off at current level of content. Just wait till release or at least 3 or 4 content updates.
killingfloor,3af712,Viliger,14,Fri Jun 19 18:25:31 2015 UTC,"I have to agree.  There's more than enough maps, but not enough perks.  Demo and Firebug are coming out next, but until we have Sharpshooter I don't think it will be worth the price.  I know they're going to be adding a lot more stuff than that (like new bosses!), but I think once the perks are added we'll have a pretty complete game.  But TWI is a great developer, and it's a lot of fun following the game as it's being developed.  If you're interested in that, then it's well worth the price, because the game is very polished and just works well in general."
killingfloor,3af712,goldsrcmasterrace,5,Fri Jun 19 18:32:09 2015 UTC,Until this game came out I never realized how many people liked the sharpshooter class. I only leveled it because it was the easiest. I really didn't care for it that much in KF1. It seemed like another commando class to me.
killingfloor,3af712,brooklyn11218,8,Sat Jun 20 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"Sharp is my favorite class.  Commando is trash killer, sharp is bosskiller.  They have completely different domains."

I've put 150+ hours into KF2, so it's a little absurd to me to suggest I should have paid pretty much nothing for it. It's very fun in its current state, and where else can you get that many hours of entertainment for that price? Pretty much nowhere."
killingfloor,3af712,Kvasir94,11,Fri Jun 19 20:31:04 2015 UTC,"I bought Killing Floor 1 about 2 years ago. It was only $3. Based on how many hours I put into that game, and how much money I probably would have spent out on the town if I weren't playing Killing Floor at the time, I probably owe Tripwire about $1000. So I agree with your point"
killingfloor,3af712,kabrandon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's all I'm trying to say. Take your playtime and divide it by the average length of a movie and then use that number to multiply the average price of a movie ticket,  it really puts things into perspective.  We expect so much more out of games than any other form of entertainment and yet somehow people complain when they ask only half of the ""newly released console game"" price.  People who play the game for weeks and then complain it's <5 dollars cheaper now fall under the same category. It's frustrating, I know, but they got their play time out of it."

killingfloor,3af712,AbanoMex,-1,Sat Jun 20 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but there's LOADS of games.  KF1 being one of them.  What's laughable is saying there's no better options during the Steam summer sale.  I'm personally very happy with my purchase of KF2, but the content is definitely lacking for a $30 price tag.  Don't fool yourself into thinking you got an amazing deal just because you put a lot of hours into it."
killingfloor,3af712,goldsrcmasterrace,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:48:29 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about other games, I was talking about other entertainment. Just because I can get an older game on sale that might be good doesn't mean I got ripped off spending 25 dollars. There's no fooling anyone going on. It WAS a good deal to me if I got that much entertainment time out of it. Honestly, there's not many games I play that hard (especially if they're single player).  I just think of it all in terms of how many hours of distraction it can provide. A good movie is under 2 hours. A good game of any price is potentially hundreds.   The 5 dollars vs 25 dollars argument is small potatoes at that point because either price is still great and I'm paying less than the majority of gamers aka console people. That's not even mentioning that I fully trust tripwire to expand the content and that those classes will come."
killingfloor,3af712,Kvasir94,2,Fri Jun 19 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"Game will only get better and the price won't get higher than 20€, even when it's out of early access. So if you're a fan of the first game and want to play the second one, buy it. Ofc you can wait until full release and judge it then, or wait a year or 2 until it's -60% or something like that.   So buy it only if you're a fan of the game and wanna try it early."
killingfloor,3af712,eyeless_eagle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Based on the developer's track record of maintaining their games by adding content for years after the game's release, I trust they will add the rest of the promised content hopefully by the end of the year (6 more perks, 4 weapons for each perk) and a quality modding community migrating from KF1, it's definitely worth it in the long run.  The base price is not expected to change between early access to full release so unless you're willing to wait a few years until there's a chance of getting 75% off, now would be a pretty good time to get it for years of enjoyment with friends."
killingfloor,3af712,Kuebic,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:48:33 2015 UTC,I'd say it's worth the price. Considering there was really no discount for KF1 owners.

killingfloor,3af712,APuppyWithATumor,2,Fri Jun 19 23:17:16 2015 UTC,"The problem is that this isn't like ""normal"" early access games. In a certain way, the game is already done. All they need to add is more maps and perks. Maybe some balancing here and there.  With a normal early access game, they're able to pump out updates every week or so, because the updates are way smaller, and are tweaks than actual additional content."
killingfloor,3af712,iliekpixels,7,Fri Jun 19 23:24:29 2015 UTC,"The core game is done, but the game itself definitely is not. Yes there will be more perks and maps, but new zed bosses, possibly more zeds themselves, zeds doing different things like crawlers crawling on walls and ceilings, possibly more guns for each perk, and stuff like the new gore system being implemented will be happening. It's definitely not just some perks and maybe some balancing here and there."
killingfloor,3af712,Rasii,2,Fri Jun 19 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"I like the game, don't get me wrong. Most of the mechanics are already there, which is good. But it needs more content. And the devs really haven't added hardly any content in the entirety of the early access state. They said they would be doing early access better than the rest of the industry, but it just hasn't happened. If I knew now how they would treat their early access customers, I would have definitely held out on purchasing."
killingfloor,3af712,APuppyWithATumor,4,Fri Jun 19 23:29:09 2015 UTC,look at it this way: you were going to purchase it regardless. Now or later it doesn't matter. You KNOW the content will be there soon(ish) and you KNOW you will get your money's worth. Until then you could enjoy the early access or just uninstall it and play whatever you would have played had you held off for release.  Either way it's a wash. You actually come out ahead because you get to play and level up your perks a couple months ahead of when you would have normally purchased the game.
killingfloor,3af712,brooklyn11218,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"Lol, you speak as if you deserve special treatment when the point of early access is to test features, you paid for a beta, and thats what you get"

killingfloor,3ae61c,EwDirt,2,Fri Jun 19 17:06:47 2015 UTC,Thought for a second you'd already managed to rebuild the entire KFRPG mod the wolfpack did for KF1.    Very nice to see everyone's still hard at work - I know that eventual workshop support and everything is really going to vault this game into another stratosphere alongside the first one.
killingfloor,3afkph,Lord_Gaben_,20,Fri Jun 19 18:55:42 2015 UTC,Berserker rework is under way. :)
killingfloor,3afkph,TW_Shuu,5,Sat Jun 20 05:52:43 2015 UTC,Can't wait woohooo
killingfloor,3afkph,cheetah245,7,Sat Jun 20 11:00:09 2015 UTC,"I had this thought as well. Would help make the low health abilities less risky, though they might just remove those in the rework. Plus, it sort of fits the feel of the berzerker, IMO."
killingfloor,3afkph,Baner87,4,Fri Jun 19 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly all the low health perks need to be removed. Anything that disincentivizes healing is utterly dumb in a game where the only way to lose is to have everyone die. If they wanted to stick to the same concept they could make it so that if you lose XX% of your max health within the past YY seconds you get a buff, but in its current state its just too hard to keep up; any decent medic is going to keep your health above 90% at all times."
killingfloor,3afkph,KarateF22,3,Fri Jun 19 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly think giving the zerker a healing ability is a bad idea.   First of all, it just doesn't fit in with the class. A melee type that is able to heal itself? That would mean all the beserkers don't stick with the group anymore because they don't need them anymore.  Usually, a beserker relies on a medic, even if he is a skilled killer. These two classes go hand in hand with each other and are (in my opinion as a medic) a great combo and essential to the team.  When the beserker thinks that he can be a one man army because of his heals, the medic will become unnessesary and will loose his ""main source of income""."
killingfloor,3afkph,Subzer0o,2,Sat Jun 20 09:08:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think it necessarily has to play out like that. It would be pretty OP if zerk was able to heal all the damage he takes, but if he's able to heal, say, ten or twenty percent of the damage they'd usually take, it could simply encourage berzerkers to stay in the fray for longer and possibly encourage them to tank for other players more. Being in the fray more means more medic heals as well.  Or it could be something like giving health whenever you kill a unit."
killingfloor,3afkph,Baner87,2,Sat Jun 20 17:43:47 2015 UTC,"They did announce a rework to berzerker, I hope lifesteal is one of them."
killingfloor,3afkph,ShiningYoshi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"It would also completely eradicate any usefulness behind his already useless perks that increase damage and stagger rate based upon missing life percentages.  The only way to make the Berserker not useless beyond normal mode in this current state of the game is to give him +life per level and to give them around 40+hp per self heal.   If you could pop yourself to 60%+ with one heal you could safely stay around 20hp per wave, and ,ideally, since your max hp cap would be around 150-200, you'd do a shit ton of damage and stagger everything.  Though, as they've already stated they will completely revamp this garbage perk before release."
killingfloor,3afkph,Swake1988,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"the best way to make the berserker not a gigantic waste of time would be at least decreasing the cooldown between parrys. 2 seconds per parry is useless against a scrake on HOE. Zerkers, even skilled ones, are garbage. we cannot ""tank"" like people seem to think when it take 2 seconds to parry ONE ENEMY and if you miss you take an absurd amount of damage. The only useful thing erker can do is demolish clots, but is that really that useful? we die to everything that isn't a clot, even fucking bloats take extreme skill to kill."
killingfloor,3afkph,Paxconsciente,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:58:37 2015 UTC,Another interesting idea would be if one of his zed time upgrades was changed to greatly increase the percent of lifesteal. Say it was by default 25% or something and zed time increased it to 80%.

killingfloor,3aet3e,doomlord5,25,Fri Jun 19 15:23:05 2015 UTC,He's melee and has the least effective health + armor of all the classes.  How does that even make any sense?
killingfloor,3aet3e,Daxtreme,14,Fri Jun 19 15:29:40 2015 UTC,plus his perks (which are being reworked thank god) makes him stronger the closer you are to death. With only 5% dmg reduction you'll die in a second if you're below 30hp on suicidal/hoe
killingfloor,3aet3e,Nippahh,5,Fri Jun 19 17:49:22 2015 UTC,And everything not based around that is entirely situational or a chance-based bonus.  Support got an extra 50 health.  And I got a 10% chance to crit.  Fuck you.
killingfloor,3aet3e,Headsprouter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"I think they were aiming for more of a actual berserker.  Think Huskar from Dota 2.  Look at his higher level perk point things.  Lower health, more damage, lower health, more speed.  I like the idea of that a lot."
killingfloor,3aet3e,TheMNCloudMan,8,Tue Jun 30 18:36:05 2015 UTC,"If his damage resistance leveled, it would probably make his abilities that triggered with missing health more useful. As it stands, when he had a bonus with them, he's usually a hit away from dead."
killingfloor,3aet3e,Anolis_Gaming,7,Fri Jun 19 15:49:58 2015 UTC,Does anyone enjoy those mechanics anyway? They crop up in RPGs quite a bit and they always seem unpopular.
killingfloor,3aet3e,TeaL3af,8,Fri Jun 19 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of. Every time I see a skill that triggers when you're below a certain HP percentage, I leave them be because if something's gotten me that low, it's very capable of getting me the rest of the way down. If it offers increased resistance or healing at low HP, I might consider it, but ultimately opt for something less conditional."
killingfloor,3aet3e,CriticalDerp,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:05:06 2015 UTC,That's what huskar does in Dota: his q is a heal that increases healing the closer to death you are and his e is a passive that increases attack speed and magic resist as he loses hp
killingfloor,3aet3e,cha0sengineer,2,Sat Jun 27 00:32:08 2015 UTC,Only in turn based games especially tactical. Getting that extra damage to finish off a big guy before it's your healers turn can help a ton. In real time? Never.

killingfloor,3aet3e,jorgamun,3,Fri Jun 19 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, having a larger health pool gives you larger windows for those percentage of health based skills."
killingfloor,3aet3e,Centias,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:22:54 2015 UTC,im not even to fond of that skill myself i feel like the berserker wants to be able to take as much dmg as possible but if you need your self low it does not really fit seems like more of a skill for the ninja class thing they are going to make
killingfloor,3aet3e,Centias,4,Fri Jun 19 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely base survivability, but I think pretty much everyone already agrees on that. Berserker is meant to be up close and personal in most cases, and as such needs more damage reduction or health to suit that role. You should not be so completely reliant on blocking/parrying to live through the damage. Not saying you should be able to spam mouse 1 and face tank everything all day, but the damage reduction is nowhere near enough to cut it. Maybe 5% + 0.4% per level for a total of 15%, or even 5% + 0.6% per level for a total of 20%.    The parry window should be more forgiving or at least decided client-side, considering how often putting up your guard right before a scrake or fleshpound hits often doesn't result in a parry for whatever reason. Also probably shorter wait after dropping guard before you can put it back up again, so you can actually at least attempt to parry more than one zed's attacks.    Both of the ranged weapons could use better accuracy. The nailgun is reliable enough to hit, but not really reliable enough to get consistent headshots. It should be a suitable pistol replacement of sorts, but really it shoots too slow on single fire and can't pop heads like it should, so it's basically only useful when you can't get close or want to damage something before approaching. The Eviscerator seems to be like 50-50 on firing almost exactly where you're aiming or flinging the blade off at about 30 degrees and completely missing everything. Even when sitting completely still and crouching, it sometimes decides to fire blades way over the heads of zeds at medium-short range. They also for some reason seem to do less damage with each enemy they pass through, and will disappear completely after doing damage to three enemies or for no reason at all. Thus it ends up being like a short range only weapon purely because the shots are too random, which means the alt fire gets used a ton and runs out of gas way early, and the shots basically get reserved for any medium or heavy targets. And you pretty much have to use them sparingly, because they just love to land outside the playable area. The only redeemable qualities about this thing are that the V bash does 100 damage, the blades can be picked up again (if you're lucky), and one ammo box maxes out gas every single time.    I also think the EMP grenades could use a little boosting in some way or another, but they probably don't need too much more. They work well on scrakes, but why does it take two to calm down one fleshpound? The duration could also probably be a few seconds longer. With the short duration and fleshpounds taking two to calm down, the effect only seems to last two seconds on a fleshpound if one berserker throws both.    Lastly, berserker currently has a talent or two that will reduce incoming damage by attacking (targets you damage deal less damage), but I would like to see a talent that provides an offensive bonus for playing defensively. Something like, after you successfully parry an attack, your next (heavy) swing is 20% faster and deals 20% more damage. Something that lets you parry that attack, then retaliate with a big hit before going back on the defensive."
killingfloor,3aet3e,Anolis_Gaming,4,Fri Jun 19 16:20:31 2015 UTC,honestly i feel parry will fit the martial artist more and they should just make the beserker a tanky mofo
killingfloor,3aet3e,Anolis_Gaming,2,Fri Jun 19 16:35:43 2015 UTC,I think the MA should have a perk  where if the parry they get a powerful counter attack on the target (with invincibility frames)
killingfloor,3aet3e,Centias,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:27:11 2015 UTC,yeah parrying moving fast but not a tank like the berserker should be
killingfloor,3aet3e,Erik_Dolphy,3,Fri Jun 19 21:14:46 2015 UTC,But to comment on the ranged weapons I don't think they need to be able to headshot well or be that accurate because he is a melee based class overall and at least he has some ranged options now but I must say wtf is up with the first beserker skill just give more ranged weapon ammo I mean come on how does that fit at all
killingfloor,3aet3e,mmSNAKE,2,Fri Jun 19 18:30:37 2015 UTC,Yeah for his ONE gun.
killingfloor,3aet3e,Crayakk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'll clarify a little bit what I meant for the accuracy. I think the single fire for the nailgun should be suitable for consistent headshots. Obviously the scatter shot should not. For the Eviscerator, it should just be accurate enough to consistently body-shot an enemy from across a room like the really open one to the left in Biotics Lab if you stop (and maybe crouch), not really reliable for headshots all day. Just accurate to be sure you hit since it only gets 5 shots at a time.    Edit: Also the ammo perk is a weird one. It only gives you free starting ammo when you buy those weapons. I think it also gives you a couple charges for the hammer, but it mostly just saves you money filling up the ranged weapons."
killingfloor,3aet3e,mmSNAKE,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:37:16 2015 UTC,ah ok yeah i see what you mean i agree and i know right idk why that is a thing for him the ranged is like a side part of the class not the main focus
killingfloor,3aet3e,Anolis_Gaming,2,Sat Jun 20 01:30:52 2015 UTC,I think a faster syringe would go a long way.
killingfloor,3aet3e,Dicktron2000,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"This is a fair question I believe.  Is the berserker perk still supposed to be a heavy melee oriented perk or more engineer type perk? Reason I'm saying this is because they will supposedly add Martial artist already. I don't see a need to have two melee centered perks.   It's ok if Berserker still has melee options, just not focus as much on it as before. But at the same time, the name for the perk would not fit. So either make the perk true to it's name or change it into something else and have Martial Artist take over all our melee needs?  What does anyone else think on that?"
killingfloor,3aet3e,Retrikaethan,3,Fri Jun 19 16:05:19 2015 UTC,2 Melee perks would be perfectly fine in my opinion. There should be a big difference in the blunt and heavy melee weapons of the berzerker and the light and sharp MA melee weapons. This is the difference between the 2 classes that tripwire wants to come with. The berzerker can still be the more tanky of the two as long as they make the martial artist more agile.
killingfloor,3aet3e,Baner87,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"I mean that is ok. I don't have an issue with that. But also changing berserker to have a different role, say based on custom built gear (as he has now) with support and utility. And have Martial Artist be the melee is fine as well. In this case, I would rename Berserker to Engineer or something, and name the new perk Berserker and keep all the melee abilities and options."
killingfloor,3aet3e,Anolis_Gaming,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:20:34 2015 UTC,i agree but it seems they do not really have skill to support the tanky berserker they gave the tanky skills and heath per lvl to other classes that really dont make scene  with them
killingfloor,3aet3e,McStabYou,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:31:42 2015 UTC,+2% resistance per level and 1 hp per level. Regen ability needs a huge buff. Maybe have an ability that gives increased  attack speed and damage for every kill for a short period of time.
killingfloor,3aet3e,Laristopa,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:42:08 2015 UTC,health (or damage resistance) + speed
killingfloor,3aet3e,textbooksforrent,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:07:00 2015 UTC,Health and dmg resistance for sure maybe a heathregen skill and life steal could be cool but I think his speed the way it is is ok because the matcalartist should be fast then the beserker when it comes out imo
killingfloor,3aet3e,kkeyes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:22:44 2015 UTC,way too squishy. skill tree is a bit of a joke but that's getting changed so we'll see. health regen as is is completely terrible though. like 2hp every 5 seconds right? not worth the perk slot.
killingfloor,3aet3e,steelblade66,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:55:10 2015 UTC,The health regen would have to be better then that rate of course
killingfloor,3aet3e,M41A_Kore,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"Beyond survivability, which has been mentioned a ton, I think he could use a reliable tier 3/4 weapon, either by adding another or reworking the eviserator. As of now, I never feel the need to upgrade to it, I usually stick with the pulv and then buy a nailgun for range/bloats/husks and usually a medic pistol. The evicerator just feels silly and unsynergistic right now. The gas tank is small especially compared to how many saws you can shoot(plus you can pick them back up), the saws fly all over the place except where you want them to go, and what's the point of having a ranged stumble as a melee class?(You can stumble for your teammates, but on higher difficulties, they rage so early that I'd much rather just have a pulv). It's too heavy for you to carry anything beyond the crovel(which is pretty redundant, if not useless once yo have the evis), so you're not setting up for anything yourself, and since you can't parry wth it, you're fairly boned at close range versus FP and scrakes. Now, you can circle strafe and saw them to death, but that's a pretty lame mechanic compared to managing stumbles and parries. And on top of that, the block is even slow. Overall, it feels like it has no synergy; hope they're working on that in the next patch with the zerk rework.  Those are just my thoughts, though."
killingfloor,3aet3e,AbanoMex,2,Fri Jun 19 18:56:54 2015 UTC,I hate that damn weapon. I just stick with hammer and nailgun. I think he needs an alternate T4 that's a smacky weapon with a parry

killingfloor,3acara,kryb,47,Thu Jun 18 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"From what I understand non-shotgun weapons are hitscan when not in zed time, while all guns are ballistic in zed time. So it is annoying tbat zed time makes shooting harder, but most of the time it's not in effect. Correct me if I'm wrong."
killingfloor,3acara,mercurial_minnow,17,Thu Jun 18 23:29:38 2015 UTC,"You are correct; this issue has been brought up in threads many, many times now. Which speaks to how irksome an issue it is."
killingfloor,3acara,ArcTruth,11,Fri Jun 19 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, but a lot of people seem to think that bullets also move slowly out of Zed Time, because the tracers are slow and guns kick about quite a lot."
killingfloor,3acara,UnforseenConsequence,7,Fri Jun 19 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"There's something that doesn't quite feel right about the rifles in general.it just feels like individual bullets don't have impact. The best analogy I've seen is that it feels like an airsoft rifle instead of an actual rifle, that description is dead on."
killingfloor,3acara,HappyTopHatMan,4,Fri Jun 19 16:42:39 2015 UTC,Only up to the Bullpup in the rifles. Beyond that I think it's just the sound that makes it feel like that
killingfloor,3acara,NoGround,2,Fri Jun 19 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"The damage on them does feel rather low to me-- they also don't have much of a stumble effect.  Though, going back to KF1, they're largely the same there, just with louder sounds."
killingfloor,3acara,UnforseenConsequence,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:25:44 2015 UTC,It's less to do with what it does and more to do with just the feel of it. Maybe it is because the sounds not adequate or maybe is an issue of tweaking the animation and visible ballistics so they match better with the hitscan. I'm not sure what it is but they just don't feel right. I think the damage and stumble are fine.
killingfloor,3acara,HappyTopHatMan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:56:06 2015 UTC,"Hitscan just means that the outcome (whether the bullet hits or not) is determined the moment the weapon is fired; the game will consider both your projectile's velocity and the current velocity of the walking clot, and make a guess at the outcome. In some circumstances (a clot having an unexpected change in velocity) the game will guess the wrong outcome, and your projectile can hit or miss despite visually being the opposite.  tl;dr: muzzle velocity is relevant regardless of whether the guns are hitscan or not"
killingfloor,3acara,xFleury,2,Sat Jun 20 01:41:23 2015 UTC,I haven't heard that definition before and after some research I couldn't find any references to hitscan using properties of the target to determine a hit. Is this something that KF2/more recent games have started doing? If you've got any articles on it I am interesting in reading how it works.
killingfloor,3acara,mercurial_minnow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:34:41 2015 UTC,That sort of stuff is never used for hitscan weapons. The only time something like that would be used is for projectile weapons where the projectile is moving at extremely fast speeds.
killingfloor,3acara,UnluckyGhost,18,Sat Jun 20 15:27:09 2015 UTC,"Shotguns shoot projectiles true.  Bullets are projectiles only in zedtime.  The tracer you see when not in zedtime are just there for visual but it isn't the actual bullet.  I've had shots where the tracer misses but the zed still decaps.  With that said, the speed of the bullet during zed time does throw me off, but there are those in the forums saying they've gotten used to it and I've had a better time when I start thinking of bullets as medic darts from KF1 during that time.  But it would be nice to be able to turn that cool feature optional for the server.  I'd expect mods to be created in the near future."
killingfloor,3acara,Kuebic,4,Thu Jun 18 23:30:27 2015 UTC,"That disconnect though is just weird and shouldn't be there. It makes the rifles feel off compared to other weapons, like they lack any sort of impact."
killingfloor,3acara,HappyTopHatMan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"I think it would be good if all bullet weapons used projectiles at all times, so that way you need to lead as much in normal time as you do in zed time.  This assumes that the bullet speeds are a realistic speed."
killingfloor,3acara,Tommygun329,10,Fri Jun 19 23:23:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I would say the ballistics suck ass, but I do find them very frustrating on occasion.  The impossibly slow bullet speed during zed time is very annoying. Sure, you can pull off some impressive shots when you hip-fire a clot's head off while strafing, but when I aim at a clot's head and pull the trigger, he should not be able to walk 4 feet out of danger by the time the bullet crosses the room. I swear, the Doom Guy runs faster than the bullets travel in zed-time.  Also, I find the server-side hit detection very annoying. Having hitscan weapons is completely pointless if you have to lag-lead them. This is with a 60ms ping, too. Not sure what the fix is, but it bugs me enough that I only play single player unless I'm partied with a friend."

In KF, Zed time was that moment where you could chain headshots in a pack of gore fast 50m away and chain 10 kills in a row. Now Zed time is more a pain that anything when shooting a rifle, and it's even more absurd since commando can extend zed time."

killingfloor,3aee69,kdpha,2,Sun Jun 21 12:21:50 2015 UTC,They haven't announce when the new PhysiX will be incorporated. IMO it would make sense to add it during early access to see bugs and performance issue it causes before releasing the full game. Not to mention update system requirements before going full release.   My guess is over the next few months.

killingfloor,3ab1iw,okungnyo,15,Thu Jun 18 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"For the lazy:   First, I want to say that I dislike those servers myself and I don't want to see them during Early Access. 12+ player server is nothing but noob factory: there is no balance, there is no skill, there is just a dumb shooting. Most of people who are playing on such servers are noobs, they have no idea how the game must be played and they will always remain noobs, even after 1000+ gameplay hours. (I'd say ""no offence"", but it is actually an offence despite being a truth at the same time)  But who cares? Those people bought the game as everybody else did, most likely they will be buying upcoming DLCs as well. Then why TWI should care how they are playing the game? If people like enjoying brainless gunporn 24/7, then so be it! If they want 20 players shooting at one direction, then so be it! If they want to collect 100 players together and dying of boredom, then so be it!  People like watching gunplay (which is awesome in KF2) and get rewarded for doing that (XP progress). Then why to restrict it? You (Tripwire) can achieve both at the same time: balance the game for normal 6p servers and just allow those crazy servers. Let's face it: without ServerPerks KF1 would be dead a few years ago. There is no ServerPerks for KF2 [yet], and limiting player count to 6 is alienating a huge amount of players. Look at steam stats: 7+ server restriction almost halved the amount of KF2 players.  My suggestions:   Keep mod whitelist. Allow XP progress on 7+ player servers. Reduce XP gain on 7+p servers. For example, every player over 6 reduces XP gain by 1/6, i.e. XP progress on 12 player server is twice slower (e.g. Crawler kill gives +5XP instead of 10), 24p server: 4x slower (Crawler kill gives only +2XP), 60p server - 10x slower (Crawler kill gives only +1XP). Allow setting MaxPlayers above 6 and MaxMonsters above 32 in server config [and WebAdmin]. Boost zed spawn rate according to current player count on server. This will allow hosting ""crazy servers"" without using additional mutators and make such games more entertaining before KF2 releases of ServerPerks and ScrnBalance."
killingfloor,3ab1iw,MrMustangg,6,Thu Jun 18 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that you wouldn't even have to lower the xp gained from those servers.  Sometimes it's hard even in 6 player rooms to get a decent amount of kills.  6+ player rooms could really open the game up to some big survival scenarios where entire maps could be defended, but that much easier to lose if everyone isn't defending the right points.  Although having zeds spawn willy nilly around every corner would be annoying."

killingfloor,3aftsm,BcKazdee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:36:09 2015 UTC,"Killing floor is very fun, very beautiful, and has tons of replay ability. But, it can be an acquired taste. Many people, including myself, weren't huge fans of the game during the first hour or two of game play, but once you get a feel for things and fall in love with the progression, it is a game you can play forever. I have 300 hours on KF1."
killingfloor,3aftsm,BcKazdee,2,Fri Jun 19 20:40:32 2015 UTC,But what Is the progression like? It is just levels?
killingfloor,3aftsm,idonthateyouanymore,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:26:43 2015 UTC,"There are 25 levels. Every 5 levels you can choose between two perks, and once the full release happens, every level will make your classes guns cheaper, allowing you to get your favorite guns faster ."
killingfloor,3aftsm,Anolis_Gaming,2,Sat Jun 20 21:10:19 2015 UTC,So levels will reset when the full game comes out ?
killingfloor,3aftsm,TownieMesiah,2,Sun Jun 21 13:19:11 2015 UTC,Nope! TW said recently (I think at E3?) that level progression won't reset
killingfloor,3aftsm,aPinata,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"I thought killing floor was a good idea, but the engine was shit and the hit detection was ultimately what prevented me from really delving into it, except a few times when friends asked me too. I've already put 27 hours into KF2 (and I'm very busy with work and school) so I'd say this is going to be one of those games I sink tons of time into. I can honestly say I enjoy it more than the left 4 dead games, mostly likely because its more fun to play with PUGs so I can play it constantly. Also the progression helps give me a reason to play it over and over. Oh yeah and the hit detection is FUCKING GREAT."
killingfloor,3aftsm,Corey307,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:23:29 2015 UTC,"This thread is a little old but I thought I'd give you a little snippet of my opinion as I just took the game and bought it for both myself and a few friends. I played Killing Floor 1 for just enough time to where I could say I'd seen all there is to see as I hated the game. It lacked the technical magic and addicting simplicity of other survival games like Left 4 Dead. It was gritty and dark and just lacked the soul that I look for in games (completely opinionated). Killing Floor 2 however mopped up everything that I didn't like about 1. The graphics are tight, the enemy design makes them easily distinguishable from one another, the shop is well designed, the netcode seems to be super stable, the levels are laid out in a way that makes them feel intricate and nuanced. I could go on.  If you are in the market for a co-op shooter you won't find one better than this that's released so recently.  The only downside, and I mean only, is the current lack of content. With 5 maps, 4 perks, and a handful of weapons the game just feels really incomplete.   Luckily for us Tripwire is known for the rate at which they can produce content and it's been stated before that the DLC approach to KF2 will be more free focused and less paid. For 23 dollars (current sale) you won't get your money's worth in terms of physical content, yet. But it's coming, and what's int he game right now feels fucking awesome. Tight controls, weight to your guns and character, well designed levels and enemies. It's the whole package, once the rest of the package comes out."
killingfloor,3aftsm,Retrikaethan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:51:59 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with developers is when they say they will do it, but end up taking longer than expected or longer than they should in order to release it.  As a game developer my self I know it takes very long with all the modeling animations level creation (I used Unreal Engine 4.8) but some companies/businesses whatever take far too long to release something. This is why I don't trust in the Early access as much as I should. But Yes you are right, I had similar dislikes from KF1 and Kf2 fixed them all. Ive purchased the game 2 days ago and already have 12 hours into it. Thats half of what I have on KF1."
killingfloor,3aftsm,Retrikaethan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:29:23 2015 UTC,I think it's really fun and worth full price even in the current state. Yes it could do with more things but I've already played enough to make it worth the purchase.  I like the game because I like the MEAT system in it's entirety and I like just always having to keep the awareness that if I don't stop moving I'm most likely gonna die
killingfloor,3adve6,eejoseph,14,Fri Jun 19 09:04:22 2015 UTC,Bad answer: This isn't call of duty/battlefield  Actual answer: KF2 seems to maintain much in the same vein as the original. I too would like to see some customizability (sights etc.) but that isn't the focus of the game. It's power is in the simplicity. The silky smooth buttery simplicity. I think the current priority is on mechanics and new content
killingfloor,3adve6,chikkaloscolab,13,Fri Jun 19 09:39:10 2015 UTC,"We don't need weapon customization yet, we need all the perks, zeds and more maps before we need any cosmetic customization. Customization should not be a priority now...."
killingfloor,3adve6,sissichu,3,Fri Jun 19 10:44:16 2015 UTC,"There isn't weapon customization because in the case of a class like commando, it causes all the rifles to act too similarly and they lose their mechanics and purpose. The different scopes help balance and give a unique feel to each weapon while adding visual/use pros/cons to it. It's actually part of the game balance."
killingfloor,3adve6,HappyTopHatMan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:48:02 2015 UTC,Well it also makes it easier to distinguish each gun if they have different scopes
killingfloor,3adve6,ANEPICLIE,2,Fri Jun 19 22:50:07 2015 UTC,"They said in a dev diary they choose weapon attachments specific to the gun. The Varmint has crappy iron sights because it's the first and cheapest rifle. That's part of the balance of the game.  Edit: It may have actually been TotalBiscuit's video in which they said that, not sure..."
killingfloor,3adve6,IsaacWest,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:29:42 2015 UTC,"Adding  functionality would change the balance of weapons. AR does not have sights, if it did it would be far easier to aim with. It would be an overall better weapon than it is. As it stands the sights are obtrusive and difficult at times to manage. That is a trade off for the large magazine and how many enemies it can kill, for a starting weapon without special circumstances.  Flash light is the same thing. I'm guessing it goes into trade off to weapons that do have it AND the silly option for night vision."

killingfloor,3aa9qn,qqnowqq,4,Thu Jun 18 14:47:03 2015 UTC,Hopefully it does come back. I think they might have removed it from the other perks because they want everyone to have unique grenades.
killingfloor,3aa9qn,TeaL3af,2,Thu Jun 18 17:13:30 2015 UTC,They might not though in order to prevent the all-in-one explosion dump to kill hans on his first level like we used to do to patty.
killingfloor,3aa9qn,HappyTopHatMan,2,Fri Jun 19 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"I guess that depends on how his damage resistance kicks in, because he's basically indestructible when he activates his damage resistance."
killingfloor,3aa9qn,TeaL3af,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:15:41 2015 UTC,"Not that you'd notice, from the way people play..."
killingfloor,3aa9qn,richertai,2,Sun Jun 21 09:25:55 2015 UTC,"It seems like in general they wanted to lower the damage output of everyone across the board, and this is just a part of that.  Also if you could stack zerker nades you could instantly calm a raging fleshpound.   do you think it will be a skill?    Maybe for the demo.  That seems likely."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,imakeelyu,54,Thu Jun 18 02:47:29 2015 UTC,A free content pack is a pack of content that comes as a free update. Just like a regular patch update.  Somehow people believe that it's something that they have to pay extra for.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Kiskavia,25,Thu Jun 18 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"Well what I saw is people thinking Tripwire worded it as ""Free dlc"" or ""free content update"" on purpose to pave the way for paid dlc, and that perks would be locked behind said paid dlcs.  I just think people are rather unfairly jumping to conclusions and accusing them of a crime they haven't even had a chance to commit yet.   And I want to remind people that Tripwire has shown themselves to handle DLC and content updates well in the past."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Ihmhi,9,Thu Jun 18 04:02:54 2015 UTC,"Well, Tripwire used to just do skins and free content updates and then they started selling guns. Granted it was a sticky situation considering they were community-made, but I feel the concerns are justified because of this."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Kvasir94,3,Thu Jun 18 07:02:48 2015 UTC,"Right.  It's totally understandable to be concerned, but I was just shocked so many people upvoted a post that essentially accused Tripwire of lying and cheating us."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,qqnowqq,2,Thu Jun 18 16:56:58 2015 UTC,They never sold perks or maps so that's pretty invalid. Those packs added some mostly gimmicky weapons for a few classes. They were also community made weapons and late in the game's life.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Kvasir94,4,Thu Jun 18 08:07:04 2015 UTC,Some of those weapons oh so heavily changed metagames though. And the ones that didn't are largely ignored for being gimmicky side-or-down-grades.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,qqnowqq,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:18:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the lever action 2.0 and nuke pistol were definitely a step too far as well as any other stuff that was OP I forgot about."

killingfloor,3a8p4n,kabrandon,-1,Fri Jun 19 00:57:25 2015 UTC,The dlc weapons didn't change much. Maybe berserker with the buzzbow but the lever action is better in most cases anyway. The game wasn't any easier with the dlc weapons.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,qqnowqq,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"The scythe was good for tanking scrakes on the harder difficulties. And imo had a better cleaving AoE than the other weapons. True, the Claymore was better for scrakes, but I felt like the scythe was better for taking on herds."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Hulkkis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:55:17 2015 UTC,Ha.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Ihmhi,4,Thu Jun 18 19:34:46 2015 UTC,The day they started selling weapons that were upgrades to stock weapons was the day i uninstalled. I hope the same does not happen to the sequel.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Apocalypse1950,6,Thu Jun 18 08:27:36 2015 UTC,"IMO the only thing that was a straight upgrade was the Flare Gun. There wasn't anything comparable. The rest seemed very side-gradey to me.  Still, it's the principle of the thing."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,kabrandon,6,Thu Jun 18 10:46:15 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure the berzerker buzzsaw bow has no counterpart in the KF base game. Its the ONLY ranged berzerker weapon before KF2.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,ZeldenGM,2,Thu Jun 18 11:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the buzzsaw bow was kind of awful compared to the normal xbow. And the melee berserker weapons beat out the buzzsaw bow in terms of dps, and heavy enemy tanking anyway."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,kabrandon,7,Thu Jun 18 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"It's a bit stupid that people are bitching about this. Paid for gun DLC came out like 6-7 years after KF1 came out. In that time you had countless free updates with extra perks, maps, events, characters, game-modes etc etc etc  The game itself was dirt cheap and frequently on sale, you could pick up copies for tuppence.  The DLC prices were also always low and very much affordable. The game and all the DLC packs amounts to less than the full price of most base games.  Consider that a game of this age that wanted to continued financial support needed to put out DLC with a price tag every now and again.  Killing floor DLC is best DLC. Cheap, affordable, and in most cases neglible impact to gameplay. Add to the fact that it was spread out over a period of fucking ages.  Yet some people have still got their knickers in twist..."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Ihmhi,4,Thu Jun 18 14:20:45 2015 UTC,"I picked up Killing Floor for like $3, and spent over 100 hours on it before even buying a single dlc. Based on that alone, I have no doubts about Tripwire being a legit business."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,HappyTopHatMan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:52:30 2015 UTC,It's not about the cost or spending the money. I bought every skin pack to support Tripwire even though I pretty much use the EOD skin all the time. It's about the principle of segregating the community between haves and have-nots.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Ihmhi,2,Fri Jun 19 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"As long as they stay away from the community gun packs, that won't be an issue."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,HappyTopHatMan,2,Fri Jun 19 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind community guns, even. I just think they could have handled it better. Make alternate skins (like they've been doing with the golden skins and whatnot). Release the guns to the playerbase and pay the creators with the income from the alternate skins. Everybody wins."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,ZeldenGM,2,Fri Jun 19 17:01:49 2015 UTC,I just meant stuff like the flare revolvers. That was a pretty mandatory upgrade for the firebugs it felt like instead of a side-grade like the thompson.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Hulkkis,0,Fri Jun 19 17:07:09 2015 UTC,Community was never segregated. All the maps were free and people without the weapons could see the dlc weapons AND use them if someone threw one for them.  The game was perfectly playable without the extra weapons.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,alive442,0,Fri Jun 19 19:21:52 2015 UTC,yep and i was a firebug main
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Ihmhi,-1,Thu Jun 18 11:18:40 2015 UTC,I feel people are getting worked up over something that doesn't exist. They labeled the update so that it was clear that it was free in a time where new perks/maps/weapons aren't usually free. Unbunch those panties and quit complaining about things that don't even exist.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,itonlygetsworse,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but the fact that games can get away with selling maps nowdays is pretty terrible - especially if you're a gamer from the era where most games wouldn't even think of doing something like that.  If there's even the slightest hint of DLC fuckery you need to shout it down and loudly or things are just gonna keep getting shittier for the consumer IMO."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,captaincannibal,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:04:20 2015 UTC,Look. Its 2015. We don't live in the past. If they want to use marketing buzzwords that's fine. But look at the reaction. They should probably rethink how they communicate with their customers. Its not hard. That's it. They don't need to change anything except the thesaurus they are using.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Rodario,2,Fri Jun 19 07:30:58 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, I think people are just confused by how they worded it. Its just another big update. They're not saying that the other perks are going to be DLC in the traditional sense. Its all just coming in various big updates just like you'd expect."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Rodario,2,Thu Jun 18 11:18:33 2015 UTC,"A free content pack is a pack of content that comes as a free update.   The content is part of the release version of the game. It's not free, it's just included in the package some people already payed for."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,troglodyte,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:55:51 2015 UTC,"Being included in the package also counts as free right?  The thing is we're just arguing semantics really, over what is probably going to amount to nothing.  I don't see Tripwire forcing us to pay for future perks."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,qqnowqq,2,Thu Jun 18 17:34:13 2015 UTC,"Being included in the package also counts as free right?   Actually not. That package goes for $27 currently.   The thing is we're just arguing semantics really   That is true. In the realm of marketing and community management semantics do count quite a bit, though."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,TheRegretfulBandit,2,Thu Jun 18 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"I understand the concern, though. Here's the thing: this isn't post-launch support; it's content they owe us from their early access promises. It's a little different than a post-launch update in that regard, and while I don't think it's a problem, it does seem a little bit cheeky to advertise it like ""OMG FREE STUFF!!!!"" when it's not free, it's content we paid for when we bought in early to fund their development.  As I say, overall, not even slightly concerned and I understand why they did it, just breaking down why people are upset or nervous."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,BlunTman805,8,Thu Jun 18 16:28:30 2015 UTC,"People are freaking out about the wrong thing. It was justfied (arguably poorly) that they considered wording it this way especially for e3 to show new audiences that we will be getting more free content eventually. I don't think anyone is complaining that the upcoming content may not be free (lol), but people are understandably worried that TW is already paving the way for DLC soon even though it's still in EA when we're already lacking so much content and polish. Despite the circumstances, they don't seem to have any shady intentions (but still expect paid DLC sometime during full release ofc).   What people should be worried about is that we didn't see any other demo weapons! That trailer mostly showed off a trenchgun that operated pretty much the same as before. It should have shown off explosives on fleshpounds or more demo weapons!"
killingfloor,3a8p4n,Tim_Fragmagnet,17,Thu Jun 18 08:29:21 2015 UTC,"PC gamers love to freak the fuck out over NOTHING.  The sooner you learn this, the better.  You'll go insane if you keep paying attention to the whinge of the week from this community.  Just ignore it."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,ScrewSamIWantKF2,18,Thu Jun 18 08:36:11 2015 UTC,DLC shouldn't even be mentioned when this game is still in early access.
killingfloor,3a8p4n,MsgGodzilla,9,Thu Jun 18 06:03:39 2015 UTC,"exactly what I was thinking.  It's content confirmed to be vanilla in the final game so I don't see why it would have to be in a ""content pack"" and not an ""update"".  They definitely could have phrased it better.  TLDR: Content packs come AFTER the game has been released. Free or not. Call them updates BEFORE the release."
killingfloor,3a8p4n,I_lurk_subs,8,Thu Jun 18 07:08:44 2015 UTC,"This was my concern. Why is it a ""Free content pack"" when the game isn't finished yet."

killingfloor,3a725b,wrightosaur,56,Wed Jun 17 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"They made a point to mention ""free"" because it was a presentation at a high profile event where a lot of the people watching may have no knowledge of the game, making sure they didn't come to the false conclusion that tripwire are pulling similar marketing to the game evolve.  There's no indication that this is some sort of prophecy for a slew of paid DLC.  For the record, you aren't ""entitled"" to anything - tripwire can charge what they want for whatever they want.  As a customer, you obviously have a expectation that they will deliver what they have said, but if last year is anything to go by you should reserve these opinions.  HOWEVER, having said that, a quick look at killing floor 1's track record will give you a good indication of their intentions - they released a huge amount of content for free for the game for years after it was released.  They have clearly put a tremendous amount of effort into Killing Floor 2, and charge half of what every other game does at the moment.  Therefore I am very optimistic that Tripwire will put out good content, mostly free, as soon as it is ready.  Stop focusing on the way you think they are ""marketing"" the game and try making meaningful suggestions to improve the game, which they have proven that they're listening to."
killingfloor,3a725b,Smowy,3,Wed Jun 17 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"This would have happened either way. When their business strategy is to release  the game early access (either to fund the game because they needed more money or to get player feedback and some idea of how popular it might be or a combination of things) 6-8 months before release, people will get tired and will lost trust if they don't get updates every 2 weeks. Monthly updates are not good enough for games that are promising content. 3 out of 4 games on Steam that are early access never finish.   At the end of the day its a good thing that consumers aren't trusting anything and are not happy with statements like these EVEN if the history of the company has done good things. Why should the past be any real indicator of the future when game companies routinely screw people out of their money on promises. This doesn't happen that often on a daily basis for most normal people out there buying goods and services. This was just a mistake on how they worded their intentions but people pointing it out are right. Keep companies honest by bitching as much as possible."

killingfloor,3a725b,phil035,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:22:17 2015 UTC,"Prison Architect is a completely different game. In KF2 you get 4 maps and only a few classes to play with, against a select amount of Zed's. In Prison Architect you get alot of replayability because it's more of a ""Manager"" game, where every time you play the game can be vastly different. In KF2, your games are  going to be pretty much the same, except with a different class and holding out in a different spot."

killingfloor,3a725b,phil035,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"So you'd end up waiting an entire month for an annoying bug to get fixed, because it wasn't bad enough for a hit-fix patch. I prefer developers releasing their stuff when they feel it's finished. Less stress on the devs to finish something before the deadline, less broken dreams for the players because the devs couldn't finish something on-time."
killingfloor,3a725b,terrordrone_nl,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:08:06 2015 UTC,How does a monthly update schedule prevent the devs from releasing a smaller bugfix patch? This point seems terribly irrelevant. Valve hasn't pushed a big update for Dota before the Source 2 update but they still tried to (and did release) bug fixes when they could.  Fortnightly or monthly update doesn't matter as long as the content is good and satisfies expectations.

Do you think you guys could have said it was ""coming in the next update"" without saying ""free content pack""? Saying ""free content pack"" almost implies you're getting ready to shell out paid DLC too. I think as long as you omit the words ""pack"" and ""dlc"" from press statements, people will assume it's free anyway. x-x"

Which on one hand I wouldn't begrudge them, but on the other hand it's a bit backhanded.  Your game is in Early Access, essentially beta stage since it's missing the majority of classes still. What is coming is an update to this beta, nothing more. To call it a content pack, let alone a ""free"" content pack is just ridiculous.  But whatever gets press at E3 goes I guess."

Just a semantics issue but just because some people already payed for it doesn't make it free. It's part of the feature set people are promised for buying the game.
killingfloor,3a725b,Rodario,9,Thu Jun 18 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"""Some of those will assume the content is paid and blast us for that""  What? Seriously? There are a ton of Early Access games on Steam that regularly update without specifying every single time ""This is free!"" They don't get blasted every update, and if a few misinformed people decide to slander a company for not saying an update toward a completed version of the game that is already paid for is free they're not going to be taken seriously by the masses. This doesn't seem like any sort of real excuse to call this ""Free Content"" to me."
killingfloor,3a725b,FencesInARow,13,Wed Jun 17 20:37:06 2015 UTC,Not everyone that saw that video know that the game is in early access. It's good to be specific that the new content they are releasing is free.
killingfloor,3a725b,Stinkis,-1,Wed Jun 17 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yep they don't know how to do PR at all. Messed up during E3 (see this thread regardless of how people feel, the fact is people looking at this subreddit will see this thread). Could have said ""Of course this update is provided for free for those of you wondering if you have to pay extra. Join us in KF2 through the early access program today! We have tons of more content planned prior to release."" But nope, instead they tried to sell it like its free DLC.  And then a dev responds (good) but basically puts out an excuse (a poor one ""oh we'll get blasted). Basically he's saying getting blasted on reddit and elsewhere is better than not covering other bases to make sure people know its free. Sounds like a failure of understanding how to communicate to your consumers who already spent money on this game AND to people out there.  Lastly the fact that Doom 4 reveled is making a lot of people compare Doom 4's gore system and look/feel to KF2. KF2 better step it up or this game is totally going to be overshadowed when it releases for real."

killingfloor,3a725b,FencesInARow,2,Thu Jun 18 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"They plan to release at the end of 2015.  Its not like we have anything at that time period... Fallout 4...Dark Souls 3....  I sure hope they know what they are doing instead of get some random excuse everytime. There is no reason to NOT tell people that's an update, a big update, or a gigantic update. Because it is an update. Nobody will assume an ""update"" will be charged with any amount of money because updates comes with the game, on every game.  We appreciate any kinds of update but please dont call it like its an extra thing we are getting for free. Its the missing content that is supposed to be added."

What I assume you guys meant is that they're coming as a part of the next big update/content update. Wording like that would be fine.  That said, people are seriously overreacting to it. I'm assuming they're all new to KF considering how long and how hard you guys worked to support the first game."

An ""Update"" doesn't come with any controversial ambiguities.  Releasing an update is also the correct nomenclature, considering that the game is in Early Access.  We gave you money for an unfinished game.  Any implication of releasing core-game content (e.g. Perks) at a price--at this stage of development--will be met with outrage, and that anger will be justified."
killingfloor,3a725b,ChipJiggins,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"It's awesome to see a post from Tripwire Interactive on this. It's refreshing when a developer is so active in keeping in touch with their community.  From your post, I understand that it can be very difficult find the best way to bring certain points across to a community that is this passionate. From my point of view, you have this statement out there that has raised uncertainty with a portion of the community. Regardless of what could have been done to be more clear or what difficulties game developers face with communicating certain hot topics, my opinion is that the uncertainty needs to be settled.  I feel that a quick comment from Tripwire Interactive that clarifies what was meant by John Gibson's presentation will go a long way with the community.  Regardless, I'm super excited about the upcoming updates and appreciate the effort you are putting in to make this title stand out.

If I didn't own this game already, I'd be more impressed by the wording of a content pack than just an ""update"", and that's the point, considering it was an E3 Presentation after all.  EDIT: Plus, TW has explicitly and repeatedly stated that no game-balance related content (guns, perks, maps, etc) will ever be paid, it will all be cosmetic, so you think they'd suddenly change their entire stance during an E3 show?

killingfloor,3a725b,Misoru,5,Wed Jun 17 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of connotation vs. denotation. Literally speaking, everything they said made sense. The connotation of their word choice, however, implies the existence of ""payed content packs"" of similar scope and design relatively soon.

killingfloor,3a725b,itonlygetsworse,2,Wed Jun 17 20:15:58 2015 UTC,"You're arguing semantics. ""Content pack"" implies (to most people, based off this subreddit) DLC or some kind of ""extra"" content from the base game. KF2 should not have any ""content packs"" at this stage of the game, because the full game hasn't been released. A better choice of words would have been simply ""update"", which is what it is."

Other examples from E3:  Blizzard said their new Heroes of the Storm game (released 2 weeks ago) has a ""brand new expansion coming to it"" which is basically 1 new map. Patches/updates does not = expansion. Its fucking dishonest marketing but I guess dumb consumers these days throw their money around so much its worth it to distort the meaning of what expansions are in the gaming industry?  Dirty Bomb advertising ""sign up now and get a free DLC character"".  ""Free DLC!!!"" - a bunch of companies  etc"

There's nothing to complain about. They used one word, ""free"", that you didn't like, they didn't charge you, or drop something they promised, or pull some sly move, like a lot of companies have recently. They're doing an incredible job with this game and it's content, cut them some slack and instead of creating a new thread for every one syllable word that upsets you, enjoy the game."
killingfloor,3a725b,BcKazdee,2,Wed Jun 17 22:30:00 2015 UTC,"To me, this sets the tone that they're going to charge us a lot for updates once the game is out. That's the part that's a little unnerving. When a game is in early access, people pay with the expectation that the game will continue to be updated and they will be a part of the process of the game reaching version 1.0 . Calling an update toward version 1.0 a ""Free content"" pack is downright greedy, acting like they are being generous when really they are just giving us what we have already paid for."
killingfloor,3a725b,FencesInARow,9,Wed Jun 17 23:16:47 2015 UTC,"I totally understand the concern, but as a veteran of killing floor 1 I can promise you that they will charge for content updates, but not until after full release. Whenever new guns were put into the game, a pack of four to six weapons were put on sale from around $1 - $6. But, you have to think of it from their perspective. They kept killing floor one fully functional and constantly updated and patched for years after its initial release and in order to do this you need money. By charging a small fee for large new weapon packs, they were able to keep the game afloat. This very well could change due to how much more money KF2 will and already has brought in. But, the inference is that they will continue the large, yet cheap, paid content updates. So yes, eventually we will get charged, but no, not until full release and it won't break the bank."
killingfloor,3a725b,HappyTopHatMan,6,Wed Jun 17 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I didn't have a problem with their practices in DLC in the first game and if the 2nd game follows that practice I won't have a problem with it either. I guess it's just the fact that everyone expects updates in early access, but from what they called it it sounds like they're trying to sell it to us like it's this unexpected, nice thing they are doing for us."
killingfloor,3a725b,BcKazdee,5,Wed Jun 17 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"The problem is they used the wrong wording, they were trying to advertise (which, lets face the facts, E3 is a giant advertisement campaign, that's why it exists) and everyone is grabbing pitch forks because they're reading into this like an english major reading a novel.

From how Tripwire has worked on previous project I would highly doubts them putting up DLC before the game even comes out. It is just bad marketing."
killingfloor,3a725b,Kuebic,6,Wed Jun 17 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"This thread right here is the exact reason so many devs fear interacting with their customers AT ALL.  You are seriously complaining about THE WORDS THEY USED when talking about the content update. Despite the fact that you are categorically wrong, you are throwing a hissy fit because you are unsatisfied with the nomenclature they described the update with. Is it a content pack? Does it cost money for people who already own KF2? Then why, ""for fuck's sake,"" is Free Content Pack anything but 100% true?  Seriously get bent, OP, and keep up the awesomeness, Tripwire."
killingfloor,3a725b,WufeiZhang,2,Thu Jun 18 11:35:25 2015 UTC,"Based on how TWI has worked in the past, I think that word choice comes from past experiences, since they're doing what they've always done in the past.  Early access or not, all their past games have been released and evolved from player input and have constantly added high quality ""free content packs"" even years after a game's release.  Killing floor 1, originally launched with 5 maps and roughly 15 weapons was Early Access before it was even a thing.  It was probably dead couple months after release.  It went through a major balance overhaul couple years after release with added perk (demo), difficulty (Hell on Earth), zeds (husk), perk level (level 6), and constant weapons and maps added with holiday events and that is what gave it the community of players today.  Red Orchestra 2 when released could also be considered early access before it was a thing.  It flopped so hard they spent a good part of the year and millions of dollars to get it back on its feet.  The main gripe you have is that ""it's still in Early Access"" and shouldn't be calling it ""free content pack"".  True, this is the first time they've been able to slap the stamp of Early Access onto their game and make it clear for everyone the game is evolving, but they're doing nothing different.    I see it as everyone looking too deeply into their word choices even though they're still the same TWI.  It doesn't friggin matter what they call this new content.  This is their game and they're updating it."
killingfloor,3a725b,Xdeser2,4,Thu Jun 18 08:01:59 2015 UTC,You're right.  I hope tripwire charges me for it so I can support the game I love playing!

killingfloor,3a725b,BahamutxD,3,Wed Jun 17 21:55:00 2015 UTC,No it is not. It's a pack of content that comes in a free and regular update. Is it really that hard to understand what it means?  I swear that people like you hate on anything that is a positive thing.  Get your head out of your ass.
killingfloor,3a725b,HappyTopHatMan,5,Wed Jun 17 21:22:31 2015 UTC,"Aslong as it's free content it's fine. The problem comes when they start charging and they have not done that YET.  Being in the E3 with millions watching, maybe they just wanted to make clear that they are releasing that for FREE."
killingfloor,3a725b,MrSoupSox,-11,Wed Jun 17 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, you don't understand the point.  It's not free, it's an update.  Imagine if Minecraft started calling every update ""A FREE, NO MONEY CONTENT PACK"".  no, an update is an udpate. This shit should be an update, it's not a content pack. The game is polished by nowhere close to finished yet, so calling updates ""content packs"" is really really stupid."
killingfloor,3a725b,Nbaysingar,9,Thu Jun 18 00:54:55 2015 UTC,"No, you don't understand the point. It is an update, updates have content, they want people who were curious (and maybe not familiar with steam EA and pc gaming in general) to understand its being worked on and more stuff is coming outside of a DLC structure. Stop making a big deal out of a poor word choice. You're acting like a freshman English major reading too deeply into Shakespeare."

Hence the rage. Completely understandable. Even if they don't intend to try and sell packs during development, it was a pretty silly decision."

killingfloor,3a8my7,MrRotch61,4,Thu Jun 18 04:06:23 2015 UTC,IMHO the only dlc that is truly useful is the first community weapon pack for the flare guns.  Everything except for the 3 community weapon packs are skins/reskins.  What time zone are you in? PM me if you want to play.

killingfloor,3a8my7,Kuebic,3,Thu Jun 18 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"For 95% of the weapons: aim for the head.  Most of the things you find in guides are what people picked up on as they played, so I'm sure 90% of the things you read you'll figure out yourself pretty soon, especially if you play with other experienced players.  Feel free to ask them relevant questions as most people I've played with are happy to help answer with their experience.  After all, it is a co-op game :D  As for DLC: the community weapon packs are the only ones that'll have a slight impact on your gameplay.  Keep in mind others with the DLC can buy the weapons and drop them for you if you ask nicely.  Everything else is just cosmetics. I'd suggest getting them in a bundle once they go on sale.  It often goes for sale 75% off (last time was late march 2015), but currently it's only 50%.  But either way, even though you won't get another base game, if you want all the DLC, bundle will save you a ton of money.  http://store.steampowered.com/sub/52870/"

killingfloor,3a7vua,asexyalien,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"I would love to be able to at least take ammo from a gun I already have if I run over the same gun on the ground. This would work nicely for early waves when using something like the AR15 if you keep finding nothing but more AR15s. It could help even more on the boss wave when you buy a bunch of AA12s and leave them all over the ground since you wouldn't need to stop, drop the empty AA12, and pick up another. Though it might create some confusion for someone else picking up an empty weapon, that shouldn't be a problem very often. I don't think it should work for different weapons unless they definitely use the same ammo.    I'm also hopeful that the teleporting zeds either gets removed, or the minimum distance a target teleport location can be from a play and time before a zed will try to teleport both doubled. Also, any zed that is raging/charging should not be able to teleport at all, namely Scrake and Fleshpound as obvious examples, but just in case, also any Husk going for a suicide rush. It might also be worth adding something like ""any zed under XX % health can not teleport."""
killingfloor,3a7vua,Centias,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:34:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe from a balance perspective, they don't want ammo to be too numerous. In later waves, if you see a tier 1 weapon, tripwire expects you to drop your current higher tier weapon and pick up the tier 1 depending on situation. Although players already leave 1 zed alive then run around the map to essentially get unlimited free ammo in some way."
killingfloor,3a7vua,shamoke,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:51:24 2015 UTC,"Well shotguns can't always use ammo of the same gauge since you have different lengths of shotshells (2 3/4 inches, 3 inches, and 3 1/2 inches). If you tried to fire a 3 1/2"" shell from a shotgun rated for 2 3/4"" shells only the gun might not be able to handle the pressure from the forcing cone being too tight. It also might not cycle or chamber if the shells are too long. Pretty sure the Mossberg in KF2 is chambered in 20GA anyway but the M4, AA-12 and hunting shotgun could probably share an ammo pool. At least the M4 and hunting shotgun since they load with loose shells."

KF1 had around 1000 players before KF2 came along (still does, actually) and there were still plenty of servers. I don't see that as a good enough reason to not buy the game. The same thing applies to KF2 as well.  However, you have a point on it lacking content. KF2 is great, but there's only 4 maps and 4 perks as it is. It really depends on how many hours you can get out of only a small amount of content. I have near 100 and am only now starting to get bored and craving more weapons."

I'm nearing 250ish in KF2 and still really enjoy it, but with a lower player base it's harder to find games you want and even harder to get them with good players.

killingfloor,3a6abq,kriegson,5,Wed Jun 17 18:23:22 2015 UTC,Well flamethrower is already in game in some form. I'm guessing it will be the 2nd or 3rd tier weapon rather than the starting choice.

But I have faith in Tripwire and they've proven themselves competent at early access multiple times. The updates we've had so far have been solid and addressed people's concerns while adding high-quality content like a new map. Whatever problems KF2 may have down the line, typical early access cut-and-run will not be one of them."

Playing it solo isn't a great experience, but 2-6 works fine, and it's pretty easy for 2 people to go into matchmaking and find 4 other randoms if you want to play that way as well."

killingfloor,3a3yjn,oarfjorai,17,Wed Jun 17 13:33:12 2015 UTC,The wording of this ''free dlc'' announcement worries me... dlc in early access? Also would that mean you will charge for other perks? That will make me a sad panda.
killingfloor,3a3yjn,gameegame,17,Wed Jun 17 01:18:54 2015 UTC,Nothing in their statements implies the other perks will cost money. It's content you are downloading - for free. I really doubt there is going to be any paid content in the entire early access.
killingfloor,3a3yjn,oarfjorai,-2,Wed Jun 17 01:21:42 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't it then be called new content for EA (which was expected), and not Free DLC? something sounds off, but I hope you are right."

killingfloor,3a3yjn,gameegame,2,Wed Jun 17 13:33:11 2015 UTC,"so they called it free, which it is.  they did not call it dlc, which would imply the game is complete and they are adding to it."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Rasii,-1,Thu Jun 18 02:32:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks I'll take your word for it. I can't watch the vid now anyway. Either way after watching the announcement initially it did leave me (and others) feeling uncertain and they probably could have explained their intentions a bit better. Since then I have read a few different opinions on the matter with good points on either side. At the end of the day, we all just want the game to succeed."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,ngwek76,2,Thu Jun 18 12:31:04 2015 UTC,they've made their intentions extremely clear multiple times.  they began as modders so they will continue to work on the game with the intention of releasing a lot of free content (including well after release).  they will charge for skins and weapons though.
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Slow_Hallway_Walker,-1,Thu Jun 18 12:48:49 2015 UTC,"Realistically if it was that clear, there wouldn't have been so many comments about it. My post is specifically about their e3 announcement."

killingfloor,3a3yjn,gameegame,2,Wed Jun 17 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"It's because DLC usually means something you pay for that adds content to a full finished game, but for KF2 it's really more content added for free heading towards a full game. It is kinda poor wording, but the content looks awesome."

killingfloor,3a3yjn,qqnowqq,-4,Tue Jun 30 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"I have to say, as a few have said, saying there is dlc in the early access, even if it is free, doesn't seem like the best wording. People might get the wrong idea, hearing that. It's a touchy subject, I think. I am perfectly fine giving money for dlc, as I love the game. However, I don't think any paid dlc, even for characters we love like Commando Chicken, should be added during the early access, as it comes off awkward. And then there's the part of me that says, I want to give them more money so they can continue development on this game I love... Like I said, it's a bit touchy. That being said...  I am so hyped! I don't put as many hours into KF2 as I did when it first hit early access, but I still hit it up when I want to relax. And absolutely love where they are taking the game. When they added Masterson back in, with old comedy lines, that seems like they are listening to us when it comes to taking it more seriously, which I've said before it seems they can do in a way, but the game will lose it's charm, etc etc, you've all read the arguments. I'm glad they are bringing a bit of the comedy back."

Regardless, new weapons... trenchgun seems just as good as before.. and I'm really scared for the RPG... if it's anything like the LAW, it's gonna be absolutely terrible xD  Also, it's nice that there won't be stat wipes, but this won't pull players back in. (down to 1300 players now..) What people are really wanting are easy scrake stuns and demolition weapons."

killingfloor,3a3yjn,AbanoMex,-2,Wed Jun 17 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"People have been implying it left and right and of course it was a touch of hyperbole. Maybe he shouldn't have mentioned it, but I totally agreed. A sizable part of their ""fanbase"" is acting ridiculous. It also took almost no time out of their presentation, as it was simple banter.  Mentioning how many players are left is pretty spiteful. Pretty much everyone knows it and you stating it is just trying to be pushy I guess? I'm part of the group that cringes at posts like this that I have to read daily.  P.S. we already have EMPs and if done properly Scrakes are completely nullified with 0 players on the team taking damage. Yes, we all want Sharpshooter, but it's been proven that if you can't take down Scrakes it's pretty much everyone's fault on your team, especially considering 2 of the 4 classes have enough firepower to take out Scrakes solo and number 3 has Med nades. Scrakes can be killed nearly as quickly as KF1 just with slightly more effort. Sharpshooter will come and we all know everyone wants it."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Rodario,2,Wed Jun 17 06:12:24 2015 UTC,"It's not spite. It's fact. The number of players is just dwindling heavily. Most people I've talked to said they don't like the difference in mechanics, mainly the effective lack of stuns. One reason a lot of players aren't staying is because pubbing isn't really viable. Sure, it's easy to play and beat maps with coordinated teams, but relying on random people to have that same synergy with you is unlikely, so people don't stay to play. Not a great incentive to pub as opposed to just waiting until you can get a squad ready. However in KF1, pubbing was much more rewarding because it values individual skill much more than team coordination.  I agree it's just as quick to kill scrakes in KF2, but the way to scrake isn't as clean as it can be atm. If they added practical stuns to the game but raised the amount of scrakes, I think more players would be retained."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Eugenes_Axe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:23:08 2015 UTC,"People are leaving not because of pubbing, but because the lack of official maps, (more are comming) and teleporting zeds, which makes kiting almost impossible since your paths are gonna be blocked by bloats and sirens most of the time, this add a layer of dificulty that is not felt right, it even feels unfair, that is why players are leaving, no one likes to die to bullshit deaths."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Rodario,3,Wed Jun 17 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"Pubbing is the reason a large amount of people I've talked to don't play that much. Your reasons are also valid for people to not stay too, though. But yeah, removing teleporting zeds and making pubbing more fun and consistent would keep more people. No one wants to lose to randomness."

killingfloor,3a3yjn,Noduxo,5,Wed Jun 17 11:30:24 2015 UTC,I've been reserved about dumping time into the game in early access because I assumed my stats would be reset and I'd have to do it all over again. This lets me know I'm not 'wasting'* my time.  What is it about retaining stats that you don't like?  * Don't take this wording too literally.
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Rodario,0,Wed Jun 17 13:17:39 2015 UTC,"I acknowledge that you are the target demographic for this announcement. In that sense it will work and increase the number of active players.  On the other hand, they have given up the ability to do a reset if necessary - and it's far too early to know that it won't, some say it is necessary already. The fact they are willing to do that just to get more people playing is a sign that they are desperately trying to get people playing instead of doing what's best for the game.  In my opinion they should improve the balance of the game and wait till more perks are in. If the game gets more fun, enough people will play it regardless of stat resets. The fact they went for the no reset route could even imply they feel balance is fine, which I strongly disagree with."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Noduxo,5,Wed Jun 17 13:29:14 2015 UTC,I'm just curious why a stat reset would be needed.  Outside of a glitch giving everyone level 25 from the beginning
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Rodario,-1,Wed Jun 17 14:45:26 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious why a stat reset would be needed. Outside of a glitch giving everyone level 25 from the beginning   There are reports of leveling maps, basically giving anybody level 25 with no experience. I don't know how accurate they are.  Outside from that, the conditions under which players are leveling might change drastically while TWI still works on balance. They recently announced a complete re-work of the Berserker class. I'd argue it's release will be a pretty pretty good reason for a reset."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Noduxo,4,Wed Jun 17 15:16:41 2015 UTC,Who cares what level other people are? That's not a good enough reason for a stat reset.

killingfloor,3a3yjn,Rodario,8,Wed Jun 17 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"I don't see any, that's the problem. Mainly because it's a team based co-op game, and not a competitive game.   Plus, the people who did buy into early access (AKA the bug/system testers) deserve to be compensated at least in a small way. If that means the date achieved on their achievements is earlier than the official release of the game, then so be it. It doesn't matter in the long run, and it gives those who did buy in early a small thank you for doing so.

If you feel like you want to reset your skills, you have the option of doing it manually and playing on normal/hard difficulties will allow you to play with other players around your level.

Also, since the level of your teammates isn't very influencing on the game experience (player skill is much more important than player level), I don't see the point in having the skills be reset.   It might be you don't see the point, but players of KF1 saw the point first-handed when whitelisting maps was dropped. Just ask around. New players leveled without gaining experience, without getting skilled at all. One of two things happened  1.) Noobs entered Suicidal and HoE servers a lot since they were ""high level"" now and (since player skill is much more important than player level, as you correctly noted) annoyed people there, even ruinied some games.  2.) Noobs entered lower difficulty servers with overpowered perks, annoyed people there and often got bored, leading to 1.)   By saying that they won't have skill resets, it will (as many have mentioned in this thread) increase the user base because the players don't have the worry of ""wasting"" their time.

killingfloor,3a3yjn,terransdestroy,2,Wed Jun 17 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see how reseting skills will solve either situations you described. More play time doesn't necessarily mean better skill. Even using legit ways to level, like playing single player only, doesn't mean the player is going to be a good team player. Unless they instituted some type of skill check (like WoW's skill check that locks you out of heroics until you can beat silver) that would prevent someone from joining Sui/HoE servers, you are always going to encounter the issue you mention in 1. Vice versa, unless they lock out lower level difficulties from higher level players, you will always encounter number 2. The only thing in place to prevent those right now is to be on a server that has good admins.  It's a win-win because people who have already purchased the game and stopped putting time into it because there was a chance of stats reseting, will come back. Also, new players will pickup the game knowing their stats carry over.  The only point I'm trying to convey is that, without some type of skill check (where you are locked out until you can beat it), you will always encounter high level players who have no idea how to play the game."
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Brick50,-1,Wed Jun 17 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"More play time doesn't necessarily mean better skill.   Yes it does. The same player will have better skill after 50 hours of experience than after 2 hours. Even if he doesn't really try, just getting to know the maps is a huge advantage.   you are always going to encounter the issue you mention in 1.   With a statement like that you seem to suggest it doesn't matter how frequent the issue appears.   It's a win-win because people who have already purchased the game and stopped putting time into it because there was a chance of stats reseting, will come back. Also, new players will pickup the game knowing their stats carry over.   That's just a win. That's the effect I acknowledged in my first post here.  A win-win implies there is no downside. And no, you or any number of people not caring about the downside still doesn't make it a win-win situation."

I don't see how someone leveling to 25 and then having their stats wiped and then having to relevel to 25 will be any better than someone who leveled to 25 and stayed level 25 and just played higher difficulties.
killingfloor,3a3yjn,Brick50,-1,Wed Jun 17 23:44:40 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that the first time someone levels to 25 doesn't count then?   I'm saying during early access might or might not at some point exist circumstances that make any leveling done at that time count less or not at all. That has also been the developers position until now.  If that wasn't the case at the end of EA then we don't need a reset, great! I just think it's a bad idea promising now it won't be necessary, when nobody can possibly know that."

It's a simple concept that has been around ever since geometry culling and LOD. If it's not on the screen, there's (typically) no reason to put it down the rendering pipe. When you turn on Physx, your framerate takes a constant hit whether the additional effects are being rendered or not. That's garbage optimization. On top of that, most of if not all the effects are stuff that can be done without Physx at all, which makes it a real gimmick."

Once again, see:   The point isn't whether physx is playable on systems or not...   I can run Physx just fine. That's not the problem. The problem is it's terribly made and is very gimmicky.   Lastly, proprietary technology like TressFX and Physx are bad for the gaming industry. Imagine a future where half of the settings in your game aren't available because you have the wrong brand of video card? That's the direction we're heading it's just the start. We already see games today like Project Cars where the game automatically runs worse on AMD hardware compared to equivalent Nvidia cards because the games code is literally written to run worse on AMD products and there's nothing AMD can do about it in their drivers.  This isn't anything new. Intel has on and off for years been trying to force software to run worse on AMD to make themselves look faster. Just google ""Intel cripple AMD"""
killingfloor,3a3axb,nivikus,3,Fri Jun 19 03:38:45 2015 UTC,"This is not true. ProjectCars does not use GPU PhysX. The car physics was written by the developer, it runs the same on any system regardless of GPU. The physics of the roadside objects uses the CPU features of PhysX, the basic rigid body stuff that doesn't run on GPU at all. There is nothing in the physics of ProjectCars that favors NVIDIA over AMD, or vice versa. The AMD problems were from graphics drivers."
killingfloor,3a3axb,AvionCornish,2,Fri Jun 19 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"Project Cars is an Nvidia Gameworks title. Like most Gameworks titles, AMD cards run worse on these games relative to Nvidia cards that they would otherwise keep up with in other games.  See this post if you don't believe me.  It doesn't matter if the car physics aren't calculated with Physx (albeit that would be extra lousy), the point is that Physx is poorly optimized even on Nvidia hardware. As soon as Physx is enabled, CUDA cores may as well get dedicated or allocated to solely Physx calculations. (This is sorta why you can dedicate a second SLI card to Physx alone.) The result is that you get degraded performance across the board rather than only the instances of when Physx effects being used. On top of that, most Physx effects can easily be done in OpenGL, DirectX or simply just additional detail added to the game. It makes Phsyx a real gimmick.  Lastly, like I mentioned above, do you really want a future where you can't use a dozen graphics settings in games unless you choose the right brand of video card?

killingfloor,3a3axb,TheGingerSignPainter,6,Fri Jun 19 21:23:02 2015 UTC,"AMD hardly has any competing graphics technologies at all. TressFX is just one example.  I think most people don't realize that even if GameWorks technologies are proprietary, they can't really do anything to stunt any given card's performance. AMD's cards struggled with HairWorks in Witcher 3 because that implementation made heavy use of GPU Tesselation, which is a DX11 feature. It had already been well documented that AMD's chips struggled with tesselation in the past (Crysis 2 DX11 content) and that's completely on AMD. It's not NVIDIA's fault or even their problem that AMD's hardware isn't up to snuff on a DX11 feature. AMD couldn't develop a real solution or optimization so they instead developed a driver setting that allowed their users to manually adjust tesselation values."
killingfloor,3a3axb,-spartacus-,-2,Fri Jun 19 21:49:41 2015 UTC,"HairWorks is a forced feature and doesn't apply. TressFX looks better according to many people and isnt as heavy nor is it closed. Tessellation in Crysis 2 is also moot because CryTek put myriad wasted resources into C2 and had it so that unseen objects in the game, like water beneath the maps, were also being tessellated which, at the time, was hurting AMD GPU performance because they didn't have the optimizations back then for it in the 5000 Series days. That's the past, this is now though. NVIDIA's shady practices are still enabling them to ""stay ahead"" while purposely gimping their competitor's hardware instead of actually bringing raw power to the playing field they do it with cheap software gimmicks."

killingfloor,3a3axb,MrSoupSox,3,Wed Jun 17 02:43:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but your philosophy is anti-consumer just like Nvidia is.  AMD works towards innovating and developing technology standards that anyone can use.  Why?  Because closed proprietary technology fragments the market and destroys the PC market.  I don't know how old you are, but I don't know if you remember what it was like for consumers and developers with all the different companies and technology both hardware and software wise.  Getting your games to run properly and run well, really took a good amount of work on both consumers and developers.  We have PCs, not Nvidia computers and AMD computers."
killingfloor,3a3axb,AvionCornish,3,Wed Jun 17 02:46:47 2015 UTC,"I totally get that argument, but I do think it's also a slippery slope to claim that NVIDIA's Physx, or HairWorks, or whatever it may be, will result in fragmentation of the pc gaming market. As it stands, these features are fairly minor, purely graphical, and not even that compatible with NVIDIA's own hardware! (roughly 20%+ drop in performance with the Witcher's hairworks on comes to mind). So I get that comparatively, NVIDIA is anti-consumer compared to AMD. But at the end of the day, a business is a business. NVIDIA also happens to be a gigantic business with a very sizeable hold on the PC gaming market, which is certainly dangerous for the future, I will agree. On the same token though, as noble as AMD is for being such an open platform, I won't spend my money on a product that may be ""open"", when it is flat-out inferior, and comparatively lacking in features. At the end of the day, I, and most other consumers, will not support an inferior, yet ""more noble"" company with our wallets. I do not feel obliged to support a company that does not compete in the ways and features that I deem most valuable."
killingfloor,3a3axb,AvionCornish,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"Well you can't really say one brand is better than another as it changes all the time and even then varies between price brackets.  I'm not arguing to buy an inferior product, because most of the time there isn't a huge difference between them.  So when there isn't a big difference why not buy from the  company that doesnt follow shitty business practices?   Hell, Nvidia doesn't allow gpu physx if it detects another brands card in the system!  You bought an Nvidia card to run physx and if you have something else in there too, it isn't allowed to work.   It's like you buy a new Ford truck, but it refuses to run if you put in non Ford oil, gas, or wheels!  You really want to support a company that insults their customers like that?  It's not like that oil, gas, or tires don't work, they do just fine.  Just like youccan hack the detector in the Physx driver to get it to work.   And all this isn't just one of thing Nvidia has done, not saying Amd is some saint or their products are always better, because they ain't.  However AMD has far better track record of being fair and open with their customers and those that aren't Yet."
killingfloor,3a3axb,IlyichValken,2,Wed Jun 17 13:22:31 2015 UTC,"I more meant ""better"" in a personal value sense. AMD historically has a better value to their cards than NVIDIA. In general, you get higher FPS per dollar with AMD than NVIDIA, and I totally respect that. But as someone who likes staying on the bleeding edge of PC gaming tech, when I had to wait a week+ to get a driver for a new game, whereas NVIDIA had the drivers available on day 1 or day 2, that's when I stopped siding with AMD, as much as I admired their business practices and general value. For many people, that's not the case, but that's where I find the value. For other people, maybe Physx and Hairworks is actually their purchase decision is determined, just as driver support is mine, and that's fine too. The same goes for AMD, maybe some people vastly prefer TressFX over HairWorks, or just flatout buy AMD to support their business practices, that's totally cool too. I just mean to say that there is no denying that NVIDIA's overall GPU support and feature list is much larger than AMD. That's a plain fact. Whether those features matter is up to the individual consumer, just as NVIDIA rigidly protecting their tech may be the deal breaker for people considering them for a graphics card, who then instead decide to buy AMD.   I feel this exact way with Apple v. Android. The only problem is that, for the Apple v. Android comparison, Android at least thrives BECAUSE it is so comparably open. With AMD, I'm not sure that as many people, myself included, are truly seeing the advantages of an open ecosystem. The price/value is certainly an advantage, sure, but when NVIDIA has a veritable truckload of features under their belt with the disadvantage of being relatively closed, I'm still going to side with their product due to the relatively small price difference. That's my personal buying decision, but at the same time, with 75% gpu market share, clearly a lot of people agree. Now whether or not NVIDIA first gained that 75% through scummy business practices, or aggressive competition is a whole other discussion. And while I agree that NVIDIA has some stupid restrictions in place (your example is an excellent one, as is the whole debacle with locking overclocking mobile gpus), when I'm behind the counter looking to drop 400$+ on a beastly graphics card, I'm honestly not looking at the business behind it. I'm looking at support, features, value, etc., and I think that's the decision that a lot (possibly all 75%) are going to make, regardless of the business that makes the decisions behind the product. I totally recognize that this may lead to a more ridiculous monopoly in the future, but so long as I personally find NVIDIA to make a better product, I will continue buying them.  EDIT: And to address your Ford argument, the only, ONLY reason that Ford doesn't do that today is because other car companies exist. So long as AMD can't offer real competition to NVIDIA, they will continue to lock down their tech, just as they have every right to. So it sucks, certainly, that the GPU leader right now feels the need to close off their ecosystem and be restrictive. But so long as AMD can't serve up any real competition (IMO, and in the individual features that I find valuable), then I will keep spending my money on the product that I find to be in my best interests."
killingfloor,3a3axb,batmanasb,-4,Wed Jun 17 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"What part of any of what I said aren't you getting? I'm not talking about them being buddy-buddy, I'm talking about how their proprietary software disallows anyone other than the developers and NVIDIA themselves to tweak any part of the game once it's in. Project CARS instantly comes to mind, where PhysX is always-on and forces AMD GPUs to offload all the PhysX work onto the CPU, whether Intel or AMD, nearly cutting frame rate in half on realistically beefy systems like 290s and 290Xs. How the fuck is that okay to some people? TressFX is allowed to be tweaked by NVIDIA to work on their hardware, as noted by the Tomb Raider launch. HairWorks runs only on NVIDIA GPUs and AMD's can't run it at all cause it's part of GameWorks and you literally have to go into Catalyst Control Center, add a profile for the game, and turn the tessellation down entirely to something like 2x all because of some bullshit NVIDIA software in the game. Mantle, the very basis of what will now live on through Vulkan and DX12, was an open source initiative by AMD to call API makers' bluff and get them to make a better API that has less overhead. It succeeded, and thus DX12 and Vulkan are utilizing all sorts of things AMD's Mantle API brought to the table. Anyone could have access to it. You think the same would be said if NVIDIA had made it?"
killingfloor,3a3axb,IlyichValken,6,Wed Jun 17 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Last I checked, AMD is a very different business from NVIDIA. AMD is open, and NVIDIA is comparatively closed. However, NVIDIA is operating completely within their bounds as a very successful business in creating incentives, exclusives, whatever you like, to persuade consumers to side with their product. Is it bad for consumers? Possibly. But however admirable AMD's openness may be, it is a business decision whether or not they release their tech to everyone or not. Period. Do people complain when Apple locks features off to IPhone platforms? No, because Android thrives because it's openness breeds creativity, consumer creation, etc. I get that the argument is somewhat moot as PC hardware is a whole different breed from phone hardware and operating systems, but I think the comparison is still valid. I see the complaints about NVIDIA ""locking down"" features compared to AMD, but the only reason that these complaints even exist is because AMD is there as contrast. All in all, NVIDIA and AMD are businesses. If NVIDIA wants to lockdown their technology, that is completely up to them, just as AMD is free to open up their tech in the same way.  And the Project CARS argument. Everyone points at NVIDIA for ""restricting"" AMD. Why does no one ask AMD to be more aggressive and get their OWN tech out there? That's the reason why I don't buy AMD cards anymore! I would wait days, sometimes weeks to get driver updates, and NVIDIA was busy pumping out additional features after their DAY 1 drivers for brand new games. I'm all for openness and all that, but at some point, I'm going to pick the superior product."

The only thing ProjectCars uses PhysX for is the rigid body simulation of roadside objects, like fences and stuff like that.

It's an entirely beefier, stronger GPU. Why the fuck is it crippled in Project CARS when, I'd bet in a shit ton of other games out there, it'd blow that GTX 760 away because like I said it's an entirely different range of card in terms of power.  It doesn't matter if there's an Intel or AMD CPU in the system, the performance is crippled on an AMD GPU. The version of PhysX within Project CARS is a version that is indeed mostly on the CPU, but certain parts are offloaded onto a PhysX-capable GPU - i.e. an NVIDIA card. I'm not pulling at fanboy strings here, I own a GTX 970 but I'm not proud of the nefarious things NVIDIA and devs closely associated with/to them do. I try not to support said games, and I know AMD's been fixing Project CARS when they can, and that Windows 10 paired with the new driver actually make a world of difference, but that kind of bullshit isn't the kind of troubleshooting or problem-solving someone should have to do, just switch OS's to be able to get better performance out of a game they bought."

There isn't even a lot of stuff that actually uses hardware-based PhysX, it's just people complaining and not knowing what they're talking about. Hell, Gameworks barely even runs well on 2x 980.  As /u/MrSoupSox said - there's really no reason for Nvidia to throttle back just because AMD's stuff can't keep up with it. If AMD wants their stuff to work better with everything, they should probably work on strengthening their hardwares' weaknesses instead of complaining about it being unfair, as they've actually done recently."
killingfloor,3a3axb,foofaw,0,Sat Jun 20 01:39:33 2015 UTC,"No, the problem comes from Nvidia hiding the code from AMD, so AMD can't optimize for it.

The same thing would happen if AMD hid the code for TressFX so that Nvidia couldn't optimize it, then AMD cards would appear 2x as powerful. But AMD doesn't do that and instead opensource everything so that games don't start being GPU exclusive.   TL;DR: Nvidia is doing shady business practices that shouldn't be supported. And this is coming from an Nvidia GTX 680 owner..."
killingfloor,3a3axb,salsadoom,2,Sat Jun 20 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"No doubt Nvidia is being shady about it, but you can't really deny AMD's hardware faults. Nvidia really wouldn't fucking care if AMD kept TressFX closed off, as they have Hairworks.  But again, AMD's hardware has never been good at things like tesselation, which is in no small portion, part of Nvidia's Gameworks. Even if Nvidia DID allow AMD to optimize for the code, I seriously doubt you'd see that much of a performance hike simply because the shit doesn't even run that well on Nvidia hardware.  It's not Nvidia's (completely OPTIONAL) Gameworks making AMD's hardware look bad, it's AMD's hardware making AMD's hardware look bad due to faults in it's architecture. If AMD cards were better with tessellation, there wouldn't be as much of an ""apparent"" gap in performance when it comes to stupid little frill things like hair tessellation that makes all hardware bog down."
killingfloor,3a3axb,P0nyRapist,5,Wed Jun 17 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, AMD hardware is probably just different, not weaker. Also, Nvidia actually persuades companies to use it's proprietary tech ($$), so that barely counts as optional. But in all seriousness, optimizations make a HUGE difference. If you ever played early access games, played console ports, or tried programming yourself, then you'd know that the largest difference between frame rates is optimization and not actually hardware. The fact that Nvidia hides it's code form AMD for no reason other than to gain the advantage is harmful to everyone, and shouldn't be cheered on like this reddit post is doing."
killingfloor,3a3axb,NightmareP69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:10:00 2015 UTC,"Well no, it is different, that's why their cards don't perform as well when it comes to tessellation. That's not to say their hardware is weaker overall, but it's undeniably weaker when it comes to things like tessellation, which as I said, is a huge component to most of Gameworks.  And yes, Nvidia may be persuading companies to use it's tech, but most of it is completely optional and not at all mandatory to enjoy the game, it just adds more to the experience. For example, Hairworks in Witcher 3 can be completely turned off or turned way down in an ini file.  And yes, I know that the largest difference is optimization, and I'm not praising Nvidia for being kinda shitty about it, as it is what it is, but at some point, AMD can't just sit around and blame Nvidia for everything as they have lately."
killingfloor,3a3axb,Supports4life,4,Wed Jun 17 04:20:23 2015 UTC,"Well, here's the thing. Nvidia payed CD Project Red to use Hairworks. If they used AMD's TressFX instead (which nvidia has optimized for), then everyone would be happy. But AMD isn't going to bride someone to use it's technology."
killingfloor,3a3axb,smashdadrum,2,Wed Jun 17 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, but no one's happy with Hairworks anyways, because it makes the game run like shit because it was essentially just thrown into the game and wasn't really implemented well. If they'd used TressFX, literally no one would give any shits.  Again, I'm not applauding Nvidia being shady as fuck about their stuff, but AMD isn't completely the innocent lamb here. At some point they'll need to stop playing the victim and actually do something about it."
killingfloor,3a3axb,Nbaysingar,3,Wed Jun 17 04:35:23 2015 UTC,A lot of great discussion on those NVIDIA boards /s  Has anyone contracted Tripwire about this? Would like an area to voice my opinion.

killingfloor,3a3axb,batmanasb,7,Wed Jun 17 08:50:02 2015 UTC,"It won't run off your AMD card at all since PhysX is designed for Nvidia GPUs only. AMDs architecture doesn't have the requirements since Nvidia made PhysX exclusive.  You can run it off your CPU, but that will more than likely destroy your framerates since it's not designed to run that way. Fortunately, you can go pick up something like a 750 Ti for cheap and use that as a dedicated PhysX processor. Whether or not it's worth the expense is up to you though. You also have to make sure you have the spare PCI slot and space to fit an additional card."
killingfloor,3a3axb,batmanasb,16,Wed Jun 17 10:48:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, Nvidia doesn't allow using an Nvidia card for PhysX if you have an AMD primary. If you've got an AMD card you may as well forget about this stuff. You'll probably need a pretty meaty NVidia card for it to work nicely anyway."
killingfloor,3a3axb,smashdadrum,9,Tue Jun 16 23:36:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's fucking bull shit then. It didn't used to be that way, right? I remember people talking about using their old 400 or 500 series cards as PhysX processors while having an AMD card as their main powerhouse."
killingfloor,3a3axb,Nbaysingar,8,Tue Jun 16 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, used to be possible, then nvidia tried to stop it, so users created some hacked drivers, then eventually nvidia put a stop to that as well."

killingfloor,3a3axb,BronzeThunderBeard,7,Wed Jun 17 04:11:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically. You won't get the fancy particle effects like the bile, blood, and guts spewing out and dynamically spreading out on the ground and reacting to physical forces, but bloats will still explode with (I think) intestines flying about when killed, and you can still blow limbs and heads off and whatnot.  This new PhysX stuff isn't remotely integral to the look and feel of the game, but it does add a nice cherry on top."

While I like my over the top stuff, chances are this is going to fuck over AMD users if they can't disable it (based on previous Nvidia shenanigans).   I mean, it looks cool and all, but if it can't be disabled it is going to kill AMD user's FPS."

killingfloor,3a3axb,ipurangi_wahangu,3,Thu Jun 18 00:02:33 2015 UTC,"I love the people getting mad over this. No, it doesn't look realistic, it's not supposed to. It looks like a fun edition. Tripwire had said during the early production videos that this sort of thing would be in the game, so why are you upset now that we're getting it?  Particle physics are not easy, and if Nvidia has proprietary tools to make Tripwire's vision a reality, why should they not use them? It's not 'selling out'.  This is touted as a 'next-gen' technology, so it shouldn't be surprising if your computer might not be up to snuff to run it flawlessly. And if you can't run it, I can guarantee you that you'll be able to toggle it off. But the entire purpose of this system is to develop a method of rending complex particle physics WITHOUT impacting game performance too much."

Besides, who's to say why Tripwire picked this? Perhaps it was the easiest to implement to the game than other options.

Call me a casual, but I just could not get very deep into this game with a complete wipe hanging over my perks.  IMHO EXP systems are a real double-edged sword. Promoting a grind can make players dump loads of extra hours into the game (which makes them more likely to pay for extra DLC and cosmetics) but you make the grind too steep and they'll just walk away.

At the end of the day you don't take anything away from a gaming session except for what you felt playing, and progression systems don't change that.

I would still be in complete agony if my support didnt have quick reload. In a game like Killing Floor where its all about repetition, it gets boring quick if ur not working for something. So I'm sorry that you cannot understand why it is not silly."
killingfloor,3a3xvv,steelblade66,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:10:40 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right that progression changes how a game feels. When used correctly it can add tremendously to the right game. However, that's not often why it's used. It is a mechanic that conditions people to play more, not through engagement, but through compulsion. How many games have you seen where progression is used as an excuse to cover up jank-ass gameplay. You say a game gets boring when you're not working towards anything, I say a game gets boring when I've got to do a bunch of shit that isn't fun to get to the good part. Take your shotgun quick reload, for example. Would you honestly say that the time you spent leveling support was well spent if it was, in your words, spent ""in complete agony""? Now, fortunately for Tripwire, I think this game is exceptionally good at its core, the actions inherent to the gameplay are engaging, the sound and visual design is great, the gunplay is top of the line, and that's why I think you are making a mistake by putting less value in games that are willing to cut the bullshit and just let you play them for their own sake."

Another thing it does is it takes away the rightfully earned achievement of being level 25. If cheating exists, being max level is not worth the stuff you pull out from under your boot after a very disappointing walk in the park.  I get it, it's not PvP, so the effect is limited, but to say there is NO effect is plain ignorant.  And resetting the stats to even out the playing field after the exploits have been fixed will do EVERYTHING to change that.  Edit: What you describe as ""facts"" are opinions.

I don't see how other people 'cheating' to get to level 25 affects the journey and the effort and the fun it took for you to get to level 25.   I get it, it's not PvP, so the effect is limited, but to say there is NO effect is plain ignorant.   I don't see any negative affect, and you haven't listed a valid one. But even if there were, it's a cost benefit analysis. Wiping does more harm then good. Even the developers see that now, which is why they changed their stance.   And resetting the stats to even out the playing field after the exploits have been fixed will do EVERYTHING to change that.   The exploits will never be fixed. Ever. I can download Steam Achievement Manager and get ALL achievements the second they're wiped. I can download Cheat Engine and max all my perks the second their wipe, and this is all unbannable.   If your working logic is that it's possible to stop cheating, you're in for a rude awakening.  Edit to respond to OP's edit: Sorry, they are not opinions they are facts. It is a fact that not every level 25 is cheater. It is a fact that Tripwire now thinks resetting stats is a bad idea. You should go get some cream for that butthurt, bub."
killingfloor,3a3xvv,Kyouji,6,Wed Jun 17 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"Seems weird to not reset at least once on release since you can level up on perk leveling maps, dupe weapons, and glitch outside maps using the hunting shotgun."
killingfloor,3a3xvv,backfire97,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"Tripwire has already shown they don't care about these things and actively promote them(mainly leveling maps).   I disagree with their decision to not to at least 1 wipe. I know the game is bleeding players hard and they hope this is one way to retain them, but part of the fun is leveling. To me this screams desperation to try to keep players while the game is in a non finished state. This is basically Tripwire saying that development is going to take longer than they anticipated and to try to keep players happy(and playing) they can keep all their levels."
killingfloor,3a3xvv,Ryshek,17,Wed Jun 17 01:46:42 2015 UTC,"well i know i'b be upset if my 70 hours of grinding and playing all got wiped and i had to restart. It takes a really long time to hit max level and when i found out that there were going to be potential wipes, i definitely slowed down my play. Leveling may be fun and enticing, but only when it's worth something; i had a lot of fun leveling my perks the first time, but i doubt i would a second time  I was not personally aware that there were really any boosting methods (except maybe the map one), but i don't know if we should really care that they boosted. Sure, it kinda sucks having to grind for work when others get it for free, but like you said, the leveling is fun and enticing. By reaching end-game faster, they are really just killing their own motivation for play and not necessarily improving as players because of it."

On KF1 i have 168 hours with a lvl 6 berserker, lvl 6 sharpshooter, lvl 5 medic, and lvl 4 demolitions, and lvl 3 rest i think. It may not take as long as it did compared to kf 1, but it still takes a long time, and if this is only with 4 perks too"

I've only been comparing directly so my experience in KF1 (all lv6)  So far I've done commando to 25 and support is at 18.  Compared to kf1 they are both faster, the commando is significantly faster then kf2  The only thing that is a bit different in kf2 is cross-perk levelling. In kf1 medic and sharpshooter were passively levelled whilst playing other perks.  Not sure if that will return in kf2 or not but even without them I'm still finding the levelling time shorter."

If they reset then I would just use a training map or hax or whatever to get up to where I was before, because I enjoy the leveling experience, but simultaneously it already takes ages, and it's going to take a retarded amount of time once there are ten perks (and I usually divide my time pretty evenly because I like them all)"

Some people recommend a prestige system from CoD where you just reset your level to 0 but get a new shiny emblem every time you prestige. I'm not a fan of that idea because I don't like starting over.   I suggest doing something similar to  Diablo 3 (Paragon levels) or Borderlands (Badass ranks). Players complained about not having any discrete form of progression to work towards at level 60, so Blizzard added something called Paragon levels after you reach level 60. You get very minor stat bonuses at each level and increasing paragon levels took a very long time. You can probably apply a similar system for KF2's perk progression: A separate ""overall"" perk progression that gets exp regardless of what perk you play. Grants very small bonuses each level so that you don't become too much powerful compared to a lower leveled player. Perhaps even make the bonuses customizable."

killingfloor,3a3y74,llBradll,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:04:32 2015 UTC,"It would be silly to expect most of it to be free. PD2 wasn't a full price game at launch, and providing updates as frequently as Overkill does would be expensive. Surprisingly a lot of the best stuff they've made has been free (Shadow Raid, Hoxton Breakout, and Election Day for maps as well as The Judge and Nova's Shank for weapons). The latest update bridged the mod gap that the courier DLC used to provide too.   If you don't feel like the DLC is worth the price, you can find it on sale all the time as well. I just got the last 6 DLC packs at 75% off during the summer sale, but sales like this happen all the time.   I find all this talk about Overkill being greedy to be hilarious."
killingfloor,3a3y74,llBradll,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:03:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't say I expected it to be free. I was saying that its a lie to say most of its free when most of it was delivered AFTER the game was released. I only ever bought their DLC when its on sale for like $1 or $2, so whatever. That being said, Overkill seems to basically generate most of their money off DLC these days so that's their business.  Making a few guns and selling them for $$ when they make the game much easier (sniper DLC) is a joke though. When people talk about content, they talk about maps, not guns.  Regardless of how people feel about Overkill's DLC costs and policy, who's to say their wrong? Brushing it off as hilarious is totally missing their point."
killingfloor,3a3y74,Xile1985,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"Neither myself or the poster before me said that most of it was free. We both argued that enough of it was free to at least demonstrate a bit of generosity on Overkill's part. If you feel that the DLC makes the game easy, then don't use it. It's not like you're competing with other players. All of the missions can be beat without any DLC at all (even on Deathwish). The ""Tabula Rasa"" and ""We are Rockstars on this Job"" achievements are prime examples of what can be done without the DLC. I'm not missing the points of people complaining about Overkill, but rather saying that Overkill isn't making them buy the DLC, and will even let you play DLC maps without owning them (which is the exactly the content you were talking about). So far, I've accumulated all of the DLC, and I've barely paid more for it and the DLC than I would for a full price game. The issue is that people forget the free updates to the game and remember the ones you pay for."

Actually, to your point, doesn't this dlc change the core meta of killing floor? New classes specializing in fp and trash removal? I really don't get what your argument is, sorry. 😯"
killingfloor,3a3y74,Xile1985,2,Wed Jun 17 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"doesn't this dlc change the core meta of killing floor?   As a long-time PAYDAY 2 player: this is very dangerous. Overkill has made plenty of content packs that have changed the meta. Very significantly so, in fact.  Now on the one hand this is fun: figuring out how the new content fits into the meta is a nice puzzle and gives you a new toy to play around with.  On the other hand, it's almost certain to ruin the balance of the game. Metagaming is, by neccesity, a very efficient beast. Once a meta has been established and agreed upon it is by definition the best way to play. If you want to change the meta, if you want to make metagamers use the new weapons they have to be better than what's already available, or else they'll be played with for a bit, and then promtly be tossed aside (keep in mind this is exclusively regarding a game's meta - not about a weapon 'just being fun' or any other reason to use it). For an example of that, see PAYDAY 2's melee weapons where only about four out of the 47 are any good. You keep releasing more powerful weapons and the game gets easier, and easier, and easier until the highest available difficulty is a joke and you can cheese the hardest difficulty with only half a team, pretending you're just level two. What you could do to offset this gradual increase in power is tweak the enemies as well, so that the balance doesn't get offset. But then players that don't buy into the DLC get an unfairly hard game so the balance is ruined anyway.  The only way to do it is, of course, with sidegrades, which is why I said it's almost certain to ruin the balance - not guaranteed. The problem is that that's still very hard to do. The thing about sidegrades is that they have to be worthwhile enough in stat X to warrant ditching what is currently the best [insert role here] weapon in the game, while still sucking hard enough  in stat Y that it's bad enough to not want it if it wasn't better in stat X, but also not so bad that it's immediately trash. The window for this is very very tiny by itself, but then you also have to make sure the sidegrade is actually interesting enough, and not just an AR that shoots a little faster with a little less damage.  So TL;DR: It can change the meta, but doing it right without ruining the balance is very very hard. Also shameless self promotion."

I didn't bring up Payday 2, just discussed it when it came up in relation to 'how not to do DLC' [at least from my and a few others perspective...]  KF2 is in a good position at the moment, it's in early access and awaiting much needed fleshing out, now is the perfect time to change things from the original, not 6 months> after release so everyone has to [at least to a degree] re-learn how to play a game they've already been playing. I love how the game is so far and have faith TWI will make this a great game, the only point I wanted to make was in my 1st post here, it feels odd they're referring to releasing DLC for a game that's not even feature complete / released yet."

In my opinion that is the best solution. If you want a source on this then you can look through their YouTube channel. Its in one of their videos before EA was released. I would link you but I am on mobile."

killingfloor,3a3y74,16block18,13,Wed Jun 17 17:53:46 2015 UTC,The no stats wipe was what made it. Though I was sad that they didn't give a date for the update. I was also disappointed because i had psyched myself up for a second boss reveal.
killingfloor,3a3y74,OCJeriko,6,Wed Jun 17 01:17:52 2015 UTC,"For those of you worried about the ""free dlc"". Tripwire has stated in a video,devblog i believe, that they will never charge for dlc that can give other people an advantage over others. All dlc that can impact game play will be free. I'm assuming if they charge for any dlc in the future it will be purely cosmetic."
killingfloor,3a3y74,Noduxo,5,Wed Jun 17 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"Really? what about the straight upgrade paid dlc weapons in the first one (flare guns, tommy gun etc)? Or is what you mentioned only applicable to killing floor 2?"
killingfloor,3a3y74,acidboogie,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:32:08 2015 UTC,What they said was specifically for KF2
killingfloor,3a3y74,JustHarmony,0,Wed Jun 17 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"I dunno... with past history or charging for better weapons, I think it's a little naive to assume they won't do it again.  But I hope you are right."
killingfloor,3a3y74,the_dogeranger,2,Wed Jun 17 17:55:52 2015 UTC,I think they learned their lesson considering they did not sell weapon packs or anything for Red Orchestra 2.
killingfloor,3a3y74,JustHarmony,5,Thu Jun 18 16:45:17 2015 UTC,They also said that the game wouldn't change in price then had a price reduction after the first update. I think DLC which gives an advantage could be viewed differently by then than us.
killingfloor,3a3y74,KaedeAoi,8,Wed Jun 17 07:49:06 2015 UTC,"Change in price means to be a permanent change in price like when a game starts to get old and they reduce it. If you're talking about the sale, its a goddamn sale. Every shop in the world has sales, if you miss it, tough luck like... with any other purchase."
killingfloor,3a3y74,Cao_Cao_Mengde,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:30:43 2015 UTC,That's why I said it could be viewed differently. Majority of people thought that meant no sales but to tripwire that meant no reducing base price. They could pull the same thing with DLC. They may not consider a new weapon as an advantage because it may be more expensive etc.

killingfloor,3a3xzp,asuikoori,3,Wed Jun 17 01:12:12 2015 UTC,That is awesome
killingfloor,3a3xzp,slmsdy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:13:37 2015 UTC,I agree.  There is not really a valid reason to reset stats or achievements that does more good than harm. I've been saying this since day 1 for early access.
killingfloor,3a3xzp,Noduxo,3,Wed Jun 17 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"Oh god damn, I heard they were gonna be reset during the beta somewhere. Welp, there goes my only excuse to not buy it... ;_;"
killingfloor,3a3xzp,Ihmhi,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:17:39 2015 UTC,One of us! One of us!
killingfloor,3a3xzp,Noduxo,3,Wed Jun 17 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a bad choice.  With the game in development and things constantly changing (not to mention exploits and ""test maps"") I think that not resetting stats is a bad move.  Early access is supposed to be shaping the game's development, not setting your progress up for future gameplay after release.  Just my 2 cents.  I was more than ok with a wipe before launch."
killingfloor,3a3xzp,Mdogg2005,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:16:51 2015 UTC,Other peoples levels do not affect you. Wiping players hard work affects them.   There is literally no point in wiping stats. Let the people who supported Tripwire by buying early access get the benefit of not having to re-level all over again. They deserve that benefit for bug testing the game before release.
killingfloor,3a3xzp,Noduxo,0,Wed Jun 17 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"But the game isn't released.  That's like saying ""I played a ton of games in Battlefield 4 beta I want to keep my rank and unlocks"" or ""I played a ton and got to max level in the WoW beta, I want to keep that when the game goes live because I invested the time.""  We knew this was early access and as things get changed / balanced / fixed we should have (and were told to) expect wipes.  I see no long lasting effects either way on their decision, I just personally feel like it's a bad choice to not do a wipe before the game officially goes live."
killingfloor,3a3xzp,Mdogg2005,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"But the game isn't released. That's like saying ""I played a ton of games in Battlefield 4 beta I want to keep my rank and unlocks"" or ""I played a ton and got to max level in the WoW beta, I want to keep that when the game goes live because I invested the time.""   No, it's not even close to saying that. And you know it's not. Stop intentionally pettifogging the issue. Starting out ahead in MMO games, or competitive FPS's is not the same as starting out ahead in a CO-OP team based game. It's not even in the same ballpark.    We knew this was early access and as things get changed / balanced / fixed we should have (and were told to) expect wipes.   No, we knew that wipes could happen because they said it might happen. But just because they said it might happen, does not mean it is a smart idea to wipe stats. It was never a smart idea, and that's why they are no longer going to do it.   I see no long lasting effects either way on their decision, I just personally feel like it's a bad choice to not do a wipe before the game officially goes live.   And I disagree. I have since day 1 where I argued against the stat wipes, and it's still my opinion. I am also against achievement wipes. They make absolutely no sense. It is the best choice not to wipe anything."
killingfloor,3a3xzp,Noduxo,-1,Wed Jun 17 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"Eh, unless people are going to hard difficulty as level sixty you are going to be completely unaffected.  It's not like Wow where there is a lot of focus on server firsts, it's all the same"

killingfloor,3a3yc2,Evenidontkno,6,Wed Jun 17 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I mean, I'm happy that it's demolitionist and not martial artist, because demo is pretty key to the KF experience, but neither of these perks will make scrakes more interesting to deal with (he's got explosive resistance now...)"
killingfloor,3a3yc2,Kitsunin,5,Wed Jun 17 04:45:49 2015 UTC,"But it does give us a better option against Fleshpounds, which means we can work out a proper strategy that doesn't rely so heavily on janky parrying mechanics. That double spawn on wave 10 will be a lot less hairy with a demo in the group."
killingfloor,3a3yc2,Gogmagog,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:14:25 2015 UTC,"True, though I think Fleshpounds are already fun to deal with. The way they lose their rage means you can kite them, which gives you a lot of interesting options that just don't exist when dealing with Scrakes.  The berserker revamp might help though. With the circle-strafing removed, and if facing them in melee range becomes viable without it, then they might start becoming fun to fight, as a berserker at least."
killingfloor,3a3yc2,Kitsunin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:24:02 2015 UTC,"Scrakes are far easier than fleshpounds. ANYONE can kill a scrake. Until they remove circle strafing effectiveness , anyone can kill a Scrake without too much problems."
killingfloor,3a3yc2,mmSNAKE,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, because of the circle strafe, but I was talking about how fun it is to fight a Scrake, not how feasible it is."
killingfloor,3a3yc2,Kitsunin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, in terms of HOE difficulty.  Scrakes are a very high priority target since incidental damage might rage them when a group is unprepared, meaning that circle strafing might not be an option at that time.  Adding demos will help with dealing with fleshpounds other than the pulverizer, which is already a great tool.  Removing circle strafing will definitely make scrakes even more dangerous compared to fleshpounds than they are already."
killingfloor,3a3yc2,Nabrubas,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"Scrakes go down already fast to AA focus fire. Or SCAR17 + EMP, or 2 commandos.   Incidental damage can happen from anything. A siren or a husk can end the entire game. Had a HOE game where Husk killed 3 people with its suicide attack."
killingfloor,3a3yc2,mmSNAKE,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you think they would make at least one of them since they'd be easier to work on in comparison to the two perks that are the most graphic intensive. All dem particles."

killingfloor,3a3yc2,mmSNAKE,3,Wed Jun 17 15:52:55 2015 UTC,OH YEAH BABY! DEMO IS BACK!!! This was my shit in the first game and I honestly thought it was gonna be one of the last perks to be included in early access. I was all about sharpshooter when I first started playing but when I reached level 4 the head shot numbers started to get ridiculous so I tried other perks and demolitions just resonated with me.
killingfloor,3a3yc2,MusicJOO80,2,Wed Jun 17 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"Gonna be pretty funny when it comes out, every server will be made up by Demos and Pyros lol, can't wait."

It'd be pretty suicidal of TW to only update with two weapons haha. What's pretty telling though is that they didn't show off even more weapons. Makes it seem like the update isn't going live for a while because they didn't showcase more. No real reason to hold them back. Watching a minute of the same two guns was so zzzzZzz..."
killingfloor,3a747c,qqnowqq,3,Wed Jun 17 20:15:04 2015 UTC,I just hope that the alt fire for the husk gun will be the Husk's handy-wavey-flamey attack.

killingfloor,39zkkm,Cao_Cao_Mengde,63,Tue Jun 16 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"Not a good system, gameplay and graphics shouldn't contradict each other.  Hope they fix this soon."
killingfloor,39zkkm,Deathitis54,8,Tue Jun 16 04:02:02 2015 UTC,I actually have had mine set to 0 for a while for this exact reason. They'll probably patch it if it gets spread around enough. :(
killingfloor,39zkkm,Kvasir94,19,Tue Jun 16 02:36:12 2015 UTC,Well they really should patch it.
killingfloor,39zkkm,VersionThree,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing, it will just be a shame to see them patch out allowing 0 corpses for people who need the performance boost."
killingfloor,39zkkm,Kvasir94,8,Tue Jun 16 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"Just make it so all bodies becomes non-solid after a few seconds (you scan still bash them around but they don't reduce the damage of bullets), and once they become solid that's when the body cleanup kicks in.  That way it'd be the same for everyone, maxdeadbodies would only effect corpses that have zero impact on gameplay anyway."
killingfloor,39zkkm,TeaL3af,5,Tue Jun 16 06:17:03 2015 UTC,A better way would be to set corpses to have 0 effect on penetration. I'm not sure if there's some kind of attribute for objects that can be changed for this but I'm sure there must be something given there are already different penetration values for different zeds/objects (glass for example)
killingfloor,39zkkm,ZeldenGM,2,Tue Jun 16 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"Even if they had zero effect on penetration, I still think corpses vanishing instantly has more of an effect on the games difficultly than a .cfg setting should allow."
killingfloor,39zkkm,TeaL3af,7,Tue Jun 16 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"It should help for a performance boost, of course, but it shouldn't give anyone such a direct advantage by doing it."
killingfloor,39zkkm,Switzzz,2,Tue Jun 16 05:13:45 2015 UTC,"since I did that (pre your post, from official forums guide) it's a breeze to shoot through sui or hoe hordes as commando / medic.  It also clears all the dead covers for crawlers, visibility is insane"
killingfloor,39zkkm,hairy_tentacle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:21:46 2015 UTC,"The only time the penetration thing is a hassle for me is with crawlers. With a room full of corpses, I don't have the time to specifically aim at the 3 inches of crawler peaking out from the gore.  It's not a deal-breaker, though, so I'll keep my beautiful mass of corpses. :)"
killingfloor,39zkkm,DrBrogbo,0,Wed Jun 17 18:36:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I doubt this would apply in multiplier as the body's might still be around for the other players resulting in no change. If its for performance reasons, I understand as the game isn't well optimized yet"
killingfloor,39zkkm,Nipple_tots,5,Tue Jun 16 04:49:32 2015 UTC,Shots are calculated clientside now so there are moments where other's shots are blocked by their dead bodies but they won't affect yours.  Definitely an interesting situation when someone cranks the # of dead bodies and have massive trouble killing crawlers while nobody else on the servers has any issues.
killingfloor,39zkkm,Kuebic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:15:52 2015 UTC,While the shots may be clientside what I'm saying is how will your dead body count interact with others as your shot would be normal on your side yet potentially pass through a zed on their side causing confusion in game data and in players
killingfloor,39zkkm,Nipple_tots,2,Tue Jun 16 07:09:36 2015 UTC,"There's no confusion in game data because the damage is calculated client-side, meaning the client has the authority to determine if its shots hit and then tell the server to apply the damage, instead of the server actually verifying it by itself."
killingfloor,39zkkm,Kvasir94,0,Tue Jun 16 08:07:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, I get your concern, but as of now, it's not very noticeable by the players as they don't see projectiles actually passing through dead zeds unless during zed-time when bullets turn to matrix projectiles.  But the more I think about it, the more I want to test it out as it's hurting my brain lol.  In terms of game data, afaik, clients determine if their shots hit a zed, then servers register the hit and replicate for all other clients.  So if clients don't tell the server they hit a zed, the server won't replicate it."
killingfloor,39zkkm,Kuebic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:16:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for clarification. I still feel like that could cause issues, however. I feel like having the hits client side could cause a few glitches but I might be over thinking this. I would love to see somebody test this though its an interesting find"
killingfloor,39zkkm,Nipple_tots,0,Tue Jun 16 16:13:15 2015 UTC,can someone tell me the console command to change this? cant seem to find anything on it.

killingfloor,39zkkm,Retrikaethan,-1,Wed Jun 17 03:23:04 2015 UTC,"huh, this is interesting. it means that it counts it as a corpse soon as it dies rather than when it hits the ground and becomes static and that it values user input/client decisions over server decisions (even if only for the the existence of corpses)."
killingfloor,39zkkm,Kvasir94,0,Tue Jun 16 03:32:38 2015 UTC,Hit detection for bullets may be client side.
killingfloor,39zkkm,Nbaysingar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:30:11 2015 UTC,"That would definitely make more sense for this game since it's not PvP. Otherwise it would be totally unfair for hit detection to be client side.  Then again, what about the bug where the pump shotgun simply doesn't hit its target? I haven't played the game in quite a bit so I don't know if TWI ever patched that, but I wonder if client-side hit detection would even allow such a thing to occur. Just pulling this outta my ass, of course. I know fuck all about netcode and hit detection."

killingfloor,39xa1f,backoff11,6,Mon Jun 15 16:58:19 2015 UTC,I hope not
killingfloor,39xa1f,itonlygetsworse,0,Mon Jun 15 17:10:18 2015 UTC,No way. They should fix this even though most people will never encounter it ever in any situation.
killingfloor,39xa1f,cat_is_fine_too,7,Mon Jun 15 21:48:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it was you who discovered that.  I believe it has something to do with the current gore system. Comes out that it's not just enough to deplete the gore health of the certain body part to destroy it. To decapitate a ZED the weapon should be able to land a kill blowing shot - a shot that will actually destroy this bodypart. Otherwise this bodypart will be existing and at same time will be considered as ""dead"".  For the headshots there're 5 damage groups (GoreDamageGroup) which can do so - shotgun, handgun, rifle, ar and smg, most in-game weapons belong to these groups. However the weapons from other damage groups can do such thing as well.  It kinda makes sense that Slashing can't decapitate because all body parts aside from the head have significantly less Gore Health compare to the normal ZED health (depleting health from these parts doesn't seems to do anything notable for now). Like Arms and Legs have 50 hp, Chest - 150, Some other - 100 etc.  I'm sure, the gore/slashing system is not yet completed, these numbers or mechanic is surely subject of change. It might not even be a bug, but rather might be an intended decision prior proceeding towards final gore system, at least in current state. Anyway, even now it seems to be a pretty complicated mechanism, not like headshots in many other games where they are just multipliers to the damage.  Funny thing - it's possible to decapitate a ZED with Healing Dart (when having Acidic Compound) and even with the Flamethrower."
killingfloor,39xa1f,herpsderpsanon,3,Mon Jun 15 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"flamethrower decapping was a thing in the first game, it has impact damage, and headshotting scrakes/fp's actually makes the flamethrower do pretty massive DPS in contrary to popular beliefs. aint ammo efficient tho."
killingfloor,39xa1f,AsiaDerp,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:41:28 2015 UTC,Its still a 10% multiplier right? How is that massive damage?

killingfloor,39uznr,cat_is_fine_too,3,Mon Jun 15 03:32:11 2015 UTC,Why would they use flash for something like this?
killingfloor,39uznr,tbonanno,9,Mon Jun 15 10:08:52 2015 UTC,Because our UI is in Scaleform - which is arguably the best solution for UI in Unreal 3.

killingfloor,39uznr,TW_Shuu,3,Mon Jun 15 10:23:30 2015 UTC,This is because you are running Crossfire or SLI - which aren't currently supported. Use Catalyst / GeForce Experience to only use 1 GPU while running the game for now.

killingfloor,39lm7c,SkyeRaven,38,Fri Jun 12 16:23:15 2015 UTC,Glad to hear that the entire Berserker skill tree is getting revamped and successful parries will be made more obvious. It's also good that melee weapons are getting bash-specific attacks (stabs were oddly absent from the game before) and we will be able to equip multiple cosmetic items à la TF2. Pretty pleased with this update.
killingfloor,39lm7c,Amsay9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:32:54 2015 UTC,"I wish they would either change the class specific weapons to have unique stats or find a better place for them other than being there for show. As the game is currently you will never use those weapons unless trying to save money on HOE and if the stab attack does less damage than the heavy attack, there is almost no real reason to use it over fast light attacks to the head to reduce damage or one shotting with a heavy attack."
killingfloor,39lm7c,itonlygetsworse,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:40:38 2015 UTC,I'd be happy with stab attacks having range as their strong point.

killingfloor,39lm7c,MarkWoulfe,8,Fri Jun 12 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"They are in a weird place.  They are not that great at taking out cannon fodder, offer medium damage, and offer nothing else to the team.  Their signature ability right now is blocking high value non-boss targets; but that's a risky proposition at best.  This game does not reward risky behavior, it rewards safe and smart play.  When you realize that it's time not to be in melee range anymore, you are just as screwed as any of the other classes.  Lots of risk, little reward.  It also does not help that the Eviscerator is massively expensive, unique to the Pulverizer, and entirely useless in later waves.  We already got enough clear in the other classes at the later stages, I'm here to block.  And if I'm running around with the Eviscerator then I'm not blocking."
killingfloor,39lm7c,weewolf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"Don't use the eviscerator. Use RMB with the pulverizer against fleshpounds. If you have to block a scrake, your team fucked up somewhere. Blocking against fleshpounds is perfectly viable, especially if you have a 20+ medic behind you.   Early rounds are amazing with berserkers because you only need to save enough for a pulverizer, not an eviscerator. It helps the rest of your team get their tier 4 weapons very quickly since you're not using ammo."

Against scrakes, if you are going to get hit you might as well try and parry but I wouldn't go into a fight delibertly trying to parry them... their attacks are just too unpredictable."
killingfloor,39lm7c,TeaL3af,6,Fri Jun 12 17:07:40 2015 UTC,It's useful to block/parry fleshpounds on 6p hoe if you have to solo one. Usually 2-3 m2's then mmb.

No one cares if you're disappointed with the game's update schedule, and you most certainly aren't coming across as indifferent.  2) I'd like to see actual discussion about the changes, not people whining that they ""don't care about updates"" every single time an update blog is posted. Sometimes I might agree with something and someone in the comments will change my mind. That's the kind of stuff that should be encouraged.  Since this sub is small, I'm assuming the mods might see this. If any does, I want to make a proposition to sticky a KF2 Complaint Megathread to the top of the subreddit so people will go there instead. I see it bleeding all over completely irrelevant posts, and it's really starting to get on my nerves. Take your echo chamber elsewhere. Just because you don't understand what Early Access is doesn't mean you're in the right to complain. When 6 months has passed and not a single update has come out (lookin' at you, Starbound), then you can pipe up and say something in a relevant post."

KF doesn't need hype, the game has always sold on being exactly what it is (Wheras hype is used by games that are pretending to be something more than they are, in fact I would go to say that feeding hype is inherently dishonest)   And in economic terms, they've already made their money out of you. for the time being; note how there's no DLC yet (and you can bet your ass they could have DLC if they wanted), instead what they're doing is using this period to create the game a pace that allows deliberate and quality changes in all aspects (Look at how the zerk is getting new animations for the parries on zeds, that's pretty rare for a game to do outside of DLC)   Sure it may be slow, but KF is a long term strategy, in the time this game gets to half its total content 3 asscreeds will be released and CoD will have gained sentience and be roaming round the world feasting on souls."
killingfloor,39lm7c,Supports4life,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:05:56 2015 UTC,Yeah this happens for any early access game though. See I dont think people are wrong for asking for more content.

I could pay attention to it, we did HoE Paris in the one-way room, 1 zerk in door crouching, 2 medics healing, rest was supp and commies shooting out of the narrow space. We just had like 3-5 scrakes coming up, since we had so much power concentrated in one spot and waves were over so fast."
killingfloor,39jylw,hairy_tentacle,4,Fri Jun 12 09:43:06 2015 UTC,I want to say the spawning of scakes and FPs are dictated by the amount of players and HOE and nothing else. Maybe a cat is fine too knows.
killingfloor,39jylw,itonlygetsworse,5,Fri Jun 12 11:57:07 2015 UTC,I used to thought so. Then I notice in solo you get 1-3 scrake last 2 waves and that 4 FP wave 9 totally throw that theory out of the window.
killingfloor,39jylw,itonlygetsworse,3,Fri Jun 12 12:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, bur lets assume its constant then. It depends on game length, and wave count. So on wave 9, you always get that 4 FP?"
killingfloor,39jylw,cat_is_fine_too,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:10:54 2015 UTC,"Its almost always 2 FP @ wave 9, rarely that's 3 (assume the team deal with that wave normally). So, not constant."
killingfloor,39jylw,cat_is_fine_too,3,Sat Jun 13 01:51:48 2015 UTC,"ZEDs do spawn in squads. Variety of squads depend on game length and # of the wave. Once all the squads to spawn are depleted, the game will recycle them once again. As long as there are some ZEDs to spawn, the game will be using same wave-specific ZED squads to spawn.  There're two types of squad to spawn - normal and special. Special squads mostly contain tought guys (on higher waves), pressumably FPs + some Bloats or Sirens or even Scrakes. During first waves special squad might contain not so tought ZEDs but rather a lot of them.  Scrakes might be spawned in both - special and normal squads.  Special squad is mostly guarantee to spawn during the wave (and then being recycled once all squads to spawn are gone) whilst some normal squads might be ignored/forgotten/abandoned by the game. At least for the solo game, where amount of ZEDs in squads to spawn might be greater than amount of ZEDs per wave. Also, to note. On Normal and Hard difficulty, Special Squad cannot be reused by the game and will only spawn once per wave. On Suicidal and HOE game such squad can be reused.  For example at short HOE wave #3 for 1 person, there's total of 3 possible Scrake squads to spawn. Two of them are normal and one is in a special one. Normal Scrakes might not even appear due to spawning mechanics which is pretty complex thing however in most cases all the possible squads will be spawned.  Spawn intensity depend on #wave, amount of living players and total wave active time. The longer wave active, the more players alive and the higher number of the wave - the faster ZEDs will be spawning. Spawn timer itself represented as sine wave."
killingfloor,39jylw,itonlygetsworse,2,Fri Jun 12 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"Firstly, thanks for clearing things up.   So dragging the game DOES increase scrake and FP count as intended on suicidal and HOE (at least increase the chance to have more)?  Oh and btw since I only kill 1 zed every 10-20 seconds to test it, I manage to make the double FP spawn one at a time on last wave (but as soon as any single one zed dies, the second one spawn immediately). So in theory, it is possible to make the bigs come alone if we kill zeds slow enough right?  And do you know how long is between the spawns? Say instead of blowing up 15 clots with a nade to make that ""fuck you spawn"" of FP + scrake + siren + bloat + trash possible, I kill 3, wait a few seconds, and kill 3 more, then the squads containing scrakes and FPs will have less escort, however at the same time those ""special squads"" become more possible because I drag the wave longer, is my understanding correct?"
killingfloor,39jylw,itonlygetsworse,2,Sat Jun 13 01:47:46 2015 UTC,"Can't tell if squads to spawn change with the additional players, but most likely they don't. The intensity of SCs and FPs does change, but i'd say a way not too much (wave 6 is the easiest, waves 7-8 are similar, waves 9-10 are the hardest). What changes is ZED types in squads and the overall spawn intensity. The significant difference is that on higher waves they start spawning in same squads.  It's possible to spawn single ZED from the squad. In that case all the remaining squad members will be ignoring spawn times and will appear as soon as there will be free space in max AI room. What won't be changed is the types of the ZED in these squads. If there's 2 FPs squad and only one free slot to ZED to spawn, the second FP will appear as soon as you'll make a room.  Time between ZED spawns is pretty undescribable. It represented as sine wave. The frequency on this wave depend on amount of players and wave number. Generally spawn time between ZED squads in never more than 10 sec. After some time passed since the wave start, the spawn time will be somewhere between 2-4 seconds.  Pretty much all the squads out of all squads to spawn are possible during the cycle of usage. Wave begin with maximum pre-set amount of ZED squads to spawn, all the obliterated squads become inactive for the time there're some squads to spawn. Once all (presumably) of them are wiped, the game initiate new cycle and things start happen all over again. The special squad most likely guarantee to spawn, while some normal might be ignored for some reasons. The order all all squads to spawn seems to be random within their usage cycle."

Well it was different, but it was always stupid things like oh this item is in a different location, this person has moved over there now. The game was nothing but babysitting stupid progress bars and shooting endless streams of cops that kept spawning. Felt mostly like a cash grab so they could produce payday 2 >.>"

killingfloor,39ex53,BaileyEagle,-6,Thu Jun 11 19:48:00 2015 UTC,"I saw the game and my first concern was that it would become too repetitive for my taste. I bought it because everything they advertised said otherwise and I was burned. I have no doubt that Payday 2 is probably way better, but it is also probably the game payday 1 should have been from the start.  I've already been burned by those developers once so I'm not really interested in giving them more money/attention no matter how good of a game they make.  As for the sticking up someplace with your pals, I already have a few games that do that very well. I'd much rather play killing floor, left for dead, gauntlet, orcs must die, and several others than payday. It just doesn't bring anything to the table that other games can't do better in my opinion."

In the end, the mods and members decided due to the small size of the community, it could be harmful creating a separate subreddit for essentially the same group of people so the mods privated r/killingfloor2 to prevent this split.  Although I do see the benefit of having a dedicated KF1 subreddit, I have a feeling it would be pretty dead as the vast majority of the community moved onto KF2, as seen in the official forums.  Granted, that's not the real indicator of the situation as many are still playing KF1 as it is a polished game and more enjoyable to play than KF2 currently.  That being said, feel free to post your KF1 content here, official forums, or steam community.

killingfloor,3997gw,McStabYou,9,Wed Jun 10 04:07:55 2015 UTC,"Nice video. Short enough to keep attention, while also not oversimplifying things. The way you carry your voice is concise and professional, making this sound like an official guide.  If you are looking to make more videos similar to this one, I would suggest starting out with a general guide followed by more advanced and specific guides. To elaborate, you begin with some of the basics and transition on to the nuances of each class, while including the rest of the basics along the way. This is fine for a one-off, but if you want to make a series of guides, you'll want to be a bit more organized. Keep them short like this one, since few people want to watch an hour long guide before getting into a game.  Keep it up, will pass this along to some people that I want to get into the game."

killingfloor,3997gw,UltiPizza,-1,Wed Jun 10 16:10:34 2015 UTC,A small part of it is that the developers have committed the sin of developing on | for developer machines and not for a reasonably priced and slightly aged PC | laptop.
killingfloor,3997gw,Midget_Sex,4,Wed Jun 10 16:17:32 2015 UTC,A reasonably priced laptop is not designed for gaming. That's not a sin. That's just you not wanting to purchase a system with discrete graphics.
killingfloor,3997gw,lobo5000,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can see how you might have trouble with that, especially if your graphics are integrated.  A dedicated GPU is the norm for gaming.  I remember getting weird graphical glitches on my old laptop while playing Penumbra: Black plague.  But it was great for playing Doom and emulating N64 games."
killingfloor,3997gw,GodsGunman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"It runs perfectly fine on ""slightly aged"" PCs, just not laptops. A dedicated GPU is almost necessary to game any time in the past 5 years. You don't buy a toaster expecting it to do the laundry, so you don't buy a regular laptop expecting it can play the newest games. Integrated laptop graphics are an entirely different ballgame than real dedicated graphics cards. If you wanted all games to run on it then you would be severely holding back the potential of gaming meaning you might as well stick to KF1. With game improvements comes PC upgrade cost. It's just a rule."
killingfloor,396y2q,perpetualday,9,Tue Jun 9 18:21:59 2015 UTC,"Not a bad method.  Somewhat known about the SCAR headshots and the Zerker's EMP.  Problem is in a match it can be more difficult to implement effectively when you have a barrage of enemies not just coming at you, but running at you or moving twice as fast.  Circling was pretty much the only catch-all method that any class could do fairly effectively, but that'll be handicapped soon enough.  In most cases the big problem I see isn't when you have a single Scrake or FP in the mix.  It's when you have multiples at the same time that really break the back of a team on higher difficulties.  Even on Hard the 3 Scrakes and an FP in a row with their stats make it very difficult to assess and deal with.  One part of you says wait until the end to deal with Scrakes, while the other will say deal with them while you can when there are still 100+ enemies because moving isn't an option.  Can't wait to see what TWI does with balancing and how future classes will impact strategies.  As of now I find most strategies only apply to 1-2 waves before you need to rotate to a new one."
killingfloor,396y2q,Anonymous_freeloader,2,Tue Jun 9 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"In a coordinated group this shouldn't be an issue with a designated ""trash clearer"" and everyone calling out threats as they come. This is definitely a strat aimed more towards a team than lone wolf pugs.  But yes, you are right, things can easily get out of hand with even just a couple of pugs in a group.  We manage to clear HoE about 60% of the time as long as there are atleast 3 premades.  Also, i've never seen ""3 Scrakes and an FP"" and i've put in almost 300 hours. How does that even happen?"
killingfloor,396y2q,ur8695,4,Tue Jun 9 18:58:50 2015 UTC,3 scrakes and a FP happens. It's when your team mess about and don't deal with a problem while there is little trash
killingfloor,396y2q,qqnowqq,0,Tue Jun 9 19:15:10 2015 UTC,I thought you meant three spawning at the same time.  If your zerker and commando are communicating and dealing with scrakes as they pop up; you should be able to keep them from piling up like that.
killingfloor,396y2q,NitrousOxideLolz,13,Tue Jun 9 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"Been saying this for a while. Commando is the main scrake-killer, not support."

killingfloor,396y2q,AsiaDerp,5,Tue Jun 9 23:54:05 2015 UTC,It's up to us to spread the word
killingfloor,396y2q,qqnowqq,0,Tue Jun 9 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"If you EMP the scrake... support kill scrakes as fast, if not faster than commando. Unless you EMP the scrake across the room..."
killingfloor,396y2q,AsiaDerp,3,Thu Jun 11 02:41:00 2015 UTC,"It's not the worst thing, but it's not the best thing. Commando does a faster speedkill, and it works at any range. Support even at maximum non-lunge range is still wasting ammo. He's better at helping finish them off while also clearing trash in the meantime."
killingfloor,396y2q,qqnowqq,0,Thu Jun 11 02:59:41 2015 UTC,Is ~10 AA12 shots killing the scrake wasting ammo as a support? Not in my book at least.   Most berserker (that are actually doing his team good) I see play with AA12 instead of SCAR.
killingfloor,396y2q,Pfheonix,2,Thu Jun 11 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"I prefer AK or Pup as zerker. Also, it's only ~10 AA12 at maximum no-lunge range. Even just a few more steps back and it becomes 15-20 AA12 shots. However, it's only 24 scar shots as commando no matter what range you are.   I've tried out AA12 zerker before and it's not as good imo. Run out of ammo too quickly. Also the benefit of using an assault rifle as your side-arm is that you can snipe out low-mid zeds from afar for kills and still have ample ammo to help out with scrakes. You don't have that luxury as an AA12 zerker and become relegated to using your melee and getting in the way or risking losing armor."
killingfloor,396y2q,foofaw,0,Thu Jun 11 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"Well... atm everyone of them bug the weight for pluv + AA12, so yeah. When they fix that, they will likely to change scrakes too, then we will have a new way to deal with them."
killingfloor,396y2q,nakedlarissa,2,Thu Jun 11 03:15:56 2015 UTC,Pulv+AK/Pup is the true meta. :3
killingfloor,396y2q,nakedlarissa,33,Thu Jun 11 03:17:34 2015 UTC,"Been reading way too many complaints about scrakes lately... so figured i would share how my group deals with them.  To pull this off in a 6 player HoE game you will need a zerker and a commando.  Zerker tosses an emp, commando unloads a scar clip into it's head. If your commando can land 80% of the shots, the scrake will go down.  Things that can go wrong, and how to deal with them:  Problem #1:    An uncoordinated paste eater walks up to the scrake, causing it to do an attack animation, which moves the head, the commando misses, the scrake lives.   Solution #1:   You let the idiot tank the scrake, he will either learn, tank, or die. You should try to inform him of his mistake.   Problem #2:   Your commando can't land 80% headshots, or you don't have a commando.   Solution #2:   Have the team help with a couple extra bullets to alleviate some of the pressure.   Problem #3:   You don't have a zerker.   Solution #3:   Suck it up and go zerker. I hate playing zerker, but find myself railroaded into the role in most of my HoE games because you NEED a zerker to keep scrakes from piling up.   Problem #4:   The scrake stumbles around making the head difficult to hit.   Solution #4:   Inform the team that the following things can cause a scrake to stumble: using grenades (you should be saving these for fleshpounds anyways, scrakes take reduced dmg from explosives), shooting before the emp goes off, or using more than one emp.   Problem #5:   You get an unlucky ""fuck you"" spawn with two fleshpounds and a scrake.   Soution #5:   Don't enrage the FPs, take out the scrake, it should take about 5 seconds, THEN turn your attention to the FPs.  Alternatively one person grabs the scrake's attention and babysits the muscular toddler till the FPs are dealt with.   Problem #6:   There is a siren with the scrake that prevents you from using an EMP. Well, you should have taken care of the scrake while it was still far away (if the siren is close enough to scream, the scrake is too damn close as well.   Solution #6:   Time for some good ol' fashion circle strafing. Zerker should run up and do the hokey pokey, while the commando is now in charge of keeping the area around the scrake clear of tripping hazards.   Post any problems you have and i'll add solutions. If this shit gets popular enough I may end up making some more on different ways to deal with big threats."

killingfloor,396y2q,mmSNAKE,4,Tue Jun 9 21:59:21 2015 UTC,If you read the blurb I put in the comments it says it must be done by a commando.  A commando can kill a scrake in a HoE 6 man game online with one SCAR clip.

killingfloor,396y2q,mrtrotskygrad,7,Wed Jun 10 01:17:05 2015 UTC,"No I do get it. What you should have done is simply fraps your group doing a controlled scrake kill during one of the waves on HOE so you can demonstrate actually how much other things are going on WHILE the 2 man group handles the scrake. Your video is basically ""hey look, its an example of NOT the practical application of what my guide really is talking about!""  People complaining about scrakes are people not dealing with HOE.

killingfloor,396y2q,GDubZzZ,4,Wed Jun 10 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"I think you should because your guide is still correct on how to handle the scrake. In fact your guide actually starts to talk about how to take on HOE with a coordinated group, which I think is far more important than just scrake killing (the least of HOE problems in my opinion due to how scrakes are not a immediate threat most of the time and 90% of the weapons actually deal full damage to it).   Hell just fraps the entire video of a standard 7 wave HOE with you guys beating it OR just getting to the boss, and list out your strategies. That would be killer."

killingfloor,396y2q,jeansntshirt,3,Wed Jun 10 08:21:24 2015 UTC,That is five guaranteed scrake kills. Last few rounds have more scrakes than that I believe.  It is fine if team is coordinated and yells out for ammo boxes or if your supports carry backpacks. I can still see people getting boned higher end in pub games.  Fairly simple and efficient method. You can even stand a bit closer to fire.

killingfloor,3945ic,wajaba,2,Tue Jun 9 14:45:07 2015 UTC,"In the original he leads you based on your velocity and how far he is from you (I think...). This means that if you jump at the time he performs this calculation, he will see that you have a velocity whose direction is upwards, and he adjusts by shooting above you. If you get the timing down this works pretty well since the husk rockets pass through you in the original, meaning you're safe as long as you do it well enough that he doesn't shoot the ground.  Of course you can also change direction once he shoots, but you don't always have enough freedom of movement to avoid him this way. You can almost always jump, though."
killingfloor,3945ic,ScumSucker-,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:45:35 2015 UTC,Is there a video of how to do this in kf2? I could do it reliably in the original but my skills don't transfer apparently.
killingfloor,3945ic,Jonno_FTW,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to do it in kf2. To me, it seems like they don't lead. The projectiles can also hit you in kf2, where they would pass through you in kf1. I think your best bet is just to be moving perpendicular to the husk."
killingfloor,3945ic,ScumSucker-,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can either jump or strafe just like before and always dodge. Just need to time it. He always aims around your torso, so you can always jump over it."

killingfloor,393j9f,Ashiev,18,Tue Jun 9 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, welcome to Killing Floor 2. If you're looking to get an early grasp on the game, my suggestion is to dive right in. Killing Floor, at its core, is a simple wave-based horde shooter (at least until new gamemodes come out), and I personally think it most fun to soak in the gunplay first. As long as you enjoy shooting things, everything else will come to you (at least until you feel the desire to look something up).  In terms of beginner information, it's a bit limited due to the game being in Early Access and the small number of community members actively writing / updating guides at the moment. However, there are a couple useful ones that you could refer to if you need assistance grasping basics or intermediate tips. Check the Steam guides if you need anything cleared up, or this useful database constructed by /u/cat_is_fine_too (if you're looking for some raw numbers).  A couple of notes:   There are skills in this game. These skills serve as additional passive upgrades / changes to each class. Every class has 5 tiers of skills, each tier being unlocked every 5 levels (5, 10, 15, 20, 25). At each tier, you may select between one of two skills within that specific tier. These skills do not carry over to other classes (unlike how PAYDAY 2 works). If you're having trouble surviving, the best bet is just to stick with the group like glue. Killing Floor 2 has a much greater emphasis on teamplay compared to its predecessor, and typically--unless something goes horribly wrong--your back will be covered, and your teammates can take the heat off of you.   Feel free to ask me or this community anything if you have any questions. If you'd like, don't be shy to add me if you want a bud to play a few games with."
killingfloor,393j9f,Storb,5,Tue Jun 9 00:59:28 2015 UTC,"You won't always find people like that. Sometimes everyone just likes to run around, and they don't really play the game as a team. In lower difficulties you're probably dealing with other people in your shoes, and they're just trying to kill as much as possible. Join another server (no higher than medium for now) and try again!"

Seriously, I just got done a few minutes ago...  A lot of the tips within came from people on this subreddit, but a lot just comes from experience.  Just practice and don't get intimidated by the muscular death dealing clones.  The skills will soon follow.  In the mean time, here's my guide for your viewing pleasure."

However, with KF2 being a sequel to a popular game many players expect even newbies to know what they're supposed to be doing. A good start would be to find some gameplay or even tutorial videos to learn the perks, weapons and enemies.  And don't buy weapons for a different perk than yours!

killingfloor,393j9f,Rezol,7,Tue Jun 9 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, medic pistols only weight 1 load and even having an AA12 and DB still leaves with 14/15 weight, so having one to heal others isn't really bad. Unless you're talking about supports purchasing one on early waves."

Of course, there will always be people who don't play well with others to rain on your parade, but that can't really be avoided with random matchmaking.  As you level up, you unlock perks. You can see them already, you get to choose one of the two available per level (you can switch them at any time, once per wave if ingame).  Just make sure you're not going on higher difficulties until you ready, and practice the basics on lowest difficulty. Yes, normal will get boring after some time, but you should remember that going onto a difficulty you can't handle will put a lot more stress on your teammates, as any additional person on team increaces the amount and health of the zeds."

Both have over-the-top talkative characters, special units that ensure you'll get killed if you run off alone, and they both have no real storyline. In both cases you gotta be ready to play the same levels over and over again. In both games the hardest difficulty setting has exclusive mechanics that creates a learning curve."

That way nobody sees you screw up; it took me like 4 or 5 rounds until I could solo finish a map on normal difficulty.   Try to learn the layouts of the maps so you know where you can run to, also it's a good idea to keep moving as you'll find ammo/weapons (to sell)/armour lying on the ground and it will make sure the zeds form a nice conga line behind you for you to headshot."

killingfloor,393j9f,1wsx10,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:54:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds like 1) You joined a game that was already over halfway done if you ran into a fleshpound, and 2) You joined some immature players, or players who don't know any better about welding doors all over the place.     One of the very first things you should do is acquaint yourself with the Server Browser. The automated matchmaking is not so great, and may drop you into a game that is already very far along, putting you up against large hordes of aggressive Zeds you don't know how to face yet. Using the Server Browser instead, you can always see how many players you will be joining, what wave they are on, and how good your connection (ping) is to the server. For just starting out, you really want to avoid jumping into games on anything above wave 2 or 3, so you get a chance to get used to the weapons, scoring headshots with them, finding your way around the map you're on, and how buying weapons works. You should also get used to picking up weapons and armor around the map, and selling the spare weapons for extra dosh (be sure to drop them with backspace before selling for an extra 50 each). Beyond that, try to find chatty players in game who can answer questions you have, or add people who from here on reddit who are willing to help you learn.    Beyond that, read some of the guides Storb linked, check out some of the weapon damage and Zed health values to get an idea what guns will be able to do enough damage to pop a zed's head off, get used to carrying a medic pistol and using it for emergency heals on other players, and get used to saving up dosh for bigger, better guns. Also learn to quick heal yourself with Q, many players seem to forget this exists."

killingfloor,393j9f,foofaw,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:51:06 2015 UTC,"Just some thoughts... Lab is a tough map. For a beginner, maps with long lines of sight are way easier/way less overwhelming.  Definitely agree with others when they say, stick with a big group of people. I get zero pleasure from the game when I play solo (that's just me). Don't worry about skills as much as being where you need to be to stay alive, knowing what to agro and what not to agro.  Pick a class that focuses on damage when you're a beginner. Don't pick berserker or medic right off the bat, these classes take a lot of tactical experience (maybe just my ineptitude at them speaking here) and are hard when you don't know the game.   Focus on saving money in the beginning, using your pistol as much as possible, and buying the right weapon combos so you aren't wasting money buying weapons you've already bought or buying ammo you'll never use.  When in doubt, run away and try to find weapons to sell, ammo/armor to collect.  Don't feel bad about dying, having level zeros and level ones die on a team doesn't destroy the game for people. The biggest fuck ups you can make are welding an entire team into a room and trapping/killing the entire squad. Don't weld doors unless it seems like a REALLY good idea.  Sorry those guys were dicks. I definitely like playing with beginners, I like to give helpful advice in game. It takes practice and lots of breaks. Don't play too much or you'll get nightmares, and try to pee in between games."

killingfloor,393j9f,mmSNAKE,0,Tue Jun 16 05:16:05 2015 UTC,"My inexperience as a player makes me unwelcome within the KF2 community. :/    Certainly not. If you are new though I recommend NOT playing Suicidal and Hell on Earth. Until you learn the game you will most likely end up as a burden on your team.  But playing normal/hard to learn is fair. Keep in mind that some habits and tactics people use at lower difficulties go out the window when going to higher difficulties.  At the base the game is simple. Kill hordes of enemies, get money for kills, spend money in between waves for gear. You will not be able to solo everything at later difficulties. Normal, you can, hard you can. Suicidal it gets difficult with fleshpounds. So mostly stick with your team, make sure all angles are covered, and you are serving the role you picked.  I would bookmark this  You don't need to study this, but use it as a reference as you go. If you think a tactic, or a weapon works or not you can use that to check your numbers.  Unlike KF1, this game isn't crippling by playing with low level perks. Weapon prices used to scale with your perk level, which made it very difficult to play at higher difficulties. This time around, if you know how to play well, having a lower level perk won't slow you down too much.  There is a lot to this game, while it may be simple at surface level, a great deal goes into it. If you aren't sure of something just ask. Plenty of people around here are both skilled and knowledgeable."

The main point of the video was to illustrate how Scrakes and Fleshpounds can be more optimally taken. And even though the one way hold really does help bring everything down quicker, it still demonstrates the proper techniques - zerknade + assault rifle spam (on and offperk) along with the berserkers spamming m2 on Fleshpounds on top of a mednade, occsaionlly blocking and parrying.

killingfloor,393mww,MarsMo,11,Tue Jun 9 00:49:29 2015 UTC,contray to what the perk descripton of the zerker says im pretty sure the bonus damage affects all of their  weapons.
killingfloor,393mww,dickleslipper,3,Tue Jun 9 00:57:32 2015 UTC,So the Dmg bonus works on both VLAD/Sawblade?
killingfloor,393mww,Blockyz,11,Tue Jun 9 01:00:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, damage applies to all berserker weapons.   Tripwire really should just put ""Perk Damage"" rather than ""Melee damage"". If anything they should do that with each perk, no point trying to be fancy about it when it effects each weapon."
killingfloor,393mww,darkwing9912,7,Tue Jun 9 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that's a point best explained by listing VLADs strengths and uses. Firstly, as you pointed out, VLAD has a great stumble chance meaning it can displace zeds pretty well whilst doing a good amount of damage. That is quite useful as even when playing a berserker, you might not have enough time to close a gap and stumble a target with a melee swing before they shoot or attack a teammate. Pulling out VLAD fixes that issue quite nicely.   Secondly, the weapon allows you to decapitate key targets with stunning efficiency which I think is crucial at the lower levels when your survivability is quite low and getting puked on can spell death. Being able to quickly pull out the nailgun and decapitate a couple of bloats and/or a husk is VERY useful if you plan on pulling out a pulveriser or crovel and dishing out damage face-to-face. It might seem like VLAD would make more sense on a Support, but I think it fits Berserker far better as it serves to even out the berserkers skill set. Without VLAD, the 'zerker would lack a ranged stumble without the eviscerator and the berserker would not be able to decapitate key targets from afar before engaging."
killingfloor,393mww,itonlygetsworse,4,Tue Jun 9 00:59:12 2015 UTC,"The nailgun is basically a super powerful, penetrating and ricocheting pistol that has 2x more ammo then any other pistol.  It will headshot and kill all clots. It will headshot and destroy bloaters. And you can always switch to burst mode to blast sirens or husks. Its a really good gun.  Now the biggest problem with this gun is that it doesn't get the speed bonus that berserkers have with their melee weapons.  The other issue is you could technically use a bullpup instead as your trash clearer  gun on harder difficulties instead of a nail gun because the nail gun has terrible aim unless you ADS. And the iron sights are terrible."

killingfloor,393mww,darkwing9912,3,Tue Jun 9 14:13:08 2015 UTC,"I do know that Fleshpounds have a large vulnerability to explosives, but I do not remember hearing of a vulnerability to piercing damage. Though yes, VLAD does pierce so it would be logical to think that it would do piercing damage, if the game calls it such.  Oh. Upon checking the wiki it would seem yes, they do also have a vulnerability to piercing rounds just like they do explosives. (150% damage received from those sources.) Well read."

killingfloor,391zgz,ZackAttackHall,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:38:12 2015 UTC,I think there's a bug where if you left click before the syringe is fully drawn after switching to it then you self heal sometimes.

You can also set this value to any number below 1 if you like your ADS being slower than hip fire but the current setting is too slow for you. 0.50 will be 50% of normal sensitivity.   Browse to your ""C:\Users[USERNAME]\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config"" folder. Open the file named ""KFInput.ini"" in Notepad Use ctrl+f or browse for the line labeled ""ZoomedSensitivityScalar="" and set it to ""1"" or any number from 0 to 1 e.g. 0.5 Make sure to save the file and reboot your game afterward. The file may be reset during Early Access changes or by opening/modifying the sensitivity settings in-game and it will need to be modified again.

killingfloor,38y531,ZeldenGM,26,Sun Jun 7 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I like Zed time but I don't care about how fast I reload during it, extra damage i get during it, and i personally don't want to extend it. I want lvl 25 perks to do more perk specific things."
killingfloor,38y531,xMongolian,5,Sun Jun 7 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"But those are more-or-less perk-specific things already. Commando can reload faster, like in KF1. Support can get an increase in damage, like in KF1. Berserker can get more health for survivability, like in KF1. And Medic can heal more easily, like in KF1.... or ... stun things.... which is weird but hugely OP if it happens. One or both of each zed time perk has a strong tie to its respective perk hallmarks."
killingfloor,38y531,qqnowqq,8,Sun Jun 7 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"But I feel like thats just so ""eh"". Ya know? When I hit lvl 25 I personally want to feel like Ive worked for something other than some more health or being able to reload fast during Zed time. Maybe the Berserker should get a taunt skill that aggros Fleshpounds or something of the sort. Im just spitballing. By no means do I want to have some wild power or some shit but when I hit level 25 I want to feel like my character is a experienced Zed hunter who has developed a skill(s) in their respective perks. Just my two cents."
killingfloor,38y531,xMongolian,3,Sun Jun 7 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"But I feel like thats just so ""eh""    I have been thinking the same thing, in KF1 when you reached max perk level it was much more satisfying; starting each game with a (compared to 9mm) very strong weapon."
killingfloor,38y531,gguuiypoq,2,Mon Jun 8 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"If that's how you feel, that's how you feel. To me though, both commando and the medic stun perk talents are really satisfying since they can earn you such great bonuses, imo. All three of them can save you from scrakes or fleshpounds either with a kill or a stun. As for the aggro thing, that could be nice I guess, but most times as berserker during zed time with fleshpounds I already have aggro, haha. Makes me really wish aggro worked like before - just shoot at them until they look at you =/"
killingfloor,38y531,qqnowqq,4,Sun Jun 7 22:46:15 2015 UTC,It's just a matter of time before we have modded servers with a bunch of wild ass perks and guns like KF1 hahaha
killingfloor,38y531,xMongolian,2,Sun Jun 7 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"Both work really well. If you get the faster firing speed you can essentially kill scrakes and potentially fleshpounds by yourself during zedtime (without zerk nades) and reload lets you killwhore more easily while even being able to extend zedtime.  Personally, I find more usage in the reload speed buff since there's a lot more trash then there are scrakes and fleshpounds. Also, the reload speed one is a bit more of a team zedtime perk, as any kills you get extend zedtime, allowing for potential medic stuns and even more zedtime extensions. The firing speed perk can do this too, but just not as well since you're going to have to reload and can't kill to extend after a while."
killingfloor,38y531,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:49:28 2015 UTC,"Fire faster. Combined with the perk passive and Auto Fire for +48% damage, plus triple firing speed...  Put it this way, with the fire faster perk, the AK-12's burst-fire mode in Zed time has the highest burst damage output in the game, eclipsing even the AA-12. An entire mag of headshots will severely wound and likely decapitate if not outright kill a Scrake on any difficulty, and can deal severe damage to a Fleshpound as well. It's the Commando's absolute best option for dealing with heavy-hitters.  The Professional (reload / weapon switch speed) is alright, but I find it rather mediocre at best - a good Lvl 25 Commando shouldn't need to switch weapons during zed time, as a single headshot with the AK-12 or SCAR on a trash mob can extend it."
killingfloor,38y531,Kellervo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:06:16 2015 UTC,"I have a glitch with this perk that if Im already shooting full auto and enter z time, I have to stop shooting and start back for it to shoot fast(if I don't stop, it just shoots normal speed)....which kinda defeats the purpose if I have to stop.  So I use the other perk"
killingfloor,38y531,MrPickles82,3,Mon Jun 8 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"Only if its a bit less Grindy to reach level 25. The rate of progression from 1-20 is perfect but then they slam on the breaks, which is fine because the lvl 25 skill isn't that great."
killingfloor,38y531,TeaL3af,12,Mon Jun 8 17:01:53 2015 UTC,While I understand the problem you have with it I ultimately disagree. I love that the level 25 perk ain't all that amazing. Killing floor 1 had a major level elitism problem with servers kicking those who were not level 5 because they didn't get the big bonus of spawning with a perk weapon. If killing floor 2 had a similar 'hit max level. Get amazing bonus.' System that elitism would rear it's ugly head again.
killingfloor,38y531,CirnoWhiterock,7,Mon Jun 8 04:15:54 2015 UTC,I never encountered that elitism in KF1 except in the case of level 1/level 0 characters joining higher difficulties. Either way I don't think player elitism is a valid reason to gimp game mechanics.
killingfloor,38y531,itonlygetsworse,2,Sun Jun 7 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"If you're making crappy level 25 perks because of ""elitism"", you're doing game design  poorly. Elitism is something that will exist as long as you have any system in place where difficulty requires as many benefits as possible (HOE for example). The fact of the matter is that L25 perks are completely irrelevant for 95% of the gameplay. They could have simply cut off leveling at 20. But then they would have no reason to time sink people into the game more."
killingfloor,38y531,j0hn_swift,2,Sun Jun 7 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"Didn't read all the comments so might already have been mentioned, but when I first saw that some skills would only be up during zed-time I was kinda sceptic. But after a while of playing I must say it fits the game perfectly. How you get that extra boost with supports on your team when there's a Fleshpound coming in or the fact that the Medic's perk skill called Sedative can stun scrakes completly for a short duration of time can be crucial at times. And commandos being able to keep you in zedtime for a longer period of time is just a blessing. At the moment I think it works really good, but I have a feeling that TW have thought about that random aspect, so it wouldn't surprise me if one of the new classes have something like a ""zedtime"" granade, so upon explosion you will be granted to go into zedtime at any given time to remove the random factors of it."
killingfloor,38y531,chief_shankaho,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"Don't know about the zed time grenade idea, but I totally agree with the first part of your comment. The zed time extension and stun perks have saved me more than once."
killingfloor,38y531,Kvasir94,2,Mon Jun 8 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"Level 25 perks are absolutely amazing, actually. Get a commando that's good on your team and just see how long zed time is. Zed time is also nearly guaranteed to happen every 60 seconds or so with 6 players killing zeds. It also engages very often when a man goes down which can be vital.any of the bonuses benefit your whole team at once and if all 6 people have a zed time perk you get tons of bonuses. You can also combine that with the fact that commandos extending zed time (every kill they get during it) retriggers many of the bonuses each time."
killingfloor,38y531,steelsoldier,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"I play 25 commando primarily, I'm not finding that the triggering extra zed time is actually activating that often so not sure if that's part of the mechanic or it just being a bit buggy  edit: also doesn't address the no zed time on the boss issue"
killingfloor,38y531,cha0sengineer,3,Sun Jun 7 23:07:17 2015 UTC,"I kinda wanted the last level 25 perks to give bonus inside zed time and outside of it, they could both be different bonuses."
killingfloor,38y531,BrighterthanMoon,2,Sun Jun 7 23:29:32 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good idea: have a lesser ability that when zed time kicks in is hugely amplified

killingfloor,38y531,djgromo,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"The level 25 perks should be on their own, not tied to levels (or at least lower level), and Level 25 should be something else.  If they were to make actual level 25 perks, I wouldn't want them to be too powerful, otherwise you'll have people saying ""lvl 25 or we will kick you"" like in KF1.

killingfloor,38y531,Erik_Dolphy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:10:41 2015 UTC,Maybe 25 lvl players should have much bigger chance of starting zed time? I don't like this 5th tier perk at all. It feels like it have zero impact on the match where on KF 1 we got badass weapon when spawning.
killingfloor,38y531,standardstyle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:54:37 2015 UTC,"The medic stun ability is legitimately useful. Some of them are meh, particularly the berserker."

killingfloor,38y531,standardstyle,-1,Mon Jun 8 18:15:29 2015 UTC,Someone suggested this before but it would be too powerful as you could easily chain zed time to overpower flesh pounds/scrakes in one go and the same could be used on the bosses.

Since the guy above you was replying to the alt weapons being a lvl 25 unlock, we can also surmise that the ""showing off"" would most likely be in reference to some kind of achievement, and due to context that achievement would likely be lvl 25.   I had never heard of melee weapon flourishes referred to as ""juggling"" before, but even before I made that connection it was clear he meant using the alt weapons to show off. This skill is known as reading comprehension, and is important to understand the flow of conversations. A good way to practice it might be reading books with lots of symbolism or lots of ambiguous dialogue; I'd recommend Steinbeck, his books are great for that, IMHO."

killingfloor,38x0cs,cheesellama_thedevil,2,Sun Jun 7 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Well it was like that in KF1, and it worked out well-enough without making it a necessity to powerlevel.   L5> L6 | Bullpup>AK | Pump>Hunting | Machete>FireAxe | Others  It could work in KF2 as well with something like:  L0>L25 | AR>Bullpup | Pump>Hunting | MedPistol>MedSMG  Shovel>Pulv would be a bit overpowered though, haha."
killingfloor,38x0cs,qqnowqq,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Well it was like that in KF1   ...yes, and KF2 is obviously an exact remake of KF1. /s  I feel like KF2 is a way for Tripwire to decrease the insane e-peen boost of KF1 without severe community backlash. IMO the lesser the boost higher levels give you, the better the game is. I've been able to defeat suicidal as a level 0, and I still can't beat HoE even with my level 22 zerk, 17 medic, or 15 commando and support.   Shovel>Pulv would be a bit overpowered though, haha.   Um, Vlad the impaler is the tier 2 weapon, so I don't know why you said that..."
killingfloor,38x0cs,cheesellama_thedevil,3,Mon Jun 8 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I blanked and forgot about the vlad, haha. However, there's even more of an ""insane e-peen boost"" in KF2. With all of these rewards every 5 levels, there's more reason to powerlevel in this game than there is to in KF1. Getting better starting weapons isn't nearly as much of an incentive to boast or powerlevel than gaining these wonderful perks and stat boosts, which really help make the game far easier. For instance, 45% extra damage for commando makes a world of difference for killing scrakes, whereas starting with the bullpup instead of the AR just boosts how early you get to your end-game loadout. It doesn't change the overall difficulty of the game, as opposed to all of these other perks and stat changes.  Also, in KF1 you could easily beat sui and HoE as levels 0-5 as long as you understood the basic mechanics. Hell, I've even beaten HoE camping with a L5 medic in KF2. Just need to learn the meta.  And the reason it's fair to compare KF2 to KF1 is to have a solid baseline to look at. If it worked well there, it's probable it can work well here. KF2 doesn't need to be a replica of KF1 to be successful, but it sure can learn some things from it. Maybe getting higher tier starting weapons isn't good or necessary, but there's a solid model to study from that's had years of a developing meta."
killingfloor,38x0cs,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:41:36 2015 UTC,"Also, in KF1 you could easily beat sui and HoE as levels 0-5 as long as you understood the basic mechanics.   I did. Maybe I didn't try it enough, but I constantly found that I hadn't had enough money in KF1 in order to buy weapons that were extremely useful though. The only exception might be sharpie, since the crossbow was always $800.   Honestly, I blanked and forgot about the vlad, haha. However, there's even more of an ""insane e-peen boost"" in KF2.

It doesn't change the overall difficulty of the game, as opposed to all of these other perks and stat changes.   I'd agree with you if it weren't for the insane discounts in KF1 that I previously mentioned. 70% off? You could buy a normally $4000 weapon (such as the Husk Gun, AA-12, or M32) by wave 4 and probably have enough left over for an on-perk backup weapon FFS, provided that you were level 6 and it was an on-perk weapon. KF2 has no weapon discounts, which is why I consider it to give low-level players a much more fair chance on higher difficulties."
killingfloor,38x0cs,cheesellama_thedevil,4,Mon Jun 8 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, removal of weapon discounts has been surprisingly (to me) a step in a nice direction. That being said, the way to low level KF1 HoE was to use flinch combos and flinchlocks. With lower levels on higher difficulties it was actually even better to use cheaper guns for combos and killwhoring than to use stronger, more expensive weapons. For instance, it's much better to go for a LAR flinchlock on scrakes as a L3 sharp on HoE than it is to go for a series of like 5-7 xbow headshots, haha. The AK, hunting, and dual flares were also more than sufficient enough and fairly easy to get early on. However, things like the m14 and m32 were pretty impossible to get without some exploiting or asking people to buy them for you >_<  It's nice that KF2 has equal opportunity for obtaining the loadout you want at the same pace as anyone else, but the perk talents and stat boosts you gain with leveling are far more important to the metagame than being able to get specific guns later on. Past wave 4 or 5, money isn't really an issue anymore anyway if you managed eco well, and by this point you should already have your end game loadout. With prompt coordination, it is possible to beat KF2 HoE with low level perks, but unless you kite, lower level players will still struggle without the damage and perk buffs. (Suicidal>HoE is a really huge leap in KF2 vs KF1 imo)   KF2 really lets low level players enjoy the game fairly easily with almost no coordination up to suicidal, but HoE is a different beast. Unless you have some competent levels (15+) it's going to be a huge uphill battle just because of the lack of damage, whereas in KF1 you could manage to get by if you understood the flinching mechanics, dealt with trash well, and could stockpile money to a demo for an m32 by wave 7.  Giving the ability to spawn with slightly stronger guns won't change the metagame nearly as much as simply leveling up and gaining perk talents has. All that spawning with a bullpup would do is allow you to buy your scar a wave earlier than you normally would. It doesn't change how hard it is to kill scrakes or fleshpounds nor does it change how the endgame is played at all. It's arguable that spawning with more expensive weapons is a bit of a broken system, like in KF1, but all of the weapons in KF2 are so cheap that you're going to be able to afford your entire loadout by the time things are getting serious anyway."
killingfloor,38x0cs,qqnowqq,7,Mon Jun 8 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"Never really thought about being able to pick what weapons to bring in at the start of the game. New weapons are certainly wanted and needed in all weapon tiers and being able to pick weapons to bring in adds more in customization and individuality of your character.   But then this brings up balance between all tier 1 weapons, how would we prevent a tier 1 weapon from being basically the best of the bunch (In the context of the class you're using) and is the only used and picked tier 1 weapon when entering the game? (Like the current medic pistol, seriously it's too good) Either way i'd have no idea how i'd play out."
killingfloor,38x0cs,AngryMobster,3,Mon Jun 8 05:46:40 2015 UTC,"The design of the perk selection UI seems to suggest that loadout customization is something that will happen.

KF2 doesn't even start to get hard until wave 5, so overall the meta doesn't change since you'd probably already have gotten a better weapon by waves 2 or 3."

killingfloor,38x0cs,TeaL3af,4,Sun Jun 7 20:27:05 2015 UTC,"I think more tier 1 weapons would be pointless if we couldn't pick which one to start with.

killingfloor,38x0cs,m1r11,2,Mon Jun 8 00:34:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thinking. I loved picking my first weapon after wave one in KF1, provided I wasn't playing as one of my higher-levelled perks.

killingfloor,38x0cs,TheBadBoy5000,2,Sun Jun 7 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think that there should be alternate weapons you can start with which are more based on playing class and doing X things specific to that class, not as extreme as some of the levelling stuff as kf1, but enough to make it feel like an accomplishment when you unlock that second pistol, or the alternate melee."

killingfloor,38x0cs,asexyalien,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:42:19 2015 UTC,"That's about how I look at it too, and it basically is. Before getting the larger mags, it's basically a 20 round version of the medic pistol with a flash light and a (promptly disabled) burst fire option instead of healing darts. Once you get larger mags, it feels a little bit more like something a commando would use, but the damage still feels pretty low. The burst fire honestly seems to fire those three rounds slower than I can tap them out on single fire, and tapping out each one is a lot easier to get them all on target, not to mention not wasting any rounds if the target dies one the first or second shot in the burst. Still, it does a decent job of serving its intended purpose: getting you through the first wave or three before you buy something bigger (AK or SCAR)."

They choose a player and do not focus on anyone else unless provoked or if you get in their way.   It might also be a mechanic to keep them from bunching up too much. TW has mentioned that they want to force teams to kite more often. If the zeds focused on the first player they see, it would be fairly easy to put a zerk up front with a support and medic behind, letting the zerk do their thing while the others support them. Now though, sometimes the zeds will walk past the zerk and occupy the others, which can cause the group to get overrun and have to move."

However, Zeds that were practically walking right next to me would either head past me for the stairs, or if I was on the stairs, completely ignore me in favor of jumping over the railing to attack someone else. While the team was dealing with a fleshpound, I tried to keep a scrake busy upstairs, but he would only turn to look at me if he was close enough to actually lunge at me.

This makes your question very confusing.  What exactly are you suggesting?  Is there a small percentage chance of the scrake acting differently?  Will the scrake try psyching us, pretending to step forward but decide to ""stay ready""?  Why won't the dodge happen 100% of the time?  Some game mechanic or player error?  Are you trying to suggest a way where scrake dodging is possible but not the exploit?  Because I feel the only reason the scrake dodge should fail is by player error, missing the timing window or getting cut off by other zeds, not a random game mechanic that determines the ""risk""."
killingfloor,390t1f,Kuebic,2,Mon Jun 8 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"I somewhat agree with him. As it is now, it takes 0 skill to start circling a scrake. He's proposing there should be a chance of failure by requiring a keen eye to see which attack he's going to do - either the large dodge-able swing, or an un-dodge-able attack if you get near him.   Although I think circling should just be removed altogether since it's just sloppy anyway, you can also make the argument that you should only be able to circle in certain situations. Like since there's no longer any flinchlocking, you should instead stumble or flinch a scrake, so you can get behind him every time. None of this dumb 'just run past him' crud..  But yeah.. scrake dodging is definitely an exploit atm since he's never going to be hitting you if you merely run along his side... >_>"

That is not true. Not at all. A scrake will spin regardless of the number of players. In regard to never hitting you, unless you're a perk with movement speed, an enraged scrake can hit you with his non-telegraphed short diagonal cut where the swing originates from his arm flailing in the air (followed by a thrust) in addition to the double spin attack (followed by a diagonal cut) as he approaches you. Permit me to share my notes.    My Observations Regarding the Scrake's Attacks:  Non-Enraged Approaching Scrake:   Step -> Step -> Forward Thrust Step -> Step -> Diagonal Slash Diagonal Slash -> Step -> Diagonal Slash -> Step   Non-Enraged Hugging Scrake:    Thrust x8 (Actually Hits 12 Times) Horizontal Slash Diagonal Slash Diagonal Slash -> Step -> Diagonal Slash -> Step   Enraged Approaching Scrake:   (Slow) Thrust -> Horizontal Slash (Fast) Diagonal Slash -> Thrust (Slow) Uppercut Slash -> Thrust (Slow) Spinning Slash (Might Look Like a Wide Horizontal Slash) (Fast) Spinning Slash x2 -> Diagonal Slash   Enraged Hugging Scrake:   (Slow) Thrust x8 (Actually Hits 12 Times) (Slow) Thrust -> Diagonal Slash (Slow) Horizontal Slash x2 (Fast) Diagonal Slash x2 (First Hit Actually Hits Twice...) (Fast) Spinning Slash x2 (Fast) Spinning Slash x2 -> Diagonal Slash (Fast) Spinning Slash x3 (Fast) Hand Swipe -> Diagonal Slash -> Horizontal Slash -> Diagonal Slash   Note: (Slow) and (Fast) only refer to the initial strike.     Furthermore, reference the HoE outpost solo by /u/The_Real_Fat_Cat. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EYhS-3DXM4&feature=youtu.be&t=46m30s.

Thanks for the clarification."
killingfloor,390t1f,Kuebic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, personally I think this idea would be great, if implemented. But it'd just be smoother overall if they allowed flinchlocking to be a thing again, even if it was the janky offperk LAR one where you took some damage during it."
killingfloor,390t1f,qqnowqq,-1,Mon Jun 8 17:06:16 2015 UTC,"sorry, what i meant is when the scrake starts his step forward attack, that situation there is a 100% chance that he will do that step forward attack, so you can just run past, no skill required... im suggesting maybe there should be 50% chance he will step forward or 50% chance he will stay ready in which case you shouldnt run past or you will get hit. i dont know where you got the idea the skrake is trying to psyche you, never said the animations should be similar untill its too late, it should make the player pay attention and react to what the scrake does"
killingfloor,390t1f,Kuebic,2,Tue Jun 9 06:45:10 2015 UTC,"i dont know where you got the idea the skrake is trying to psyche you   The term ""stay ready"" isn't very clear.  I'm imagining when the scrake is about to lunge, he pulls a Kobe Bryant with a fake step forward but doesn't lunge, instead ""stays ready"" to attack the side the player tries running by.  To me, that's a psych-out, even if there is a small visual cue it's not a true lunge.  But yeah... It's making more sense now.  Basically it's not that the player doesn't have a 100%  chance dodging the lunge even if executed perfectly, but it's that the scrake gets another lunge attack where running by his side will hit the player and it's up to the player to read the scrake correctly."
killingfloor,390t1f,AsiaDerp,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"exactly. i know the difference between punishing and challenging. i want it to be challenging, definitely not punishing."
killingfloor,390t1f,Steakosaurus,3,Wed Jun 10 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"A raging scrake already have an attack that will still hit you once if you just run pass him, on either side."
killingfloor,390t1f,TeaL3af,4,Tue Jun 9 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"I think the intentional convolution clear visual cues in effort to confuse the player is never a good idea. Players want to feel rewarded for recognizing a mob's action, and reacting accordingly. When you change the visual cue for certain actions to all be similar, it reduces the player's ability to respond to guessing at what the best course of action is, which can be super fucking frustrating.   You talk about the ""risk"" of running past a scrake that's winding up for his foward attack. The risk is already inherent - misstep, and get wrecked. The more mobs that are around, the greater chance for mishap. Yes, if executed perfectly, the player gets through unscathed - this isn't a bad thing, this is good gameplay for this scenario. Players want to feel rewarded for putting the time in to learn the mechanics of the game and how best to approach and deal with certain mobs. When you lower or remove that reward, it leads to less gratifying gameplay.   Why would I bother trying to run past the Scrake when there's a 50/50 shot that instead of the forward step that I can run past, the wind up animation I'm seeing is actually a clothesline that knocks me back and shreds my health and armor? Fuck that, I'll just keep running away."
killingfloor,390t1f,MarsMo,0,Mon Jun 8 12:45:16 2015 UTC,"i think you misunderstood me, i want the player to be able to figure out what the scrake will do, then act accordingly. i dont want it to be unclear untill its too late, where would the fun in that be?"
killingfloor,390t1f,MondayWeather,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:49:08 2015 UTC,"I think it would be great if all the Scrakes attacks where telegraphed somewhat, assuming circling is removed. Currently if an enraged one gets close and you aren't a move-speed class circling is the only reliable defence because some of his attacks hit you before you have a chance to react."
killingfloor,390t1f,qqnowqq,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think KF2 is more ""ACTION-PACKED"" so players are supposed to think in a ""ACTION"" way.  SC charges at me, so I run into a perfect direction in a perfect timing, that is good. Simply running in circles to fool a should-be-a-threat enemy, is bad.  I think the proper solution is to give SC more moves to deal w/ players, step-forward stab to hit runaways, bladestorm to cut down mutiple players, ground slam to stun circle-dancers.  This makes KF2 more ""1 on 1"" feeling. When you see one you observe his movement then pick the right move to counter, isn't fun?"
killingfloor,390t1f,MondayWeather,0,Tue Jun 9 12:56:52 2015 UTC,"You usually get hit when you run past him anyway, it literally has to be perfect."
killingfloor,390t1f,TeaL3af,3,Mon Jun 8 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"What? All you do is run through either side. As long as you have some distance and sprint through, you won't ever get hit. There's almost nothing to perfect with circling."
killingfloor,390t1f,TeaL3af,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"What I was going for is that if you remove the circle part, he will always hit you (on the initial dodge). So you could increase the turn speed, but not be able to constantly dodge him initially as he would take down your health. Hope that made sense!"
killingfloor,390t1f,NitrousOxideLolz,-1,Mon Jun 8 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"I think we has a cooldown on his big derpy lunge, and also doesn't use it so often when enraged. If you run past him and he still clips you that's probably why."

killingfloor,38yvur,m1r11,3,Mon Jun 8 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't think of any way for this to get fixed. I think it works perfectly the way it's supposed to while in combat. Changing it to nerf the ability to restore armor between waves or in a wave trough would nerf it during combat as well.

killingfloor,38yvur,chief_shankaho,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:44:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, not too sure how they would fix it other than ""No falling damage"", maybe just make it so the syringe doesnt give armour on heal and you need to rely on the grenade?"

killingfloor,38xxqi,kfcno,8,Sun Jun 7 20:04:34 2015 UTC,"Well, they are class specific weapons aren't they? I'm not sure why anyone would assume they wouldn't when even the starting non-class specific pistol does as well."
killingfloor,38xxqi,Mingeblaster,2,Sun Jun 7 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"I believe there is still plenty of room for confusion, as the other non-specific weapons (The Katana and Flamethrower) do not grant any XP for any class. The 9mm pistol that is granted to all players at the start grants XP to the class wielding it, the melee weapons shown grant XP to the class associated with it regardless of what class is actually using it. This means that a commando wielding a scalpel still gains XP for the medic."
killingfloor,38xxqi,Mingeblaster,5,Mon Jun 8 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"Seems I misread what the OP was about with my pistol comment, although my basic point still stands - It's fairly obvious that class specific weapons will grant XP to the class they belong to, regardless of the class wielding them or the slot they inhabit. The Katana and flamethrower aren't associated with their respective ""martial artist"" and firebug classes since they're not ingame yet, but once they are they almost certainly grant XP to those classes in the same way."
killingfloor,38xxqi,m1r11,3,Mon Jun 8 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"This was already known, though not sure by how many. Have you tried starting as a medic and swapping to commando, then killing people with scalpel?"
killingfloor,38xxqi,m1r11,4,Mon Jun 8 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"I just tried this, and even after switching perks the XP goes to the perk associated with it. So in this case, scalpel kills contribute to the Medic even while playing as a Commando."
killingfloor,38xxqi,exnx,2,Mon Jun 8 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh oki, I knew that using say, shotguns on zerker, or assault rifles on support would give the xp to the perk the weapon belongs to, was unsure about the default melee weapons.  Not that I use them much but it's handy to know :D"
killingfloor,38xxqi,Brawlly,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:06:34 2015 UTC,If you're playing support and kill zeds with standard pistol does it give xp to commando?

killingfloor,38xxqi,exnx,4,Sun Jun 7 21:29:17 2015 UTC,I'm sure gunslinger will have his own class specific pistol. The default pistol is likely going to stay default for whatever class you have.
killingfloor,38xxqi,Brawlly,3,Sun Jun 7 21:34:29 2015 UTC,I don't know why I said standard pistol.  Say you are support and kill zeds with a SCAR.  Does it give xp to commando?

I use the semi-auto mode for commando so rarely that I don't consider it worth it, and many others feel the same way."
killingfloor,38yv8g,cheesellama_thedevil,4,Mon Jun 8 02:40:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, single-fire damage buff would only be worthwhile if it proposed a stronger damage buff than its auto-fire buff counterpart (maybe 25 or 30% single vs 20% auto). Make it so you either don't reload often because you do stronger, single shots, or so that you reload more often because you do weaker, but continuous sprays.

Don't get me wrong, I understand the appeal of semi-auto (back in KF1 I was more of a semi-auto guy myself) but I think that full-auto is better for clearing out as much trash as quickly as possible, which is, you know, the purpose of the commando. Also, I don't like looking down sights due to how it slows you down, so why try to be precise? Just aim for close and medium range trash, that's what the commando is intended to do. I know sharps isn't in yet, but the commando wasn't meant for precision shots. It's meant to be the ultimate trash-cleaner."

Being able to reload while sprinting would encourage kiting even more =/  The game's already sloppy enough with so much emphasis on kiting and circling... >_<  Also, tactical reload is already really useful. There's no real need to make something great even better when the alternative (single-fire damage buff) is entirely overshadowed. Don't make more reasons to pick one over the other. Each one should be a somewhat equal trade-off, only differing in playstyles. And nah, mando would be much better with sprinting tactical reload than support would be. If you're sprinting away from something, chances are you're going to have some distance between you and zeds, meaning less damage for shotguns. This doesn't matter for assault rifles since they do consistent damage at all ranges. Furthermore, shotguns have less total ammo, so you would not only be dealing far less damage than normal but you'd also be eating up all of your ammunition much faster."
killingfloor,38yv8g,Steakosaurus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:51:47 2015 UTC,"Wat.  Tactical reload is the only reasonable choice for commando in that tier and is EXTREMELY powerful as it stands. What's the point in having +20% semi auto damage when you can just tap single shots with the +20% full auto damage perk? This rings especially true if you're playing in a group that handles scrakes by throwing an EMP at it and just letting a commando decap it (yes, this works even on 6man HoE)."

killingfloor,38vr2k,itonlygetsworse,13,Sun Jun 7 06:11:13 2015 UTC,"Like KF1, zeds only get weaker if they spawn when there are fewer players alive. So if someone dies while a scrake has already spawned, it's going to have the raised health. It won't scale down because your teammate(s) has died/left. Zeds spawned afterwards have lowered health though."
killingfloor,38vr2k,qqnowqq,3,Sun Jun 7 07:44:53 2015 UTC,"Even zeds spawned during the same wave?  And I'm assuming only if someone leaves, not dies.  So if the wave starts, and someone leaves, then the rest of the zeds that spawn in that wave will have less health than the ones that spawned in the beginning of the wave?"
killingfloor,38vr2k,goldsrcmasterrace,4,Sun Jun 7 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, during the same wave, even for both leaving and dying. The game doesn't care. If a Scrake spawns and kills someone in 6p hp or if someone leaves at that moment, that Scrake will still have 6p hp, but any Scrakes spawned after that absence of a player will have 5p hp.  There's one key difference between players dying and leaving though - faked zeds. What this means is if someone died or hasn't loaded in when the wave starts, you'll get an extra amount of zeds but still with the lower amount of players. Ex: Wave 10 is starting but someone tries to join your 5p game but doesn't load until the wave starts. Now you have your extra 50 or whatever zeds but they all have 5p hp not 6p. The same is true for KF2, and it's a bit more common since the loading screen lasts a lot longer for most people, haha."
killingfloor,38vr2k,qqnowqq,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:44:03 2015 UTC,That's interesting to know.  I could have swore I heard and thought it was always that if a player left during the middle of a match then it screwed the whole team until next wave.  Had no idea that at the very least health was affected even when a player just dies during the middle of the match.  It does explain some things now that I think about it.

killingfloor,38vr2k,MarkWoulfe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:34:24 2015 UTC,"Checkit. Just look at both the zed and difficulty tabs. Code ripped from KF2 and put into a word doc.  It worked more-or-less the same way in KF1 as well. This is something you can easily test in solo too by spawning in zeds to see how easily you can kill them, and then spawning in/removing bots and repeating to see how the health values change."
killingfloor,38vr2k,qqnowqq,2,Mon Jun 8 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"I knew they had less health if they spawned after someone left, but it counts if someone died too? I never knew that, wow. Interesting."
killingfloor,38vr2k,captaincannibal,3,Sun Jun 7 14:39:59 2015 UTC,I've been wondering this too. Does it change depending if players die or just if players leave? So if everyone but me dies will they be as hard as 6man or will they scale down to 1 man difficulty?
killingfloor,38vr2k,JustHarmony,4,Sun Jun 7 13:36:51 2015 UTC,Amount of health for each next spawned ZED will be depending on amount of living players. All ZEDs spawned after none of your teammates alive will be having their health scaled to one person alive - you.

Honestly though, the clot thing adds its own level of annoyance to them as monsters and I view it less as a console hand-holder and more of a new mechanic. Yeah, sure, complain that they pretty much hand you a headshot-- I'm more upset that the bastard is basically forcing me to spend ammo on him instead of dealing with whatever I was lining up my shot with the fraction of a second before he started rubbing our faces together.  I would be happy to see a return of the old chat system as an official mutator. More intuitive for PC controls. By the same token, if TWI wants to co-release on consoles, certain localization changes need to be made."
killingfloor,38whe9,jxfaith,6,Sun Jun 7 12:43:05 2015 UTC,The new clots make the game harder. Instead of being able to drop the scrake that is going to kill me I'm forced to deal with the clot first.
killingfloor,38whe9,1337Bolshevik,0,Sun Jun 7 12:56:00 2015 UTC,Except with the old mechanic you would try to move away from the scrake if your next shot didnt kill him and you suddenly find that you can't.

killingfloor,38whe9,alex70031,0,Sun Jun 7 21:12:11 2015 UTC,If you have nothing else to complain about other than the game being 'consolised' (lol?) then you're the only troll here.   Graphics are good. Really good.  The clot thing spinning me fucks me more than anything. I can't even think of another mechanic you can possibly complain about but I'm sure you can find one. Also they didn't even have a mechanic like this in KF1. Does that make KF1 more console than PC?  Other games considered amazing that are only on the PC use the spinning menu thing because its more visually appealing and easier to use. No one needs 30 different quick chat commands.   I could easily address the rest of your non-sense but I feel as if I give you anymore attention it will only further encourage you.   10/10 shitpost. Try harder.
killingfloor,38whe9,_Jazz_,2,Sun Jun 7 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"He raises some fair points in the OP. I personally do use alot of the commands in KF1 and KF2. Killing Floor 2's commands system is lacking, in the first game I could say very specific things like ""Let's hole up here."" ""Weld the doors."" and ""Follow me."" (Not sure if that last one is in KF2, canmot remember.) The large amount of chat commands was nice and I felt it helped for those of us not wanting or not able to use microphones.  The clot issue is subjective, I find it trivialises the game because it hands you a free headshot, but others could also feel it might steal away a crucial shot from you by spinning you around like that which is a valid point to make.  Lastly, you trying to call the PCMR thing ""bullshit"" is crude at best. The main thing consoles have going for them is exclusives and ease of use, PCs are the superior system most of the time. Stop pretending every game needs to be console-friendly."

I just think the idea that people try to parade around acting superior because they use a PC is pathetic and annoying. Really annoying. It's everywhere and you just can't escape it. The simple idea that whatever system you're using makes you automatically better than someone else is crude. It's even worse than that but I don't feel I can put into words how I feel about it currently. Stop pretending you're superior because you play on a PC. Stop pretending people can't enjoy consoles and PC. Stop pretending that a game being released on console is the end of the world. I could go on, but I think you get the point now."

Then it kind of grew on me. The thing is, if there was a zombie horde following you, with 2 fleshpounds and a few scrakes in the mix, you wouldn't be running professionally. You'd be running for your fucking life with everything you've got, swinging your gun like an idiot in an adrenaline-fuelled attempt to just get away from the horde.

When you see a Fleshpound that is more or less isolated, or you have the firepower to take it down quickly, here's what you do:  Someone, preferably a medic or berserker, runs up to the FP's face and starts tanking it with blocking and parries. A level 20+ medic drops a grenade under the tank's feet and begins spamming darts at him like crazy to keep his armor up. The FP does laughably little damage to the tank if the tank still has any amount of armor. Shoot the FP in the face until it's dead.  Edit: Weapon type does not matter. I was blocking and parrying the FP with the medic's scalpel."

I've got a 650 ti right now and I get crashes when playing this game (and... Rome 2, for whatever reason).  The display drivers stop functioning and then recover, causing the game to crash and the system to actually require a restart before I can launch KF 2 (or, again Rome 2) without the game crashing at startup.

killingfloor,38slgy,AsiaDerp,27,Sat Jun 6 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"In reality rifle calibers will penetrate quite a bit. 7.62x39 (what AK uses) easily goes through a normal car and still has plenty of energy to kill you. 5.56 doesn't penetrate as much, but still can.  Differences between the two rounds is noticeable but for gameplay purposes it doesn't mean much (IE who cares for how heavy or difficult mags are to carry).  SCAR17 uses 7.62x51. That is equivalent of .308 which is more than an assault rifle/carbine round. That's a sniper round. In comparison this gun should do FAR more damage and would certainly get penetration, but again it depends on the load.  In KF1 where sharpshooter used the old winchester, which I'm assuming fired .45 long colt (going from memory here). That is a pistol round, and while it certainly is powerful, it is no where near the energy of 7.62x51. This meant if we follow real world logic the FAL and SCAR in the last game should be AS powerful as M14EBR (or at least close, we can say M14 uses a different load) since they used the same round.  Shotgun penetration makes sense from gameplay standpoint. Now in real world? Not so much. Most people have a shotgun around in their home because there is little chance to hit someone through a wall due to overpenetration, among other things of course. It makes perfect sense why give it to support. Their ammo supply is far less than commando, giving them penetration makes the player use those fewer rounds effectively. While commando has rounds to spare from target to target.  Another thing that is very much disregarded in games from reality is pellet spread. There is absolutely NO WAY the double barrel shotgun will have spread like that. Some pellets actually come damn near 60 degrees off the barrel exit. At close to medium ranges in this game shotgun has a tight spread that is smaller than a person's hand. But for gameplay purposes it would make shotguns less of a crowd clearing and more of just straight line penetration guns.  Commandos are still great for trash clearing. Plenty of ammo to kill 200 some trash without much fuss, and ammo to spare (with one gun).  Ugh, got carried away. Gun nut, signing out."
killingfloor,38slgy,mmSNAKE,3,Sat Jun 6 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yep. If rifles had realistic penetration, or even just 2 penetration (which means it goes through 1 target in the game), it shotguns would start to feel extremely outclassed. And the only class that can use shotgun penetration properly is support.  If shotguns had normal penetration, or the support class did not have up to 500% penetration, then shotguns would be trashy."
killingfloor,38slgy,itonlygetsworse,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:33:21 2015 UTC,Well we could just say that the shotguns in this game are loaded with flechette rounds.
killingfloor,38slgy,SgtTittyfist,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:50:21 2015 UTC,What I mean is why they give AR high damage and shotguns penetration in the first place. Why not they give shotguns a lot more damage and no penetration at all and AR penetration with very little damage?
killingfloor,38slgy,TeaL3af,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:32:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all the weapons have high damage, what sets them apart is their other qualities. Due to their unrealistically wide spread shotguns naturally become a sort of AOE weapon so I guess they just wanted to amplify that."
killingfloor,38slgy,itonlygetsworse,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:42:37 2015 UTC,I guess. But Flechette rounds kill people not zombies and are not strong vs skulls.

killingfloor,38slgy,mmSNAKE,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"We are getting really specific here. .308 is also not a standard assault rifle round. Yes it's full sized more for battle rifles like M14, FAL etc. In terms of it's performance it IS still a sniper round, in comparison to how well it performs with distance. Shooting anything a 1 km away is something I would put into the sniper category. .338 lapua would get into higher caliber end.   Also the AK12 is a 5.45x39 chambering.   It is also chambered in 7.62x39. I was referring to standard most common AK platforms. I mean yeah now 5.45x39 is getting more popular, but that isn't usually what people think when you say AK platform. 7.62x39 is usually what comes to mind."

killingfloor,38slgy,ZeldenGM,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:20:03 2015 UTC,"I really wish they'd reduce the spread from the hunting shotgun and also fix the fact that ammo packs only give you 2 more shells for it (versus say 20 for the AA12 or 30 for a perked SCAR)  ammo packs are so crap for hunting shotguns.  Some more penetration on the commando weapons would be great as well, you should probably be able to go through a couple of smaller zeds rather than getting stuck at one."

killingfloor,38slgy,DPNovitzky,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"Using 00 Buckshot actually has a high chance of overpenetration, as does slugs. #4 buckshot is actually preferable for home defense as it has less energy to penetrate walls but enough energy to eliminate a threat.  I still want a .30-06 M1 Garand in this game. And maybe a Mosin-Nagant as the starting weapon for Sharpies."
killingfloor,38slgy,mmSNAKE,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't have 00 buck in mind. Slugs are overkill.   M1 would actually be really cool to have in this game. Semi automatic, 8 shot high powered .30-06 rounds.   Starting weapon for SS is nearly guaranteed to be a lever action rifle. My choice would be Marlin  336, but they will mostly go with winchester in .45 long colt."
killingfloor,38slgy,ScumSucker-,3,Wed Jun 10 19:59:17 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure realistically the assault rifles would just be better than everything else... But I think balance between the classes is a better objective than realism.

Tempts me to set max corpses to 0 :/"
killingfloor,38slgy,qqnowqq,6,Sun Jun 7 08:20:36 2015 UTC,"Commandos don't deserve penetration. Especially not with their current damage output being so high. It's just not implemented for balancing reasons. KF1 had this sort of problem with the pistol balancing too. Cheap, low weight guns that simply outclassed tons of weapons (and the magnum) with high damage, penetration, magazine size, and reload speed. The difference in difficulty between trying to solo with the pistols vs the lar speaks volumes. Now imagine giving that to a 30 or 45 round assault rifle. There's no reason commandos should get any penetration in KF2 since they kill pretty much anything with a single headshot, and mid zeds in just a few headshots.."

Compare this to a Support's top tier weapon, the AA-12, which can make mincemeat out of a horde with a few shots and still be a beast against single targets."

That's 20-30 trash kills. Depending how good you are.  With proper burst control you can kill husks and sirens in a blink as well. Using tactical reload skill, this gun is monstrous.

killingfloor,38stp8,itonlygetsworse,3,Sat Jun 6 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"Why would you be so certain that the berserker will get a damage increase? It could be increased attack speed, movement speed, stun/flinch power, or something else entirely.   That being said, the shovel is already more than strong enough to kill anything you want. You just need to be aware of what resistances exist. Shovel m2 one hits crawlers on bodyshot for instance (due to their slashing resistance); m1 headshot kills most trash; and 3-4 m1 headshots will kill husks and sirens. Damage is fine atm imo. People just need to realize you're neither invincible nor an m1 doorzerk anymore. You need to pick your spots and earn your increased damage resistance."
killingfloor,38stp8,qqnowqq,2,Sat Jun 6 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Not to try and sound rude, but don't you think it's more reasonable to wait and see what happens to the berserker before we talk about how to adjust everything else?  Honestly speaking all enemies, with the exception of 4, take only a single shot to the head to kill with the normal attack.  There are only 2 enemies in the game that can withstand a pulverizer shot to the head (Scrake and Fleshpound).  I really REALLY am not thinking berserker needs to get a damage buff, and my main is berserker.  We'll just have to wait and see what happens- it's very possible the developers will go with damage reduction from zeds or some skill re-arrangements over damage buff."

killingfloor,38kylr,BistroMathematics,13,Sat Jun 6 10:52:42 2015 UTC,"I've definitely had moments where I overextend or position poorly and get fucked by a crowd of gorefasts and scrakes/FPs, where all the medic darts in the world can't save me.  Idk, if people want to get mad about dying like that, let them; you can't save them from themselves.   Oh, what helps though is using the voice chat to call out incoming scrakes and FPs, and calling out armor drops and injured people, not enough people do that in pubs. As long as the callouts are calm and to the point I find everything goes more smoothly."
killingfloor,38kylr,vodkaholic,12,Thu Jun 4 22:04:16 2015 UTC,"My problem with it is I'll then get trashtalked for the rest of the game. Had some lad today saying he wished votekick was in, while I'm one of the last two alive, keeping a poor old commando from getting mushed by the scrake."
killingfloor,38kylr,Baner87,10,Thu Jun 4 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"I've found (across most games, but especially KF) that trash talk is usually inversely related to skill, aka the more they talk trash the worse they are. Most KF veterans know this is a cooperative game and they should work with their team, but there's always going to be someone new who thinks they know best. I've had to deal with people like this a decent amount as a zerk as well, since I often have to rely on my teammates to cover me and/or work together while I take out scrakes and FP's. I try to offer constructive feedback (""please don't enrage another scrake while I'm still dealing with this one"" or ""buy a medic pistol if you have room before the boss"") and often someone will dismiss it and call me a scrub or whatever. I usually just start playing a little safer and watching out for my own neck and they usually die to their own hurbis. Seems like most of the trash talk dies when you're the only one staying alive or when they have a scrake tearing them a new butthole.  But the best solution is probably to just ignore them and/or find a different game. There's always going to be jackasses online, but luckily, you can be in a new game with better teammates in under a minute, while they're stuck in your old game wondering why they didn't listen and git gud. =P"
killingfloor,38kylr,Baner87,6,Thu Jun 4 23:21:38 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, when the rest of the team has wiped (either due to bad luck, me fucking up a bit, or just bad play) and I'm the only one left to kite 6 scrakes, they tend to leave out of shame because suddenly it's clear that I am good. Meh, I know it shouldn't get to me, but it's really irritating, especially since I play with a few friends so server hopping isn't really an option."
killingfloor,38kylr,mmSNAKE,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you're playing with people, server hopping would be obnoxious, but on the other hand, I'd imagine your friends have you back when the trash talk comes.

killingfloor,38kylr,zeronic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"Depending what round it is, but say you are playing Suicidal or HoE. Wave 8. You are last man standing. If the team doesn't have 3k money each. They might as well leave. Not that it can't be done, but if you all died in the first place, chances are it is a waste of time.One death, or two can be easily recovered. But 5 on late waves on Suicidal and HoE, chances are you are boned."
killingfloor,38kylr,Baner87,5,Fri Jun 5 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"I've found (across most games, but especially KF) that trash talk is usually inversely related to skill,   I'd say this is pretty relevant to pretty much any game with a multiplayer function. Some players just have bad attitudes in general because they're too busy ""being the best"" in their own head or something.  These types of players are physically incapable of learning from their own mistakes because they blame everything but themselves. You can't really learn anything when you're charging headfirst into 2 fleshpounds and 2 scrakes as a commando and then blame the medic for not being able to heal you. They also are physically incapable of learning from others because they're the best, everyone else are obviously scrubs. All advice is disregarded and treated as a personal attack. This type of player is completely hopeless, yet is so endemic in games in general that it pains me to think about it.  If you want the genre where this is the most endemic, I'd probably say go play MOBA's for a week. It really opens your eyes to how bad players stay bad, and mediocre to good players get better when they can identify their mistakes and learn from them."

I imagine people who don't play medics would get bitter over how inattentive most of them are. Not fair for you, but I can see why people assume medics aren't competent.  That being said, if you've been playing together for a few waves they should know if a medic is on the ball or not."

killingfloor,38kylr,SazFiury,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:10:13 2015 UTC,Totally agreed. It seems like there's tons of people who play medic who don't even attempt to heal other people. Why would you choose the class if not to heal? Im confused.
killingfloor,38kylr,mercurial_minnow,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:27:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty new player, only a week or so. I think part of the issue might be the lack of a real tutorial, or at least a more obvious wiki in-game.  i'm lookin to main Medic, but until I started reading this reddit, had no idea there were alternate fire modes for the guns... So got to lvl 5 without firing a single dart, and healing with only the syringe.  With a tutorial, or in game wiki, class knowledge would be more accessible, and hopefully the constraints of classes will be better known"
killingfloor,38kylr,SazFiury,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. I may have come across a little harsh, but I'm generally referring to higher level medics. You can expect low level players to still be learning. I'm talking about level 15+ medics who leave people running around visibly wounded even during a quiet patch.  It might just be my expectations but when I play medic healing people and armouring them is my number one goal. An attentive high level medic can inject 20+ armour every time a crawler taps someone. This keeps people alive and can save a few thousand dosh over the course of a game. Bonus points if you can get your team to trust you enough to jump off ledges for more free armour."
killingfloor,38kylr,NikoRidavitch,2,Fri Jun 5 04:09:13 2015 UTC,"Nope, not harsh, just adding to the discussion. Yes, lvl 15 and beyond I'd imagine players probably should be well versed in the game."

killingfloor,38kylr,KaedeAoi,3,Fri Jun 5 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I've had matches where guys were running off into the map only to get killed by letting themselves be swarmed somewhere on the other side of the map and then going ""I'm dead. Good job, medic."" Seriously, don't run off into nowhere thinking I'll blindly follow you. At least try to stay the fuck together."
killingfloor,38kylr,ipurangi_wahangu,2,Fri Jun 5 08:36:03 2015 UTC,"I main healer in most games and i feel you. In a MMO just earlier today i had a DPS run away to attack a optional boss while the rest of the party attacked the main boss and i got shit for letting him die, when we weren't even close to him.

And there is plenty of that.  Pissing off scrakes, and FPs out of turn, taking too long to kill a siren or a husk around corner. Those things can end the game really damn fast. Good medic or no."

I agree, it's not just your job to keep all five of us alive at once, especially when everyone's spread out across say, that giant red room in Biolab. It's our responsibility to be aware of our surroundings, to at least try to stay alive, and to know when we have your attention before trying something stupid (like soloing a Skrake as a lvl 10 Zerker with only a shovel on Suicidal).

Shooting him with small weapons just makes him mad. Think big, powerful weapons for this one! (not always good) The Scrake. Yes, that is a chainsaw he's carrying. Nothing subtle about him! The Crawler. Interesting attempt to merge human and arachnid genes. Sort-of worked, too - these little nasties have a habit of appearing in all sorts of strange places! etc   Less trivia, more tips for less-than-obvious meta.  I really like the idea of submitting tips to use for the loading screen though, especially ones backed by all difficulties.

Damage is dependendant on current pressure. At full pressure does massive damage but damage quickly falls off with each successive shot until repressurized.

The goal of captive bolt stunning is to inflict a forceful strike on the forehead using a bolt to induce unconsciousness. The bolt may or may not destroy part of the brain.  The bolt consists of a heavy rod made of non-rusting alloys, such as stainless steel. It is held in position inside the barrel of the stunner by means of rubber washers. The bolt is usually not visible in a stunner in good condition. The bolt is actuated by a trigger pull and is propelled forward by compressed air or by the discharge of a blank round ignited by a firing pin. After striking a shallow but forceful blow on the forehead of the animal, spring tension causes the bolt to recoil back into the barrel.

killingfloor,38kwf5,JustHarmony,4,Thu Jun 4 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"Whether or not the mechanic is balanced, this is a really neat idea."
killingfloor,38kwf5,Headsprouter,2,Sat Jun 6 02:38:19 2015 UTC,Firebugs are supposed to counter Sirens. Sirens currently take considerably more damage from fire attacks as it stands now.
killingfloor,38kwf5,jxfaith,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see on the wiki where this is true, rather that they take 2x explosive damage. Do you have a source on that?"
killingfloor,38kwf5,Headsprouter,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:24:05 2015 UTC,You're right. They have a weakness to explosives not fire. Although that is funny since you can't bake grenades so normally you can't get a explosion on them.
killingfloor,38kwf5,OroOro,2,Sat Jun 6 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see that. It wouldn't even be debilitating for the firebug, seeing as they're bound to get a MAC-10 or something to switch off to. Rather than completely cancel out the fire and putting out nearby zeds, though, I'd like to see the scream create a shield around the siren and zeds caught within it for its duration that simply prevents the fire from moving past it."
killingfloor,38kwf5,theholybope,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:50:52 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but the classic MAC-10 used incendiary bullets and lit zeds on fire for much of its sustained damage. I suppose if it were intended to have some zeds that countered burning damage, shuffling its functionality towards providing non-burn damage could be done.   The proposed change does move towards parity with the Demo, but is that really necessary? The pyro isn't designed for wiping out clusters of high priority targets, it mops up the trash (arguably, everything siren and down) with efficiency and lets the supports, marksmen, demos deal with the high health zeds. Adding a pyro counter to sirens just makes the perk rely on outside help or specialized weaponry to get his job done."
killingfloor,38kwf5,GDubZzZ,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"I dunno, when I played firebug I used the MAC and the Husk Gun, the latter of which could kill...pretty much anything. Or at least provide a big help (and a lot of bothersome noise). Firebug to me was jack of all trades, master of none. Hence the inclusion of support, demolitions, commando and sharpshooter type weapons that all exchanged a bit of ease of use for some damage over time.  The classic MAC could still kill the Husk in a pinch thanks to still having some basic bullet damage to go along with the fire. Spitting a bullet or two at a clot to let it burn was good, but when you really needed it, you still had an SMG."
killingfloor,38kwf5,GDubZzZ,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"Well it's less Bass and more of an obnoxious high pitched wail, opera singers can't put out fire.  That said, It would be cool if you had a flamethrower and the sirens scream acted as a barrier from your flames."
killingfloor,38l1qx,gguuiypoq,12,Thu Jun 4 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you could just put it down to ""they were going for a funny concept for the character in KF1, but with KF2's more serious tone they felt it would be out of place so they changed it to something similar, but more believable"".

Also, wasn't Foster in this game changed a bit to be more successful, while in KF1 his career was more of a joke?  Edit: Yeah, he used to be Hayako, which I imagined they changed because Hayako was more of a feminine name.   It's possible they wanted to give him more of a fleshed out backstory.

When    Horzine agreed  to  take    corporate   responsibility, they    started recruiting  survivors   to  fight   the Zed menace. Recruiting  was actually obvious. Someone who had somehow survived the onslaught had to have something going for them. And if they were willing to do it    again   (even   if  just    for the money)  they    had “the  right   stuff”.   They’ve   already had the on-the-job  training,   so  just    equip   them    and send    them    in. They    kill    Zeds,   Horzine pays    them    a   bounty, let them    spend   it  on  bigger  weapons from    the Horzine Trader. Everyone    wins.   Except  the dead. But they don’t complain."

killingfloor,38lssb,boksuwww,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:24:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I saw quite a few map packs on steam going for 5GBP, i dont think me and my friends are actually interested in the characters and weapons pack. What we will be concern of is the number of maps that we can play on. In short, we would save money if I simply purchased the map pack and then share it to my friends via download in game."
killingfloor,38lssb,goldsrcmasterrace,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:51:32 2015 UTC,"Like he said, there are no map packs for sale.  All maps for the game are free.  The DLCs are only character skins, weapon skins, and some new not-so-great weapons to have some fun with.  But maps are NOT sold."
killingfloor,38lssb,Sharkdude300,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course. Multiplayer is arguably the main part of Killing Floor . I'm not sure what you mean here, there are no extra map packs. There's the stock maps then custom, player-made maps that are downloaded by joining a server running them . Difficulty has no effect on the # of waves, there are three game lengths. Short (4 waves with 5th for boss), medium (7 with 8th for boss) and long (10 with 11th for boss). I recommend just playing for fun. If you grind perk's you'll quickly get burnt out. Killing Floor 2 is a different game, much more serious and faster paced. It's fun but has far less content currently."
killingfloor,38lssb,hairy_tentacle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:40:54 2015 UTC,"yes, hit browse online games in main menu yup, I already downloaded some custom maps after connecting to a server, went all fine answers everywhere yes. But dont bother with these, one wipe will be when game is released, perhaps others too. So just enjoy the show for now KF2 is not released yet, only KF1 is. You don't need both, KF1 is old and I have no clue about player population. Lore-wise it's not needed, neither for content."
killingfloor,38lssb,hairy_tentacle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:33:01 2015 UTC,"above answers go for KF2 ofcourse, are you completely asking in regard of KF1?"
killingfloor,38lssb,OroOro,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:10:26 2015 UTC,"You might as well get Killing Floor 2 if you have the money.   Yes, Click Multiplayer > Internet Games > Refresh. (You can also change the game mode, KFO (Objective) Or Survival If you're hosting a server, they should all be able to use the map. The waves vary with difficulty and increase in total every round There are some maps which make grinding easier, firebug for example does well on farm, with lots of space to kite zeds while burning them to death.  But ideally you can do what you want on any of the maps with your perk of choice as long as you meet the requirements. Might as well"
killingfloor,38godr,McStabYou,16,Thu Jun 4 02:16:17 2015 UTC,this is probably just a bug but still its a good tip: you can drop any tier one spawning weapon and it will sell for 150 instead of 100 this is pretty helpful for suicidal and hoe since money is in short supply
killingfloor,38godr,dickleslipper,10,Thu Jun 4 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"enraged fleshpounds lose their ability climb (i.e. stand on a car on burning paris and it can't touch you). A medic told me this after she did it to avoid a fp.   if you weld doors, enraged scakes will try to run around them instead of pound them down, which they will do if they are not enraged  if you're being chased, you can close the doors behind you to stall the zeds for the extra 1/4 second, which actually does help.  for scrakes, after you dodge their first swing you can just stay behind their backs almost indefinitely and shoot them continuously unless there are other zeds or walls.  when hans throws smoke grenades, do not shoot him at all, as it is a waste of ammo, and simply let him heal off of you.   if this is in*accurate let me know"

killingfloor,38godr,hairy_tentacle,3,Thu Jun 4 20:35:32 2015 UTC,"don't buy armor in first rounds  stick to melee / starter weapons in first rounds  in team, share money if you're set  don't split, don't panic, stay in sight of your team  headshots >>> bodyshots  tag all zombies, even 1 hit grants you full XP and some Do$h  COMMUNICATE"
killingfloor,38godr,mackbrinkman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:34:25 2015 UTC,"This. Almost all losses I've had are from people not sticking to the area. Find a good spot, agree on it, and get your ass back there by the beginning of every wave."
killingfloor,38godr,OroOro,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:05:55 2015 UTC,Headshots and communication are part of the basic tips already.  Sharing money is a good one though.  Too often I see players with their endgame weapons and 5K worth of dosh.  Honestly that money serves no purpose if it's not being spent.

killingfloor,38godr,GhostOfMuttonPast,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:17:57 2015 UTC,"Might be fixed, but Scrake strafing is easy stuff. Run to the right, a non-raged Scrake will always swing to the left, so you dodge it by going right. Then run up to him, right behind his back. Stack behind its back, go around counter-clockwise. You can either hit him in between the pauses when he turns or have teammates just mow him down safely.   Make sure to include the perk or skill configurations, which ones are useful. Also other tips like for support specialist, getting tenacity the first few rounds and then switching to the extra weight perk later in the game when you have money to buy that many guns is a good strategy. You might also want to include a ""bug"" section as there are things like having 150 HP as another class with extra weight by starting the game as Support Specialist and then switching, etc."
killingfloor,38godr,tomr4lph,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:57:19 2015 UTC,"Depending on the difficulty, in later rounds buy armor before secondary ammo. If you don't have enough dosh to cover it all, get ammo for your primary instead."
killingfloor,38godr,Nabrubas,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:35:41 2015 UTC,Shotgun jumping with the double barrel can prove extremely useful in certain situations when surrounded.

In the earlier rounds, even as a support, if you want to make more money, it may be worth your while to buy a medic pistol early since it can 1-shot headshot weaker zeds."

And my kiting route only get me to last wave like ..... 10 times....I have get to last wave with less than 20 zeds a few times, but all of them resulted in a fail...   I start in the piano room, go out to the demon statue area (but not actually go down to the statue), go up stairs into the house, go straight down the stairs back to the spawning, go up to the big windows that you can jump down, and back to the piano room by jumping out of window or go to the right room. But shit always happens that you may end up  in other rooms...   My route ""kind of worked"" but not that good, so I didnt bother to upload them. This map is way too bad for solo unless you have perfect aim and dont need to kite, or you cheese it like I did."
