It's terrible practice to give your credit card information out over the phone to begin with.. Unfortunately, it's effective so it'll continue to happen. Most people have never heard of the scam and have no reason to question the fliers, so they'll continue to get scammed.."
orlando,3e0m47,Taylor_Reddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:52 2015 UTC,"A scam as old as credit cards.   For real. This has been going on since I can remember. My dad taught me about this scam in the 90's. It's pretty prevalent at the hotels downtown Orlando as well. A lot of the hotels even have notices on the doors to the effect of ""Do Not Order Food From Fliers Placed Under Your Door - We Do Not Endorse These Businesses""."

orlando,3e0m47,KnightsFan,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, actually. All of their money makes it harder for everyone who actually lives here to afford things. Sure if the tourism industry dried up to pre-Disney levels it'd be hard on a lot of folks and people would have to leave, but it'd be better in the long run. Central Florida's economy is screwed all to hell by outside money coming in and determining prices."
orlando,3e0m47,Taylor_Reddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that's a problem unique to Central Florida. Inflated prices are common and usually a fact people accept when they make the choice to move to big cities.
orlando,3e0m47,KnightsFan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"Except in most cities the inflated prices are due to demand. There just isn't enough of it. Here we have plenty of housing, but the prices are higher than the market can really support. Why else was the region so hard hit by the housing crisis of the last decade? People were paying more than they could really afford, because somebody decided that's how much houses should go for, because a rich retiree or transplant was willing to pay that much.  Also Central Florida isn't comparable to a big city. It's a region that should show a larger diversity in income levels and housing."
orlando,3e0m47,Hawaiiansdoitbetter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah let's just take away 150k theme park jobs in the CenFl area.

Another option you can try is the ride sharing option through super shuttle. It's reliable and it might just come out to be $40 for the two of you

With that said, you can go to Brooks Bothers and get a $2500 suit, or jcrew and get a $500 suit, or one of these ""suit stores"" and get you a $100 suit.  Unless you need it urgently, I suggest you shop around the mid-level ($400-$700 range) before you settle on a cheap $100 suit just so you can gauge the quality difference and make the determination of whether or not the extra money is worth it."

Pick up name brand never tailored suits for pennies on the dollar (like 1/10 or better).  Then take it to a tailor to have it properly sized.  May take a few trips and/or some time but if you have the time/patience it really is a good deal.  New... more so than for about any other product, you get what you pay for.  If it is inexpensive, there's a reason for it being cheap.  Men's Warehouse has about every level but they produce in bulk and IMO the suits are not great quality (for daily ware anyway) but it is one stop shop."

Also, 'new?' specials include basic (27 channel) cable and Lightning 35 for $74, so it's basically a year of free basic cable.

Their base prices are a bit lower then what Brighthouse charges.   I currently have 15/1 for 34.25 a month after taxes and fees for six month after which the rate goes to around $45.

I hope someone from Orlando will verify or dispute this, but I've never heard of any kind of rent control in Orlando, meaning rent in Orlando can go an unlimited percent of one's monthly income. So, if one rents one year at 30% of one's income, the following year the landlord could raise the rent such that it's now 50% of one's income. Repeat until literally impossible to afford the rent.   Now, this may or may not happen. Welcome to wild west, free market, capitalism in Florida.  Obviously most landlords won't rent to you if they don't think you can afford to pay them. And has been said, 30% is a good cap to shoot for, but if you start there and fail to get raises matching rent increases... You may want to try to start at some lower percentage to leave yourself a buffer and not initially max out your rent budget."

orlando,3dsrpc,jeremy_5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:29:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're wrong about that, but I ask, how does that change anything? If anything, that makes me more sympathetic to them. Addiction is a disease (and don't let this become a battle for semantics -- substance abuse is something epidemiologists track in public health studies right along with viruses and cancer, so it's not really worth dancing around). Moreover, studies seem to suggest that addiction is often genetic, or at least there are genes that make people more susceptible. So it's easy to pass judgment over someone when you are literally built to counter what they feel more easily.  If substance abuse caused their life to become derailed, it's tragic, and I'm hopeful for them to get their life back together. It's not an easy road though, like a switch you can just flip and be like ""I'm just going to stop doing this thing."" If life was that easy, I wouldn't still be trying to get over my ex-girlfriend from a year ago. Sometimes the toughest battles in life are the ones against ourselves, and on that front, I empathize."

And as far as I understand it, even for absinthe that contains thujone (the psychoactive byproduct of wormwood), the levels of thujone are so low that you wouldn't experience any hallucinations from moderate drinking. To get to that level, you'd have to drink enough absinthe that you would likely get alcohol poisoning first."

orlando,3druai,sendeth,2,Sun Jul 19 14:50:16 2015 UTC,You should do some reading on the subject. A few years ago some guys in a group led a charge to get the laws changed. In the process they found that the testing method for absenthe was so poor that none of the absenthe banned were tested properly at all. As it turned out all of the absenthe banned we're actually perfectly legal under the law. Even most European absenthes are well within the tolerances that the United States allows. Absinthe causing hallucinations was just fear mongering to try to get absinthe banned just like if you smoke weed you do Reefer Madness stuff. You can now buy lucid absinthe at ABC and you can buy it online and have it shipped over and it is perfectly legal. No absenthe is going to make you hallucinate because absenthe does not do that.

Victoria place near Waterford (this was like four years ago)  2/2 was $1100. It was nice but get a bit hectic to drive around the holidays. Black Friday was a nightmare one year and people were parking in our complex and walking to the shopping center because the parking lot was so crazy.   Legend at winter springs (434  and 417) away from the cogestion and close enough for my husband to commute to ucf. It was (just moved out for a house last month)  2/2  was $1055. It was very nice day, helpful staff and maintenance was done withing 24 hours. There is a publix shopping center very close (Tuskawilla and 434). I suggest this one if you're looking for something quite, no students and close to the highway."

It's a quiet neighborhood with 2 great pools, lots of greenery, and plenty of parking. Only a few students live here, so it's mainly small families or young professionals working at UCF, Lockheed Martin, or the nearby area. My roommate is a student at UCF and he doesn't mind the commute. Let me know if you have any questions! Good luck... apartment hunting is the worst."

The amenities aren't the greatest and it's not the newest place, but maintenance is on point and the people at the office are usually really helpful. Easy access to University and not hard to get anywhere else around town. ...worst part about it, really, was that the units don't have washers and dryers, or even hookups. If you're okay with living in the 20th century and using the common laundry facilities (which are kept in pretty good order), then it's a nice place to live."

Here, you'll find homes, bars and restaurants with lots of character. Prices are relatively low (compared to downtown, Winter Park, etc.), so the area does attract young professionals and students.  Some good spots to check out:    Sportstown Billiards Hideaway Bar Redlight, Redlight East End Market Stardust Coffee & Video Wally's  Milk Bar   Lots of other great spots, but it's a start. Only big concern I'd have is the commute to UCF.  If you end up in Winter Park, check out Spatz. It's a bar/pool hall. Pretty fun spot."

I'm guessing you're talking about the Winter Park near 436 / university blvd which is not the nicer part of winter park. Probably the most hipster places to live right now in Orlando are Mills Park, Audubon Park (although it's more for hipster families), and colonial town. Places to check out: Milk District, stardust, redlight redlight, matador, courtesy, I-bar and Body Talk for dancing, Lil Indies, Will's pub, propagation., Downtown Credo. The most hip place to eat lunch right now if you're a hip hipster is at East End Market."
orlando,3dnf6s,2stroker,2,Sat Jul 18 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"This thread is obviously full of people that don't actually visit these places, they just read about them on reddit.  Having spent my time in Gainesville, there's something I have to let you know:  There is no Orlando equivalent to anything you're accustomed to.  Gainesville is a very popular city based around UF and it's students.  Everything you see, do, eat, drink, party is centered around the college.  From freshmen to professors.  The Haile area was my hangout.  Those were probably some of the best years of my life as far as being social in a particular city.  So, what is Orlando and how does UCF fit in?  Archer Rd from the ABC liquor to 75 is the equivalent to what UCF area has.  That's it.  Chain restaurants and freshmen bars.  I mean that's all there is.  If you want to do something else you must drive 30 minutes to the downtown Orlando area.  Winter Park?  That's where I live.  Not hipster even 1%.  It's upper middle class/high class living with a very yuppy atmosphere.  Equivalent to the Haile Plantation area.  The only ""hipster"" place to speak of is the Geek Easy https://www.facebook.com/thegeekeasy  Colonialtown/Milk District:  Now, here's where you're going to find places that you are looking for.  It's the hipster area of Orlando.  I won't bother naming any places someone already has in another post.  You MUST get drunk at Wally's at least once.  The best food in Orlando is around here.  I'm not talking about 5 star dining, I'm talking about the most interesting, flavorful, unique restaurants you'll find this side of Miami.  Downtown club district?  I don't know much about this area anymore it's been years since I would club hop.  I'm in my 30's now and not really interested in waiting 30 minutes for an overpriced sub-par drink in an atmosphere were I can't even hear myself think.  If you must?  I-bar.  I've been going there when I get in the mood to dance for the last 10 years.  Okay, so are you ready to know where to find the most hipster place in the Orlando area?  Historic Sanford.  Hands down winner by MILES and has been for the last 10+ years.  The Colonialtown/Milk District area is equal to just one block of what this area has to offer for all your hipster needs.  Best part?  It's on the St Johns River and if you ever become a boat owner, you can roll in and tie off to the city dock.  There's also beautiful walkways and parks on the water to watch the sunset.  I used to live about 5 miles away from there, and I'm seriously considering moving out of the Winter Park area and back to Sanford.  I miss it."

I used Tara Libby. http://taralibbyphotography.com  Her natural light pictures are phenomenal and she is a GREAT price. Very sweet girl too. I paid 1400 for the 6 hour coverage. I did not use the included engagement session though, so she did knock off a few hundred from the price for that.   I used Arthurs Catering but only because my venue required them as the caterers. They were very expensive and although the food was good, it wasnt mindblowingly awesome like I thought it should have been."

orlando,3dk3z4,Rambo-Brite,2,Fri Jul 17 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"We used John Michael and the food was amazing. They offered tastings every 3 months, at Leu Gardens, since some of the options are seasonal. They also have all of their partner vendors there if you are looking for anything else.   If you book them as your caterer you can do an upgrade package to get a credit with a florist, cake, dj and photographer. Our florist was Lee and we loved the flowers. The cake was done by a small baker in longwood (cakes by design, I think) and it was amazing. The photographer we weren't super happy with but the pics came out good we just expected more after having meetings and an engagement photo shoot done prior.   Do you have a venue picked out yet? From what we discovered most venues require you use one of their preferred vendors (mostly for insurance reasons) so you're limited to 4-5 in the area."
orlando,3dk3z4,9mmKurtz,2,Fri Jul 17 03:29:34 2015 UTC,Planning what sounds like the same wedding right now. We are using Lee Florist and he can really come up with anything to fit your budget but id expect about two grand. Our photographer is Chris Glenn. Catering is levans and that's the only one that let us taste the food before booking. He's been around forever and the food was great. He's been fantastic to work with.
orlando,3dk3z4,mcn11,2,Fri Jul 17 04:23:35 2015 UTC,"We used Millenia Catering for ours back in May and they were great. People kept telling us how good the food was, even after the wedding. They asked us to pick potentials off their menu and prepared them for a private tasting. The staff was aces. I'm not sure what it cost us exactly, since our venue price included catering for up to 60 people (we ended up with around 120).   I would strongly advise against John Michael. They hold a giant event a handful of times every year (maybe it's quarterly?) and while there is an incredible amount of food there, it was sad that the best thing we ate was the cake and ice cream from Publix. We ended up tossing most of our stuff after a bite or two.  We used Kellie LeFever as our photographer: http://www.lefeverphoto.net/  Not sure about the florist."

It came in a huge duffle bag vacuum sealed and rolled up, once you open it you have to wait a couple days to use it.    If you have an existing bed frame you can either use your old box springs, have slats cut or shop around for a cheap box spring or platform bed.

Consumer reports ""Best Mattress"" guide for 2015.  If you hit the paywall, you can always just go to your local library for ~10-15m.

So people can't handle that amount of energy and the attention it requires and get rid of them.

orlando,3d96jv,vorpib,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:10 2015 UTC,Agreed. There are 3 different ginger beers at that Publix. Two of them are in the hispanic food section of the ethnic food aisle. The other one will be on the shelf behind you if you are facing the Goya brand.
orlando,3d96jv,synmo,2,Wed Jul 15 14:38:55 2015 UTC,The Jamaican one in the 2 liter bottle is not bad either and the English one in the red can as well. They both lack the bite for me though.  You can also find small bottles in the soda section from time to time but they are over priced.

I park get out of my car and step right in the middle of a 50 year old man verbally assaulting a 9 month pregnant woman and her 16 month old daughter. I immediately go over to calm the woman down and make sure the guy didn't physically come after her and calm the little baby down. She is holding her stomach and then the guy starts verbally assaulting me. Well anyone who knows me knows I didn't just stand there and take it! The jerk proceeds into Publix and is three guesses at the deli where my chicken is. Before I know it her husband shows up and all hell breaks loose. Deli counters are moving, glasses flying and curse words worse than a sailor were flying. Police are called, people standing around video taping the fight.

orlando,3d96jv,tastychomps,5,Wed Jul 15 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"After she was finished loading the child into the vehicle, she left her cart in the middle of the parking space. Colon asked if the pregnant female would move the cart out of the way so that he could pull his vehicle into the parking spot. The pregnant female then grabbed the cart and shook it and said to Colon ""what do you want me to do with it?"" The pregnant female then began cursing at Colon who then cursed back at her.    If I understand correctly, we only have Colon's side of the argument. If he's being 100% truthful in his account of the events, I gotta say I side with him.   How self-centered/selfish do you have to be to leave a cart in the middle of a parking space, even after someone asks you to move it so they can park there?"
orlando,3d96jv,marGEEKa,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:55 2015 UTC,"My parents live in Baldwin and the story from their neighbors is that she was still loading the groceries and the baby into the car and had the cart pulled up next to the car in the space next to it while loading. The dude showed up and instead of asking started pulling into the spot and honking at her to get her to move the cart. Being 9 months pregnant with a 2 year old in tow tends to make people slow so I guess she just wasn't moving fast enough for this dude. They exchanged words, he was screaming at her that he was going to go complain to a manager and so I guess he found parking elsewhere and went in to do that. She called her husband who showed up and the rest can be seen on video."

I park get out of my car and step right in the middle of a 50 year old man verbally assaulting a 9 month pregnant woman and her 16 month old daughter. I immediately go over to calm the woman down and make sure the guy didn't physically come after her and calm the little baby down. She is holding her stomach and then the guy starts verbally assaulting me. Well anyone who knows me knows I didn't just stand there and take it! The jerk proceeds into Publix and is three guesses at the deli where my chicken is. Before I know it her husband shows up and all hell breaks loose. Deli counters are moving, glasses flying and curse words worse than a sailor were flying. Police are called, people standing around video taping the fight. All the men are just standing around looking while I am screaming for someone to break it up! So police don't show and I leave my name with the manager.   Colon sounds like a massive asshole."

orlando,3d96jv,Colinhurley,4,Tue Jul 14 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a delicate situation. My sister works at Publix (for 3 years now) and they have all sorts of rules about confronting people in the store. Employees are not allowed to stop someone from stealing. If they have a security guard, that person can stop someone from leaving the store but once that person gets outside of the store, they cannot chase them down. It's all liability and insurance crap, which I understand. I can picture a scumbag getting tackled while stealing a bottle of wine, breaking their ankle, and they turn around and sue Publix. Luckily for this kid, he barely had to touch them to break it up. He just got in between them."
orlando,3d96jv,c6k,4,Tue Jul 14 18:09:19 2015 UTC,i used to work at this exact publix. they had me bagging groceries and dangled stocking shelves as some huge incentive. i asked to be register trained and was told i wasn't competent enough  jokes on them i quit bagging groceries once i got a job writing software for attack helicopters

orlando,3dbku9,DabbleOrlando,7,Wed Jul 15 00:21:04 2015 UTC,Legitimate question:  Do you have a customer/marketing base that's greater than what I would achieve making my own YouTube videos and then promoting my own website or posting here on Reddit or Craigslist?  I'm trying to see a reason as to why I would use Dabble.
orlando,3dbku9,happyfeet407,7,Wed Jul 15 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"Great question.  First - the goal of Dabble, and the whole reason I wanted to be involved, was for the in-person aspect of the classes.  I personally am on my computer all day for work and while I love YT tutorials, I just want to get out and do something hands-on with like-minded people... at least once in awhile!  Enter: Dabble.     Dabble's main social media outlets (Twitter: 4.6 k followers, FB: 10k followers, Instagram: 830 followers) would be used to promote as well as their weekly newsletter.  They utilize SEO as well - their website should be third down with a simple search of the word ""Dabble"" and they would provide Facebook/Google Ads targeted locally. We'd build out Orlando-specific social media outlets to promote classes too.     Note that this is still in the early stages for launching in Orlando - the first step is finding awesome people who are interested in teaching.  Dabble lets the teacher do the teaching, but they handle the logistics/systems portion of classes: class reminders, assisting with venue if needed, class sign-ups, etc.     Ideally, the Dabble Orlando site would turn into a main platform to use when looking to take a new class/try something new rather than having to search here, there and everywhere.  Don't get me wrong - I love craigslist and especially reddit, but I see Dabble and those sites as apples and oranges.  You can still use craigslist/reddit to promote your class, but again Dabble would turn into the ""main hub"" for people to find in-person, one-time classes.     Let me know if I can further clarify!"
orlando,3dbku9,Bvitamins1,3,Wed Jul 15 02:02:26 2015 UTC,Honestly in person classes are much more effective than online classes for some people. They provide back and forth dialogue between the teacher and student as well as structure. Best of luck to you and Dabble

Unfortunately that put him in front of an occupied vehicle that decided to run him down, and he didn't have time to correct it.   I have nothing but contempt for monday morning quaterbacks, especially those who have never been in, and will never put themselves in the situations they're judging."

They are trained to stay gun drawn by the drivers side door.  This is not opinion - this is fact straight from the horses mouth & this video will most likely be used as a textbook example of how not to react for future law enforcement officers according to my family.  The only MMQB here is you hippy.
orlando,3d9nc8,orangecountyff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:47:56 2015 UTC,So you don't know anything because you are not a cop. Also are any of them officers for orlando? Because each department has their own set of protocols so unless your family works with opd they don't know opd's protocols. But thanks for playing hippy.
orlando,3d9nc8,I_HAVE_POON_WORMZ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:01 2015 UTC,Yep one was OPD in the last 5 years before joining the DEA.  Youre not a cop either.  5/5 that i know say he fucked up & broke protocol.  I trust them more than some random internet hippy.
orlando,3d9nc8,orangecountyff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:18:14 2015 UTC,He didn't jump in front of the car to stop it he jumped out to follow one of the guys who jumped out of the passenger side. He actually didn't break protocol that I saw stated in any report but I'm sure you can make something up. Secondly if an officer is injured trying to keep my community safe and protect my kids I am more than happy to be one of the citizens hpwho's taxes are paying his hospital bills. But no you are right all cops are worse than criminals and ruin society and waste our money man life would be soooooo much better without them.

orlando,3d9nc8,comm_pope,3,Thu Jul 16 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation. Most reasonable people would not attempt to run over a cop, no matter how much we dislike cops, because we don't want to go to jail for several years to life."
orlando,3d9nc8,Nosra420,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:58:28 2015 UTC,If i thought I would die then i would gladly run anybody over to live...pointing a gun at somebody has the tendency to make them think their life is in danger.

If the cop has a legitimate reason for pulling a gun on you and you try to run him over rather than comply, then frankly, I hope he gets you before you get him.  And for the record, I generally don't like cops and do think there are too many bad ones. But a cop pulling his gun is legal and understandable in this specific situation; attempted murder is not."

He's white has a terrible looking Goatee and is typical meth monster 25 going on 50 years old.  His partner was equally scummy looking but had shorter hair no beard and some prison tats. I remember because one I love bicycles and 2 the guy said he was from Sanford and his friends left him in the neighborhood and he just needed money for the bus. I threw his bike in my truck and said great I live in Sanford just hop in the back of my truck and I'll take you there now. His buddy rode up on the dump bike and asked me to give his friend's bike back.   Of note I live close and someone broke my fence gate and also broke into my neighbors house yesterday.

orlando,3d7iim,IswagIcook,2,Tue Jul 14 03:06:27 2015 UTC,solara is a new hip complex reminds me of a downtown complex ...Notting hill has some nice units...there is also steelhouse but it is right next to lake Mary PD..   Solara is actually in Sanford but it is really more like lake Mary as it is right on the border.  Probably the most bang for your buck.

orlando,3d7iim,flyntdj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:31:04 2015 UTC,I live there.  I have a 2b/2b and pay $1200.  It's all 1 and 2 bdrm places so most of the people are younger and not a lot of families.  I think you can get a 1 bdrm place for around $1000.  It's very important to ask them about their specials if you're looking.  The pool and gym are both crazy nice.  The electric bill is super low since it's a new building and all energy efficient.  I had the same size place at Notting Hill and my bill was $200 in the summer.  It's now only $60.  Also they are wired for uverse (and brighthouse).  My bill went from $210 with Brighthouse to $120 with uverse.  The staff are really nice and everyone that I meet there seems really cool.

($5000 over book value) I had run it through a few online appraisers such as Edmunds.com and KBB. Both said it was worth around 7-8k. Looked at a Kia Forte Five Door and it was priced at 27k. I started looking at the sticker... it was loaded but there was a $5000 fee added into the car.   I did the math. Yes their $5000 over book value got me curious but I was skeptical- it seemed to good to be true.  They were hoping people would take the added trade in value then finance the sticker price. Then they'd not only get their $5000 back on the sale of the car they'd make added money on the interest.   I really liked the Forte hatch. Had they actually offered me 7,0000 for my car and sold me the hatch for 21-22k I might have actually bought it but the fact that they were trying to trick people like that with the added trade value and hidden upcharge in the sticker price- bothered me to the point I just walked.   Two years later I traded the Camry for a used 2008 Toyota Prius. The car is the right size or me and it was half the cost of the Forte five door. Fuck Kia's Orlando dealerships."

orlando,3d2x4q,lucylulemon,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:34 2015 UTC,Is Sushi Lola's good again? That was my favorite place when they were in the old location. But all of my Sushi Lola's-loving friends told me that things went downhill in the new location. I'm kind of afraid to go back.  Sushi Pop definitely deserves the #1 spot. Love that place.
orlando,3d2x4q,justinrcole,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:34:44 2015 UTC,"Sushi Lola's used to be a weekly lunch trip for me. When they moved prices went up, service went down.

orlando,3d2x4q,LarryGergich,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:09 2015 UTC,Lola's has definitely gotten bad and not gotten better. I’ve had really slow service several times.
orlando,3d2x4q,herephishiphishi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:20:46 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand how it always manages to end up on ""best sushi"" lists.  I have been to Sushi Lola's several times, both in their old space and in their new, updated space, and I have never been satisfied with any of my visits.  It was recommended to me originally by several different people who live in that area, but it's only redeeming quality is that it is close to where they live if they don't want to venture out.  My latest experience will definitely be my last.  Their new space is bigger, and the decor has been updated nicely, but the chandelier that they have by the door does not match anything else; it is too bright if you are seated facing it, and the shadows that it casts make the walls and blinds look dirty.  Also with the new decor did not come new dishes, which is fine, but if you seat me at a nice table in a nice chair with a cloth napkin, don't serve my drinks to me in a clear plastic tumbler with green and purple dots on it from Target.  The tables are also just as close together now in their bigger space as they were before in the old, smaller space.  While we were seated promptly and given menus, the server took about 5 minutes to bring us drinks, and he did not ask us what we wanted before or after he brought them, only brought us water.  When we were finally able to order, the food was brought out faster than it has been in the past, but it was very disappointing.  I ordered a tempura roll that was rolled so loosely, it just fell apart when I tried to pick a piece of it up.  My other roll was an avocado roll, and the avocado was so ripe that it was just mush, and whoever cut the roll did not wash their knife between cuts, so the roll was covered in smeared avocado where it was cut, it was not pretty.  We also ordered a beef teriyaki bento box; the beef was bland, and while it had a good sauce to dip it in, there wasn't enough of the sauce for all of the beef.  The sides were decent, but they were your standard deep-fried fare (tempura vegetables, spring roll, white rice).  Overall with the experiences that I have had I can't say that there is any reason for me to return to Sushi Lola's, and I don't understand why people continue to list this on their top sushi spots in Orlando."
orlando,3d2x4q,xhopesfall24,2,Fri Jul 17 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"I used to go to Sushi House, frequently. I, typically, use it as my scale if sushi is good or not. Hadn't been in quite some time and found they moved. It was still good, but didn't seem to be as good. New place isn't as nice as the old. I liked the sushi cam (maybe they re-added it, recently) the old place had. I also liked the dark and relaxing atmosphere, miss that.   Someone mentioned Hana, but I didn't find it to be all that great, maybe lunch isn't as good as dinner. I'll go again with the gf on the weekend and give it another shot. A lot of people I work with go there on lunch.  Went to Mikado in Lake Mary on Sunday, it's pretty good (been there before). Lots of cute waitresses, too!  Shin is really, really good! They have this steak roll (I don't usually like sushi unless it's seafood), and it is amazing. Can't remember what it's call. Also some spicy oysters. I usually like friends order at places I've never been, fun way to find new stuff (reason I don't know the names to this stuff).   Gonna try Sushi Pop, too."

I think the original comment was very clear about the fact i had no intentions of purchasing solar panels.  You chose to speak with me about them & i shared my opinion.  So why do you care so much if i do or do not purchase solar panels?  What did you hope would come of our interaction with one another.  There are quite a few other people you couldve engaged in this thread that agree w/ you... But you CHOSE to engage me in some sort of liberal dialogue knowing i had no intentions of purchasing solar panels.  What did you hope to accomplish by trying to engage me in conversation?  I think the only dummy here would be the one trying to start a conversation w/ someone that clearly didnt agree with them... But i'm not gonna be a child & start calling you names.

Apartments also give rent discounts to employees. And/Or.....  This may not be what you want to hear but it's the best thing anyone can suggest. Start on an AS at Valencia or seminole in information technology. It will be hell if you go to school and work at the same time but you can finish in a year and a half.

I've been to conveyor sushi places where the lowest plate was $1.25, and they were making a killing. Their rolls were on par with the fanciest sushi places, too!  Koy Wan in Altamonte is a chinese buffet place, but they have a large selection of good sushi. Crazy China Buffet does as well, but I'd rate them second to KW."

orlando,3cwxvd,devoidz,3,Sat Jul 11 16:53:15 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you are staying will make things easier. If your staying near the I-drive area that is where all the tourists go. We just completed building the Orlando eye. Only a few meters shorter than the eye in London. Might be something worth checking out.   If your a fan of quality craft beer and since you will be here on the 30th, Orlando brewing (our local brewery) is one of less than 10 organic breweries in the US. They hold an event on the 30th of every month called brew 30 where they reduce the price of every pint by $2. Usually gets pretty packed so I'd recommend getting there a little early.   Winter park isnt far from the downtown area. They have a road called park ave which is nice place for a stroll and grab a bite to eat.   Walking around lake eola on a Sunday morning there is a farmers market that you can go and enjoy fresh local produce and other crafts while enjoying the lake view.   As someone else said. Kennedy space center is a blast. (Heh... Punintended) but they have some cool stuff there. Haven't been in 15 or so years but they have a space walk simulator last time I was there.   If I think of more I'll add more to this post.  Edit: Not sure if your about the night life, but here in Orlando there is a decent scene. Any night really but if your trying to go party, Friday and Saturday nights off orange ave no earlier than 10pm is the place to be. Bars close at 2am.  Edit edit: I just realized you'll be here on the last Friday of the month. Critical mass is a massive ride around the globe where cyclists meet on the last Friday of every month to ride around their city. Our city meets at loch haven park at 545-6 and hit the streets no later than 6:10. There are bikes that can be rented around the city so I'd recommend that if you'd like to ride with 500 other cyclists around the city streets of Orlando. I'll be there on my tall bike. And don't worry. It's not a fast ride. Family friendly."

We really only went to eat at Genuine Bistro and Swamphouse Grill, went to Karaoke Night at Shotz and visited Benson Junction a bunch of times to find cool stuff for cheap.  Since we came from Sanford, we always just drove over to Downtown Sanford to go out and hang out with friends.  There are nice bars, breweries, a wine room, some small shops with interesting stuff (there's a vinyl / coffee shop, there's a marshmallow place that does kitchen and marshmallow decorating tours, etc.).  We probably spend the most time at West End in Sanford.  I agree with a lot of the comments here that DeBary is a lot more unsafe now than it used to be; while we were living there a ton of homes got broken into in our neighborhood, people went missing or turned up dead and overall people just seemed rude at a lot of places that you went (grocery store, gas station, etc.)."

orlando,3ct68e,okiedawg,11,Fri Jul 10 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"Text copypasta for those behind paywall.  For more than six years a small sign in Colonialtown has advertised the impending arrival of Kobe Japanese Steakhouse.  The sign went up shortly after Barney's Steak & Seafood closed in 2009, yet year after year the 22,000-square-foot building has sat empty while Kobe Japanese Steakhouse expands through Central Florida.  Hundreds of new restaurants open in Central Florida every year, but at a few properties, development has stalled for months or even years.  One property in Maitland that housed the short-lived Blackfin restaurant has a sign that says ""Coming Soon! New Management. New Concept!"" The sign went up in August.  ""The old Barney's was an investment property,"" said Chau Nguyen, CEO of the 11-restaurant Kobe chain. ""We still plan to open as a Kobe, but right now it has a low priority.""  Nguyen said Kobe's expansion has kept him so busy that a restaurant near downtown Orlando hasn't been as important as new eateries in places such as Longwood and International Drive. The company now has four restaurants in the Tampa area as well.  ""The reason it is low priority is we are opening one more location on International Drive near SeaWorld,"" he said. ""The tourist market has been very strong the last two years compared to the Colonialtown area.""  The new location would be the fifth in Central Florida's tourist district. So for now, that old Barney's site will have to wait.  Sometimes the planning and details of opening a new restaurant can be a long process, said Mark McKee, CEO of Ace Café North America, which is opening a site in downtown Orlando near Interstate 4.  McKee and Ace Café announced in April 2014 that it was bringing its vintage-motorcycle-themed eatery and bar to Orlando, converting a handful of unused industrial buildings into a 16,000-square-foot entertainment space.  ""This is a pretty big project,"" McKee said. ""We are trying to restore the buildings versus tearing things down. All the permitting and planning that has taken time.""  From the street it would appear that the project is stalled, but McKee said work has been going on inside, examining the structure, evaluating the roof and planning exactly how the building will accommodate a restaurant.  ""A lot of the work is inside; you just don't see it from the outside,"" he said.  Ace Café held a ceremonial groundbreaking at the 3-acre site in April. McKee said the company is now planning to start exterior work in August. Meanwhile, the company is working to hire a general manager for the business and then can start hiring other staffers.  ""We want to get open sometime in the fall just before Biketoberfest and a lot of other events that are happening downtown,"" he said ""We've got about 200 people to hire.""  When Blackfin restaurant in Maitland closed after just five weeks in business in August, a sign on the door said a new eatery would be coming soon. A banner went up along U.S. Highway 17-92.  Former Blackfin co-owner Eric Kovar said the restaurant was successful, bringing in upward of $25,000 one night, but he and business partner Brandon Bizar parted ways. Bizar retains control of the property, Kovar said.  ""It's a high-profile spot and a beautiful building,"" Kovar said.  Bizar didn't respond to several attempts to contact him.  Kovar is no longer connected to the site, but he said the restaurant had a 10-year lease on the property, and there are still plans to reopen.  ""It's been almost a year now that the sign has been up,"" Kovar said."

orlando,3co1c3,designedbyemil,2,Thu Jul 9 11:59:40 2015 UTC,Do it yourself.  My 100lb ex wife used to change the brakes on her Prelude wearing heels and a skirt.  I'm quite sure you can manage it.  Cost? About $70 bucks from Rockauto for the parts shipped.  Parts?  Two new rotors and good quality pads.

orlando,3co1c3,mcrue2009,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:39:32 2015 UTC,I haven't had my brakes done in a while but a popular deal used to be $100 for pads & rotors per axle. This was 5+ years back.  $190 seems a tad high but I may be off. If you have the slightest mechanical skills you can do them yourself for about $50 -  $75. I did my ex's once and it was really easy. Same car as you too.

orlando,3co1c3,vorpib,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad price, including rotors. Just ask and make sure they're replacing the hardware too.   The mechanic shop I go to is Sloan's Automotive on Michigan Street in Orlando. They're a bit more expensive but all the guys that run that shop know what they're talking about, and do quality repairs. I've been bringing cars to them for years now."
orlando,3co1c3,vorpib,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:35:24 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad price at all if you don't want to do it yourself . I was quoted $235 by tire kingdom for rear pads only and machining rotors, I laughed all the way to autozone"
