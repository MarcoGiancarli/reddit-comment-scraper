pokemonconspiracies,3dxze6,T-151,24,Mon Jul 20 13:29:45 2015 UTC,"You dropped this: \n    So Ive been thinking about this for a while now and I beleive that the next pokemon games will come out... This Year. I know everyone says the movie is coming out next year so the game will release after that sometime in 2016 but I think otherwise. Here's why...(This theory was split into 2 parts so its less chaotic.  Part 1: Pokemon X and Y released before the ""Main Movie"" Which involved Diancie and teased OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire. OrAs released before its ""Main Movie"" which involved Hoopa who will probaly have a part in the next games like how diancie did in OrAs... So the Next Games will probaly release before the next movie which will probaly tease G7 while showing off Volcanion (Like how they showed Genesect and teased X and Y).Now onto the second part of this theory  Part 2: Look at the release dates of past pokemon games... They somewhat match up with G6... In 2003 we got Ruby and Sapphire (G3) In 2013 we got X and Y (G6) In 2004 we got Firered LeafGreen (Remakes) and in 2014 we got Omegaruby Alphasapphire (Remakes) In 2005 we got emerald (G3 Remix) so in 2015 we will probaly get Z (G6 Remix) which will be split into 2 parts... XZ and YZ  Part 3: So if we are getting a game then why hasnt it been announced yet? Well lets compare the announcement and release dates of the last 2 games... X and Y was announced in January and released in October (10 Months) OrAs was announced in May and released in November (7 Months) January-May is 5 months so the next pokemon game could be announced in September with a release in December (4 Months) which means less corocoro therefore less spoilers  Conclusion: Even though it sounds crazy there is a pretty good chance that the next pokemon games will be released this December as gamefreak is unpredictable and has been known for working on games early... X and Y was being worked on during when Black and White was released so who knows when they started working on these upcoming games... Also I remember reading an article where they where talking about releasing a pokemon game every year and how they get someone else to direct sequels and remixes so its very possible that OrAs was being worked on as another Director was working on XZ and YZ  Summary (For those who dont want to read walls of text): Pokemon XZ and YZ will be announced in September and will have a December release..."

pokemonconspiracies,3dxze6,fleker2,2,Mon Jul 20 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"I think that's a bit presumptuous. It's possible that they'll release a third version before the next movie, that would make sense with the past few years, but I don't think the timing is right.  First, we'd see more evidence before announcing it. The August version would probably have some teaser for the next issue. September would show the silhouettes and announce the game. Next issue is some of the new mega evolutions. Next issue is an in-depth look at the storyline changes and new art. Next issue is showing Volcanion and teasing the new movie. Then the next issue will show more mega evolutions and a final ad for the game.  If they want to sell this game, on its own merits instead of just nostalgia, they'll spend more time building hype.  Next, the date itself is unlikely. OR/AS was released to tie into Black Friday and Christmas. While a December release date isn't impossible, I think a release would be slightly earlier to catch more consumers if they were to release that quarter.  Last, we don't know how long this generation will last in the anime and what movies are planned. Zygarde might not be showcased and the anime could have an extra year to dedicate to the story of Z like what they did with Team Plasma.  The games have been following a yearly release cycle for a while, but I don't see much evidence this trend will continue this year."

Their health issues, inside a pokeball, are just bugs in the code which the machine can read, patch, and revert to normal without removing any of the new memory code that has been added.  Thus, the pokemon is healed, but they still have memories from the experience.

pokemonconspiracies,3bni73,Stv13579,-20,Tue Jun 30 19:48:44 2015 UTC,That's why Red and Blue can only carry 6. Average humans can't carry many Pokemon. For example: Youngsters always have few small Pokemon because of their small body mass and hikers carry heavier Pokemon like geodude because they are much stockier.
pokemonconspiracies,3bni73,jo_blow421,14,Tue Jun 30 20:04:29 2015 UTC,Hikers carry heavier rockier pokemon because that's what they like. They aren't all trying to put together the most effective team. They befriend their pokemon like they are pets. Most people don't have 6 pets at a given time. This makes your character different than most since you have no problem hoarding a bunch in a computer never to be seen again. Your character is also much more talented than most (all) other trainers in the game. Catching pokemon is harder for others than it is for you.

This explains why you can only carry six, but not necessarily the reasoning. I recall it being explained in the manga that it was simply determined as optimal given how you spread your attention and care between your party members. Now within the limit of your six legal on-hand Pok√©balls, although there are some exceptions, we can assume some trainers choose to carry fewer simply due to their skill level.   In the games, young children will only often carry two or three Pok√©mon of a low level (I'm looking at you, Youngster Joey), while others with the Ace Trainer title tend to carry six Pok√©mon, often of a higher level as well."

pokemonconspiracies,3b6ngk,Dioruein,5,Sat Jun 27 05:59:57 2015 UTC,They are pokemon rangers but they are not from the same regions as the Ranger series. My theory is that there is some sort of regional law that doesnt allow the use of pokeballs in these areas so they created the capture stylers as a sort of compromise allowing the rangers to do their job without capturing or harming the pokemon.
pokemonconspiracies,3b6ngk,Dioruein,3,Sat Jun 27 07:30:01 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good explanation actually.

pokemonconspiracies,3b23cx,nigel_uno,9,Thu Jun 25 21:24:51 2015 UTC,Golduck is psyducks next form though. I think you'd be pulling strays at that point

pokemonconspiracies,3b23cx,Jimm607,6,Thu Jun 25 17:42:03 2015 UTC,Selective breeding doesn't mean two different species breeding though. It means the same species with certain traits are chosen to breed. So someone was breeding only Psyducks with bigger brains until it eventually became the norm.

pokemonconspiracies,3b1tg4,frigginboom,4,Thu Jun 25 10:22:55 2015 UTC,"Being caught in a Pok√©ball injects a chip on the back of the pok√©mon's head that telepathically links it to its trainer and makes it completely obedient (it also blocks other trainers from catching it). This mental link has the upper limit of 6 pok√©mon at a time to ensure the trainer's mind doesn't get overwhelmed from subjugating others' wills. Which six are ""paired"" to the trainer can be changed at a PC. This mind link goes both ways: trainers feel the pain of their Pok√©mon, even fainting themselves when all of their mons fall. This also explains why trading pok√©s is a big deal, involving a machine: You need to rewrite the programming in the chip so it can recognize the new trainer."

Basically the theory states that every Pokemon emits a certain amount of radiation that could be uncomfortable to trainers in large amounts.  This radiation would vary with the size/power of the Pokemon under consideration. This explains why young trainers in-game and the show have bug types and starting area normal types or birds. Whereas the tough Hikers and Elite trainers have big, strong ones.  The exception to this is the character you play as in the game, but then it's assumed that you are prodigial in some way."

For example, a Machoke gets traded, interprets being traded as a form of abandonment, and is emotionally devastated by it. He looks deep inside himself for something, anything that can ensure he never feels those feelings again and finds the capability to sprout a second pair of beefy arms to doubly impress his new trainer. For an Onix undergoing the same quasi-abandonment emotional turmoil, they would find this ability to become diamond-like and, even though it normally requires being underground and/or living for hundreds of years, they force it into reality with only the aid of a Metal Coat."

For one, yes, we are very different from Pokemon in the sense that we do not need to battle to grow and stay healthy. The best theory to explain that would be that like you said, an ability ""Control"" allows the human Pokemon to grow and gain experience like a Pokemon from controlling and battling other Pokemon. And from what else we know, humans are Normal type (they don't seem to be particularly weak to any group of types and cannot physically interact with Ghosts) capable of learning very few attacks, like standard hitting moves and select others like Aura Sphere.   About human racial distinctions, this seems to be just another rare variant trait like Vivillon as you've mentioned. There is no evidence of Pokemon variants across the other species, which may imply Pokemon evolution is vastly different. For one, keep in mind that all Pokemon descend from a species capable of transforming itself at will. Perhaps that is the evolutionary difference between Earth species and Pokemon species."

Normal type is quite underrated by most. It is the most versatile type, just think of tri-attack and the large amount of normal type pok√©mon that are exploited as HM Slaves. Another group known for being resourceful/adaptable? Humans. They also can learn to swim, rock climb, move incredibly sized objects, etc.   We know for a fact that some humans are capable of psychic abilities in the pok√©mon world. Other humans attain physical prowess that puts other humans to shame. This could be evidence of evolutionary paths. Other pok√©mon have these, and often have type changes between the branches. Normal/Psychic and Normal/Fighting humans thus would be humans that chose brain or brawn paths of evolution and exposed themselves to those conditions (like the stats of tyrogue affect its evolution).  With pok√©mon like Yamask proving that people do become pok√©mon they recognize, it's not hard to believe that they start as pok√©mon and humans just ignore that until they look very different than the ""standard"" human."

pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,casualassassin,29,Mon Jun 15 00:36:40 2015 UTC,"I would say that it's because Pokemon get tired using moves over and over again. That's why they struggle when their PP's run out, because they hardly have the strength to do anything else."
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,ElStrawFedora,7,Mon Jun 15 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this completely answers the question. Sure, it makes sense that a Pokemon can only struggle when they entirely run out of PP. But suppose you have a Pokemon with both Tackle and Giga Impact, and it runs out of PP on Tackle. By all accounts, Giga Impact is essentially just a really powerful Tackle. If running out of PP is as simple as 'getting tired,' then that means the Pokemon has the strength for like 5 whole Giga Impacts but is too tired to muster the energy for even one more Tackle. That just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Similar analogues could be made for the argument that Water-type moves are limited by a finite water sac or Electric-type moves are limited by a finite capacitance.  I don't know that there is an in-universe explanation. Even the text for when you run out of PP is just something vague like, ""No more PP left!"" which kinda translates to, ""We have no in-universe explanation!"""
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,ferrishthefish,2,Mon Jun 15 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking too much into this. It is essentially a quantification of the in-universe explanation. A person can still exert themselves when they're tired, such as using Giga Impact even if they can't tackle. They'll just be that much more tired.  If we were to say the games were 100% perfect representations of the actual universe, then why can you only walk on square tiles? Why are there like 5 people in one city? The games are always gonna be somewhat simplified."
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,ElStrawFedora,3,Mon Jun 15 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"A person can still exert themselves when they're tired, such as using Giga Impact even if they can't tackle.   That's like saying you're too tired to pick up 50lbs but not too tired to pick up 150lbs. You can see by comparing the descriptions of Giga Impact and Tackle that they are the same type of attack in terms of their physical execution. Tackle is   A physical attack in which the user charges and slams into the foe with its whole body.   and Giga Impact is   The user charges at the foe using every bit of its power. The user must rest on the next turn.   They both involve charging at the opponent, which basically means they use the same muscles. The only difference is that Giga Impact requires ""every bit"" of the user's power and Tackle does not. If you can use all of your power, you ought to be able to use just some of your power too.   The games are always gonna be somewhat simplified.   That's exactly my point. There isn't an in-universe explanation because it's an aspect of the game mechanics that the programmers came up with for convenience, and possibly for a bit of uniqueness.  It turns out, according to Bulbapedia, back when Pokemon was still being developed and were still called Capumon (Capsule Monsters),   As shown in several Capsule Monsters sketches, Pok√©mon were originally planned to have a stat called TP, presumably short for Technique Points, with each move requiring a certain amount of TP to use.   Your explanation of ""getting tired"" would make more sense under this system, as mentioned by /u/Exaskryz."
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,ferrishthefish,6,Tue Jun 16 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"What /u/ferrishthefish would be arguing for is the fact that your explanation suits better if we had been given a PP gauge that each of the four attacks detracts from rather than each attack being limited.  Say you had 100 PP to work with total. A tackle might use 1 PP while a Giga Impact would use 10. If you reach 0 PP from tackling, you shouldn't be able to use a Giga Impact."

pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,domrepp,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"That's the game version of the explantion, in real life you think a pokemon using hyper beam 5x in a row would not be exhausted? They get tired and the game condenses that into their moves having a set number of uses, its kinda like working out. Doing 50 jumping jacks is easier than doing 20 pushups, yeah you could do more but it would wear and tear your body"
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,Keranu,6,Thu Jun 25 03:40:47 2015 UTC,"Friend an myself thought of the same question. After some short explanation, it was mutually agreed that Pokemon, even Normal-type are less animal than we typically think of them, having confined water storage sacks and electrically-chsrged pouches in their cheeks  -- but are more like elementals, like the piles of rocks or globs of water we see in Final Fantasy games. They have only certain power within them, which must be recharged with rest.   In-game, though, I can not recall any logos for that"
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,dont_ever,4,Mon Jun 15 04:16:17 2015 UTC,Wait but didn't they say something about the pokemon league rules stating you could only have 4 moves on a pokemon? I don't remember the episode but I thought I remembered hearing that somewhere.
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,adioruben,0,Mon Jun 15 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"This might be the secret. The rules do state a Pokemon can only have 4 moves, unless you're a Dragonite in the Orange League. The rules could very well say that a Pokemon is only allowed to use a move X times in a battle (while the game keeps track of those moves between rests).   I would say ""PP Ups exist to fund the Pokemon League"", but I don't think you ever pay with cash for those...."
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,Exaskryz,2,Tue Jun 16 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"Has there been one?  Technically, I don't think so.  However, it makes enough sense to me to assume that pokemon can only ""master"" 4 at a time because its about the most they are physically and/or mentally capable of doing.  I don't recall in any universe (in game, comic, tv or movie) in which a pokemon battle consisted of an onslaught of moves.  I've seen Reds pikachu strike with agility, quick attack, thunderbolt, thundershock, thunder wave, thunder, tackle, and tail whip, but I don't think I've ever seen a combo of more than three of those in any given battle.    I'm also thinking like in sports, there are rules to the game.  Maybe its a gentleman's rule to only use a max of 4 different moves per battle.  In baseball, your short stop may have the capability of pitching, but that job is given to someone else.  You won't have 2 or 3 pitchers all throwing balls at the batter because it wouldn't be fair.    I'm sure we've all rolled a dragonite at some point in time who only knew thunder, fire blast, blizzard, amd hyper beam.  May seem like an edge, after a few sand attacks it'll get worn out (run out of pp) which kinda evens things out.    Maybe the idea is that all pokemon innately know their moves (isn't there a move re-learner, kinda opposite the deleter?) but its the TRAINER who decides what moves they will use.  I think it'd be interesting if wild pokemon can use as many moves as they wanted because they aren't restricted by the ""rules of battle"", but the trainer has to decide what he or she will use after capture.  May or may not answer your question, but its my theory."
pokemonconspiracies,39uyzg,FolkDude,2,Mon Jun 15 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"My personal theory is that attacks are specialized moves that the Pokemon can use in battle. (Duh)    Of course Pokemon can do regular things like charge at an enemy, even Pokemon who can't learn Tackle; but when the ability consumes their PP (whatever PP is in universe), it becomes an attack.    An example:    Charmander can spew fire from its mouth because it's an ability inherent to its evolutionary line; however, just starting a fire is different from using Flamethrower per se."

The original timeline: FRLG/RSE -> HGSS/DPPt -> BW -> B2W2 (FRLG & HGSS have replaced RBY & GSC). This could be what Zinnia was referring to. The new timeline is similar, but includes XY & replaces RSE with ORAS; the events of FRLG, HGSS, DPPt, BW, B2W2 are retconned to include the Fairy type/Mega Evolution. That's just my take on it."

pokemonconspiracies,385sel,zaccox,18,Tue Jun 2 01:31:54 2015 UTC,Giovanni said some things in the game that has always made me believe that he was trying to make the world better in his mind.

pokemonconspiracies,385sel,hlainelarkinmk2,11,Fri Jun 12 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"In reply to this, I'm going to post EXACTLY what I told a friend when he brought this theory up to me, and also what I posted when this theory was posted before: It's a good theory, but a little flawed. First of all, it's worth noting that this is ENTIRELY Giovanni's fault, since he, ya'no, paid for Mewtwo to be created and couldn't control him. It's not so much 'saving the world' as 'trying to cover up his mistake', as Giovanni is a VERY influential man, a blunder on this scale could ruin him. Secondly, it's also worth noting that there is not only one Master Ball - Master Balls can be won from the lottery if your trainer ID matches the lottery number exactly. Theoretically he could have obtained the Master Ball from anywhere, he didn't have to steal it from Sylph Co. (Although it was likely the easiest.) With his wealth, he could have bought one, and probably could have bough the Silph Scope too, proving that he's not a good guy, he stole it because he wanted the chaos. Also B brings up a good point, he likely would have happily let Mewtwo go about his business if a) the fact that Giovanni created him and couldn't control him could be kept secret a b) Mewtwo hadn't so thoroughly twarted him. Here is a powerful man who is used to getting his way - he paid a pretty penny for Mewtwo to be HIS, and here is this Pokemon (whom Giovanni considers tools, not beings) that has openly mocked and defied him. It's going to be a thorn in Giovanni's side until he can correct how Mewtwo has wronged him - by bringing him entirely under his control. You can see how this is true by referencing the second movie - Giovanni threatens Mewtwo's followers, forcing him into submission, and gloats that he has finally bested Mewtwo. I like Pokemon :) I apologize, after doing a little research I am mistaken. There were a few Master Balls produced, up until the point that Giovanni tried to steal them, at which point Silph Co. stopped producing them (source: http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Ball_(Pok%C3%A9ball) ). It isn't mentioned that he tried to steal the Master Ball purely to capture Mewtwo, just that he tried. Still, Giovanni's only recourse would have been to steal them, but of course he would want to - he is entirely power hungry after all."
pokemonconspiracies,385sel,theicedragoona,2,Tue Jun 2 03:23:18 2015 UTC,"Giovanni CAUSED Mewtwo, and has shown himself to just be really greedy, not being afraid to sell sentient creatures, allow minors to gamble, steal, or even kill. And this isn't for the greater good, it's all profit."
pokemonconspiracies,385sel,Crobatman123,-6,Sat Jun 20 02:22:49 2015 UTC,i just thought that could be  different way of looking at it

I don't remember the Rhyhorn/Donphan fights, because if you mean the introduction fight of the first movie here then it's Bulbasaur fighting the Donphan.

pokemonconspiracies,37wtw8,Trainer411,3,Sun May 31 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I only watched like 1 or 2 seasons when I was a kid, but there was a lot of weird stuff about Gen 1 - I just have no idea if they still do it.   In general on the show - they let pokemon do things that just seem to be amazing. Like, how could you not take over the world with that Alakazam?  Mr. Mime, Machoke, Alakazam, Jynx - they all have clothes or things that seem to be made by man, yet they are all identical. Are they born with these things?  Porygon - Why would that be a pokemon? It's a computer program I thought, so it just seems odd.  Charmander - The flame on his tail can't go out or he dies? How would a species with such a horrendous weakness ever live? They'd pretty much have to be subterranean to live without the shelter of humans/pokeballs.  Wasn't there also an episode where it zoomed into a cross-section of a pokeball, and the pokemon was just happily standing inside? What kind of hellish existence is that?  Just a lot of little things that sort of stuck out to me as strange I guess."
pokemonconspiracies,37wtw8,adrenalineadrenaline,6,Fri Jun 5 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"In fairness, Charmander can breathe fire. They're totally capable of re-lighting their own tail if they have to. Nothing ever said that they die instantly if their tail gets blown out. The charmander we saw in the anime was too weak to keep re-lighting his tail, so he would have died if Ash and Co. hadn't been there to save him."

pokemonconspiracies,380p9l,pokelord1,8,Mon Jun 1 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"So this isn't really a theory more than it is just arguing for the validity of the Pokedex entries. There isn't really much to go on in terms for evidence of this; however, we've seen dead humans/Pokemon throughout the series always embodying a ghostly form rather than the body of a Ghost type Pokemon. In addition, there are simply too many of each Ghost Pokemon species out there in the world for all of them to have met the same fate long ago that caused their fate. Also, in things such as the anime, we see no evidence of these Pokemon acting as if any of such ideas are true. If anything, Ghost type Pokemon seem to take advantage of Pokemon's easily manipulable genetic structure (like seen in evolution, Ditto, etc.) giving them properties that would seem Ghost-like."
pokemonconspiracies,380p9l,ElStrawFedora,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:22:37 2015 UTC,"Origins touches on ghosts a little bit, because even as we are hesitant about ghosts, - some people believe some people don't - the people in Pokemon origins have the choice to believe, meaning there's debate on an after life.   Also, This board specifically talks about the game universe, I believe, not the anime or manga.   It's fairly well established that some pokemon are formerly humans. The first kabara was, Phanstump definitely was, yamask was."
pokemonconspiracies,380p9l,DearKC,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:46:32 2015 UTC,"Origins actually supports my argument, where Marowak is shown not to be a new Pokemon after death. Also, belief of ghosts has nothing to do with this. As far as we've seen in virtually every incarnation of the Pokemon series, there have been deceased ghosts as non-Ghost type Pokemon.   Also, This board specifically talks about the game universe, I believe, not the anime or manga.   Not necessarily. OP may be referring to the games, but the way Pokemon exist is pretty firmly connected across canons.    It's fairly well established that some pokemon are formerly humans. The first kabara was, Phanstump definitely was, yamask was.   You can't say that without bringing up the Pokedex validity argument like I've already said, because there actually ISN'T any evidence of their ""former selves"" in game events or dialog."
pokemonconspiracies,380p9l,ElStrawFedora,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:54:43 2015 UTC,"So, if I'm understanding right, you're saying that we can take the shows for cannon (even though there are numerous discrepancies), but we can't trust the pokedex?  And actually, you don't even have to look at the dex enteries to find that humans and pokemon are one in the same. Much of the lore in D/P/P specifically says people and humans used to love and marry one another all the time, and some of the history tets in those games call humans and pokemon the same thing.   And what this guy is saying is not that pokemon turn into ghost pokemon, he says human turn into ghost pokemon, which is a valid belief based off of both pokemon lore (specifically shinnoh) AND dex enteries, which are the truest form of cannon we can possibly have."

pokemonconspiracies,380p9l,zaccox,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:18:36 2015 UTC,The idea that ghosts were once pokemon is part of a larger discussion: pokemon and humans are one in the same. D/P/P has many referrances to a time when humans didn't think themselves superior to pokemon. they loved and even married before there was ever such a thing as a 'trainer'.   Here's a video that explains it well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjnPyGFYKrI
pokemonconspiracies,380p9l,DearKC,0,Sat Jun 6 17:47:13 2015 UTC,It would make more sense if most of them were dead pokemon
pokemonconspiracies,37lbpl,Shifter25,21,Thu May 28 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"Well in the game, they talk about Fairy type being a new classification, ""turning the entire type chart on it's head.""  I really think types aren't so much a defining characteristic of the Pok√©mon themselves, but a way for humans to more easily categorize them.  A good example would be from the Adventures manga.  When they discover Steelix, they don't automatically call it a steel type, but they see that it's noticeably different to warrant a new classification.  Pok√©mon like the Magnemite line that are also steel wouldn't have benefited from being steel types, as they were the only two at the time of their discovery.  It's only until there's a substantial amount of this typing or a substantial distance from previously established types that I think new types arise.  However, I do like your theory, especially about the origin of particular types and how they arose."
pokemonconspiracies,37lbpl,Lennypoco,5,Thu May 28 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"Well, if it were the case that only the classification changed, then there would be no noticeable change in the effectiveness of moves.  Fire moves would have been super-effective against Magnemite before its reclassification as a Steel-type, even if there were no stated reason for it."
pokemonconspiracies,37lbpl,LadyLilly44,4,Thu May 28 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"Because of the opening of ORAS, with the beginning being the player character playing a GameBoy SP, my head cannon is that Gen 1, 2 and some of 3 are video games within the Pokemon world. They go with the type match ups that the world believes they are. Not what actually is."
pokemonconspiracies,37lbpl,Lennypoco,1 point,Thu May 28 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"Well I'm strictly speaking about the lore of the types.  They couldn't have changed the mechanics to fit types they hadn't invented yet.  I mean I'm sure they could've have made Magnemite a type of it's own (Steel), but it'd would've been odd to only have those two as that type (Dragon can be an exception because they were super rare)."

That one was just my own theory I've come to accept, put together from pieces of lore they've already given.  I like that we got a pretty decent discussion from it!"
pokemonconspiracies,37lbpl,makdesi,2,Fri May 29 12:02:50 2015 UTC,"my only issue with this is that Arceus, assuming all things came from Arceus, would have had to create matter (the Creation Trio) before Mew was introduced, as Mew would be (in theory) made of matter. But this also raises the question of whether or not Arceus is made of matter, or if he transcends material beings... idk.  Also, would this mean that Mew is capable of transference between the multiple universes in order to communicate with the other Mews? Like, in a way similar to Hoopa being able to move other Pokemon through dimensions and such?"
pokemonconspiracies,37lbpl,Pintack,2,Sat May 30 15:30:24 2015 UTC,The original beginning of Ditto Theory is that Mew is the source of all non-legendary Pokemon.  And communication doesn't require travel.

Only thing I think is that for instance, when there's a new type discovered, it actually isnt really a new type for the universe the game is in at the time. Im not sure about this but in the Anime I believe they dont really make a big point out of the fact that theres a Fairy type, but that it has always been there. As we started with XY and ORAS, I believe that those two games are the beginning of a new timeline in Pokemon."

The player character in explorers was a human from the (spoilers) future, in rescue team, the player was a human as well as a random gengar (who it should be noted was a trainer, implying that the rescue team universe still has human villages), and I haven't played gates.  Personally, due to the extreme rarity of humans and trainers and seeming non-existence of Pokeballs, I believe mystery dungeon to be set in the main game's past, specifically going off the Sinnoh lore, where ""At one time humans and pokemon were so alike they would marry"" is written in one of the lore books at the library. This fits in as in Mystery Dungeon, despite the fact that the humans can't understand the pokemon's language (Going off the shock of the player character when their partner first talks to them), seem to be able to communicate more effectively with their pokemon, as the Explorers PC and Grovyle were able to form a plan which Grovyle continued even after the (to its knowledge) death of it's partner (Not trainer, which only Gengar is referenced as being)."

pokemonconspiracies,36o6l2,232THEPIG,3,Thu May 21 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"Tech advanced in terms of buildings. You can normally tell if a civilization is advanced or not if they have taller buildings (normally, not always the case). Unova and Kalos both have much more skyscrapers, IMO, than the other regions, giving me the impression that they're ""more advanced"""

pokemonconspiracies,36gjoj,Polarion,7,Tue May 19 06:38:30 2015 UTC,"well, I don't think it would be a popularity thing...but IIRC, there were quite a few ""planned"" pokemon made in Gens 1 and 2 that didn't make the cut, and I'm fairly certain that plenty of designs eventually got used in some way.  Here's a bit more evidence...if you look at Gligar's original art, you'll see that the little spines on its wings and feet are white...just like Drapion's.  However, when I bring up the artwork, there's a problem...  You see, Gligar's pinkish-purple coloration that's similar to Drapion was introduced in HG/SS, which is also when the spines were changed to match its body. Before then (D/P/Pt and Gen 3 games), Gligar was a blue-purple, and still had the white spines. However, from HG/SS on, it's been the almost-pink color we know it as today.  Old Gligar sprite  New Gligar sprite"
pokemonconspiracies,36gjoj,JirachiWishmaker,2,Tue May 19 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"True, although its very first sprites back in GSC were more pinkish-purple. Still, you're right, even the Sugimori art at that time was more bluish."
pokemonconspiracies,36gjoj,Whattup,7,Tue May 19 18:54:55 2015 UTC,The real problem here is that Dunsparce doesn't evolve into Gligar.

But later you say that humabs and legendaries are in the same egg group. Here comes the flaw, you indirectly said that if you have a legendary in your team it will create an egg. Which we all know is not true."
pokemonconspiracies,364plw,frigginboom,6,Sat May 16 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think that kangaskhan (like some plants) can reproduce both sexually and asexually.

pokemonconspiracies,364plw,aRabidGerbil,3,Sat May 16 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"Yea this is the only things that makes sense, good theory. It's just weird that you never encounter lone Kangaskhans. Like we never seem to encounter the mothers while they are 'between kids' and we never seem to see babies who are in what I guess would be their 'teen years'. Like AFTER they have left their mother but BEFORE they are fully grown"
pokemonconspiracies,364plw,BoltWire,5,Sun May 17 01:26:48 2015 UTC,In all honestly Pokemon was never intended to get beyond Generation 2 so they never had to think long term. It was meant to be a one off game that spuratically exploded into a mega-franchise.  People were supposed to forget about Pokemon in the early 2000s.
pokemonconspiracies,364plw,bloodstainer,2,Sat May 16 17:19:04 2015 UTC,That's not really relevant. Even in generation 1 it was a weird confusing problem.

pokemonconspiracies,364plw,bloodstainer,3,Sun May 17 10:00:12 2015 UTC,"Totally agree that the introudction of eggs screwed some things up but removing the whole idea of eggs still leaves some questions. If baby Kangaskhans leave their mother after three years, why do we rarely see Kangaskhans with empty pouches? Why do we never see 'teenage' Kangaskhans? If they really do 'grow' from babies to mothers why hasn't there been a sighting of what they look like during that growing phase?"
pokemonconspiracies,364plw,BoltWire,2,Mon May 18 06:09:44 2015 UTC,"Because the Kangaskhans are all derivative from the concept art and original sketch in which its seen to have that baby, I think it was designed as a female pokemon with a baby in mind but I doubt that if they'd have given the concept anymore time they'd have kept the idea of every single Kangaskhan actually having a baby. I think that the original idea was that some Pok√©mon grow and some grow a lot, look at Charizard for example we've seen that there are plenty of Charizards in the Charicific Valley with varrying sizes, I just think the reason why they didn't bother to change this was because there was no good way to change it once it was brought up, there had already been the Gen II adding eggs and I think it was Gen III that introduced gender differences in Pokemon (excluding Nidoran)  And in the end I just think they didn't want to do end up changing something that would upset people, because it would force them to make the Baby into a separate pokemon, but that would pose a new question, why would we be able to battle with that pokemon on low level when its shown to be in need of its mother's protection, secondly since Pokemon are usually gender categorized, what should we do about the males? Should they still keep carrying babies around?   I think this has been brought up but the discussion become rather complex and they ended up letting the dispute being unsettled with the matter closed and Kangaskhan remaining unchanged. For better or worse, I prefer it when they don't retcon things but in this awkward situation its not really a retcon per say, more like ""why wasn't this idea finished initially before implemented."""
pokemonconspiracies,364plw,Chispatr,3,Mon May 18 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yea I completely agree. They KIND OF tried to add some more information by showing a slightly more aged baby during the Mega evolution, but that doesn't answer a whole lot.

pokemonconspiracies,364plw,bloodstainer,1 point,Tue May 19 06:59:08 2015 UTC,"I think they ended up realizing that because they didn't change it in Gen II or III they messed up, now it wouldn't be adapting, more like retconning and people don't like that.

One of these evolutions was the crossing of a Mr. Mime, and a Jynx (don‚Äôt ask how). This resulted in a baby human. Unexpected, but brought forth into the world. Humans began to live alongside Pokemon, but not as Trainers (at first). They saw themselves equal in the Pokemons eyes. Some humans began to use tools, and soon cities and structures came to be. Arceus, seeing Man had now stepped out from the Pokemon line that they came from, gave them the 3 Regis, as ways to make other tools, and learn more about the Pokemon they came from. Man did so, but feared the Regis, and the power they had. Groups of Men locked them away, so they wouldn‚Äôt learn from Pokemon about the past anymore.

It is most prevalent and common among amniote vertebrates that are classified under the reptile class.  TSD differs from the chromosomal sex-determination systems common among vertebrates. It is a type of environmental sex determination (ESD); in other ESD systems, some factors such as population determine the sex of organisms (see Polyphenism). TSD was also thought to occur in some megapodes, such as the Australian brushturkey; however, their offspring sex ratios appear to result from temperature-dependent embryo mortality rather than from TSD.

We'll assume millions of years ago for simplicity's sake. Over millions of years, Pokemon as well as the environment have changed. Those Pokemon who lived and thrived back in the days of dinosaurs not only had, probably, a much warmer climate, but less competition in terms of varied species. With all the introductions of other Pokemon to the environment, the prehistoric ones, if resurrected and released, couldn't survive the conditions.  TL;DR: Less competition between species of Pokemon is probably the main reason the prehistoric Pokemon did so well at surviving; more competition means they don't know how to react and die off."

I would love to see the connection with heatran, cresselia, shaymin, and darkrai as I think it would be really interesting to see. I feel like this connection and allusion to thw Bible could give some background to some of the pokemon that haven't really been talked about a lot.  I feel like giratina representing representing Satan is pretty much canon. At least, I felt like it was anyway.  I especially like the mention of manaphy and phione being living water, I thought it was a really interesting way of theorizing why those are the only legendary who can breed.

pokemonconspiracies,34pz5x,ferrishthefish,13,Mon May 4 06:06:56 2015 UTC,"Its pretty well known that pokemon games are based on these things.  For instance kyogre, groudon, and rayquaza are the leviathan, behemoth, and other thing I can't remember from Jewish mythology.  Xerneas, Yvetl and Zygarde are the beasts that live in the tree Yggdrasil which is....Norse I think?  Zekrom and reshiram are yin/yang (tao?) if I'm not mistaken.

pokemonconspiracies,34pz5x,ElphabaPfenix,1 point,Mon May 25 18:25:02 2015 UTC,"1) Satan isn't real. References to Satan in the Bible imply temptation or ""thing that is against the will of God"". There is the beast in Revelations, but that book is written under odd circumstances. There are demons. But Satan himself is a ""romantic"" encoorperation of all things evil. Completly fabricated. The snake in Eden was just a snake who was malicious.  (this is my own opinion) I think people enjoy having a big-bad a villain. So they invented one. People try to force narrative into everything because it helps them make sense of it. Sadly, real life doesn't conform to narrative.  There are strong themes with Gen IV with this untrue point of view... But not with The Bible.  Interesting parallels you've pointed out."
pokemonconspiracies,34pz5x,scw55,5,Tue May 5 10:44:08 2015 UTC,You do understand the Bible does reference the Devil alot right? Even Jesus mentions him. Not many devils but one. Satan.
pokemonconspiracies,34pz5x,WattledPenguin,2,Fri May 8 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"It's all very ambiguous really. Garden of Eve had an evil snake. Hence why God cursed it to crawl on its body forever. Satan means adversary or ""against God's will"". Anti-Christ means anti-Christ; opposing the Messiah. Some people have references to the ""morning star"" with the devil. But that's also used to refer to Jesus. So that confuses things.  There's a lot of evil manifestations in the Bible. They have this badge of ""The Devil"". There IS The Devil and Lucifer but they are two different entities. So I apologise. The Devil is real, but he's not what you think he is. He appears in Job only.  There's nothing about a fallen angel. There's a great serpent dragon called Satan or ""the devil"" (notice the lowercase). That's in Revelations which is a very visual book of the Bible. It feels similar to the begining with Genesis with the poetic feel to it. Because it's a prophetic dream of sorts.  There's a bit about Jesus resisting temptation from ""the devil"" for 40 days and nights. We all are under bombardment of temptation almost all the time. Is this ""the devil"" talking to us..?  If Giratina is based off ""the devil"", the only parallel is the dragon. Where's Giratina's angels which apparently there are?"
pokemonconspiracies,34pz5x,scw55,1 point,Fri May 8 20:49:01 2015 UTC,No. Gen 4 is a story about a maniac and an ugly kid who stops him. You'll find that many pokemon are based off of that kind of thing. Like how Groudon and Kyogre are Behemoth and Leviathan.
pokemonconspiracies,34pz5x,Crobatman123,-4,Mon May 11 11:45:36 2015 UTC,"It's not really much of a theory. Like, it's super obvious that this is where they based most of it. :p  I think you've gone a little further than necessary in your reasoning, though. Most of it comes down to simple roles.  Arceus is the Alpha Pokemon. As in ""I am the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end"".  Mew is the Beta Pokemon, which fits with Jesus.  The reason you can capture Arceus? Because God can't truly exist physically, so Arceus is just a manifestation of God's power in the same way that Dialga is a representation of Time and Palkia is a representation of Space."
pokemonconspiracies,34pz5x,horseradish1,3,Sun May 3 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"Or it could be that Arceus wants to be captured. Like, he knows that his world needs a hero, and the player just single-handedly took down the mafia and sundry, so he gives his blessing and trusts the player to be a worthy companion.

I rather liked sticking with the only 70-ish new Pokemon in Gen 6 and focusing on improvements to the core formula instead. Maybe not have a new Pokemon game every 2 years and instead try to give us a bigger and better post game. Or better yet, step down and let another IP fill that void (when Pokemon becomes too bloated for its own good that is, it isn't time yet but I believe it will probably come in the next 20 or so years)."
pokemonconspiracies,33vfvh,FyreFlu,5,Sun Apr 26 04:35:02 2015 UTC,"That, or they'll reboot the franchise when new hardware hits. They'll take their favorite 100 or so, add 100 new pokes, and not let us transfer pokes from previous games. This way they can make mechanics changes that older Pokemon couldn't adjust to (like when they increased IVs on the GBA), we still get some of our favorites, and game freak keeps their wildly popular franchise alive."

Gamefreak should focus on adding Pokemon that would add value (aesphetic or mechanic design) to the games. Gen VI felt great because a large % of the new Pokemon I really liked, even though they added few new ones. They also added some novel Pokemon like some Normal/Electric&Fire types and a Steel/Ghost.  A problem the competative scene has is due to the quanity of existing Pokemon, you'll have multiple Pokemon that will serve the exact same role. This is not fun finding a Pokemon you like the looks of, but there's another that you find ugly but is better in every aspect. You're torn between chosing looks or viability. Winning isn't everything, but it's not fun losing and thinking it's because you chose to take a weak option to battle."

Clearly people didn't enjoy oras, why bother making another Pokemon game?"". They look at how X/Y and ORAS did in sales and make their decision based on that.    x and y releases were a success, but oras left much to be desired   Gamefreak would consider the oras release a success as well. They don't think in ratings, they generally look more towards sales. They are usually a better indication on whether a game is successful or not."

pokemonconspiracies,33vfvh,Krobelux,11,Sun Apr 26 02:14:24 2015 UTC,"But imagine a game with entirely new pokemon, no older pokemon.   They did that with Black/White. The only way you could obtain any of the older Pokemon from previous generations was to beat the story."
pokemonconspiracies,33vfvh,Krobelux,6,Sun Apr 26 02:36:39 2015 UTC,"That's because Pikachu is the mascot. But I mean Black and White's Pokemon was a starting over point to introduce this generation of kids to Pokemon. Just about every Pokemon in Unova mirrors another Pokemon from the past (Audino = Chansey, Bouffellant = Tauros, Throh/Sawk = Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan, Klink line = Magnemite line, etc).  It didn't garner exclusively new Pokemon going forward in the series because then it would shun all of the fans of Pokemon from before. I don't think they'll ever stop using certain Pokemon (unless we're counting side games which only contain a handful to begin with.)   They are starting to add fewer and fewer Pokemon though. With Pokemon X/Y they added only about 70 which is less than Gold and Silver (which added 100 I believe.)  I feel Gamefreak is stepping away from adding more species of Pokemon, and will simply branch out with 'Mega Evolution' to bring new to old."

He trained this Rattata from the time since he received his first pair of extremely comfy shorts, and now it lies on the ground, Knocked-Out by some loser with some really powerful Pokemon that some Professor decided to bestow on him.  Joey snaps and realizes the world's conflict; it simply was a battle between the haves and the have-nots.  He promised his unconscious Rattata revenge; revenge on the trainer with the red hat and coat, the symbol of lavish excess and inherited power.  He took his Rattata into his arms and went to the Pokemon Center, where even Nurse Joy was astonished that Joey's Rattata suffered a defeat.  While Rattata was recovering, Joey watched the boy in Red win through the Pewter Gym, defeating trainer after trainer with hardly a care for those he deemed unworthy.  The gym leader stood up valiantly, but fell through the boy's unending use of Potions and powerful Pokemon.  It was inconceivable!  The boy in Red beat Brock despite the type advantage!  There was no way that this boy could have beaten Brock without light-years of training! The trickery! The malice! Joey could only think of one thing to do; he needed to ambush the boy.  He found a Team Rocket agent sneaking off into the woods on his way to Mt. Moon.  This is it!  He and Rattata attacked the grunt and overpowered his team of six Zubat.  Rattata then evolved into Raticate!  That's it! With Raticate's new power, he couldn't be stopped!  Joey said to the grunt, ‚ÄúTeam Rocket doesn't need a weakling like you,‚Äù and stripped the grunt of his clothes, putting them on himself.  He waits for the boy in Red in Mt. Moon, and he will get his revenge!"

Been ages since I played Gen 1&2, but I seem to recall they were mostly just in the business of making money.  Just looking through the bulbapedia article right now to be sure.  They try to grab Pokemon fossils to sell them. Break into a home to try and steal a TM, presumably though not explicitly for similar purposes. Apparently they tried to steal Cubone Skulls? Blanking on that. They run the casino where they make a nifty profit distributing their stolen Pokemon. Try to steal a some machinery from a Power Plant. Try to find some precious gemstones. Stealing slowpoke tails to sell for profit. Inventing some nasty shit to evolve Pokemon, but the wiki claims that this was because gyarados sell for more than magicarp. So on and so forth.  Not seeing anything about them trying to amass some army of the strongest Pokemon though.   If I had to guess they use generic pokemon because those don't sell for shit. If they acquire a dratini that goes straight to the casino but zubats they can keep for themselves."
pokemonconspiracies,33khmp,gangler52,10,Thu Apr 23 14:59:06 2015 UTC,I thought the reason they made the magikarp evolve into gyarados was so that people would flock over to the lake of rage to see it and have to go through the toll they set up in front of it.

If it's for money or trading then they might just have an endless source of weak pokemon while the better pokemon meet the demands of Team Rocket's clients looking for those pokemon. It's unthinkable to use the material you're using for trading for further trading because you don't want to damage the merchandise. The few exceptions that aren't traded because a client backed out could be handed out by Giovanni to his elites.  So I think they all use the same pokemon because those pokemon are not in demand.

pokemonconspiracies,335oe1,firestorm501,2,Mon Apr 20 02:55:31 2015 UTC,Some of the ancestral dittos inhabited areas/routes that were peaceful and thus they had no need to evolve.

pokemonconspiracies,335oe1,Anjunabeast,4,Mon Apr 20 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not sure about the timeline here. New pokemon get introduced in each new game, but in every one of those games there's a history in which these ""new"" pokemon are found to have been around for a long time, even interacting with previous region's pokemon. If Dittos were still becoming new 'mon, there wouldn't be any history (which makes me wonder about Dittos and fossil pokemon vs dittos and modern). Regardless, perhaps the modern Ditto is actually a different species, so to speak, from the ancestral Ditto. Like /u/Anjunabeast said, ancestral Ditto living in peaceful places had no need to change, and could have eventually lost the ability to permanently alter form, resulting in the modern Ditto, which only retained the basics of shapeshifting. I'm not sure, its a great theory in any case, and I like thinking about it."

But this also calls to mind what else might be different about Pokemon genetics. One of those things may correlate to the whole idea of egg groups and non-hybridization like we see in the game. Perhaps genetic alterations from don't occur from generation to generation but rather through mutations in the process of evolution. Just thoughts to keep this idea from being one-sided."

pokemonconspiracies,321wd5,frigginboom,15,Thu Apr 9 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"Most of the animal stuff was in early anime episodes cards and then was pretty much phased out.  When Pok√©mon set up it's own established Universe beyond one generation and establishing the rules of how it all works, the animal stuff disappeared as if they were never there.  Nintendo probably want to forget they were there, as it does open up a can of worms (maybe the worms in your video but in can form).  So my guess is the official standpoint is no animals while doing essentially a ret-con to the anime to make it be different to how it actually aired.  If animals existed there, it would be a mystery how they showed up due to them not being Pok√©mon, especially with humans in the Poke-Universe possibly being evolved from Pok√©mon too."
pokemonconspiracies,321wd5,neonrideraryeh,2,Thu Apr 9 23:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yea I talked in the video a little about that. All animals allegedly evolved from Mew, even people.

pokemonconspiracies,321wd5,Hthiy,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Pokemon were an alien ""virus"" that infected earth. Only very few natural species could adapt quickly enough (dogs, cats, fish, etc.) while especially large carnivores (lion, wolves,etc) died out because pokemon were stronger. Humans also managed to adapt and assimilated a kind of ""PokeRus"" that made them especially resistant to their attacks and eventually empowered them to enslave and later befriend pokemon.  That is the short story of my theory that I posted elsewhere but I don't know where it was ...  PS: To add on to that, the reason some animals were able to survive until now or adapt is because they lived together with humans which meant they were protected and bred for maximum success and survivability."
pokemonconspiracies,321wd5,Crobatman123,1 point,Sat Apr 11 09:27:52 2015 UTC,But what about all the stories of Pokemon existing BEFORE humans?
pokemonconspiracies,321wd5,SrirachaSanic,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:06:16 2015 UTC,"The thing about human history is that very little is known about what actually happened. So a lot of that history isn't even known. Do we reliably know what happened 10.000 years ago? Of course not! Since pokemon came to earth likely during the time where humans just started evolving (remember we all come from africa) or at least during the time humans first started to have animals (stone age or so?). There is nothing, even in our time, from that period to explain to us what actually happened. So a new kind of animal (pokemon) appearing near them and others disappearing would be completely normal.  Remember, according  to the games and what else is told to us, Pokeballs aren't even 150 years old.   If you mean the stories about ""gods"" and Groudon/Kyogre creating land. What would you think with your primitive brain if you saw these monsters creating waves and fire and battling each other? They were deified by humans. That is why they are regarded as gods.  That's why ""legendary"" pokemon in the anime appear to have families and children."
pokemonconspiracies,321wd5,SrirachaSanic,1 point,Sat Apr 11 12:49:51 2015 UTC,"That's true, all the information about Arceus is always preluded with 'according to legend...' or something similar.  There's another idea similar to yours, which says that humans left Earth because it was dying and the events of Pokemon actually happens on another planet that humans found and inhabited. Pokemon were already on this planet, but animals weren't. The animals were actually bought along with the humans. That also explains why real countries are mentioned, but the geography of the maps seen in the games and what not don't mentioned what we see in real life. Humans might have taken the names 'America' and 'Africa' and applied them to land masses on the new planet."

pokemonconspiracies,31xkbu,HylianAngel,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:48:45 2015 UTC,That sounds about right. I just really wasnt sure about those games...
pokemonconspiracies,31xkbu,fleker2,7,Thu Apr 9 00:53:56 2015 UTC,"The theory in this video also has 3 timelines. In the Mega Timeline, the events of the Dual Slot Timeline also occur. The difference is that Mega Evolution does not exist in the Dual Slot Timeline. So you can presumably place the events of Pok√©mon Origins in the beginning of the Mega Timeline.  Dual Slot Timeline   FireRed/LeafGreen = Emerald Platinum = HeartGold/SoulSilver Black/White Black 2/White 2   Mega Timeline   Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire X/Y   Original Timeline   Yellow Crystal   The video covers most events pretty well, but there's several things to note that re-confirm the order of specific games.   FireRed/LeafGreen = Emerald. Bill and Lanette work together to create an improved PC system. Red/Leaf help Celio finish the incomplete Pok√©mon Network machine. After Red/Leaf gives Celio a Ruby and Sapphire, the machine is completed and allows Pok√©mon to be traded between Kanto and Hoenn. After the events of FireRed/LeafGreen, Team Rocket disbands. However, there's a hint in the warehouse on Chrono Island that Team Rocket has been working on electromagnetic wave experiments to induce evolution in Pok√©mon. Several years later, Blue takes over Viridian City's Gym, Red eventually travels to Mt. Silver, and several other events confirm that FireRed/LeafGreen occurs before HeartGold/SoulSilver. Platinum = HeartGold/SoulSilver. The Red Gyarados is recently-covered on the TV news at the beginning of Platinum. So Team Rocket has arisen again and has begun their electromagnetic wave experiments in Mahogany Town, but the Red Gyrados' rage has not been calmed yet by Ethan/Lyra. Spoiler: After defeating or capturing Groudon/Kyogre in OR/AS, you can see AZ's Floette underneath the tree of Sootopolis City. This is presumably before AZ and his Floette get reunited at the end of X/Y. /spoiler. So X/Y definitely occurs sometime after the events of OR/AS."
pokemonconspiracies,31xkbu,DearKC,2,Thu Apr 9 02:00:17 2015 UTC,"I always just thought that the Gens I & II occur in one timeline, Gen III through V occur in theirs, and Gen III through V also occur in the X/Y/OR/AS timeline, but with ORAS replacing RSE, which occur at the same time as FRLG, the XYORAS timeline version of which is documented in Pokemon Origins. Then Gens IV and V happen, and X/Y, as Tajiri tweeted, coincide with B2W2.  tl;dr:  Gameboy Timeline:  Red and Blue  3 years between  Gold and Silver  Modern Timeline:  Fire Red and Leaf Green, and Ruby and Sapphire  3 years between  Heart Gold and Soul Silver, and Diamond and Pearl  a few to several years between  Black and White  two years between  Black 2 and White 2  Mega Timeline:  Pokemon Origins, and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire  3 years between  HGSS and DPPt with Mega Evolution  a few to several years between  BW with Mega Evolution  two years between  B2W2 with Mega Evolution, and X and Y.

pokemonconspiracies,31eqob,StygianFox,-6,Sat Apr 4 10:46:56 2015 UTC,"Im thinking that Pokemon were created by humans. They made the 2 original Pokemon : Arceus and Mew. Arceus gives life and knowledge to the pokemon they create, while Mew creates the DNA of the pokemon. These 2 pokemon are instructed by humans to create pokemon for a specific task. The humans are in a war between each other. Thus, they created pokemon as weapons. After witnessing how Pokemon were injured by the battle, Arceus, together with Mew, created the Creation trio to create a new universe. The humans who instruct them were terrified of the new pokemon they created, because a) they did not instruct them to create and b) it was very powerful. There was no legendary before Arceus and Mew, until they created the trio. They managed to create a new, empty space. They created a new universe - an extra to punish Giratina. They created the weather trio and the other legendaries to create a new earth/world. The humans, realizing they had no control of the legendaries, they were forced to stop the war. After the humans made peace, the legendaries teleported all of the humans, along with the pokemon, to the new universe. Thus, creating the current world where Ash exists."

The whole point about Wally WAS that his condition was cured by his relationship with Ralts and the Pokemon journey he embarked on. Maybe we could say that if death was the symbolism there, it was the last hurdle he had to overcome, his recovery, seeing as that field of flowers was the last spot in the Victory Road before making it to the Elite Four; that he had finally rid himself of that looming worry about his crippling illness."
pokemonconspiracies,319q3t,ElStrawFedora,9,Fri Apr 3 13:22:31 2015 UTC,If this is supposed to relate to the Wally is dead theory it really doesn't fit. it's because after you beat Steven Wally appears during and after the Delta episode.

A lot of people have taken that to mean that after all the hardships getting through victory road and then losing to you it breaks his will to go on and he succumbs to his illness. Now an interesting point is that keystones in xy/oras are implied by zinnia to contain power related to humans like mega stones contain power related to pokemon. So it could very well be that Wally in the Mega Timeline is getting some strength from his keystone, and by extension his M-Gallade, therefore is able to surivie where other Wallys of other timelines have died.

pokemonconspiracies,3105d4,ElStrawFedora,8,Wed Apr 1 13:33:08 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that all Arceus's Pokedex entry says explicitly is that it created Sinnoh/ the Origin Trio, it doesn't say Arceus is omnipotent or anything like that."

BW:     It is said to have emerged from an egg in a place where there was nothing, then shaped the world.     X/OR:     According to the legends of Sinnoh, this Pok√©mon emerged from an egg and shaped all there is in this world.     The idea that Arceus created the universe is not confirmed by canon, nor disputed. In fact, it seems to be speculated in universe. It's plausible. I don't know if it can be said that it is outright not omnipotent.  Observations of its nature:     Arceus is shown to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times and protected it from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion in return to those who treated it with equal kindness. Arceus does not suffer fools gladly, and it will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived."

Just an idea that some people are looking into.  In general Pokemon doesn't seem to set religion and science against eachother though. The pokedex for example frequently treats folklore as important data. Mythological creatures consistently exist, and study of them always finds the myths to be entirely true.   It's pretty deeply built into the structure of the setting. Scientists aren't concerned with proving that ghosts don't exist. That'd be stupid. Obviously ghosts exist. They're all over the place, and scientific tools have only enhanced our ability to perceive them. Scientists are concerned with figuring out why/how some ghosts sometimes turn into other ghosts under certain conditions. We can clearly see that they do, it's just that we don't fully understand the mechanisms which govern the process."

Arceus went on, over the course of time, to create the world by creating different Pok√©mon for different reasons. (Dialga/Palkia for time and space. Groupon and Kyogre formed the actual planet, Rayquaza formed the O-Zone layer and etc. for the rest)  And when the time came, in a vein similar to Adam and Eve, Arceus created Mew who spread out all throughout the world and adapted to all types of conditions, and in that course, becoming different pokemon.  Mew was just another creation that served it's purpose by doing what it was created to do. Become life."
pokemonconspiracies,30z9r1,The_Kalinstagram,5,Tue Mar 31 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"Most Mega Stones in Hoenn (if my memory doesn't betray me right now) are obtainable after you complete the Delta Episode. The reason being that the destroyed Meteorite split into all the Mega Stones due to the influence by Mega Rayquaza.  Note how Mega Rayquaza basically created his own Mega stone inside itself by eating Meteorite shards until it had accumulated enough power.  The Meteorite shards from the destroyed Meteor spread all over Hoenn (and possibly Kalos) thus people are just now discovering them and/or that's why they are so widespread.  The Mega stones that are in possession by trainers already, or in locations that could impossibly be hit by a Meteorite shard, come from the first Meteor that Rayquaza destroyed way back with the help of the ancient people. That's why they are treasured and hidden like Beedrillite, despite not being the most amazing stones.  TL;DR: Mega stones are the result of Rayquaza destroying Meteors that threaten earth, they may be created in this process as Rayquaza is shown to create his own Mega stone from Meteorite shards. Because it happened at least once (maybe more) Mega stones are more common in Hoenn, and only reached Kalos through their relationship with the Hoenn region. Maybe a few also fell on Kalos and are thus being discovered."

pokemonconspiracies,30qqyd,Rancis_Fluggerbutter,40,Sun Mar 29 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with ""technological advancement"" and everything to do with how real life cities are made.  Small towns generally don't have variety in their stores.  Low population means they stick with what people like, and that's about it.  If they do have any new stuff, it's in very small amounts, because it doesn't sell as well as the staple goods.  When it comes to cities, though, variety of goods increases with variety of people.   Pallet town doesn't have a store, because hardlu anybody lives there.  So we go to Viridian City, where it's small, but big enough to support a store.  They carry pok√©balls, but only the basics, because the local pok√©mon don't put up so much of a struggle that they'd be ineffective.  As we go on, not only do the pok√©mon get stronger, but the population increases.  Higher population generally means higher income, and those two factors combined allow for greater variety and quality of goods.  Hell, look at Celadon City: it has a restaurant, a game corner, and apartments.  Lots of people allow for a department store to open, and from there, word spreads, and the store gains more business.  That's why they can stock rare and expensive items that you couldn't find anywhere else.   The rest is all necessity.  Yes, places like Victory Road basically require ultraballs for easy captures, but you'll also notice stuff like dive balls, for example, only ever really sell by oceanfront cities, where people catch mainly water pok√©mon.  And since pok√©balls still have a possible catch chance on every pok√©mon, they're a staple item that any trainer can rely on.  Their cheap and can be bought in bulk, as a fallback for when your main ones run out or if you can't afford new ones."

News like that would spread if it had been happening for a while.  Secondly it isn't implied in the first pokemon movie that much time passes between mewtwo joining giovanni and him leaving so it's most likely he wasn't with giovanni for a long time.  Why is this important? Well, bill is a pokemaniac and an aquaintance of professor oak and many other acadamia in the pokemon world. It is plausible that he was also an aquaintance with Dr fugi (not to be confused with the games Mr fugi) and that fugi would have shared his knowledge of his creation ""Mewtwo"" with bill before mewtwo destroyed new island and killed fugi and joined forces with giovanni. Bill, being a pokemaniac, would be excited at the news of a new pokemon and would have made an inscription of it on his door."

They often rely on word-of-mouth through generations, which is why the entries can also change. It's not just one kid, but the professors who gather and compile the data from all the trainer's pokedex to make the entries. They likely just take whatever has the most common ground between the trainer's observations.  Kids are creepy, so some of these make sense if you view them from the right angle. Like a kid bonding with an Abra at a young age and being raised ""like brothers"" so he when he learns that Pokemon aren't humans and they are different, then his ""brother"" just turned in a Kadabra. Scary stories about masks and dolls always exist so that's not really unusual either, especially considering where you find these pokemon.

They are a group of people who call themselves Draconids based on their heritage. This can be related to the fact that there is many towns and places that don't appear in the games, like the Village of Dragons in the anime where many Dragon Masters come from and it's the hometown of Iris. (though different sources place it in different locations)  So Zinnia is just one Draconid, but they have a hidden village somewhere in the Hoenn region, and the people living in Sootopolis call themselves Sootopolitan as Wallace reveals due to their ancient heritage of protecting the Sky Pillar, who again is connected to the Draconids.  Zinnia isn't the only Draconid to appear in the games either, because Zinnia's grandmother is present in Meteor Falls and will teach Rayquaza Dragon Ascent in Zinnia's place if he forgets it. She also reveals the truth about Zinnia and the Draconids in the first place.  What differentiates Zinnia from the other Draconids is that she is the current Lorekeeper. The Lorekeeper is something like a position of an Elder or someone who keeps knowledge of ancient times. Considering her looks and age, Zinnia must have only become the Lorekeeper recently because the last one died/retired/whatever. Her purpose is to use Rayquaza to protect Hoenn and the pokemon world should another meteor threaten to collide with earth.  After she is done with that, her purpose as the Lorekeeper is fulfilled and so her grandmother tells her to find a new purpose in life.  What does that mean for your theory? Pretty much nothing. Draconids, like Sootopolitans, are just a group of people from  the same origin that gave themselves this title. There is no ""activation"" required and they are free to move around. In fact there might even be a hidden connection to the Village of Dragons, since Rayquaza is also a dragon.   Why does the ghost girl appear in ORAS at Mt. Pyre as a normal, NON-GHOST person? ORAS takes place before X/Y.   About the ""Hex Maniac"" (that is the trainer class) in Mt. Pyre, I doubt it is connected in any way to Lumiose City or the ""Ghost Girl"" (since that was  the ghost of a Hex Maniac). Why? Because Hex Maniac is exactly what the ""ghost type trainer class"" is supposed to be, so it's not unusual to see her visiting a giant graveyard mountain. The nod towards XY's ""Ghost Girl"" is very obvious, but not unusual either in my opinion. She might just be looking for the ghost of her dead pokemon, or maybe she is looking for Phoebe (the ghost type Elite4 member), who is also on the mountain.  If she would disappear after Team Aqua/Magma raids the place and steals an orb from the elder couple, then I would find this much more interesting as it would contain some value as a clue. The way it is though she is still there, after you beat the E4 and after you save the world with Rayquaza.  Why would it be a clue if she disappeared? It could mean that Zinnia actually intended to meet up with Hex Maniac ""Aster"" at Mt. Pyre to discuss their future plans or how the Team Aqua/Magma plan is going, as Zinnia was a part of a team at this point and likely present at Mt. Pyre.  It further discourages the idea of the Hex Maniac girl being Aster and/or travelling to Kalos to meet Zinnia, because she is still in Hoenn AFTER the event with Rayquaza. Unless Zinnia is a di** and leaves her important friend alone in a graveyard at Mt. Pyre for possible years (before the events of XY) without telling her the mission is already over, I don't see any way that part could possible be true.   so she left a note in Lumiose for Zinnia to find   The note in Lumiose Train Station that I think you must be referring too : ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go for help. Wait in the usual place.‚Äù  Why would anyone write this message on a sign in the station? First of all ""the usual place"" sounds very suspicious. If Aster and Zinnia were really travelling together, then how would they familiarize themselves enough to be so casual about it? Also, Zinnia and probably Aster too have access to a PokeNav or HoloCaster so they can send themselves mail/call/chat/etc. without any problems and in secrecy as well. Why write a message on a public board?  Do you know who doesn't have access to things like PokeNav/HoloCaster or Pokemon? Children. In the same place where you find the message there is a little boy who says something along the line (couldn't find  the quote) ""Am I in the right place here?"" suggesting the message was actually for him and he or his friends are in danger, so one of them went to Looker asking for help, because as you find out during the Looker mission there is something off about the kids in Lumiose City and you are requested to find out what it is.  There is also another theory about that message regarding the two abandoned Skiddo in front of the station. A lady in a nearby cafe reveals that their trainer abandoned them. Maybe the message was meant for that trainer and he rushed over but something happened and so he never returned for his Skiddo.  TL;DR: I think the connections you are making between Zinnia, Aster and the Hex Maniac girls are too loose to be considered evidence. Zinnia has clearly nicknamed her Whismur after Aster. But due to her dialogue options we are given suggestions that Whismur isn't Aster, but that Aster is someone else. Who else? Zinnia's daughter. In a dialogue option in AS she refers to Aster as ""my daughter"" and in several more she refers to Aster as ""her"" making it clear that Aster is female. Whismur is likely Aster's pokemon and Zinnia thus calls it Aster because Aster herself died/or disappeared (but that is another theory all together)."
pokemonconspiracies,2zg6oh,SamitosHK,3,Wed Mar 18 08:50:31 2015 UTC,"This theory makes me uncomfortable! Tthe biggest problem however I see with this process is that Kangaskhan would breed with itself indefinitely which obviously is not the case.  So how about something else like twins? Or maybe the ""baby"" is actually a Male Kangaskhan? The supposedly ""child"" as we have named it, is actually a male Kangaskhan. When they breed (only with Ditto or other species in games) they always have twins, a female and a male.  The female's duty is it to ensure that her ""little brother"" is able to find love and mate. Kangaskhan ""exchange"" their male counterparts during breeding and form couples that way.  The ability ""Parental Bond"" from Mega-Kangaskhan directly refers to the bond that male and female Kangaskhan form due to them being ""parents"". That is why the male Kangaskhan leaves the pouch to assist the female in combat to protect  their offspring. Rather that it being Kangaskhan's bond to her child, because why would a mother let her child fight when she is  trying to protect it?  How about  theory? Sounds much more happy and lovely to me. Incest sounds scary."
pokemonconspiracies,2zg6oh,Chisonni,2,Wed Mar 18 17:38:19 2015 UTC,I have a theory like that. Saying that I agree with you. http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/2cmjrg/another_damn_kangaskhan_theory/
pokemonconspiracies,2zg6oh,Syberous,2,Wed Mar 18 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I didn't knew that! We do interpret the meaning of Parental Bond differently as you see it more as a sort of ""Sibling Bond"", while I see it as reference to their role as a couple/parents, rather than motherly love to a child (as I said, it doesn't make sense to let your children fight if you are trying to protect them)."
pokemonconspiracies,2zg6oh,Chisonni,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"Well, the pokedex clearly states they are parent and a child. How about in this perspective? When it mega-evolves, it makes the child mature rapidly. It is also the mother's responsibility to prepare the child for adulthood. In this case, it means fending for itself."
pokemonconspiracies,2zg6oh,Chisonni,2,Sat Mar 21 06:27:23 2015 UTC,"The podedex clearly is full of false information. If we go by what is told to us then the pokedex is filled information from  10 y/o guys/girls. So what would Kangaskhan look like to a 10 y/o child? Like a mother and her baby.  It's  true that IF Kangaskhan's baby is her child. Then at one time during the growth process she will have to teach the child to fight on its own. That is just the way nature goes, but when you consider  that Kangaskhan is an all female species, where are the male pokemon? Kangaskhan also ALWAYS has a child, which means the child either doesn't grow up (which means it never matures or has to learn fighting on its own), or she replaces it right away, which is impossible however when her species is all females.  Looking at Mega evolution that is just further proof that Kangaskhan's baby is not a baby at all. Why is that proof against the Kangaskhan/Child theory? Because Mega evolution is EXCLUSIVE to Kangaskhan that are owned by a trainer, are in a deep bond with her trainer, carry a Mega stone and is limited to combat only.  Taking this information means that Kangaskhan DOESN'T release her child from her pouch in the wild. She can't, because it is only possible during Mega evolution. She doesn't teach her child or train it in any way, because she can't mega evolve in the wild.  So what else is there?  Since there is only female Kangaskhan with a child, there need to be male specimen or Kangaskhan wouldn't be able to reciprocate in the wild. It is only logical that the baby is actually the male specimen. That also explains the mega evolution because through their strong bond to their trainer the pair of Kangaskhan decide to fight hand-in-hand instead of female Kangaskhan protecting her smaller & weaker partner.  That's why Kangaskhan being the mother&child in one is very unlikely. Other theories make sense and have more foot then the pokedex entry, which is just an observation made by a child (according to the games&anime).  Assuming you were right and Mega evolution somehow would allow Kangaskhan to let her child mature rapidly, what reason is there for the child to revert back afterwards? None. The child, now matured, would surely choose to begin his own life instead of stay with his mature and give up his newly attained power.  Even though it is the mother's responsibility to raise her child, it makes no sense to do so at the bidding of her  trainer. On the contrary it is highly unlikely she would follow those orders considering that she might be facing very strong opponents (for example in competitive battles) and then sending her child out is a very silly and unintuitive decision that neither the mother, nor her trainer would make as it risks the child's life.  So unless there is actual proof of Kangaskhan and the baby being what they are according to the Pokedex entry, then I don't believe it to be true. There is absolutely no proof to that claim and it opens up many more questions that aren't answered. Instead the theory of the baby being a male Kangaskhan which explains a lot."

pokemonconspiracies,2z7siy,TeekTheReddit,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:05:51 2015 UTC,"That's not really how that works. Greater air density wouldn't keep Wailord from floating away, but it explain how Wailord would be able to float in the first place.  However, you'll need to take into account that it's not simply a matter of changing the oxygen/nitrogen ratio alone. Oxygen is a little heavier than Nitrogen, but not enough to significantly change the density of the atmosphere.  This theory depends not just on a higher oxygen/nitrogen ratio in the atmosphere, but also a heavier atmosphere all together.  For instance, a 40/60 split rather than the 20/80 split we have would get you the big bugs and the explosions (ball park numbers), but wouldn't change the air density enough to allow Dragonite to fly.  Likewise, you could have an atmosphere dense enough to allow Dragonite to fly, while still maintaining the 20/80 ratio of oxygen and nitrogen."

The earliest evidences for life on Earth are graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland  and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.    Fossils of cyanobacterial mats (stromatolites, which were instrumental in creating the free oxygen in the atmosphere  ) are found throughout the Archean, becoming especially common late in the eon, while a few probable bacterial fossils are known from chert beds.  In addition to the domain Bacteria (once known as Eubacteria), microfossils of the domain Archaea have also been identified.  Life was probably present throughout the Archean, but may have been limited to simple non-nucleated single-celled organisms, called Prokaryota (formerly known as Monera). There are no known eukaryotic fossils, though they might have evolved during the Archean without leaving any fossils.

Kinda like how Jesus is the Son of God, but as a part of the Holy Trinity, he's also an aspect of God himself.  The Romans crucified Jesus. They didn't crucify God.  If I had to take this headcanon and metaphor combo further, I'd say that Mew is the Jesus, then there's a ""God"", and Arceus is probably the holy spirit.

pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,aquametal,-3,Sun Mar 8 18:20:56 2015 UTC,"Whats to say the war didn't last for 3000 years and only finished recently, or while Lt. Surge was young, meaning he could've fought in the war"
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,aquametal,3,Mon Mar 9 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"All the regions seems to be very well organized at the moment, and the environment seems to be preserved too, so I don't guess they just finished a 3000 years lasting war."
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,Shroom_Soul,3,Mon Mar 9 11:55:39 2015 UTC,"So I have another theory, my perception of the timeline is that the war finishes just before Colosseum starts and in the time of Colosseum they start rebuilding the world and that is why there isn't many Pokemon in the region. After Colosseum there is Gale of Darkness. In Gale of Darkness the world continues to rebuild and they remove all the shadow Pokemon. When they finish Red and Blue start in a new world, where the war has just finished, which is why Red and Blue's dads are missing, they died in the war."
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,Shroom_Soul,2,Mon Mar 9 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe some pokemon used their special abilities to clean and rebuild the world too, like Suicune purifying the water, while Shaymin helped to regrowth the plants. Those pokemon could have forgiven the humans for their terrible sins.  Another explanation is that their war isn't really similar to ours regarding weapons and destruction, or they follow a strict code of honor. But it is still a long time to keep in uninterrupted war.  Finally, a long war can explain even the creation of pokemons, because maybe they were built to be war creatures based on our real world animals, then they were incorporated in the myth because of the cultural depreciation caused by the long war. The same war decimated the original animals and replaced them for other beings more adapted to the harsh environment."
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,Shroom_Soul,3,Mon Mar 9 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"Surge is definitely not from Kanto. He's the biggest American in the series, and Unova is Pokemerica, so it's obvious that he's Unovan."
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,BIGJRA,2,Sat Mar 14 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"Clearly he is very patriotic, so it is possible that he was born and raised in the Unova region and after the war moved to Kanto, but it is never said where he comes from except america"
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,Valor_dictorian,3,Sun Mar 15 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"True, but Unova being 'America' and Surge being 'American' fits with the idea that he's from there. I also theorise that Fantina in Sinnoh might be from Kalos for... obvious reasons."
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,FyreFlu,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"True, most Gym Leaders would have fought in the War Fantina could have simply moved to Sinnoh after the war."
pokemonconspiracies,2y8fgr,airportakal,2,Mon Mar 16 07:20:56 2015 UTC,Yeah. If you wanted to push it further you could say that Fantina's ghost Pokemon are the spirits of Pokemon who died in the war.

Abra is the only pokemon that can naturally know it in gen 1, and Abra is only found right next to Bill. TM30 (teleport) is found next to cerulean as well, directly underneath the route with Abra and Bill's teleporter. The pokemon that can learn teleport are almost exclusively found between Mt Moon and Rock Tunnel along the northernmost part of Kanto. Mr. Mime is a little further away, but he's traded for Abra. Jynx isn't in the wild but is still only found in Cerulean, the Staryu family is in the gym (along with Shellder).  of the 32 pokemon that can learn teleport almost all of them are focused there. Exeggcute/Exeguttor, Porygon, Arcanine, Magmar and Mew are the only exceptions. Mew can learn everything and isn't in the wild anyway, Porygon isn't in the wild (but is computer based, like Bill's PC and is a game corner prize like abra), and Arcanine can learn it but Growlithe can't (which I think is the done because Arcanine is a legendary of sorts).  Which leaves Magmar and Exeggcute family as the ONLY teleporters that aren't really close to Bill.  Personally I'd guess Bill is meant to introduce the conceptual thin line between life in the physical world and computer-life, but I don't really know, I just like poking into this subreddit.

Bill rescues the young Dratini from humans who think it's a dangerous snake-monster, and he stands up to protect it when its Dragonite father comes looking for it and is mistaken for a threat by the humans in Bill's city.

Don't get me wrong, growing up I did love Yellow,Crystal,Emerald,Platinmum, but B2/W2 really changed the game. It made the whole Gen5 storyline a lot more interesting and give us some complex, well written characters too. If they follow something like that up by just mashing and rehashing X & Y into Z, it's going to be really underwhelming.

pokemonconspiracies,2x7w7q,GoshDarnBatman,5,Fri Feb 27 00:19:37 2015 UTC,It depends on the density of the room. Because wailord doesn't actually have that much weight it could end up with wailord being the one who dies inside of the room with out the room actually getting destroyed :) but once again its just theorized so yeah ^ and it depends on how dens & hard the walls of the room are :)

It turns out that Wailord could actually fit inside of the Cerulean City gym but would not be able to do any type of actions while inside and in the Cerulean pool. We also need to disregard the depth of the pool because the pool might not be deep enough. It's a water-type Pokemon, so it wouldn't be able to survive being on land without water for long. Next time you bring Wailord to a gym battle beware! you might get fish and chips instead of a gym badge :O  My comment:  Hang on--there are a good number of water type Pokemon that can survive outside of water--Mantine and Gyarados come to mind, as they have to fly anyways. Rotom-Wash, Arceus-Water (OK, that's a bit of a cop-out but you get the idea), the Mudkip evolution line, the Piplup evolution line (they're penguins, they can survive outside of the water for a good amount of time), etc.   Also how did you determine that Wailord fits inside the gym?"

Also if Zygarde plays a bigger role in the next game (which is just total speculation on my part) it would make sense for the game to start with the same letter as Zygarde's name (like Yveltal and Xerneas).

So, if it were revealed that humans were in fact kinds of Pokemon, it would turn the entire system on its head and likely change everything about it.

pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,TeekTheReddit,-1,Mon Feb 23 17:26:50 2015 UTC,I am not sure I agree. Can you provide any evidence to support your claim? Or points that disprove my own?
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,Liamisaspy,11,Mon Feb 23 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, many of your comparisons are flawed.  Surviving the Ice Age wouldn't indicate that Humans deal 2x damage to Ice. It would indicate that we have a resistance to Ice. (Now, what we've done to the polar ice caps, on the other hand...)  Likewise, using Steel doesn't translate into being super effective against steel. At most, it means we can learn steel moves. Last I checked, regular humans are generally not very effective against steel on their own. They need to use fire to be super effective.  In trying to explain a weakness to Flying, you list things that you yourself define as ""falling."" Falling is the exact opposite of flying, so that's not a very good comparison either.  Normal and Fighting types are both ineffective against Ghosts, so that's a neutral point there.  I think the Rock example is the best way to make my case. Nine times out of ten, human attacks won't be very effective against rocks. However, that tenth human, who is a martial arts master, can be capable of shattering bricks with their hands. This indicates to me that the humans that are super effective against rocks are ones with a special ability and move set outside."
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,Jimm607,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. If we are Normal type, our tools are our attacks. I just made a post, however this makes a ton of sense."
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,TeekTheReddit,-2,Mon Feb 23 23:28:02 2015 UTC,"Ice: okay, fair point.  Steel: Well, that I disagree with. Average human can work with tools, drive cars, and use metals in their daily lives. It was not steal itself that I was talking about, but how mankind has always used tools to get their jobs done. From swords and armor, to screws and wrenches.  Flying: I don't understand what you are saying. That doesn't sound like what I said at all.  Normal/Fighting: Okay.  Rock: Maybe. I see your point there, but I do not mean martial artist breaking rocks. I mean humans using tool to break them. Anyone can use a jackhammer (you know what I mean) or a pick or shape stone with carving tools."
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,Spicachu17,5,Mon Feb 23 18:15:16 2015 UTC,"Humans developed external, artificial methods of doing these things though. We only use metal tools because we use fire to forge them, so not only would that be a fire-based advantage, rather than a fighting one, but we also artificially produce that fire. These aren't human feats just as setting off the sprinkler wasnt a water-type feat from pikachu.  This kind of flaw is pretty much the problem with almost every point you make. A lack of flight for example only makes us not flying, it doesn't mean would have any special connection to ground type, and our making light is entirely artificial, which removes the link to dark.  And with your rock connection, that's humans artificially using steel against rock.  What you're describing is an artificially varied move set, not a natural typing.  If you want to find humans typing you have to look at the resistances and strengths in a vacuum, separate from our inventions and technology, separate from our artificial abilities, in the same state we'd analyse any Pokemon."
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,Spicachu17,4,Tue Feb 24 08:00:16 2015 UTC,"Flying: I don't understand what you are saying. That doesn't sound like what I said at all.   Your argument is that humans have a weakness to Flying things, but everything you listed (weather, asteroids, falling objects, ETC) are things that fall, not fly. You haven't shown that humans are weak to flying things, just falling things.   Rock: Maybe. I see your point there, but I do not mean martial artist breaking rocks. I mean humans using tool to break them. Anyone can use a jackhammer (you know what I mean) or a pick or shape stone with carving tools.   Yes, but a human using a jackhammer would be a human using a steel attack. That doesn't make the human a steel type. Likewise a human with a flamethrower is using a fire attack, but is not a fire type and a human with a water gun is using a water attack, but is not a water type."
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,morticino,-5,Mon Feb 23 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"What? No, no, that is splitting hairs. Flying things can avoid falling things. Weather is not a falling thing, and humans can't fly so when they fall they don't save their own lives.  That other point is true."
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,232THEPIG,5,Mon Feb 23 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"counter point:  humans are actually psychic types. It is actually true that psychic type's weaknesses are based off of inherent fears that humans have had throughout their existence.   2x weakness to bug: many humans have bug phobias, especially spiders. It is a learned fear because they are ugly looking, but also a natural fear because they can be poinsonous and natural selection has passed on a present fear of bugs to keep us alive should we come across a bug that could harm or kill us.  2X weakness to ghost: people are scared of ghosts. If they are real, it means that we would be unable to harm them while they could influence our daily lives physically and/or mentally. If they don't exist, it means that they are something created from the mind and we are susceptible to the fears that we imagine.  2X weakness to dark: Many people are afraid of the dark because as children, or even adults, imagination could force us to believe that there is something in the dark that really isn't there. This is also a biological fear because as we were unevolved (excuse the pun) we grew to fear the dark because there were predators that lurked in the dark that could harm/kill us.  psychic type's super-effective types could also be explained with human capabilites:  2X effectiveness against poison: our body has the natural power to fight of disease and infection by itself.   2X effectiveness against fighting type: brains over brawn. focus always wins over brute force. an example of this is in martial arts. yes there is a fighting aspect of it, but the one who wins the fight who doesn't go in fists-flying, but thinks a few steps ahead of his/her opponent instead."
pokemonconspiracies,2wvjoz,Liamisaspy,2,Tue Feb 24 04:40:53 2015 UTC,"I really like your theory, more than my own admittedly.  But the one point I would say is totally wrong is your rationale with the x2 resistance to poison. Yes, we can resist most diseases on the planet, but all humans are terrified of getting sick. And disease is not poison. Poison, or venom, hurts us like hell, and humans evolved to naturally be afraid of animals with poisonous abilities.   And too be fair, focus does not always wins over brute force, but I see your point. I also took martial arts, and often times the bigger guy wins just because he has a weight advantage.

As if the spiritual world of being both conscious and subconscious is actually coming to life around the humans and the pokemon each human trains is actually a piece of the greater mind that they are fostering. Therefore people training poison types are fostering spiritual poison and people training electric types are fostering speed metal and rock'n'roll.

And I'll expose why I guess your theory have many aspects I don't agree with:   About the fairy type argument, if our enchanted to things we don't know is a weakness, we should be weak to ghosts, psychic and dragon too, because we don't really know those.  Also, we aren't particularly strong against ice, rock, steel, and dark, because we need artificial features to bypass all those. Look how seals don't need clothes to dive in the arctic sea and cats and owls can actually see and hunt in the darkness without the need of artificial lights.  About the flying type, many types in the pokemons world are stuck on the ground ant that don't make them weak to flying, some like rock and steel are even strong, and the most stuck on ground type, the ground type, aren't defensively weak to flying.  Your arguments about bug and poison are suggesting weaknesses to poison and bug defensively, but fighting type don't take double damage from those types, it is just less effective offensively against them. But that imo it works to support your theory, because we aren't particularly weak to poison and bugs too. See our junk food, it would kill must other animals, but we actually live double the lifespan of other similar weight mammals. And some bugs are vectors of diseases to us just like other are to other animals, no difference. Finally, we aren't offensively weak against bugs and venomous animals."

In the games, it is quite possible that if Charizard used Flamethrower on a human, that human would be dead, and if Blastoise used Surf, that human would drown. And if Garchomp used Earthquake, cities would be destroyed. We don't have enough experience in the games to say that it isn't lethal to humans. It is quite possible that pokemon are just really tough or that there is a special energy inside them that makes them capable of surviving such attacks. In fact, the games seem to suggest otherwise. Notice that Ghetsis threatens to kill you with Glaciate, and the legends actually threaten everyone's safety. Not to mention that somehow, Team Rocket killed Marowak. Also, the Manga suggest pokemon kill each other. Just watch Koga's Arbok get sliced in half. Basically, a quick and well placed Ice Shard is perfectly capable of killing someone,as are many other attacks. These groups just don't attack people without pokemon, either because there's no real point, they hadn't thought of it, or they're humane enough to refrain from using their pokemon as murder weapons."

Something else to note is that she also talks as if she failed to save the world once before, which is odd. This could mean one of two things, either she's a time traveler, or she is actually from the other dimension she talks about, and failed to stop the end of the world because she couldn't stop the asteroid using mega evolution.   Or just that she knows about the distortion world (the only other dimension we actually know anything about) and is hinting to it.  It makes way more sense to me that Zinnia is afraid that we ruin our dimension and let it become like the distortion world.  Also, you don't have to be from other dimensions to know about them.

As it is alternate and does not rely on the same foundation as ORAS Hoenn the way the Distortion World relies on the same foundation as Sinnoh. I really do see where you're coming from but it just a doesn't add up."
pokemonconspiracies,2wcesa,Rd25w,1 point,Thu Feb 19 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"Wait. No evidence of an alternate Hoenn? Zinnia quite blatantly refers to an alternate Hoenn. It's why she didn't want to teleport the meteor away. She speaks of an alternate Hoenn, never of the Distortion World."
pokemonconspiracies,2wcesa,Rd25w,1 point,Thu Feb 19 05:58:47 2015 UTC,"This intrigues me. Can you further elaborate on what you mean by no evidence pointing towards an alternate Hoenn? Thanks for your help. Also, sorry for being so late to the party!"
pokemonconspiracies,2wcesa,WeirdQuasiCornbread,-1,Thu Feb 19 06:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, no evidence of alternate Hoenn when my Shiny Kyogre is from it. Perfect sense is made."
pokemonconspiracies,2wcesa,Crobatman123,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:47:57 2015 UTC,"Wait a second... What if, when Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina were created, they plotted against Arceus, but as shown by the 12th movie, they (SPOILER ALERT FOR 12TH POKEMON MOVIE) could not beat it, even when using their best attacks together (END OF SPOILERS) so they fused their powers together into HOOPA, which sadly for them, did not do anything against Arceus? And then its Unbound Form could be Giratina putting its evil to work and releasing its full potential"
pokemonconspiracies,2wcesa,KingHeracrossTheBug,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:41:45 2015 UTC,"That would explain it for things such as the Legendary Dog Trio or the Swords of Justice, but what about big things like Dialga, Palka, or Giratina? I mean, Gira has the power to go through DIMENSIONS, so he could at the very least save himself, right? And why didn't any legendaries do anything to save the world?"
pokemonconspiracies,2wcesa,KingHeracrossTheBug,2,Fri Feb 20 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"Well I'm guessing that Giratina only has the ability to move through the real world or the distortion world. I'm also guessing that the distortion world is tied to the real world he's in,  which is why he can't move to the other timelines/pokedimensions. Also there could be a few reasons why the other legenderies didn't help out saving the world. Remember how it was though that only pokemon strong enough to destroy the asteroid would be mega rayquaza? Maybe that was true, seeing as mega rayquaza has the highest base stats of any pokemon (I think). Another reason could be that the legendaries aren't actually in your world until you literally ""pull them through"", using hoopa's hoops. Remember how you have to stick your hands through the rings before battling the legendaries? Maybe Hoopa can't pull them through itself, so it relies on you to do that for it. Seeing as how you capture the legendaries, maybe you as a character think that they aren't strong enough to destroy the asteroid, therefore they do not attempt it as you are their trainer now. Also, how would you successfully fly towards the asteroid and live without mega rayquaza's speed and abilites? Wouldn't your pokemon suffocate in space without rayquaza's ability to create air/wind? Just a few ideas"
pokemonconspiracies,2wcesa,KingHeracrossTheBug,1 point,Tue Feb 24 04:21:19 2015 UTC,"Well, in Platinum you catch Giratina without any apparent repercussion on both worlds.   And what about Arceus? If the world he created was about to be destroyed wouldn't he step in and do something? Though according to the 12th movie (once again lol) that probably would've wrecked him.  Yeah, or maybe the legendaries had a power of sensing if the meteorite is there and since they don't sense anything they freak out or something.  Who says you have to ride the Pokemon? You could've commanded it to destroy it. If you really want to go 100% the Pokemon way you could have told your Pokemon to use Hyper Beam, Thrash, Superpower or something else on the big rock. Although the Deoxys popping up after the meteorite breaks probably WOULD hurt them"

pokemonconspiracies,2w51rw,Wyatt1313,10,Tue Feb 17 06:35:48 2015 UTC,"This would make sense. Each box is allocated with a poke center.

pokemonconspiracies,2w51rw,ItalianRapscallion,4,Tue Feb 17 06:40:31 2015 UTC,"They must issue only enough trainer licenses  that they can support at a given pokecenter, its possibly a lot but maybe not so many.    Maybe this is why most trainers only have a couple pokemon, maybe they weren't eligible or are pending registry for the PC system, so they only catch what they can carry around."
pokemonconspiracies,2w51rw,Exaskryz,6,Tue Feb 17 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"Inspired by your post, I just thought:  What if trainers usually only get to store at 1 Pokemon Center (hometown or nearest otherwise)? But it's trainers with PokeDexes that can access all of the Centers' Boxes? It might be one of the privileges of a Professor - approving trainers to use multiple boxes?  Bill, at least in the anime, thought very highly of Professor Oak. So it's possible that Bill and Oak are two persons with the authority to give trainers multiple boxes to store mons in."
pokemonconspiracies,2w51rw,ItalianRapscallion,3,Tue Feb 17 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats a better call. Cause im pretty sure you need a license to carry pokemon in general, and i also vaguely remember npcs mentioning their licenses.  Pokedexes on the other hand are given out much more rarely and for the express purpose of collecting lots of mons for study.  So yeah, pokedex must be your ticket to the storage network."

pokemonconspiracies,2w92ao,232THEPIG,15,Tue Feb 17 23:43:54 2015 UTC,The biggest problem with this is the fact that it's been made pretty clear that it is the same Red from R/B/Y. Theories usually are based on things that haven't been made clear such as the similarities and opposites of Gengar and Clefable when people are just speculating backstories that haven't been made clear. Meanwhile as I said it's pretty clear that it is the Red from R/B/Y.
pokemonconspiracies,2w92ao,Splotzker,-6,Wed Feb 18 00:02:33 2015 UTC,Just asking what makes it so clear? I don't see evidence proving it and red(game) had no (shown) reason to go up but red(adventures) had a reason
pokemonconspiracies,2w92ao,Splotzker,8,Wed Feb 18 05:55:42 2015 UTC,If you go to Pallet Town IIRC Red's mom will say her son left her and she doesn't know where he went but she trusts him. His room is exactly the same as it is in R/B/Y.
pokemonconspiracies,2w92ao,Splotzker,-1,Wed Feb 18 12:33:59 2015 UTC,well she doesn't know where he is he could even be in south america searching for mew and again he has no reason to go to mount silver and i am suggesting that the red(adventures) traveled between worlds although i will give it to you i don't know why he doesn't talk so that goes against my theory
pokemonconspiracies,2w92ao,Jelmddddddddddddd,4,Wed Feb 18 18:14:04 2015 UTC,Ok but I'm pretty sure she is supposed to be hinting to the fact that he is at mount silver. If you don't want to agree with me I'm ok with it.
