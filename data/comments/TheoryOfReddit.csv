TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,raldi,92,Mon Jul 20 03:43:29 2015 UTC,"It's also worth remembering that white supremacism is most certainly not consequence free. Coontown is close to Stormfront in size, and certainly no tamer in terms of its language or beliefs it promotes (arguably, Stormfront is nicer). And, well, Stormfront...   Though on any given day, fewer than 1,800 registered members log on to Stormfront, and less than half of the site’s visitors even reside in the United States, a two-year study by the Intelligence Report shows that registered Stormfront users have been disproportionately responsible for some of the most lethal hate crimes and mass killings since the site was put up in 1995. In the past five years alone, Stormfront members have murdered close to 100 people. The Report’s research shows that Stormfront’s bias-related murder rate began to accelerate rapidly in early 2009, after Barack Obama became the nation’s first black president.  source: http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/publications/White-Homicide-Worldwide   And, Stormfront is most certainly not cost free. It takes a lot of effort for the white supremacists who run it to keep it up (7.5k a month) - but they do so anyways, because they know that they can use it to recruit and inoculate new believers. Which, of course, brings us to reddit, a very big website with a lot of eyes where white supremacists already want to have a significant presence on. Maybe, just maybe, we don't need to give them their own little corner to exclusively spew hatred and racist propaganda. I mean, if there's a place to take the moral fucking high ground, it's here."
TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,fernsauce,31,Mon Jul 20 07:12:30 2015 UTC,"There is a bright line here that reddit crosses when it bans a subreddit based on content, though. Up until now reddit has been essentially uncurated. Subreddits banned up until this point have been doxxing or spreading illegal content. Once the reddit admins ban a subreddit for its content alone they've crossed a line from providing a forum for opinions to editorializing that content- saying that some opinions are good, and others are bad. At that point the admins become responsible for the remaining content, which by not banning they have tacitly approved. I think that would be a worse situation than the current situation.  A lot of redditors have opinions that I vehemently disagree with, and believe to be demonstrably wrong. The only difference between their views and the racist subreddits is that there's a broader consensus that the racist subreddits are wrong. I don't think that certain opinions should be banned by majority- we can use words and votes in the comments to do that.  Finally, addressing your harm based argument- there are lots of subreddits on reddit that likely cause more harm than the racist subs. Check out /r/ProED, for instance. But then also check out /r/fuckeatingdisorders, which isn't pro-ED but still is a welcoming space for those struggling with eating disorders, and doesn't necessarily force them to change. Does providing those users with that space help? Harm? Would the internet and those people be better off if all they found when they searched for ED resources was a therapist's hotline?  These are the kinds of questions we'd need to answer if reddit starts editorializing content. Obviously, reddit has no legal obligation to allow any particular kind of speech on its platform, and the free speech conversation is often derailed on that. But unless we want admin editorialization, an open platform is the only option."

By which I mean, if stormfront didn't exist how many of those murders wouldn't have happened? I'm not being rhetorical, if anybody can provide an estimate I'd be very interested."
TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,TheChance,4,Mon Jul 20 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"Tl;dr: holy shit  Edit: I misread the quote, and spaced Stormfront-affiliated murders out over 1995-2014. The actual quote was, ""in the past 5 years alone"". Adjusted figure is at the bottom.  I tried to do some armchair research, intentionally creating the most favorable statistics for Stormfront, but FBI data was missing for 2004-2009, so take all of this with a grain of salt. We're just after loose conclusions, anyway. At the end, I compare the rate at which Stormfront users have been killing people with the rate at which black people have been getting lynched. It's not pretty.  How I created artificially favorable conditions for Stormfront: first, few of the crimes described in the article were actually black people being murdered; there were lots of (particularly depraved) homicides mentioned that didn't involve black people (or even qualify as hate crimes). However, in most years, there are at least as many murders of black people (for that reason) than there are hate-crime murders of not-black people. There are actually a couple of years where that isn't the case (one year, I forgot to write down which, there were more anti-white murders than anti-black), but it more than washes out.  So if we just pretend all Stormfront-affiliated murders are white-on-black crimes (which isn't true), we're comparing Stormfront's murder rate with the largest possible, individual pool of bias-motivated homicides. We could take it against all of them, but as long as we're playing bullshit games with data, I figure we should play bullshit games that make sense. The overwhelming majority of bias-motivated murders that aren't anti-black are anti-white, and I feel confident that Stormfront accounts for 0% of those.  Second, we don't actually know how many incidents the figure above represents; Stormfront users have killed ""close to 100 people"", but some of those were almost certainly rampages. To account for that, and because we don't know what ""close to"" actually means, I assume Stormfront-affiliated individuals have been involved in only 75 incidents that had a body count.  The only point that swings it a little in Stormfront's favor is that FBI statistics are known to dramatically underreport hate crimes. However, this is more often attributed to crimes not being reported to the FBI, rather than to the FBI failing to classify them properly. I'm pretty sure all homicides are reported to the FBI, though I guess I could be wrong.  The article quoted above was published in April, 2014, so we're talking about a period of 19 5 years. 75 incidents puts Stormfront's userbase at 3.94 15 murder incidents per year (not a body count). We fudged that figure. If we fudge it a different way, and assume ""close to 100 people"" means 94 people, Stormfront's body count is 4.94 a staggering 18.8 corpses per annum.  Now, again, we're missing data from 2004-2009, so we can't compare this directly to the average number of anti-black murders per year; we aren't sure we have it. What we do have is a visible trend among existing data:   1995 - 5 anti-black murders  1996 - 3 anti-black murders  1997 - 3  1998 - 3  1999 - 4  2000 - 3  2001 - 3  2002 - 3  2003 - 4  2004 - 2009 missing  2010 - 1  2011 - 1  2012 - 0  2013 - 1   We have data for 13 non-contiguous years. For the sake of playing more data games, we average them, and get 2.61. For the sake of clarity, we note that 2010-2013 was a quiet period for anti-black homicides, and note that data from 1995-2003 averages to 3.111 anti-black murders per year over 9 years.  Edit: I now realize that I'd misread the quote, and those ""almost 100"" murders were over 2009-2014, a period during which somewhere between 3 and infinity anti-black murders occurred. This makes Stormfront look much, much worse, and my original conclusion was already pretty gross.     Things we can't say: How Stormfront's figures compare to white supremacists in general (we don't have that data), which was your actual question.  What we do know: Stormfront's userbase kills people at somewhere between 127% and 189% holy shit 482% and 720% of the rate at which black people are lynched in America."

If we only want to look at ""anti-black"" murders I don't think those should count (I could be wrong but I think all the victims in that incident were white).  My point though was that there's no way to tell from a basic correlation whether Stormfront attracts people who were more likely to commit murder anyway, or whether it's actually causal. In the former case it might be a good idea to leave it up as a honeypot so the FBI/whoever can monitor all its users. Then again maybe it's some of both; it attracts crazies who egg each other on."

While we could have good-faith arguments about everything from coke v. pepsi to free-market v. Keynsian economics, the value of the W. Bush presidency, the affordable care act, gay marriage, and on and on and on -- the history, meaning, and value of white supremacy is absolutely clear : it's among the most discredited ideologies in the world and consistently a profound force for evil.   I don't think that anyone should be put in jail or executed or fined for being a white supremacist, but but reddit does not have to, as it does now, provide ad-free hosting for white supremacist communities.  The value reddit can create as a center of vibrant, diverse web culture is tremendous, but we cannot have that so long as reddit is also the #2 hub for white supremacy. And as someone who celebrates internet culture (I've been doing weird performative lectures about the internet for years at ROFLcon and major universities from coast to coast and have co-authored a book to be published by Breadpig about internet culture), I'm deeply disheartened that one of the major homes of internet culture is also the #2 biggest website for white supremacist groups on the internet.

Nobody said that strict rules should have to be outlined to prevent people from speaking freely - but it would be nice if people had the fucking decency to know the difference between being fun and being a dick.   And sure, sometimes people slip up and someone's feelings get hurt even in polite society...but in polite society, most people would just say ""Oh, i'm sorry that hurt your feelings.

Probably the three biggest liberal movements right now and Reddit has a massive hard-on for them all.  That said, I don't think Reddit is uber-liberal, but it does lean more left than the average person. Reddit is so damn huge now that the law of averages have moved it closer to center. The people that see it as super-racist or something along those lines seem to cherry-pick or have selective memories. I've seen every sub with any kind of political lean argue Reddit is extreme polar opposites but with the size of it, you can make the argument for anything. At this point, it's mostly just a random selection of people with very average, slight left leaning views."

Yeah, we're pretty big into that, and that's pretty leftist by US standards, but not on a worldwide scale.  As for Sanders and basic income, is that supposed to be a joke? Because the only time Sanders even comes up on reddit is when his sub has a post that makes it to /r/all (which is semi-frequently, admittedly), otherwise he is never talked about on the rest of reddit. As for basic income, try bringing it up sometime and see what happens. See how long it takes for you to get laughed out of the thread. There will be the occasional thread where people at least take the idea seriously, but it's mostly seen as a joke.  I really don't think anyone who calls reddit ""liberal"" or ""left-wing"" has thought about it very long or maybe they're just being dishonest. Really, the only ""liberal"" things about reddit are a handful of social issues. We are mostly ""conservative""/right-wing even by American standards, especially on economic things."

TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,Oda_Krell,7,Tue Jul 21 05:31:02 2015 UTC,"But try using a term like ""union"", ""systemic racism"", ""affirmative action"", ""feminism"" or ""collective bargaining"" and you quickly see just how ""progressive"" and ""liberal"" Reddit actually is.   This just shows how far removed from reality your definition of ""liberal"" or ""non-racist"" really is.  GF made the following important distinction:   Reddit is filled with progressive liberals for the most part so Reddit's population is likely going to align anti-racist -- I'd say it's definitely moreso than the average population.   If your definition of ""anti racist"" follows the tenets of a pretty small (elite, if you will) academic environment, then you're right of course. By that definition, a vast majority of voters in pretty much any developed nation are racist. Which makes the term itself, ""racist"", almost useless - the power of predicates rests on their ability to separate.  Reddit users are, by and large, comparably liberal. That's all GF pointed out, correctly I would say. And in particular, the point was: the ""collective mindset"" of reddit (by the above argument: not extremely liberal, but moreso than the average of the population) is almost certainly not aligned with the one exhibited in the hate subreddits.   Yet, despite the above, redditors defend the existence of this subreddits - and that's a remarkably similar case to the Voltaire quote (which isn't really his, anyway)."
TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,adminbeast,3,Mon Jul 20 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"GF made the following important distinction:   Sure, if you ignore what they said in the sentence immediately before it, which you also quoted, in which they describe Reddit as ""filled"" with ""progressive liberals"". If what they meant was ""people who are, broadly, perhaps marginally off to the left as compared to the totality of political opinion in the United States, but still definitely moderate and hardly even remarkable in that skew"", which is the tone you're taking, then ""progressive liberals"" is a remarkably inaccurate and poorly-chosen description.   By that definition, a vast majority of voters in pretty much any developed nation are racist.

TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,Johnny_Horsecock,0,Mon Jul 20 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Nice semantic lawyering, but you're avoiding the point I made:  Your initial claim was: Redditors, on average, don't follow the notion of ""systemic racism"", or don't (largely) support ""affirmative action"". Hence, they are not really liberals.   Please feel free to correct me already at this point, if I misrepresent your argument.  My own point, countering yours, was: Plenty of people don't subscribe to the above viewpoints (not equally perhaps - the concept of systemic racism probably sticks out somewhat, unions should be less controversial, or at least, is much less controversial in Europe), yet they identify as 'liberal', vote 'liberal', etc.  Again, tell me where I go wrong, please. If requested, I'll go digging for polls about public support for affirmative action, for instance.   Third part of the argument was: the hate subreddit are at the very end of the opposite side of the spectrum. Aggressively racist, aggressively misogynist, etc. Yet, redditors by and large seem to favor not to ban these subs. Conclusion: if not because of them being politically aligned, then maybe because they value freedom of speech (the general concept, not the legal implementation) higher than protection of minorities from hate speech.  But I suppose that's too outlandish as an explanation, huh? Nah, that pictures of dead women or black people are completely relegated to minor subs, and are heavily downvoted on the front page is perfectly compatible with reddit secretely supporting the political views of those who post such things."
TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,adminbeast,5,Mon Jul 20 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"Please feel free to correct me already at this point, if I misrepresent your argument.   You've already done it multiple times in your first few sentences. (Poisoning the well by accusing me of ""semantic lawyering"" when I pointed out that you were choosing to ignore an inconvenient bit of text; setting up ""systemic racism"" with scarequotes, as though I invented it, here, in this thread; etc. etc. etc.)  But let's skip that, because your facts are all wrong, too.  According to a 2013 Gallup poll, the median American actually supports affirmative action:   58% of Americans [say] they favor ""affirmative action programs for racial minorities,"" including 51% of whites, 76% of blacks, and 69% of Hispanics.   http://www.gallup.com/poll/163655/reject-considering-race-college-admissions.aspx  The fact that Reddit is at best ambivalent, at worst wholly opposed, speaks to Reddit's whiteness (note that racial skew), Reddit's conservatism, and the fact -- as I said upthread -- that Reddit is generally only ""progressive"" on issues which directly affect the well-being of young, middle-class white men. When it comes to something like affirmative action, Reddit runs the other way, even though mainstream liberalism -- and certainly the ""progressive liberalism"" we're talking about here -- dictates that affirmative action is at worst an unfortunate necessity.   Plenty of people [blah blah blah]   Plenty of people identify as ""liberal"" yet have voted Republican at every election for their entire lives. (And plenty of ""conservatives"" always vote Democrat.) Labels don't prove much, which is why I'm so eager to talk about what Reddit actually believes.   Conclusion: if not because of them being politically aligned, then maybe because they value freedom of speech (the general concept, not the legal implementation) higher than protection of minorities from hate speech.   But it's not just ""hate speech"", it cultural tolerance for attempts to shut women and POC down and force them off the site. It's harassment, it's toxic conditions, it's shifting the Overton window, it's creating a climate where, for the sake of ""free speech"", we allow plenty of potential good-faith contributors to be silenced because a small number of bad-faith contributors find it amusing or fulfilling to silence them.  In such an environment, siding with the oppressor is profoundly illiberal, and -- if we want to wrap ourselves up in pieties about ""the marketplace of ideas"" and ""tolerance"" -- downright hypocritical. (Can we stop pretending that /r/coontown is Voltaire or whatever? These people are not here to participate in your marketplace, these people are here to shut it down.)"

Literally the top post of /r/all right now is someone playing a sousaphone making fun of KKK marchers... the top post of /r/politics is Bernie Sanders pushing for a 15$ minimum wage.  Reddit is just anti-authoritarian. It's very critical of authoritarian leftist ideologies. Thus it being generally less racist than the American public while also being more supportive of racist subs right to exist. Also explains the hate for police but the dislike of the anti police brutality movement being co-opted by race baiters. Also the confused boner it always gets for the libertarian Pauls.

Hell - just yesterday I was narrating to the SO, the history of reddit's own counter movements.  First there was reddit - then  subreddits. Thence came bestof, and the warm summer of happy reddit links and positivity.  That faded into autumn and the rise of subs like SRS, where people initially wanted to highlight the opposite of the happy happy feel good parts of the hive.

TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,danweber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:04:58 2015 UTC,"Evidence suggests that anti-discrimination law and hate-speech policy ""grow from the barrel of a gun"": once a discriminated group acquires enough political influence, it adds itself to the list of groups that shouldn't be discriminated against.   An alternative explanation for this would be that groups which are targets of discrimination and hate speech do not have a chance of being added to any list of protected groups while the people with the power to decide what makes up those groups are not sympathetic to their plight. In general groups which are protected against discrimination and/or hate speech are minorities, at least within positions of power and influence. They idea that they are giving themselves protection is clearly false, consider for example the recent majority vote for marriage equality in Ireland. Is it more likely that the 1,201,607 people who voted in favour are gay, or that LGBT activism has given them a new perspective?   Whether or not that group is of the what you are sort (sex, age) or what you do sort (religion, political affiliation), or a mixture.   Political affiliation is not typically protected in the same way as far as I'm aware. It might be protected under freedom of association, but that's different. Religion can be argued to not be a choice. When someone is raised into a religion from childhood, breaking away from that is not a simple matter of choice. There is also often an ethnic aspect to religion, e.g. Jewish people."

It's a bit tiresome because nobody I have seen in any discussion is arguing against that or thinks otherwise.  Reddit doesn't need to do anything, they could take the site down tomorrow if they felt like it.  The point to be made about free speech is that by limiting it the website primes itself to become shit for any controversial discussion and the ripple effect of that is the slow decline of the site."
TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,anace,14,Tue Jul 21 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"The innovation and creativity that sprung out of a hands-off, user powered policy is what made reddit what it is. To ban communities or censor them for any reason erodes the core principles of the site. Of course, there are very practical reasons to make that trade-off. Reddit has drawn lines around what they will and will not tolerate. Not banning ""hate"" communities is consistent with their core principles and it can also be viewed as an ode to the principle of free speech.  So I think a more apt analogy would be that you are in the business of making signs for people and business is booming because anyone can use your website to make a sign for anything. Customers start making signs that say ""kill john doe"" or ""john doe lives at ______"". So you ban personal threats and private information, which makes complete sense because it's relatively easy to monitor and far too risky to allow it. Now the Westboro Baptist church wants to make a ""god hates whoever"" sign and you have a much more nuanced and complex problem on your hand. This is where reddit is now. There are merits and risks associated with either decision. It's not the obvious choice you want it to be."

TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,jstrachan7,11,Mon Jul 20 04:49:09 2015 UTC,"First off, reddit was not nearly what it is now back in 2009.

I never knew reddit had a hate speech policy except for anecdotes of Huffman saying he removed things he didn't like. Was there an actual written policy?  Either way, I'll still stick by what I wrote. A company could have a no hate speech policy for years and only experience negligible negative effects. As the site gets bigger, they run into more situations where they are exposed to the risk a policy creates."

The offensiveness of the content isn't the issue. My grandmother finds gay marriage offensive, but that's not a valid argument against it. When something is offensive that's just a symptom. The reason it's offensive is what needs to be examined.   A subreddit about le edgy humor is one thing. They're just people with a dumb sense of human trying to get a rise out of others. Big deal. Places like coontown host legitimate hate speech. The issue with hate speech not that it's offensive.    Of course you can: /r/coontown if full of white racists, (I'm sure there's a few black trolls in there fucking with them), just as /r/christianity is full of christians, that's what subs are, they attract people with similar beliefs, that's the entire reason Reddit exists.   Those subs are similar only in the most superficial of ways. You can't say ""here is subreddit X, their existence has effect Y"" and assume that's going to apply for all X equally. When you have different demographics sharing different information for different reasons, the outcomes are going to be different.    What you are suggesting is we take that choice away from people and that is absolutely wrong   If I choose not to invite someone into my house because I think they're a dick, I'm not taking away his choice in any meaningful way. He doesn't have the option to enter my house in the first place unless I choose to let him in. reddit is not a public space, it's a private residence, and they can choose who they allow in.

It's certainly offensive to her, but what about the subscribers, what of their loss.  And suppose there was another sub, r/ihategaymarriage, which is full of bigotry towards gays, would she want that banned? there's a good chance she wouldn't because it sounds like she's a bigot herself, (not saying she is, just for the purposes of this discussion) and fits into her world view.  So me as a supporter of marriage equality should I want /r/ihategaymarriage banned? absolutely not, nor would I subscribe to it.  Reddit is a reflection of the world we live in with all the good and bad posted for all to see if they so choose, just as I choose not to attend GOP conventions and listen to their hate speech so I choose not attend KKK rallies and listen to that hate speech either, but nevertheless, I would be pissed if someone wanted to take away mine and everyone elses choice."

The reason free speech is a laudable goal is because it allows for the exchange of ideas and knowledge. It can help people be exposed to new political and social ideas.  Hate speech does not accomplish this goal. It only serves to cause harm, intimidate, threaten, bully, and encourage others to do so as well. It does not serve a useful purpose. It just breeds hate.  While I would not trust the government to ban hate speech, I'd be perfectly fine with a site like reddit drawing the line there and saying it's not allowed.  If a specific venue decides they do not want to host the KKK's hate speech, I would have no problem with them doing that.

Yes, that's true.  And yes... that may end up to be what largely happens.  But that's not necessarily good thing overall.  Because an unrestricted site may end up being a stronger competitor even if it does contain a higher number of bigots.     they're merely calling for reddit to stop being the one to provide the free microphone.   That's all fine and good until reasonable people start getting banned for relatively frivolous reasons.

TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,itty53,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"People fought and died for the right to be legally able to express an opinion.

That is the legality of /r/SomethingIdontLike has nothing to do with 'compelling' Reddit to do anything.   But then, this is the /r/TheoryOfReddit . No one is compelling Reddit to do anything. We are talking about the way things ought to be. By blurring that distinction You are trying to create some strawman argument.    If the reddit leadership doesn't want bigotry on their site, do they have to allow it? Of course not.   It's not about ""bigotry on their side"" but ""allowing all sides"". Even the side that you are spewing your opinion from -was restricted at some point. If you truly feel that you are right in your opinion about something -you should know the counter arguments. If you restrict the counter arguments then don't be surprised that they are taking hold with other people that you could otherwise convince."
TheoryOfReddit,3dwn73,CanadianHoser,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"They're merely calling for reddit to stop being the one to provide the free microphone.   And that's the problem. People on this website want this community to be a free speech community. They want it to be a place where anyone can express any idea, no matter how repulsive.  Echo chambers are not productive or healthy for society, and that's exactly what you are proposing is the right course of action. For people to divide themselves into their little subcatagories and distance themselves on the Internet by going to entirely different websites. What if the people at Stormfront decided that they no longer wish to entertain non-racist speech? What if they said ""You can just go elsewhere""? How is productive conversation and debate supposed to occur, if everyone bans opposing or distatseful speech from their communities?  What you are proposing is a shot in the foot to the notion of free speech. You'd ""have"" free speech, but it would be functionally worthless. You'd gimp it beyond utility. We as a site are made better, not worse, for allowing multiple viewpoints to coexist. The climit of free speech benefits us, if for no other reason, than because virtuous speech is only virtuous when it is not compelled. By banning subreddits like coontown, by censoring ""wrong"" opinions, you destroy any value in the ""right"" opinions. You also deny me my right to listen to what they have to say. It's not just a matter of denying them the right to speak here, you take away my right to hear them out, to weigh the merit of their ideas against other's and my own thoughts. You take away my right to think while on this website.  We should not be going around banning people for having the wrong viewpoints or beliefs. Reddit is not some small community forum. It's not themed after some specific topic. It's a massive social media website, designed to allow commentary on a wide variety of subjects. It must be everything, or nothing at all."

If what someone does is wrong in public and does it on the internet, like harassment or bullying, the same disdain / repulsion / reform should be applied to the internet as well.  .  I think the internet should be considered an extension of the public and therefore should be committed to empathy and providence. If those views include coontown or fatpeoplehate, then let us make the haters feel loved and their hate hated, but not silence them.  .

Bullying bigots self righteousnessly want to police their perception of social utopia. That's all well and good in Ivory tower sociology papers but on reddit and life there are actual reprocussions.   Meta drama cross linking and consolidation of power by various mods and groups are a much bigger threat to organic contribution and participation on reddit. Derailment, bullying, mockery, harassment, brigading, vote skewing invading other subs is a lot more insidious than clearly extreme racism and other -isms. No one is running off to join the KKK or the Westboro Church because some idiot says something racist. What does happen however is constant brigading from elsewhere on reddit telling people how racist and sexist they are."
TheoryOfReddit,3dpm0d,Sansa_Culotte_,-5,Tue Jul 21 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"One of the pillars your argument rests on is ""more likely to actually harass or harm others"". The guts of this idea rests on a claim along the lines of, ""certain content / speech / text / images / video might influence behavior and therefore it is Reddit's responsibility to manage that content"".  Reddit CEO /u/spez announced the decision to ban /r/rapingwomen on the following grounds: ""They are encouraging people to rape"".  Allowing arguments along the lines of, ""someone might do something bad because of something they read / saw / watched because of Reddit"" to hold weight is the road to hell. It is insanity. Stupidity. Facepalm. My brain is full of fuck. Why would you do that?  I think you get the idea, but just in case you're still unsure as to my opinion on this matter, it is the management equivalent of catastrophic failure.  Part of the problem is that the USA supreme court made the disastrous decision to permit the states to outlaw certain types of speech in 1969, the Brandenburg v. Ohio decision. The principle here being that there are certain types of speech that are really really bad which therefore don't qualify for first-amendment protection.  Here's a thought experiment: suppose some frat boy comes on to /r/rapingwomen, he makes a self-post along the lines of, ""There is this really hot babe who hates me and I want to rape her tonight, how do I do it?"" The /r/rapingwomen community gives him a bunch of pointers, and he goes on to commit the rape. Lets forget about the consequences of this particular incident (does the woman catch an STD? does she press rape charges? does the frat boy flee the country?) and just focus on the post and Reddit's role in this little drama. The supreme court decision I mentioned above does not protect the speech of the Redditors who encouraged the OP to commit the rape because the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely.  In short: the USA supreme court is 100% wrong and this state interference in the civil society makes a mockery of freedom.  In a free and open society, members of the society are free to instruct, cajole, pressure, and otherwise incite others to commit crimes because such acts are speech and the individuals are personally and completely responsible for their own actions. Speaking is speaking. Harming is harming. The two should not be confused, and the responsibility for harming should be completely retained by the harmer.  I could launch this into a discussion of peer pressure, but that leads into a sociological territory I'm not qualified to discuss.  tl;dr Reddit CEO /u/spez should step down because his decision to ban /r/rapingwomen has set off a chain reaction; the new CEO should reverse this decision and put Reddit on a course to challenge and overturn the supreme court's restraints on free expression. It is the right thing to do."
TheoryOfReddit,3dpm0d,CollumMcJingleballs,3,Sat Jul 18 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of things that clearly encourage violence is fine. Without criticism from outside groups, it's more likely that users will find it acceptable to do reprehensible things. My argument isn't ""Racist and sexist trash increases the likelyhood of people doing bad things,"" It's that without criticism, it will be more likely for someone to think it's okay to rape, harass, bully, assault, or murder another.  What you described is anarchy, which is not what a free society would be. With anarchy, those with the ability will try to silence people they don't like without consequence. With /r/rapingwomen, they were encouraging people to commit an act of violence against others, and thus it had to go.  We don't ban the Westboro Baptist Church from protesting funerals, because in a free society, they should be allowed to do so. It would be wrong to force them to stop. Telling them that they are hateful nutjobs is fine though."

Those two subreddits being the first thing people saw turned off 1/3 or more of America (not sure how the rest of the world would see those places). While they finally made them less visible they took so long in doing it that this site leans extremely heavy with liberal bias and makes it hard for Republicans/conservatives and even many moderates to stick around.   Even worse when /u/spez says he wants Reddit to be a place of open and authentic discussion yet there is no place on Reddit where an open and authentic discussion about politics can take place. Which is fine when everyone is welcome and they push free speech but now that they are deciding which viewpoints are good and which are bad....

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,gaviidae,16,Fri Jul 17 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"Reddit doesn't need growth in people, it needs grow in revenue. For that to occur it needs to jettison the 'freedom of speech at any cost' and attract the 'interesting, polite debate' crowd."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,HeartyBeast,16,Thu Jul 16 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"I've kept distance from a lot of this. Don't feel obligated to recap the whole thing, but what exactly is so challenging about putting the polite, interesting debate on the front page along with some irreverent humor and pop/geek culture while leaving everyone else to their own subreddits? My first account was made in 2008 and that was my sense of the site for the most part. The less tasteful parts of Reddit weren't a problem for me until people started pointing them out and loudly complaining that on other parts of the site. In fact, I kind of liked being able to easily visit the seedier parts of the site."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,tonicandgin,8,Thu Jul 16 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'll add to what's been said by pointing out that the ""less tasteful"" members of Reddit tend to dominate outsiders' perceptions of the site, either through their actions within the site or their actions IRL. It is, of course, wrong that the general public judges reddit based on this tiny sliver of it, but it still happens, and it affects how potential users perceive the site. A potential user who has some scumbag tendencies might say, ""hey! This looks like the site for me"" while the intelligent, compassionate potential user might say ""no thanks"". So, I don't think we can just say that it doesn't matter how mainstream media depicts us. Even if you set aside the financial issues, the less tasteful aspects of the site matter more now that the site has a high profile b/c their presence is now likely to influence the future userbase, whether we like it or not.   There is one optimistic possibility. The virtues of reddit will simply overwhelm the negative stories about it. The negative stories will bubble up in the news and then die down over and over, but gradually, over time, the cool things we produce, the amazing AMAs with amazing people, the memes, the great stories and conversations, will be what we're known for. One can hope."

Partly this may be due to brigading 'hey guys - someone's just said they're fat in worldnews'.

The person could be a racist nazi sympathizer, but just because that aspect is hidden, people are fine.  But if that person were to actually have a forum where he talks to like minded people, it doesn't mean that the site is seedier. Those people will just pop up in normal threads.

Multireddits are identical to front pages, but with them you are able to choose which subreddits you see. For a multireddit, you are limited to 100 subreddits of your choosing, and I think the limit for creating multireddits is limitless. So far, I've created ones for a few categories that take over all of my browsing of reddit. There are a few here and there that have been affected, but overall, I haven't really been bothered by it.   I have been keeping an eye on the announcements page and other things that may pop up, but seeing how reddit as a whole responds to this whole thing is just a turn off. They make all of these posts, some including the swastikas that you mentioned, defacing or shunning the previous CEO and even make a petition to get the Internet's attention about the horrible CEO's ways, but then news breaks that it may not have been her decision of firing Victoria at all, but /u/kn0thing's.  I have a feeling by the end of this week/weekend, the majority of reddit will go back to business as usual until the next big change (probably the implementation of the new content stuff and banning of subreddits that was discussed in the AMA today) unless it's something that riles up pretty much the whole userbase."

It's sad and unfortunate that some people don't know how to react to person with an opposing viewpoint without being offensive, nor  without actually harassing and/or threatening said person. That's what I believe they're trying to crack down on. Not all people with extreme views are going to harass other redditors, rather, those few who do.

Sure, this is a misstep on the part of anyone willing to jump to conclusions without real evidence, but it's still a problem that the admins should take seriously. I don't mean to shirk responsibility for having made un-based decisions, but I'm not about to accept full responsibility for it either; it is clearly within the best interests of the admins to keep the broader community well informed, which they did not do, and that is not my fault.

Reddit (the company) should be a facilitator for this discussion while making revenue through the website while also giving stamps of approval to discussion boards that they feel to represent Reddit.  To do this, the front page and /r/all need to be reworked into three, instead of two, main portals for Reddit.  1) The Front Page: this would remain the same as it has been, either being defaults for non-signed in users or subscribed subreddits for signed in users.  2) r/all: this would also remain the same as it is currently, with one change: an 18+ verification would be required to access the page, similar to what nsfw subreddits have now.  This would state that the opinions on r/all do not represent the opinions of Reddit, but represent views of a broad user base.  r/all would use sidebar ads like there currently are, but not have any additional corporate sponsored monetization programs unless they achieved an r/all status due to user voting.  3) A new main portal would be the Reddit Verified Boards, a group of subreddits given a stamp of approval by Reddit (the company). To become one of these subreddits, the moderators of a subreddit could submit an application to a board of admins.  The admins could approve or deny, through a consensus of the board, whatever subreddits they choose for whatever reasons.  These subreddits would show what Reddit approves of; Reddit doesn't like FPH? Don't allow it on the Reddit Verified Portal, but allow it to stay on the website to keep getting ad revenue.  Corporate sponsors don't want their products to be associated with porn? Don't put nsfw subreddits in the Reddit Verified Portal. Getting brigading from a subreddit? Remove its verified status.  Through the new Reddit Verification process, I believe the majority of users would be happy with the state of Reddit, with the obvious exception of a few flamers and trolls.  Instead of completely being banned from Reddit, a subreddit that is distasteful would just not be verified.  Users get their subreddit, Reddit gets ad revenue while winning over users by saying that even though some ideas they do not agree with, they will provide a discussion space for them, corporate sponsors get a family-friendly version of Reddit that can be tailored specifically to advertising, and users like Reddit because they, whether Reddit (the company) believes in it or not, uphold the idea of free speech."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,Gin_And_Ramune,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:10 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of practical thinking that we need. Let's brainstorm. Currently, we can vote on a post and a comment. Perhaps users should also be allowed to cast a standing vote on a whole subreddit. Or maybe users assign a sliding scale or choose from a set of tags to assign to subs.  Choose ""tasteless,"" ""crude,"" ""circlejerky,"" etc. for problematic subs. There needs to be a way for the typical harmless users to paint a picture of how they feel about entire subs, not just posts and comments."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,motsanciens,4,Thu Jul 16 19:43:58 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of tags for subreddits in theory, but there would have to be some type of preventative measure to prevent circlejerking in the tags themselves.  It's like how Steam allows tags, which is a great idea, but then you get stuff like when Payday 2 was tagged as a ""bag throwing simulator"" for a while.    User feedback would be a great way to show how a certain subreddit is viewed as a whole, but I think in controversial subs that aren't exactly problematic, this could just end up in activities similar to brigading.  For example, Christianity vs. Atheism, I could see some vote distortion going on there, as the intended user bases are two separate and opposite groups.  Similarly, KotakuInAction and GamerGhazi, both groups are made of people who truly believe they are right, and to them, the other side are trolls/flamers/marxists/whatever the slur of the day is.    I'd suggest a karma minimum on the board to be able to vote for it, but who would earn 100 karma on coontown to be able to tag it as racist?    The tagging is a great idea that would definitely need a lot of work to turn into an implementable form, and this discussion is one that reddit admins, mods, and users all need to have together."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,Gin_And_Ramune,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with approved tags would be they would need people to approve them like admins but then more admins means spending more money, that's why Reddit has volunteer moderators right? It's a interesting predicament."

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,LuisN,24,Thu Jul 16 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"I think that is too simplistic.   We as humans are mired in ideology. It's how we enact and institute ideology into the infrastructure of a website that would lead it to whatever goals the creators and users desire.   To say that a website should ""just be a website"" is a bit weird. Why aren't you in the yahoo comments section everyday? 4chan? Or some other link aggregate?  I feel like reddit has different goals than say a website like 4chan. ""Ideologically"" you have the pursuit of individual gain and notoriety (i.e. Karma) vs. the collectivist anonymity of the users at 4chan, to put it generally. Not to make it black and white, I understand each website has similar aspects reflected in each other (tripcode on 4chan).   But to ignore all these attributes that hold these websites and communities together and to let it ""just be a website"" is an incorrect way to look at the situation.   What goals does reddit hope to achieve in the long term? Will reddit as we know it even be useful 5 years from now? 10 years from now? What if everyone lives in virtual reality and the standard of a scrolling Internet page with a mouse and keyboard disappears?   These are things to consider when you get to the core of what you hope to achieve not just with this website alone but with any project really. These are the questions I believe this post is hoping to ask and come towards an answer."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,beachsunflower,10,Thu Jul 16 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"Good point, well made.   I would observe that reddit had already changed enormously, one of those changes being that hate stuff in general has been added to the site. And if you were to step back far enough this discussion would be how to prevent reddit becoming what it is now, what the protesters are currently fighting to keep as a status quo.  Reddit changing is a matter of when you arrived and I guess I'm just not really seeing it from their perspective. That I joined what was essentially a computer social forum and ended up with edgy teens screaming in my ear is hardly worth setting in stone to me, but that's not to say the place became useless because it changed...and already became more commercial, I would add. Reddit gradually morphed as time went by and different pros outweighed different cons and I'm fine with that continuing.   I think there's an element of change as the enemy, rather than result.  Change. Just because I haven't said that word enough in this comment.  Change change change change change.   Heh heh heh."

Principally because it violates my rights as an individual when you start censoring speech you disagree with. No, not my right to speak (although it does violate that as well). It violates my right to listen. When you censor speech, you presume to tell me what speech I can and cannot listen to.  I will not have my thoughts be controlled.

People here are using ""free speech"" as a principle; the John Stuart Mill idea that open and free exchange is more powerful at combating bad thoughts than is simply banning those thoughts.   It actually does become a First Amendment argument, though, when you try to insist that a privately-owned website be required to host all kinds of speech, even speech that it finds abhorrent. Per Citizens United (though I do loathe most of the implications of that case), corporations are individuals with First Amendment rights, and they have a right to dedicate their resources to whatever speech they see fit and also to deny it to other things.   Mill's idea of a free and open exchange is amply protected by the fact that our government permits us to access a variety of websites. Reddit does not have to host all kinds of speech in order for all kinds of speech to exist; people fleeing any limitations Reddit imposes will go to alternatives and the Big Conversation can continue that way. Think of Reddit as an individual node in a network, Voat as another, Empeopled or whatever else have you as another. The ideal of free speech is not harmed by Reddit deciding not to host certain types of speech; there are still plenty of other places for people to have whatever conversations they want, people will still be able to find and comment on them and have exchange that way.    By letting people see how bad the ideas actually are, you can more effectively defeat them.   Yes, and we've had many, many years to see hate speech (and the actions it gives rise to), and many people are deciding that they've had enough. The fact that more and more websites are opting to restrict certain types of speech is evidence that those ideas, having been seen, are being defeated on their own lack of merit. That process entails it being seen less and less frequently, and that's a very good thing for those who would be the targets of people espousing hateful, violent speech.  Edit: a word"

I tend to agree with that latter group; the free speech experiment Reddit has hosted has led to some dangerous excesses. But both sides are having their say and Reddit will make a decision.   I just can't stand this whining about how people's ""free speech rights"" are being infringed by Reddit perhaps suggesting they'll shut down subreddits where you can watch people die or cheer on the murder and degradation of others. The people making this argument (and I'm speaking to people who are formulating their argument as, ""MY free speech rights are being infringed upon"") are not considering Reddit's free speech rights, only their own.

First, I was just following the formulation in your original post, when you suggested there would be a defeat of certain ideologies when brought into conversation with others. Did you not mean to imply (with the word defeat) that someday, a battle would be won, and certain ideas would become all but invisible? I mean, who out there (over the age of 3) still thinks the earth is flat? Ideas supersede and replace other ideas all the time, and the latter become footnotes in history.  Also, I don't think that certain ideas are worth sharing. Ideas that explicitly call for preemptive, offensive violence against others don't need to be debated, they're wrong and harmful. A world in which those ideas never came to anyone's mind would be a great one, in my opinion.    Sure other websites exist. But if Reddit wants to retain what I and many other people see as the characteristic that makes this site beautiful, I think it needs to be the bastion of free speech itself.

Censorship must be combated at every avenue, not just legal ones, or else one day that legal right may also fall under threat.  More over, it degrades society as a whole to have a tolerance for censorship, and excuse it on the basis of being ""legal"".

That's a pretty good description of the collective wisdom I've heard. Well. IMHO it has a lot more in common with Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Every redditor loves reddit and hates everyone that made reddit what it is. It's unbelievable.  I thought /u/yishan and /u/ekjp were both fools for ever accepting the job - If Reddit's CEO is to be beloved, he (yes, he) basically needs to be Chris Pratt. Admired and nonthreatening to men and women. White. Funny. Affable. Actual talent at making an organization function... totally irrelevant. That should be delegated. Basically, Yishan & Ellen could have, should have run Reddit much more successfully if they hired someone else to be the ""CEO"" and then called themselves the ""COO"" and actually made all the important internal decisions. Maybe it could work if the CEO were someone non famous but universally beloved, like Victoria or... Well, shit, a year ago I would have said Alexis Ohanian. Maybe it really does have to be a celebrity. My point is that it's about feelings, not competence.  The CEO needs to be able to call Reddit a bastion of free speech and convince everyone to laugh off the places where they crack down. Consider what communities Reddit has actually banned: brigadiers and literally illegal content. Somehow their user base is still in revolt. Their only error in this matter was PR. But I don't think this is because they said anything incorrect - it's just because their user base is INSANE. Given enough people, it's guaranteed that a huge number of those people will be unhinged idiots. The only solution way I can imagine resisting that would be to employ someone that those people love unconditionally. A white dude.  As far as I'm concerned, /u/spez is doing a great job so far. He fucked up with ONE COMMENT (sure, one comment contradicting the ideology of all the most vile agitators on the site) and he really should have known better. If he'd been more careful, he could have slowly made a case for Reddit having some other raison d'etre, something beyond being a place where literally anything goes. Honestly at this point it seems like the site is in such revolt that even if he hadn't said that, they'd have decided some other comment was just as offensive. So I think he's doing almost as well as possible.  The other alternative would be to hire someone openly antagonistic towards the cretins. Someone of their phyle, but still confrontational. Hire a neckbeard who curses and rages. ""You fags are guests in my home. Come at me bro. See what happens."" Maybe that's what would be necessary to turn around the narrative."

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,parlor_tricks,2,Fri Jul 17 05:04:11 2015 UTC,"The top comment should be :  I want reddit to be profitable enough to be left alone.  I'm on a damn mobile so it's hard to put down a week of thinking here, and it's wasted considering how late in the life of the topic this is.  Reddit admins have their heads too close to the metrics to see what the hell the site is.  It's a damn forum.   What they are missing , and what a lot of reddit users are figuring out, is ways to make communities work. Then using that to have fun, improve on hobbies or work.  Reddit needs to buy enough time to add the following tech to the site:  1) better mobile use  Site and community functionality:  2) a bounty or some system to let forum users provide reddit gold for doing something. A user sets a bounty for the whitest cat pic someone submits, or for the longest dick pick some one has, or whatever. But some mechanism to give fake kudos/gold to people who do minor simple tasks.  The over arching point is that there are several types of subs. Some subs are scalar subs: they don't have a direction of movement, they just accumulate content, fluff, cruft and arguments.  Vector subs on the other hand have topics which get stuff done. Posts which are fluff are useless, because they don't answer the question or move things forward. Mods have a strong reason to remove non conforming content. Let's build a chair, let's meet up, let's figure out how to support net neutrality. These are all vectors.  Things like ""Look at this funny cat pic"", ""I think this political party sucks !"" are scalar topics.  Vectors often involve doing real world work. They usually create/incentivize positive interactions through time pressure (there is a goal and a certain amount of mortal time in which to achieve it)  All of this helps build communities. This is what smaller subs are about, and it's what really is the heart of reddit, and what keeps veteran reddit users here.  Revenue linking to point 2: 3) let firms encash X amount of reddit gold for a coke, or protein bar, or whatever.  4) reduce the price of gold. It should be cheap and people should be using it like candy, or a glass of water.  Moderation:  5) in the long run; mods need to have less power, and subscribers should have more power to split off and have new subs discovered.  In the short term, mods need a hybrid-ticketing system, awareness of who and what is brigading them, brigading as a whole should be stalled from the back end, or google engineers hired to build the algorithms which will protect forum from drive by Downvoting/up voting. Brigading is a bitch, and it's not solvable by simple means but by detecting patterns of user behavior and then applying a valve to modify the impact on the target forum.  Reddit as a whole needs to upgrade it's tech stack. They have google search level problems being dealt with by wordpress level support. I feel for the coders and the code base.  Most of the moderation and user behavior issues cannot be solved without pattern Identification,  user behavior fingerprinting, and a goddamn vault to ensure this type of tech doesn't get abused.  This again underlines the inherent contradiction of the site - we need tools to shut people up so that others can have the right to dissent and speak freely.   The simplistic understanding of free speech used by many to subvert the freedom of others results in far too many Hobson's choices by the admins. Bringing me to the next point   Free speech:  They admins may well need to hire a judge or lawyer to codify for the site what the point of free speech is, the spirit of the code, from which the letter of the law will apply.  tldr   I want the admins to say we are in the business of making communities make themselves succeed. We are building a platform that helps you set reward and recognize tasks and govern yourself. We are hard at work on mobile, and we think most mobile input sucks right now, we may well be partnering with people to allow text to speech.  We are going to give mods a better ticketing system, and in the long term we have plans to reduce the work mods need to do, and give communities the ability to self manage more tasks. We are going to study online communities and teach reddit about what we learn. Finally: We fucked up, and will continue to fuck up. Please forgive us out sins, and we hope you learn from our fuck ups. Matter of fact we hope to drop corp speak and just fuck up in plain and simple English.    A lot of this post includes ideas which are never going to reach production: (text to speech). The point is to highlight pain points and force myself to put some form of solution towards them."

Women, as linked in the previous sentence, and confirmed by everday experience, are mentally ill upon birth to navigate the sexual market place without acheiving cognitive dissonance. There's no other way to put it. If men had the mindset as described above, they would be deemed crazy. Dont sugar coat it with the word 'differences'.  They want to be inferior. You do not tell them this, you treat them like that. You just 'get it'. Being better than a woman is not something to take pride in, this is expected of you.   Substitute women for Black people or Jews and this  post will fit in perfectly in r/Coontown or r/GastheKikes. This kind of misogyny is poisonous and vile and only serves to rile up angry young men and also spur angry reactions from SRS, making Reddit a more hateful and bigoted place in general. Allow free speech, but not bigotry. A little bit of bigotry will proliferate and spur more bigotry and anti-TRP  hate subs."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,Mylittleponee,9,Fri Jul 17 08:29:02 2015 UTC,"See, I do think that constitutes free speech though. And you're free to debate them. It probably wouldn't do any good because their minds are made up and their beliefs are fucking toxic IMO. And if you did choose to debate them and they started doxing or harassing you, reddit's anti-harassment policy should take care of it accordingly. I don't really see the harm in those communities existing, as long as they remain contained to that community.   That being said, I really don't care either way if reddit wants to be a bastion of free speech or not. If they don't want to host those subreddits, they can get rid of TRP and similar anti-whatever subs and it won't affect me in the slightest. They'll only go somewhere else (I guess Voat); it's not going to change their minds or anything. It will probably only strengthen their beliefs, as they'll blame women and the evil SJW's for persecuting them.   But if reddit is going to close down polarizing subreddits it should be made very clear what is allowed and what isn't. I don't know how to draw those lines."

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,N7_Cmdr,4,Thu Jul 16 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"If the post you quoted was made in pretty much any mainstream sub other than TRP, it would have (at the very least) garnered more discussion on the topic, offered some more viewpoints and scientific articles, and the voting patterns would have probably been reversed.  In my view, this illustrates exactly why we shouldn't ban communities and individuals with these viewpoints.  By sectioning off TRP and forcing them to discuss their ideology in isolation, all that's happening is their most obscene viewpoints are being reinforced.  They don't even have to try to temper their viewpoints to stand up to criticism when they can just jerk each other off isolation.  Do you want these opinions to disappear?  Banning these types from reddit isn't going to stop them from spreading their propaganda.  Put their ideology up on display to be discussed, deconstructed, and publicly exposed for the heaping pile of bullshit that it is.  I know you don't think there's any point in arguing with the craziest of crazies, but keep in mind that the majority of redditors are lurkers who are cruising through the comments and reading content, reading the different viewpoints and trying to figure out where they stand.  You're usually not trying to convince the crazies, you're trying to convince the audience."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,Mylittleponee,3,Thu Jul 16 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"I mean yeah, I meant that free speech grants you the right to debate with them, not the right to actually have them hear you out. I even said it's basically useless to try because they are so aggressively opposed to anyone telling them they're wrong.   So you're free to just ignore them. That's what I do. I find their views hateful, usually factually inaccurate, and toxic. But I literally never see anything related to TRP because I don't go there.   This is why I really don't care whether reddit takes down all hateful subs, allows all of them, or just choose to effectively go after individuals who leave their community to harass others or otherwise violate reddit's rules. I'm interested in the discussion, in figuring out the best way to go about this, but I'm personally pretty neutral on it all. I respect both all kinds of free speech (even the kinds i think are reprehensible and wrong) and reddit's right as a company to do what it sees as the best option."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,N7_Cmdr,2,Thu Jul 16 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"I don't want to ignore them. You know what happens when you turn away and allow a hate group(E.g. Jihadists, Taliban, nazis which got into power with 37% of the vote in an election that had low turnout, KKK lynch mobs) in your country to grow? History says that shit hits the fan. Reddit is not a country but it is an online society and these groups have shown time and time again that they brigade other subreddits, get into flame wars with other bigoted hate subs and atttract the worst kinds of people to join Reddit(I imagine this is like all the people who go to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS) because their hate forum is most highly visible and accessible here on Reddit. It leads to a decline in the overall quality of the Reddit experience just like how allowing religious fundamentalists in your society creates unnecessarily divisive anger, fear and paranoia. Over time it turns Reddit into a cesspool that attracts bigots away from other forums because Reddit is a stronghold of bigots."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,SomeCalcium,3,Thu Jul 16 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of those subreddits will do nothing to erase those beliefs, though. Arguably having the communities here, where the members can be exposed to dissenting views, is better than every single hateful group moving to Voat and creating an echo chamber.  Reddit should probably work harder to police users who are breaking rules, harassing people, doxing, etc. But I personally haven't experienced or even witnessed that much of it. Perhaps I'm just not paying attention to it.

It may grow elsewhere, but it will not grow here. Subreddits do not exist in a vacuum. The people who visit these subs do not solely occupy their subs.   As a mod, I frequently run into these users. Not just because they may be trolls, but they may be using a particular thread on your subreddit as a soapbox, or they may find an opinion that they disagree with and harass the user who makes it. You simply do not know when someone from these subs are going to stalk a user that frequents your subreddit, make an off-color racist remark, or use your subreddit to push their agenda to a larger audience.  A good example would be /r/videos. /r/videos is often targeted by these subs since their moderation team is more lax about the material posted there. It is not entirely uncommon for a race-baiting type video to be posted in that sub and the OP to be a frequent visitor of something like /r/coontown.   Eliminating those subs means that those people will no longer be able to see reddit as a place where their ideas are safe. They will no longer be able to use their subreddits as a launching point to push their ideals on unrelated subreddits.  Free speech is fine, but the idea that these subreddits are self-contained is false. Whether we like to admit it or not, reddit has a serious problem with racism, misogyny, and general site-wide discrimination. It does need to be addressed."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,whitefalconiv,2,Thu Jul 16 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think eliminating these subs is going to eliminate the users from the site.  Someone posted proof in one of the meta subs a few months ago of the dudes over at Stormfront discussing various ways to manipulate reddit to get their viewpoints upvoted, disguised in scientific jargon.  Which makes sense; reddit is a big site, it's only natural that groups like that would see this place as fertile breeding ground to recruit new members.  I don't think banning them is gonna stop anything, they're only going to find craftier ways to toe the line and follow the rules to the letter while sneaking their viewpoints into every place sub they can.  Put their bullshit up on display so users can see it alongside the other viewpoints and come to the conclusion themselves.  Let them mingle with everyone else so their viewpoints can be exposed for what they are.  Pretending these viewpoints don't exist isn't solving anything, it's just making the average user ill-prepared for the day they're finally faced with some long, pseudo-scientific yet carefully worded and convincing post espousing one of these ideologies, and no one will be there to refute it."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,N7_Cmdr,5,Thu Jul 16 19:48:12 2015 UTC,"You don't have to debate them.  Why even pay them any attention?  They can say whatever they want, but you don't have to listen to them.  You can (like I and I'd assume most people) choose to ignore them, because paying attention to their bullshit is why people like WBC are still doing their shit at funerals, because people pay attention.  Freedom of speech isn't the same as freedom to force other people to listen to what you have to say.  How about this middle ground idea? Make it so you have to be subscribed to a subreddit that is marked as ""unfriendly"" or whatever in order to see the content in the first place? Unless you subscribe, all you can see is the sidebar and maybe the sticky posts as a new user introduction to see if it's the kind of place you wanna go.  Don't allow links to comments on those subs, either, or auto-link links to the /r/subreddit.  Let the FPH and the TRP and all the other racists and bigots have their own private little spot where they can exercise all the free bile-ridden speech they want, while the rest of us never have to even acknowledge their existence.  Because free speech DOES mean you have to include the bad in order to get the good, and most people have both good and bad aspects.  Someone can be the worst racist in the world but if he's the best, say, woodworker on the planet, and contributes content of value to /r/woodworking, but then leaves reddit if/when /r/CoonTown is banned, then /r/woodworking loses a valuable contributor, and othersitethatismuchlikeredditbutallowsracism.com gains a valuable woodworker and thus gains some more legitimacy.  You're never going to be able to debate a racist or a bigot or a homophobe, you're never going to change their minds, so it always comes down to two people yelling at each other."

Reddit would still get to have a set of ""values"" they abide by, while still allowing users outside of that set of values to have their freedom, while making sure they can't harass people with their beliefs, and those who would be offended literally can't/don't have to see it at all unless they subscribe."

Freedom of thought, and freedom to express those thoughts. Free speech is not free speech if ""bigoted"" speech is banned.  Virtuous speech is only virtuous when it is not compelled. That necessitates the freedom to speak bigoted speech."

News flash, if you are a piece of shit people don't want to be around you, and that includes Reddit. The worst redditors are suddenly facing the same treatment that they would face if they actually expressed their hatred in real life, in that they are facing the social consequences for their views."

They appeal to a lowest common denominator within society, people who sit around obessesed with women and hating them and trying to prove how alpha they are all the time are not people capable of snapping out of their basal animalistic desires to focus on logic, science(not broscience) or other socially beneficial or more worthwhile ideas and pursuits."

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,jesuslovesmeslowly,4,Thu Jul 16 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"Not really. TRP is extremely proud of how amoral their dating and manipulation strategy is. So amoral that they encourage cheating with other men's wives because they think those men deserve it for not being Alpha enough.   Ultimately they are not only preaching misogyny, they are saying that every man needs to be the most Alpha man in the room(off topic: we know this is not possible because an alpha is another word for the leader people look to, not something you can aspire to become by artificial means or manipulation. Leaders like Obama, Merkel or Putin did not spend their time studying How to be Alpha sex strategies in their youth, they went to school and got a non-bro science education and became leaders of their industry) to dominate other men who are not alpha enough or are beta, omega or whatever. They encourage the cuckolding of other men and treat other less alpha men as competition for pussy or belittle them for being unalpha. My husband has met people like this in real life, they are constantly trying to prove how much better they are than other guys in front of those guys' girlfriends while trying to act like they are above women.

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,whitefalconiv,3,Thu Jul 16 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"Again this is a huge generalization and not at all scientific. The statement that sexual strategy is amoral doesn't mean that actions are amoral. There's actually been a huge debate in the sub, but the mods recently took a position in that debate that moral arguments about sexual strategy are impermissible (thus neither moral criticism nor moral praise belongs in the sub). I think they did this to prevent entryist feminist discourse from being in the sub, but I ultimately disagree as morality is significant to me and I disagree with banning avenues of discourse.  If getting laid is one of your goals in a social situation, then some of this behavior makes sense, assuming TRP principles.

How can they be exposed to differing views which gradually change their perspective over time?   To me, reddit is a great example of democracy at work (minus the government). People able to share information, debate those ideas, and then interact with the world more informed than they were before. Censoring ideas limits one's ability to grow as a person by having access to all available information.

First off, Elliot wasn't close to RP. He was a bitter and angry young man who believed women should be forced to have sex with him. TRP is very big on letting the women ultimately decide on sex. Secondly, there was a thread a week before the Elliot shooting in TRP about how this guy is mentally messed up and needs help. TRP was against this guy before any of this shit happen. Just a lot of people from TBP decided to blame TRP for this guy.    I have seen US gun violence being blamed on feminism and posts praising Sharia law or telling men not to promote women upvoted.

We complain about Exxon and Nestle not being good corporate citizens.  I think I would lump reddit right along with them.

Though the piss-poor communication from Reddit admins isn't helping anything.

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,maddata,9,Fri Jul 17 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily have a problem with outright hate speech being censored... but there needs to be clear and obvious reason.  For instance, do we need a forum for holocaust denial?  Racist pseudoscience?  The real question is where does the censorship stop?  Because if we're already calling the idea of sharing content that has a negative outlook on obesity censor-worthy hate speech, the bar is set pretty damn high.  Will the advertising dollars balk at the presence of exmormon / excult communities?  What about a satanist subreddit?  What about bdsm, or subreddits dedicated to doing hard drugs?  The problem is that I think with the bar set so high, you're risking the alienation of a critical mass of reddit users who will then be looking for the first good alternative to re-establish a content sharing community.  Sure, few of us participate in coontown, but I'm sure every one of us (reddit users that comment/vote/participate) visits at least one 'questionable' subreddit that might be getting the axe soon."

One of the admins (or it might've been u/ekjp, I'll try to find the post) said that as long as things are contained to the subreddit in question everything will be fine.

TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,N7_Cmdr,2,Thu Jul 16 14:59:58 2015 UTC,"The clear problem with their statements   actions not ideas  subreddit was harassing   is that they made a bot to ban out any successor subreddits.  It's not like a five minute old subreddit can send brigades... there's no chance for another community with similar focus as /r/fatpeoplehate to ever come back, because they are against the idea behind it.  The whole fatpeoplehate fiasco was really more a result of them lying to the userbase than anything else.  The truth   FPH being the 13th most active subreddit is a big problem for reddit's image, so we cant support it.   is a lot more palatable than   4 random nearly inactive and userless subs plus fatpeoplehate were banned because they are hate subs.   ...while ignoring some of the worst hate subs, as well as having incorrectly identified a small community called /r/neofag as a hate sub.  But that brings up another point -- if /r/watchpeopledie for instance gets a big enough following, or some media coverage, will they axe that sub?

I guess one could assume that if the FPH community were permitted to regroup, they would be even bigger than before (because of the controversy; wouldn't shock me if people who weren't subscribed before might get involved), and would soon after start brigading/harassing out of spite. But if they aren't given a chance there's no way to know.   While I personally don't care if a community with a similar ""focus"" as FPH comes back or not (because I do see it as hateful; it's right there in the name of the sub... but it didn't bother me when it was here and it doesn't bother me being gone) I do want reddit to be very clear about what they'll support and what they won't.

Should individual users be punished somehow instead? Should the admins issue a sort of ""warning"" to a sub to get its more vocal subscribers to keep things contained better, or else they'll have to be shut down? Should the admins take a completely ""laissez-faire"" approach?  I don't know at all. No matter what happens there's always a group of very vocal users who are displeased, to say the least. I think at the end of the day, reddit is just another business and they get to make whatever call they think is best for the company. But that's a fine line to walk when they risk alienating so many of their users, and reddit would be nothing without them (us). They have some really tough decisions to make.   E: Why the downvote? If you disagree with something I said, explain why. Explain what changes, if any, you would prefer.

If the mods are not doing their duty in banning harassing/doxxing users (assuming proof) then admin action is required. If the mods themselves are harassing/doxxing users, then there is perhaps no hope for the community. This last one is probably where /r/fatpeoplehate went afoul (specifically with the imgur staff photos), and perhaps deserved the sub ban (though I think clearer outlines for what constitutes harassment would have avoided the situation in the first place)."

I think that the slurs Reddit should first concern itself with are those that have the most and worst history; calling someone a GamerGater doesn't rise to that level. I don't think that names related to political ideologies rise to that level in general, since people largely choose those.

What do you mean by ""certain types of people""? Is promoting violence against anyone acceptable? What if you say you wish all of ____'s elected officials would die?   Promoting violence against anyone is totally unacceptable; however, generally it's only hate groups that do it on a regular basis, and they usually have specific targets, so I was describing that phenomenon, not saying that there are people against whom it's ok to promote violence.

An evolution of the idea in media that fathers are normally incompetent or 'less good' than any other 'adjusted' member of the family.  Just because they are (white) Straight males they get knocked to the bottom on the peg when it comes to socializing.  Their opinions are wrong, their wisdom does not matter, etc and so forth.

Just because people are new to being top social dog does not mean they should catch up in all the mudslinging, and two wrongs do not make a right.

So I just assume every racist is trying to be hyperbolic on the side of good until he actually hits me in the face or bombs my church or lights a cross in my yard.

In the AMA /u/spez said that /r/rapingwomen would be banned, since it promotes violence, but /r/coontown would only be partially banned (hidden) since it's undesirable but not violence oriented.   How does that fit under what you're saying here? /r/rapingwomen isn't targeting a specific person, but is rather merely pro violence in general (to my knowledge, anyway)."
TheoryOfReddit,3dhuq7,Joke_Insurance,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"Some people are of the opinion that raping women is cool, and some people get off on rape fantasies and thinking about it and talking about it. The interest in it generates a conversation, but hiding the conversation doesn't make the opinions go away. Someone who wants the conversation to not be able to take place in a public forum is just pushing it out of sight, out of mind, even though the opinions are still out there. Yes it is upsetting that there are people like that, and yes it makes me feel less safe knowing that, but nobody is actually being harmed except through their own sheer disgust at the topic. But threatening people personally and making them feel unsafe in their own homes is a much more intimate violation. ""I think rape is fine"" is a much different sentiment than ""I am going to find you and rape you"""

I want it to be a place where not only discussion but also different types of discussion can thrive.  As it is now, I never confront much hate speech because it doesn't occur in the subreddits I participate in.  And if it did, I would simply leave those subreddits, perhaps starting my own on those topics.  This is the beauty of Reddit.  Users participate in their selected subreddits.  There is no cost to leave those subreddits.  Over time, this self-selects for subreddits that serve the needs of their users.  Keeping Reddit relatively unregulated allows this type of movement between discussions.  Instead of clamoring for the universal, site-wide banning of a user or a subreddit, people start their own, better subreddits where they can freely ban that user or set the terms of the debate.  I understand that this doesn't do much for the people who just want to look at the default subreddits and have those communities serve their specific needs.  But that's not what Reddit should be about.  What makes Reddit beautiful is the flourishing of innumerable microcommunities, peacefully coexisting and, occasionally, sharing ideas across the entire site.  Those communities exist precisely because of different interests and values.  tl;dr: A hands off approach will allow the site to display its best qualities"

In which ways do you think your notion conflicts with the majority of (active; those who are actively voting and not mostly lurking) reddit users?

TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,PrivateChicken,2,Thu Jul 16 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"I think you might actually be, coincidentally, taking my response too literally. That's what I meant by my answer. I suppose I could be viewing things too much from my perception, but things like FPH being banned was inevitably around the corner if reddit wanted to maintain a good image. I imagine more of that type of thing will follow again. I'm not trying to say I predicted that ban specifically, but I am saying it didn't surprise me, for a number of reasons. I believe it likely didn't for many of us.   All said, though, this is not unprecedented behavior. I think any users who have been around for 4+ years remembers a few other very large, questionable subreddits that were banned following bad press or that possibility. Reddit as a whole has changed basically in every vein from 7 years ago, for very similar reasons  Reddit has always been a business, but it's culture has changed. I think a lot of people realize this, and the loud minority is making the site as a whole look ignorant about the realities of large websites, while the silent majority recognize it's a growing business and could have a very in depth discussion about a lot of the issues ""the front page"" rarely scratches.

TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,WeenisWrinkle,25,Fri Jul 17 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"Let's take a step back. What problem are you trying to solve? So far, Reddit has only banned a handful of subreddits that I can't imagine any non-profit wanting to spend money to host. Are you just annoyed that anyone is making profit or is there an actual harmful act that you want to prevent?  Keep in mind, the same thing that Reddit is doing to make profit (having ads) might be the same things that would be done to fund a non-profit. I appreciate the example you listed, Wikipedia, not having ads ... but I am also not convinced that having ads on Reddit is a significant problem (nor is it incompatible with being a non-profit)."
TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,WeenisWrinkle,7,Thu Jul 16 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"I read in a another sub that this was a fight between two elephants: the mods and the admins, and that the users were just the grass.  Some mods were painting themselves as the martyrs who had worked for this cause of freedom and the corporate overlords were taking it all away, etc.  The truth is that the mods do benefit, if not directly, and it was clear in the statement explaining the re-opening of /r/askscience.  In that case it was about being able to speak at various institutions and promote science, all good, but it benefits the mods professionally as well.  It may be different for each mod.  Remember that Reddit was born from the Digg rebellion, where just a few users consistently made it to the front page.  SEO is a big business, and Reddit can be used for that purpose, and likely is by some.  I think this is a big part of requesting to know how Reddit works... some people want to game it.  Other mods are obviously pushing an ideological agenda.  It is almost impossible to browse Reddit and not come across someone throwing the acronym ""SJW."""
TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,za3keaxi,3,Thu Jul 16 06:48:56 2015 UTC,...eh the proposed benefits for moderators are a lot hazier and contingent than that of Reddit.  Fundamentally Reddit is getting free labor. That's tons of cash in wages they don't have to pay.  What does a moderator get besides fuzzy feelings? If they're a large sub then you could argue there's the potential for them to leverage influence. But a minority of moderators both moderate subs that large and have a distinct agenda. So it's poor compensation. There's no inherent benefit to moderation. It's still anonymous volunteer work by default.
TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,za3keaxi,-5,Thu Jul 16 13:59:40 2015 UTC,"Actually I think that's a good point. I don't think the current state of reddit isn't as bad as some people portray it to be.  I don't have much of a problem with /r/fatpeoplehate being banned either if it's really the case that the mods of it incited off-site campaigns etc. It doesn't give you a good prospect for the future though when that's coming from a renowned feminist which are not best known for tolerating other views and political incorrectness. And for the dismissal of Taylor: things like that would probably be needed for a nonprofit in the same way as it is now for reducing costs (even though I really doubt that it was needed).  So I think the previous errors were probably mostly of communicative nature. Not discussions things prior, not properly explaining things, not anticipating how sensitive central parts of the community are to these issues etc. etc. (again: not sure about the Taylor thing)  So all in all this might not be an issue as pressuring as I thought at first hand. The current state of affairs doesn't tell much of what's yet to come though.

I think it's remarkably premature to assume there will be any subs banned simply because they're controversial, given that the only decisions that have actually been made have been perfectly reasonable. I still don't understand where your claim about feminism came from. If you don't have a single example of something having to do with gender or sexism, then you are basically just repeating slanderous comments made about her.   deleting posts concerned with her lawsuit   Most of the deleted posts listed there were in totally inappropriate subreddits for news about Ellen Pao, such as /r/funny, /r/JusticePorn, and /r/worldnews (which does not cover US news). At the time of the complaining post, it was already at the top of /r/news, which would be the logical subreddit for it. Keep in mind, the mods delete submissions, not admins. In any model, there are still subreddit moderators.  Most importantly, there is zero indication (let alone evidence) that any Reddit employees/admins used any influence (let alone technical capabilities) to have any posts regarding Ellen Pao deleted.

Wikipedia works because it doesn't have all the comments and constant refreshing to deal with.  It also doesn't really suffer from popularity spikes.  So, point being - the amount of money that it costs to run a site like Reddit is beyond what can be done in a non-profit manner.

However (I'm not sure about this though) reddit gold could also be used by a nonprofit.  Wikipedia has far more traffic than reddit in general though (which is however cancelled out as it receives far more donations than reddit could ever hope to receive; even when including reddit gold and alike).  Maybe there's also a way to have it operate on a peer-to-peer manner to drastically reduce costs.

Reddit's burn rate is way higher than that.  Employees alone are more than that, never mind server costs.   Wikipedia has far more traffic than reddit in general though    Wikipedia gets more users, but it doesn't necessarily get more load.    The average daily Wikipedia user probably reads 1-2 pages from a google search and then moves on.  The average daily Reddit user is probably reading 10-20 links, with a healthy dose of users refreshing the comments section repeatedly.  And some of those huge long posts with thousands of comments generates pretty hefty page sizes.  Also Wikipedia isn't nearly as dynamic - it's basically nothing but static text with the occasional modifications.  Reddit is constantly pulling up dynamic data in the comments, posts, algorithms, user karma, upvotes/downvotes, etc, etc.  That all takes a lot more horsepower.  We obviously don't have the real numbers, but even if Wikipedia's monthly user traffic is 3x Reddit, it wouldn't surprise me if the load generated by Reddit is 10x or more that of Wikipedia.   Maybe there's also a way to have it operate on a peer-to-peer manner to drastically reduce costs.

He is also in a sub dedicated to in depth meta discussion of Reddit. You shouldn't just be focused on whats made it to the top here and strive to find the content already here and contribute to it.

TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,HeartyBeast,0,Thu Jul 16 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"I wasn't thinking about it in terms of P2P but in terms of various subreddits hosting their own content on community funded servers and reddit acting instead as a regulating body over a large network of separate but uniform community sites.  These separate sites all have their content showcased on the main reddit site, but the community section and subreddits themselves are hosted on the community sites.  It could be setup in a way that users can create subreddits hosted by reddit, but as soon as they hit some arbitrary threshold, either the users need to pay directly to reddit to cover hosting costs, or they can host the subreddit themselves.  Obviously there would need to be clearly defined rules concerning what a separate community site is allowed to look like/do in order for it to be linked to from reddit proper and there's always the risk that these separate sites might host illegal content or viruses, but I think a no-tolerance policy and a few examples of community sites getting cut off from reddit proper would cut down on a lot of scams."

Having dealt with many non-profits myself they are about the same as any Fortune 500 out there; the company gets big and they begin to divide into departments and divisions. These departments, in non-profit or for-profit, have budget goals and need to demonstrate growth/value. This means that they need to show increased revenue or decreased cost.  You may think that 'but they only need to cover their costs, there's no need to be so money driven' but that's not how it works. We have projects, capital campaigns, and staffing needs that can all be fulfilled sooner if we can increase the revenue for this FY just a little bit. So NFP orgs will still be as revenue driven as any other company. Nothing really changes."
TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,chip_0,8,Wed Jul 15 23:38:31 2015 UTC,"The better showcase of a working example would be 4chan. 4chan is essentially a non-profit in that the entire site is run at a fiscal loss- it only makes money through J-list and user ads, as well as 4chan passes. However, 4chan is not supposed to be profitable, it's supposed to be, in theory, a place where unfiltered, uncensored communication is possible (in practice it obviously comes up short). If Reddit took the 4chan model in mind and focused on staying active as a private project rather than a for-profit company, then you'd have a situation where the users would be happy and the owners wouldn't need to be as fixated on the bottom line."
TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,xiongchiamiov,7,Thu Jul 16 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, just download the source code, buy a domain, pay a host, spend hours of frustration with technical details, and presto! You have a Reddit clone. If it gets popular, you now have to figure out a way to fund it.  The Wikipedia community is committed to the core principles (five pillars) but the subreddits are committed to their own sidebar guidelines. Reddit also has rules, but these aren't rules that bind the community into anything coherent. The Wikipedia rule on neutral point of view does bind the community and really forces divergent points of view to come together. Reddit takes the opposite approach: if you don't want to be exposed to a subreddit's community, then don't go there.  The main thing holding Reddit together is the technical hurdles in administration / lack of technical sophistication of the moderators. If something were to somehow lower this barrier, the Reddit communities would split up into several independent news aggregation and discussion sites based on shared principles.  The main reason why /r/blackladies and /r/coontown put up with being on the same domain is they know the domain owner is in it for the money. The corresponding communities on Wikipedia know the domain owner is in it for the neutral point of view. If making money becomes a problem, then I would expect these two communities to migrate to different domains because news and speech is, by its nature, politically volatile, and the domain owner must ultimately be held responsible for the content it allows on its site."

TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,adminbeast,3,Wed Jul 15 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that that is true.  Reddit supports itself through ad revenue and reddit gold but that isn't incompatible with a non-profit, just non-profits that oppose the use of ad revenue to support their operations.  In fact, if all that revenue was shoveled back into the site eg. buy more servers and everything else that is needed for things to run smoothly here instead of worrying about how to squeeze more profil out of the site, things are a bit simpler/easier in a way.  The problem is that if Reddit were non-profit, you wouldn't be able to make use of capital from investors to expand site operations but that's balanced by the flexibility not to have to wring as much money out of this place as possible before the golden goose keels over and dies."

That includes stuff as varied as TVtropes, Encyclopedia Dramatica, and the UESP. The only thing I can think of that was every even close to Wikipedia's mission was H2G2, and that was more of a half joking attempt to make a real hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy than a real attempt to compete with Wikipedia.

TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,nwob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:15:59 2015 UTC,"Good points. However imo enforced politeness is not something that needs to be done if donations come from the userbase and if those are enough for reddit being independent off government and institutional funds. Not sure if it's possible to cause a stream of userbased donations large enough to finance it though. But reddit gold is essentially a donation as well so maybe when keeping that it could work out. And there might also be other ways. For instance development-efforts could be ""crowdfunded"". e.g. there could be something like /r/ideasfortheadmins where developers estimate the amount of time needed for each request and the users set their money on those, with the requests being implemented if it reached the threshold. (Note that the incentive for donations is significantly increased by the proximity of its effect - people donate less to things far away for which they get no feedback / no means of observing the effects the donations.)  All of it would mean pioneering a new way of financing, which is something really hard to do but eventually possible (Wikipedia did it).   Yeah, no. A decentralized system means a system which holds child pornography in at least some of its tentacles.   Yes I guess there currently aren't the technological means to implement it. What I meant was a peer-to-peer model that reduces central costs but doesn't imply fully decentralized rules etc. To give you a rough idea of what I meant: it might have some central databases or user-run ""supernodes"" with all the peer-to-peer nodes just providing users with reddit's content and taking up users' content but not being in the position of controlling the content itself. (Note that it would probably require browsers to allow for such new types of websites by which the users become p2p nodes)   (You would adopt standards of behaviour and use which explicitly prohibit such use? Cool; so your ""decentralized"" system is actually totally centralized.)   Yes it would have many essential centralized elements. But those could be directed by consensus.  But yes, reddit going non-profit would be really hard - these are just some ideas towards that direction of which some might not be useful at all or in the near future."

They contribute to other subs besides those and those contributions are appreciated by someone. If there was such a person who is a misogynist and nothing else, then perhaps there would be little place for them here. But there is no such person, and the fact that a certain sin is in vogue right now does not mean everyone who commits it is a worthless wretch with no value in any arena or context.  Second, it is better to give those impulses an outlet and an empathetic ear than to force them to try to find satisfaction by disrupting other subs and other users' experiences.

Lots of people use the fact that some people are racists as an excuse to hate them.

Because you want to feel superior to racists and sexists in the same way they presumably feel superior to black people and women. Racists are people too. You're not above them until you act better than they do, and performing the same hatred as they do under a more honorable-sounding ""cause"" doesn't cut it.

I think TRP/CT users keep mostly to their own subs, only occasionally leaving to spew hate in other communal spaces.  But even if they did make some worthwhile contribution elsewhere, I don't think that excuses their continued presence.  We still put people in jail despite them no doubt being a positive contribution to someone's life.  It could really come down to a utilitarian calculus - is this person providing a net benefit to the site?    I also don't think racism or sexism have been 'in vogue' for decades - belittling it as a temporary fashion choice is intellectually dishonest.  Coontown is morally abhorrent, not 'in vogue to hate'.  Your 'outlet and an empathetic ear' sounds like a therapy session.  What subreddits and online communities like CT and TRP could just as easily be cast as is echo chambers in which users have their beliefs reconfirmed and double down on them as a result.  It makes them more entrenched. Sure, repression doesn't work but confrontation and deconstruction might.   Rule #2 is ""if it bothers you, it reminds you of you.""   lol - this is just ridiculous.  I know racists are mistaken, but in the age of the internet, being wrong is no longer a defensible position.  They're not medieval surfs who will never see a non-white person or read a book.  They have the whole of collected human knowledge at their fingertips, they can read every prominent work of black philosophy written in the last 200 years if they wanted to.  In the sense that any of us are truly 'responsible' for the knowledge we do or don't have, they are as responsible as any of the rest of us.  To paint the desire to merely not host coontown on a website you support as being equivalent to the rapid loathing that they feel towards non-white people is bizarre, as is the assumption that being against racism and sexism is rooted in some need for moral superiority.

In the sense that any of us are truly 'responsible' for the knowledge we do or don't have, they are as responsible as any of the rest of us.   That's a great point, but if they're too busy coping with their immediate emotional needs because they lacked something important growing up (or now), which is the norm rather than the exception for modern western life, they may not ever have been free to educate themselves rationally and coolly about black philosophy. Maslow's hierarchy of needs -- if they've been fighting for emotional survival their whole lives, they're going to use the internet for that first, and for earnest philosophical enrichment second.  Perhaps someone grew up in violent neighborhoods where the black kids hated the white kids, beat them up -- then the kid moved to a more integrated area, referred to a black kid using a racial slur one time, and then was outcast by his new friends and hated for being racist, which only made him more intent on preserving the last shards of his dignity by holding onto his racist views until someone came along and told him it wasn't his fault he felt that way, and patiently helped him know it was safe to see things differently. That kid's not going to go on the internet to enlighten himself about black people -- he's going to save his pride first, which might make things worse before they get better, but pride is less destructive than shame, which would destroy him if he continued to be shunned. The point is, you don't know the story -- you just know one tiny, superficial fact, and you judge this person's entire life on this one recent thought they had, with no concern for how it may have arisen.

To paint the desire to merely not host coontown on a website you support as being equivalent to the rapid loathing that they feel towards non-white people is bizarre, as is the assumption that being against racism and sexism is rooted in some need for moral superiority.   The person I responded to, /u/dkjb, wrote that under no circumstances would they support a website that hosts KiA, or /r/KotakuInAction, a sub that voices dissent with regard to the reactivity of the ""-ism police."" They are not remotely associated with CT or any hate sub. They're a moderately thoughtful sub composed mostly of people who are against racism and sexism as much as anybody else, only they don't make a lifestyle out of condemning it from on high, and resent those who do for very sound reasons. I am painting /u/dkjb's characterization of that subreddit as ""racism and misogyny"" as a straw man that betrays a loathing of racists and misogynists. (That loathing happens also to be similar to that of racists and misogynists, in that the poster clearly has no understanding of those whom s/he hates (meaning the users of /r/KiA), but that's a separate issue.)  I would not paint the desire merely to not host CT as equivalent to rapid loathing; that's a position that can be held perfectly reasonably. However, it's not the position /u/dkjb  was expressing, and thus not the one I was responding to or ""painting.""   lol - this is just ridiculous.   You'd be surprised.   the assumption that being against racism and sexism is rooted in some need for moral superiority   Being against racism and sexism is not necessarily rooted in some need for moral superiority. Hating racists and sexists, however, is.   Neither of them really change the fact, though, that we are under no moral obligation to struggle with these people to dissolve their hate for non-white people/women/whatever.   That can be debated to some extent, but I agree in general -- we are under no moral obligation to struggle with these people. So lay it down -- let them have their space, and go about your business.

TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,Stukya,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:06:47 2015 UTC,"Speaking of empirical premises, what observations lead you to that conclusion?   I use a mass tagger that periodically tags everyone who comments on a particular set of subs with that sub's name, so when people from TRP, for example, comments outside of their sub it's pretty obvious.  Of course, confirmation bias and all the rest lead me to be at least somewhat skeptical about what I'm about to say, but I've never seen a TRP commenter make a positive contribution to a discussion elsewhere on the site.   We put people in jail for hurting people, not for hating people. (On occasions where people are harassed, I think it should be dealt with through real-world legal channels.)   The analogy only goes so far.  I'm not suggesting imprisoning people who post on TRP because they post on TRP - I'm suggesting that if they do some good on the site that may not be enough to cancel out their negative impacts, and I would argue that this is the case for the majority of these people.   It's not that racism and sexism are a temporary fashion choice -- condemning their practitioners are. It's the ""Sinners, repent!"" of a secular society.   Hmm.  I'll have to think somewhat more about this, though from my perspective up on the moral high ground /s it seems to me that 'political correctness' (I hate the term but can't think of a more apt summary) is far from having beaten the pushback against it.   It's perfectly possible to believe this without regarding its members as sub-human.   I agree on this point, for sure.   That's a great point ... racists are people too.   I think I broadly agree with what you say here - that people who dedicate their time to a hate-community on the internet are unlikely to be so out of whimsy and that a deeper-rooted psychological problem is more likely to be the cause.   Being against racism and sexism is not necessarily rooted in some need for moral superiority. Hating racists and sexists, however, is.   Again, that's something I can agree with.  I don't think hate gets us anywhere.   KiA   If I was dividing the reddit community into 'people I actively want ejected from the site at high velocity' and 'people I merely disagree with', KiA would most likely fall into the latter, while being somewhat close to the border.  I have little sympathy for people who complain about the -ism police or other such malevolent boogiemen that KiA have imagined.  If you polled KiA users, I'm sure the vast majority of them would report not being racist or sexist or transphobic or homophobic or whatever - you have to get pretty hardcore crazy to wear those badges with pride.  But I've had enough arguments with people involved in gamergate and related movements that they just won't acknowledge things like structural prejudice, which, if we're honest, is the main problem facing discriminated groups.  Black people don't (often) get lynched any more (though they do occasionally get shot by police).  For me, there's a serious problem about how we think about ethnicity, gender, class, etc.  There's more to combating hate than just changing the law.  But that's perhaps a different discussion.   That can be debated to some extent, but I agree in general -- we are under no moral obligation to struggle with these people. So lay it down -- let them have their space, and go about your business.   The question is, why does their space need to be also my space?  They're perfectly capable of hosting these discussions elsewhere, so by kicking them off the site nobody is preventing the discussions from actually happening.   Sure, repression doesn't work but confrontation and deconstruction might.   Yeah, that is a really interesting result in studies, I find it a very interesting challenge."
TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,PublicIntelAnalyst,2,Thu Jul 16 17:10:44 2015 UTC,"I use a mass tagger that periodically tags everyone who comments on a particular set of subs with that sub's name, so when people from TRP, for example, comments outside of their sub it's pretty obvious.   That's pretty cool. Is it in RES? I think I might want to use it...   I've never seen a TRP commenter make a positive contribution to a discussion elsewhere on the site.   I used to comment there under a different username. Most of my comments were trying to clear up misconceptions and draw distinctions between helpful and destructive interpretations of their core ideas. It's been a year or two since I last visited that sub, so if it's gotten significantly worse in that time that may explain your experience. I also know a very popular and respected redditor used to post there around that time too (I won't invite vitriol upon him by naming him), with a similar approach to mine.    The question is, why does their space need to be also my space? They're perfectly capable of hosting these discussions elsewhere, so by kicking them off the site nobody is preventing the discussions from actually happening.   Because this is a community -- it has its own organism. You don't cut off your hand just because technically all the cells could congregate into a living tissue somewhere else.  Is your space really not separate enough from their space? I've frankly never seen a CT-style comment except in posts describing how awful they are.   Again, that's something I can agree with. I don't think hate gets us anywhere.   Glad you agree with that, and with the other parts you mentioned.   'political correctness' (I hate the term but can't think of a more apt summary) is far from having beaten the pushback against it.   And it never will, because its methodology is flawed and inherently justifies pushback -- just like fundamentalist Christianity (the origin of the ""Sinners, repent!"" example) hasn't beaten the pushback against it, and never will.   If you polled KiA users, I'm sure the vast majority of them would report not being racist or sexist or transphobic or homophobic or whatever - you have to get pretty hardcore crazy to wear those badges with pride.   The badge I would wear with pride is honesty. I have flaws, a sprinkling of racism and sexism being among them, because these are first and foremost natural reactions to differences between people that might strike one at first as upsetting or threatening in some way. Fear of the unknown -- of that which is different from what we know and are familiar with -- is fundamental in human nature, and it is not always a sin to have racist feelings. Often we cannot help that. The sin comes in making other people pay the price for our racist feelings.   The mistake I feel KiA exposes in the ""political-correctness police"" is that the latter seem to want to legislate natural human reactions out of existence. This is impossible, and to say with complete honesty ""I'm 100% not racist or sexist"" is also likely impossible. What we can be proud of is the aspiration toward that, the overcoming of our natural (but fearful, misguided) reactions when confronted with the unknown, and the commitment to increasing our ability to empathize with one another. This will ""eradicate racism"" not by stamping it out, which is impossible, but by healing it faster than it can be generated (it will always be generated).  The ""PC police"" condemn people for not having been born knowing what they themselves only learned last week at a seminar. They are right that racism as an ideology is wrong, but wrong that racist feelings are completely preventable. This is dangerous, and the delusion that fear of the unknown can be repressed leads to its finding expression elsewhere -- namely, in communities like KiA where dissent against PC-police type ideas is expressed. It results in the PC police hating and fearing a community they don't understand, and pre-judge based upon the ultimately irrelevant criterion that they don't explicitly agree with their own opinions. This bears a striking resemblance to the prejudice that accompanies racism and sexism, and illuminates what I hope is becoming clear: the sense in ""Rule #2 of psychology"" from my earlier comment -- If it bothers you, it reminds you of you.   Yeah, that is a really interesting result in studies, I find it a very interesting challenge.   I do too, I think and write about it a lot."

Hell, I was subbed to FPH and I still wasn't a fan of the move.

That's how voat is trying to differentiate it itself from reddit? You can't build an identity off being the anti-whatever. Because you're still letting the other define you.

TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,stygmata,2,Thu Jul 16 05:47:27 2015 UTC,"One possibility is that subreddits are each responsible to pay for their own server time. That way, each community would come to its own decision about funding, either from things like reddit gold or selling special flair, or advertising, or donation drives.   This would also allow for increased donations, people could donate to subs they really like without feeling like they support ones they hate. It would also put both more power and responsibility into the communities; a greater feeling of sovereignty but also being forced to actually see the difficulty of paying for things.  Reddit the corporation could monetize a couple of things for revenue, which would be ok because they now aren't paying for all the servers and as much labor. Small subs with very low traffic would also be covered, instead of having to somehow find a way to pay for themselves.  This would also hopefully solve what I think Reddit's biggest problem is, that non-reddit people see reddit as a monolithic group, so if there are racists on it, then the whole place is tainted by racism. Maybe with each sub basically funding itself, that perception would not continue."
TheoryOfReddit,3df1vi,snowsoftJ4C,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"I think this would work only if reddit became more like forum software like phpBB. In otherwords, separately branded, hosted sites that really have no connection to one and other, other than using the same software.  Because from a branding perspective, even having separate, primarily self-funded servers, but still under the reddit umbrella, is potentially dangerous to the brand. The non-redditor public and media doesn't care about the nuances of how each community is being funded and run. All they see is snoo and the reddit logo above each sub, with a reddit domain address. That's all they need to know to make a judgment that all redditors are x.  It's in the same vein as people from other countries stereotyping, jokingly or not, that all Americans are fat, gun-toting, rednecks. It disregards the obvious fact that the US has wide, rich, diversity at the regional level all the way down to the local level. The negative association is there, that's all that matters.  The other thing with letting subreddits decide their own funding is that it has the potential to split the overall reddit community. When people have control of their own money, they have control over their own destiny. Like you said, sovereignty. If you're the mod of a popular sub, that's able to meet and exceed its funding goals far beyond the other subs, why would you still want to listen to reddit corporate? Is reddit corporate taking funds from your subreddit in order to support less-self-supporting subs? We see that play out everyday in governments. Why bring that level of drama into reddit?"

TheoryOfReddit,3dgsmn,andrew2209,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there's an opt out already. And likewise some people might target adult subs. Who knows, maybe NSFW subs have a higher ad rate."

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,chaosakita,45,Wed Jul 15 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"Former CEO Yishan said in a comment yesterday:   Well, when things were heating around the /r/creepshots thing and people were calling for its banning, I wrote to him [/u/spez] to ask for advice. The very interesting thing he wrote back was ""back when I was running things, if there was anything racist, sexist, or homophobic I'd ban it right away. I don't think there's a place for such things on reddit. Of course, now that reddit is much bigger, I understand if maybe things are different.""  I've always remembered that email when I read the occasional posting here where people say ""the founders of reddit intended this to be a place for free speech."" Human minds love originalism, e.g. ""we're in trouble, so surely if we go back to the original intentions, we can make things good again."" Sorry to tell you guys but NO, that wasn't their intention at all ever. Sucks to be you, /r/coontown - I hope you enjoy voat!   So, according to him, reddit was not originally supposed to be a bastion of free speech, just as /u/spez said in his post today. All the free speech rhetoric came later in the history of reddit.   We need some quotes on free speech from Alexis or Steve in 2005 to settle the matter. All the quotes I've seen are from later years, including the one from Steve that Yishan quotes in the comment above."
TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,RunDNA,9,Wed Jul 15 16:00:33 2015 UTC,Looks like there's more info to consider. Thanks for providing more context.
TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,Kforstmosaics,25,Wed Jul 15 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"It seems very possible to me that the bastion of free speech quotes from a few years back were more of a spin on ""we don't have the resources to police our community, so we're going to say it's because of a lofty ideal."" You give quotes to a newspaper to promote a certain message; it doesn't mean the message is the truth."
TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,IIIISuperDudeIIII,7,Wed Jul 15 17:36:34 2015 UTC,I would put money on that being the case.
TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,HAL9000000,16,Wed Jul 15 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"I think it would be ridiculous for anyone to suggest that Reddit was ""originally"" intended to be anything with any sort of lofty cultural objectives.  It was created in Alexis's and Steve's college apartment.  It was intended to be, as I'll paraphrase Steve from the other day, a place to share and talk about cool things.  And I think it's dumb for anyone to say that something like this starts out being anything other than ""I hope people will use this and like it.""  At some point, when it started to get big, I think it's reasonable to understand that Alexis and/or anybody affiliated with the site would try to define and refine Reddit's purpose.  And so that's when Alexis makes this proclamation that he wants Reddit to be a ""bastion of free speech.""  So I don't think Steve is lying when he says Reddit wasn't intended to be that, at least not from the beginning.  Given that Alexis said that, I think it's reasonable to suggest that he was stating an ideal.  But just like with the US Constitution, where the First Amendment protects free speech, we've had many, many reviews of how to interpret what ""freedom of speech"" means and it is certainly not absolute.  The US Constitution and the United States as an idea followed the ""Wild West"" period in the United States where there wasn't much in the way of laws and outlaws thrived.  The Constitution came in to correct problems with that Wild West environment.  Many corrections/improvements in society have obviously happened since the Constitution was written but, of course, there are some aspects of the Wild West that people miss and/or they think those days must have been great.  The first decade or two of the Internet have allowed people to return to a form of the Wild West, a Cyber Wild West, in which lots of illegal and/or socially questionable behaviors have been facilitated.  And it was only a matter of time when efforts would be made, just like with the Constitution, to reign in those illegal and socially questionable behaviors and make the Internet a place where we and the online platforms we visit would start to try to more consistently apply our laws and better adhere to our basic social contract in which we try to protect peoples' rights and stop hate when it becomes harassing/threatening.  The internet, increasingly, is not a separate place from real life.  The internet is an extension of real life and real life is an extension of the internet.  The phrase ""bastion of free speech"" is meaningless without further clarification.  Relative to most nations around the world the United States is a ""bastion of free speech.""  And yet if you ask some people they'd say that the US is some kind of totalitarian democracy.  So I guess I think some Redditors are just pouncing on these words because it helps their argument and it is definitely funny that this one Redditor literally found this quote where Alexis said he wanted Reddit to be a ""bastion of free speech.""  But if we are going to get real then we have to acknowledge that what Reddit is doing is part of this larger movement to simultaneously try to make the internet a better place while trying to avoid fucking up the good Wild West stuff.  And inevitably some people are going to be especially pissed about how this process does fuck up some of the good Wild West stuff that they love."

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,N8theGr8,25,Thu Jul 16 11:50:02 2015 UTC,"My take on the issue is that when he said ""Reddit is meant to be a bastion of free speech"" he meant that it was a forum for an open exchange of ideas with no topic off the table.  When he said ""Reddit is not a bastion of free speech"", he meant that people aren't allowed to harass others and be openly vitriolic about certain groups.

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,marvin,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"Even if this happens to be the case, it's still a thin line. E.g. where do you draw the difference between legitimate criticism against a religious group with dangerous beliefs (e.g. for hurting themselves or others) and ""hate"" against said group? Encouraging violence certainly is in the latter category, but how about arguing for and making political moves against said group immigrating or practicing their belief? How about calling out well-known members of the group for such activities? Most people make this out to be a matter of black-and-white demarcation, but it's not.  I think that regardless of this, thogh, the judge is still out on whether the coming purge will affect only hate groups and leave room for merely discussing unpalatable topics."

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,Droidaphone,26,Thu Jul 16 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's much more about growth. If Reddit wants to keep adding users at the rate it has been, at what point do you run out of potential users who are willing to ignore/unsubscribe/be-associated with that sort of behavior.  The other day, a video from CNN was posted where Reddit was called backwards and sexists. The vibe on Reddit was that CNN was typically out-of-touch. But that misses the point: if you're not a Reddit user, and all you hear about Reddit is that it's a shitty place because those are the stories that make the news... Then you stay a non-user.  This is a lose-lose for Reddit. If they don't clean house, they slowly stop growing. If(when) they do clean house, they alienate the libertarian free-speech crowd that has long been at the core of their demographic, and those users will take other casual users with them."
TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,PavementBlues,15,Wed Jul 15 14:57:40 2015 UTC,"Spot on, and I believe that it goes beyond the fact that at some point ""you run out of potential users who are willing to ignore/unsubscribe/be-associated with that sort of behavior"".  One of the consistent points made by those against banning of subs is that we should encourage maturity by simply unsubbing from or ignoring communities that we don't like.  That relies on a mistaken assumption, though: that the existence of those communities does not affect reddit at large. If these were isolated forums operating independently, it would be perfectly fair to just ignore them. The world is full of vile groups doing vile things. Sometimes you have to just grow up and shrug it off.  The problem is, these are not isolated forums. Each subreddit is tied into the ecology of the reddit community, so as these groups grow, their users will go on to explore the rest of reddit. The voting mechanism makes this particularly dangerous, because while it is easy to downvote a racist post, their opinions shape reddit by their own upvotes and downvotes, boosting negative attitudes and giving them increased visibility.  Reddit is a sum of its parts, and each of those parts influences it and shapes the others. Large, toxic subreddits can and will poison the water, spilling over into other subs and affecting the general community."

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,davidreiss666,3,Thu Jul 16 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be about investment, any community will hit lowest denominator and self-destruct with insufficient QA. Hell, subreddits do it internally all the time.  You start off with a ""decent"" group, a ""bad"" group come in, they're left unchecked and the tone shifts, the decent group begin to move on, the bad group become an increasing percentage of the group, badda bing badda boom, you're done and there's no way back.  The behaviour of reddit - for lack of a better brush to tar everybody with - has been completely bonkers. I'm sure the staff would like to have sane discussions, but it's not going to happen. Not as a global announcement, anyway."

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,autopornbot,7,Wed Jul 15 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"This maybe be one big argument over what speech exactly should be allowed. Even people who believe in ""free speech"" typically agree that personal threats and harassment should not be allowed. Hate speech is slightly more controversial, but only slightly. And then we getting into how aggressive speech is allowed to be and so on (e.g. is calling somebody racist offensive?).   When somebody says they believe in ""free speech"", it means they think that whatever speech being discussed should be allowed. So without any context, it's meaningless. Ohanian was being political, saying things which sounded nice but didn't actually bind him to any particular action. Yishan's comment sheds some light on this."

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,sugarwallsrobinson,4,Wed Jul 15 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"Despite what folks have said, reddit has never had free speech. It's pretty obvious if you think about it. Link us to a submission form, any submission form, where you and I are both guaranteed free speech. You can't: since moderators are gods in their own subreddits, they are always able to remove content completely arbitrarily.  Reddit has always been more about a free market in content management: you can freely move between subreddits to find ones you like."
TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,Phokus1983,5,Wed Jul 15 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"In my honest opinion, I believe that there should be certain limits set on free speech. Free speech should encompass all ideas, opinions, and schools of thought except when the above is used to propagate hate speech. It is completely okay in my eyes to discuss, for example, the flawed reasoning and cognitive dissonance that has led to America's obesity epidemic, or the perpetuation of negative stereotypes among the black community, but is NOT okay to do what /r/CoonTown does (or what /r/fatpeoplehate did) and become a cesspit of hate speech without promoting any meaningful discussion.  By banning these subreddits, Reddit is no longer going to be a forum of absolute free speech, yes. But in setting reasonable limits on free speech, it is still allowing for (and enhancing its ability to uphold) meaningful and controversial discussions on race, gender, gay rights, religion, politics, etc. without the distracting voice of those who want to silence such discussions with bigotry. And I fail to see how this could be a bad thing for the website, or why the founders should be under fire for coming to this realization, even if it theoretically goes against their original stated ideals (if those even exist).  It's not as though there aren't other unregulated channels of absolute free speech on the internet, anyway (4chan and now Voat come to mind immediately)."

The problem as always is , what is 'reasonable' ?  And it is not some vague hypotehtical, there are people losing their jobs every day throught this insanity, here  a man was arrested for singing kung fu fighting in a bar when a chiense man walking past heard it and phoned the police, another was arrested for calling a horse gay.  And i t is not some tiny fringe element, it is endemic and growing.   And its not about tolerance and yes the gradient has limited adhesive proprieties. Just like civil partnerships would not lead to gay marriage- ah, but youe say' gay marriage is great so that doesnt count' , the communists called murdering people en masse great, whatever is relentlessly pumped is the new 'great'.   Equal oppurtunites become equality and diversity became just diversity, and nothing more- from a system where it was illegal to discriminate in recruitment against people because of their skin to onel where it is illegal not to discriminate people because of their skin.  Young people. young 18 year olds than never lived in those bad old days when women were chained to the sink and blacks rode on the back of the bus let alone take part will have to just accept that they be will be mistreated so that a black kid who only came to this country 6 years ago so never experienced any of the racism or sexism can get a good job and maker the stats look good.  Because each white person is responsible for  the actions of other white people who did bad things even before they were born but black people are individuals and cannot be treated badly or given higher insurance quotes based on the behavior of other black people.  That is the new equlaity, because words no longer have  any meaning. And on a site that is mostly worlds thats problematic"

TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,PhillyGreg,3,Wed Jul 15 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"Reddit is a privately run forum for discussion.  It's not the government.  There is no constitutional/moral obligation to allow everything.  All of this is on Reddit's infrastructure.  If Reddit wants to ban certain subredddits, it's their right to do that.  If voat wants those communities, they're free to welcome them with open arms if they want.  That's the other half of free speech that a lot of people here don't seem to give a fuck about.  You have the right to say something without being hindered by government provided certain caveats but others also have the right not to assist you in broadcasting that speech as an exercise of their own speech rights.  In response, all of you have the right to complain about Reddit's choice not to host certain controversial subreddits via whatever means are available to you.  TLDR: free speech is also about being subject to the social consequences of what you say not just the right to say it and it's certainly not unlimited, there are fucking rules."
TheoryOfReddit,3ddvgz,hstisalive,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"Spot on.   The funny thing is that it's not even a free speech issue that set this off. FPH intentionally doxed people. You don't dox someone to make them realise the conviction of your ideas. You do it to cause them harm.  So they were banned. There was collateral once they all re subbed and cause mayhem through r/all and other places. But it all started due to them being arseholes, not because their ideas were being repressed."

I mean sure, you get to say what you want, but I haven't been here long and even I can already see that in Reddit the liberals get to give their opinions and the conservatives get to be downvoted for theirs.   Personally, while I think reddit's free speech ideals worked in the beginning, I think the site has changed to make it unfeasible. But it was definitely intended to be a bastion of free speech when it was started.<   No matter where you go, there are going to be the black sheep of the bunch. That goes for everyone. So of course its large, ever-growing community is going to make it harder to ignore the people abusing their free speech.  Take the community of League of Legends, for example. League of Legends is (currently) the most popular game in the world, but what's most likely the first thing you hear about the game? The toxic community. In this situation, the community is just so large that the toxicity stands out among the crowd- and it spreads, too.  Edit: formatting"

Even with that said, look at the United States of America.     The United States of America actually ""condone"" hate speech. Let's look at the Neo-Nazi/Nazi parties. They put in for permits to cordon off a public area. The permits come back and the permits are legitimate. The Nazis/Neo-Nazis then use these permits which grants X amount of time at X spot and the Nazis/Neo-Nazis have their speeches for the allotted amount of time and then go home or back to private meetings or what have you. The police even stand guard for the Nazis/Neo-Nazis and protect them from the public at large. The only problem I'm seeing is how do we, the reddit community and management, convert this practice into one that is reasonable?   I think the only real solution is to have a ""you know it when you see it"" rule. The Supreme Court of the United States has even set precedents for things like this in law. Look at /r/fatpeoplehate. It has absolute zero constructive value to anything involved there. It's literally just hate speech. Now look at Nazis. There is actually some really constructive values in Fascism, whether or not you go along with the ""Murder everyone that isn't a true Aryan"" is up to you but from a governmental standpoint, there's a lot to be learned. There isn't in fat people hate besides ""we shouldn't allow/do that."""

In fact you seem to make it out to be pretty significant considering it's one of the main issues you note reddit facing.   Regardless, that's not why I mentioned /r/conspiracy. That was because your main intention seems to be fixating on whether he could have worded that particular brief remark more tactfully. Nominally you're addressing the free speech issue, but putting aside the fact that it's already been addressed plenty around here lately, the vast majority of what you said related to this very specific tidbit from him.

At the point when you have coontown mods running the blackout2015 sub its not really worth arguing that bigotry played absolutely zero role in the proceedings. It did but I dont think its the major reason. Remember that petition only had a few thousand signatures after the FPH ban, and it wasn't until the blackout that it blew up, which shows the majority of reddit doesnt care about that. It seems like it was the plan all along from beginning to end was to not have Pao succeed. We were fed a narrative complete with a happy ending. I mean hindsight is 20/20 but we can see she was pretty much brought on to be the public face of a lot of controversial changes. The harassment post in r/announcements is the most downvoted announcement to ever be posted. The stuff with her husband makes her a perfect choice for this, there is a ton of free controversy and negativity right off the bat without even knowing anything else about her. But there is more to it than that. I'm not going to start digging through user history but I'm pretty sure Ohanian never came out any said anything like ""Hey reddit I am the one making all the decisions you are harassing Pao for."" Pretty obvious why he didn't and why he always posts in bullshit CYA corporate talk whenever he's not stirring up drama. We only really know about the real chain of command because of Yishan's little breakdown, so why didn't he post about it sooner? Look at his user history and its empty for months up until a few days ago. I feel like a popular ex admin making those kind of posts BEFORE the witchhunt got out of hand would have maybe affected things. I wouldnt be surprised if absolutely everyone involved Pao included was in on the creation of this story. The frenzy is over. Maybe a few thousand people are paying a bit more attention than everyone else and realized that Pao is not the big bad wolf. But the momentum is gone and if anyone starts up with anything now it won't be taken seriously. And, what even would the goal against Ohanian be? It's his company, even if he is a shitty boss you can't really fire the boss.   Now instead of asking whether this is just the fault of bigotry, ask the same question from a different perspective: If Pao was never hired on, and Ohanian made all these controversial changes himself, would there still be an outcry? Personally I think there still would have been. Pao just made it even bigger. You could say the bigotry enhanced the impact of the already extant controversy. Two big things coming together for a huge ass riot. And of course she was there to make people forget about the changes when we got our happy ending of her leaving the company, keeping the average redditor with their positive/apathetic impression of the real admins."

Still; same thing applies: The assertion is that bigotry played a big part of Pao's demise, and not her actual actions. This is evidenced by the lack of Bigotry directed at Ohanian, whom we now know was responsible for Victoria being fired.   You said ""He's not excusing them"". Here's the context of that:   ""The recent /r/announcements[1] post is chock full of Ohanian hate. Definitely different degrees, but he's getting roasted too.""   ""Very much this. And, expanding on this, the Pao hate... Well, people choose their battles, and choose their weapons. Racial or sexiest jokes aren't great rhetoric (or even mildly effective rhetoric), but they are easy, cheap, and fast.""   ""Using racist and sexist weapons, even if they are the easiest, fast and cheapest weapons available, is still racist and sexist behaviour.""     He is kind of excusing them. ""Very much this"" is in agreement with Ohanian getting hate too, but that's not a valid comparison and not really the topic at hand: Ohanian is getting some hate, but not nearly the tsunami of hate that Pao got, and further, it's directed at his abilities and the shots he's called: not at his race or gender. People are attacking his ideas, not him personally. That's a huge difference from what happened to Pao.  The fact is that Ohanian isn't getting roasted by bigots. No one's giving him shit because he's a man. No one's giving him shit because he's Irish. There aren't racially tinged slurs about him absolutely dominating /r/all.   Three weeks ago, if you'd have asked me if all the anti-Pao hate was bigoted, I would've disagreed. ""Can't be"", I might've said.   Now though? I dunno. It's hard to just say 'No, can't be'.   Reddit's more-vocal-minority is showing its true colors here. The argument really can't be made any longer that it was just anti-authority rhetoric: it wasn't. In hindsight, it was bigoted. It was racist. And it was sexist.   This isn't to say all redditors are bigots, of course, but I think that on its face, this shows that an apparently large portion of reddit is, yes, made up of bigots. Which is good to know. I kinda wish I'd have been tagging the people posting all the Pao nonsense, just so I can easily ignore them now. But, live and learn."
TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,itty53,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"I guess I misunderstood his comment.  The way I read it, I don't think he was trying to say these people were not actual sexists and racists deep down, just that it is easier for racists and sexists to attack Pao than it would be more rational people who can differentiate blame. Maybe like there is not enough for a logical person to get angry about or for the average Redditor (who does not actually understand what is going on), but for someone with racist and sexist philosophies that person can literally start a fight wherever and whenever s/he so chooses because as long as the other person is somewhat different they have some kind of twisted ammunition.   I feel like that is just a rambling mess. To try and translate: Racists and sexists do not require a logical reason to start fights therefore it  is easier for them to start one.

Ultimately, there's nobody calling for Ohanian to depart for numerous possible reasons. I think mostly, he has been with Reddit for quite some time (duh) so there's a tenure aspect. People drew a correlation with Pao being new and the shitstorm happening and said ""she needs to get out"". This isnt exactly a bad conclusion to make given that we don't have inside information on the operations of Reddit. I believe this reflects poorly on the board as they knew exactly what they're doing. At this point, redditors have begun to realize what they do doesn't matter as their whole response was completely orchestrated by the board. They'll either have to accept changes, or move to a different platform, because its very clear that big changes are coming."

This entire incident is the best example possible of why this was a bad conclusion to make. Reddit didn't have any information, wasn't willing to accept what information it got, acted in anger and vitriol, and threw out the old CEO. For what? Not disclosing why an employee had been fired, which, as mentioned by most of the admins, is standard practice in business?   Even if the sexism didn't play a role (which it probably did), the blind willingness to rally around causes with no information probably played a bigger one."

I however did not state that the general reaction to this conclusion was good. Hence my last part: either people will need to accept changes, or leave.  Sexism probably played a role but as sexism can be inherent in many things due to the nature of communities (I.e-of couse sexists are in the Reddit community, and were vocal in this instance) I don't think that was the key factor. The key factor was group mentality, combined with ignorance. And many people realize that now, even those who originally took part."

The subsequent conclusion, which, again, was made with no evidence and no basis, was that Pao needed to leave and everything would be great.  There is no step of logic in this chain, from the firing of Victoria, the association of that firing to Pao, an the subsequent calls for Pao's resignation, that is a good or even neutral conclusion to make. None of these steps are reasonable."

If Ellen Pao was known for being a renowned philanthropist who did lots of amazing things for lots of people with her millions of dollars (or something else that made her likable in the public eye) and made a couple mistakes in her handling of Reddit, I don't imagine the hatred would have gotten so out of hand.

Victoria was seen as a martyr because the Court of Reddit decided she was not at fault.  The problem is what Reddit decides to do when you are a target of hate.

Reprehensible track history does not justify the reprehensible and primitive reaction."

Like I said, most people didn't hear about it until AFTER the judgement.   There's a third option, ""Maybe she fabricated it"".   Why do you assert that only a non sexist person would assume those two possibilities. Wouldn't a reasonable person in general consider ALL the possibilities?   I guess it makes sense considering your subreddit participation and your character: https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/3bad6w/sitting_the_lsat_in_13_hours_havent_prepared_at/  Seriously.

The fact that it was interpreted with such hostility across the board on reddit exposes hostility towards women.    I could see why you'd think that after SRS, TBP, GG, And all the other meta subreddits have been telling you that over and over for weeks.   Try stepping out of the echo chamber hug box.    How would reddit have reacted if a male CEO had filed such a complaint?   It has nothing to do with being male or CEO. It has to do with what now appears to be a frivolous lawsuit. You can say what you want about racism or sexism, but the fact is that transcripts and the decision show she was interested in the settlement more than anything else.

Apparently the author is ignorant of the fact that hiring 75 people to moderate would double the staff of reddit, which is currently not profitable, but I'm sure he has given more thought to the rest of his suggestions. He also assumes that the ""top 75"" mods would be willing to work for reddit.   Reddit is huge and growing. It didn't accomplish that with top down hierarchies and strict ""no basement"" censorship. It did it by largely staying out of the way and letting communities self organize. The idea that this tradition should be discarded based on the opinions of someone who refuses to so much as have an account is preposterous beyond description."

Also, not unlike the behavior and actives you don't want to be associated with there are NSFW subs you'd probably find shockingly horrible that have been here almost as long as reddit has been around. The fact is the off color, NSFW, libertarians and the like were here first. It's only now that there's a loud enough group complaining that it's become an issue.   What you've got is people coming to a bar, not realizing it's a certain type of bar, the owners depending on certain customers significantly but also wanting to force them out to make way for more marketable clientele. The majority of redditors just like the bar's wings and see a miscellaneous motorcycle outside occasionally, it's not even a Harley or MC appropriate bike (shout out to Sons of Anarchy for the biker education)-- usually it's an old Honda or a GXR.   Personally? I've been registered for 8 years, lurking for another 1, I'm subscribed to ~200 subreddits and participate in dozens. While I see a lot of wild opinions I rarely see explicit non-trolling hate or harassment. When there is, it's almost always negative and buried at the bottom with hundreds of downvotes.   Most people who author intense comments are upset and reactionary. Just as traumas and joys integrate deeper into our personalities so too are our participation rates similar on reddit submissions for various topics.   At what point do stupid comments become hate and harassment?

One of the most upvoted questions in the Al Sharpton AMA was basically just a racist accusation ripped straight from Rush Limbaugh.  Mention Romani almost anywhere on this site and watch the bigotry flow right to the top of the thread.  Feminists are evil SJWs, but no, really guys, I totes believe in equality.  It took the overwhelming flood of hateful, crying, petulant children in the wake of the FPH banning for shitposts like "" found the fatty"" to get downvoted more often than upvoted, and it's still a crapshoot whether fat hate is gonna get you upvoted or downvoted.  Users defending a 50 yearold's right to have sex with a teenager (down to 14 because ""that's the age of consent somewhere""), or to look at child porn will actually get positive karma.

TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,ArchangelleDovakin,0,Tue Jul 14 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, but none of that is evidence that reddit is becoming a place catering exclusively to right wing views. Moderators still can and do enforce the censoring of racist, sexist, etc. speech in their own subreddits, and vastly different communities thrive under the reddit url. The sports bar being ""taken over"" by bikers isn't all that apt of a metaphor. A better metaphor might be of an entire entertainment district having some bars catering to bikers, some to sports fans, some to families, etc., with the city doing relatively little to limit who can and can't open a bar in that district.   Further, it is not as if the left on reddit doesn't enjoy a symbiotic relationship with the extreme right. Entire subreddits like SRS and SRD and numerous others thrive off of the entertainment value of the far right, so it comes off a little disingenuous for the same folks to claim that the racists and sexists are ""ruining"" reddit for them. The overt racist and sexism on reddit is precisely the appeal of the site for those posters.   It anyone was genuinely concerned with the proliferation of racism and misogyny on reddit they'd do much better looking at the more progressive corners of the site. You don't have to do much digging to find minorities and poor people fetishized as somehow more ""authentic"" than privileged folks, or non western cultures reduced to primitive states which do no more than react against western imperialism, and have no genuine agency of their own. And what could be more chauvinistic than the widespread idea among reddit leftists that the biggest threat to women is the sexuality of other men?   Yet despite the fact that these ideas have been criticized by many well known race theorists and feminist theorists, the progressive side of reddit is practically a how to guide for racist, sexist liberals."
TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,AnxiousReginald,3,Wed Jul 15 02:06:41 2015 UTC,"I never said anything about exclusivity.

The overwhelming majority of those users would give up that ""entertainment"" in a heartbeat, and are only on those subs because they want a space where the don't have to feel excluded and embattled constantly, where they can point to what they see as bullshit and commiserate with others who agree.

You have some crystal ball which allows you to see into the possible world where the bigots have all left reddit, and SRD and the like have all cheered and gone home happy? This is a subreddit which defines worthy content with the very language of entertainment. Mere racism or sexism is nothing to them without popcorn. And all this existing within a culture of American liberalism which spawned the entertainment-politics of John Oliver and Steven Colbert, where the entire raison of political engagement is the mocking of right wing extremism. It's as ludicrous to suggest that such a culture is really about racism and sexism as it is to suggest that To Catch a Predator is about catching pedophiles. Entertainment has defined American populist political discourse since Reagan, and you think reddit is some enlightened exception? Please.    you're completely ignoring places like coontown, trp, european, philosophyofrape, and many other actual bigot and hate subs   No where in my post did I claim these subs don't exist, or that they aren't bigoted. Nor did I use this silly language of ""actual"" and ""real"" bigots. My claim was that those who are concerned with the proliferation hate on reddit might have more success ridding it from the progressive corners of the site. This implies absolutely nothing about whether progressives are ""more bigoted"" than the extreme right, whatever such stupid, obfuscatory language might mean. The point is only that (1) hatred exists in progressive circles, (2) progressives tend to be (very slightly) less set-in-stone about their views than the right. Hence the fight against hatred isn't entirely futile when directed towards progressives. This is not some sort of competition, you do not win a cookie for showing that the right is bigoted, nor does the fact that the other camp is bigoted make your camp a utopian paradise.   That said, you might argue, as many have, that hatred among liberals is more pernicious than among the right, since the former is almost exclusively covert and thus quite easily denied and dismissed by the leftist. History might even support this view, given that prominent figures on the left have been criticizing liberal racism for decades, yet little has changed. Personally I am on the fence about this issue, although it seems with every post I become more convinced that progressives are absolutely unable to conceive that they're not the unimpeachable angels of ""tolerance"" they work so hard to identify as.

There is a high probability that my entire existence is amoral if I am a part of capitalist culture: if my existence burns enough fuel, creates enough garbage, and lends a hand in the continued wage slavery of people working in factories overseas.   Its quite likely that things which I think to be moral, could actually cause an ethical problem: ala the Trolley Problem.  That being said, I'm fairly confident that beliefs like ""jews should be killed"", ""black people are inherently unculturable"", ""feminism is a moral degradation of our generation"", ""fat people deserve to be mocked"" etc. which gain loud voices on Reddit (and in the world at large) are fairly dubious, and seem to be based more on a xenophobic emotional reaction than any kind of coherent moral or ethical system.  It seems ethically lazy to throw out any kind of rule-setting because it might trample on someone's beliefs. If people are going out of their way to hurt or disrespect other people, I go by classroom or parental rules: they have waived their right to be taken seriously as an adult in the conversation, and need a time-out to understand that they are only one agent in our multifaceted society.     AKA: if fat-haters want to fat-hate, let them, but I think that their disregard and disrespect of others based on dubious moral reasoning is grounds for their silencing in a conversation. Their voices can create an echo-chamber of non-scientific and non-analytical reasoning, which creates an in-group mentality.

It is not a person, like Jews, blacks, etcetera. And that's a pretty big distinction. The problem with ideologies like feminism is that they lead to ideologues wherein any disagreement is an attack. Same thing with, say, communism. That can lead to overbearing folks on both sides of the divide. For a reddit example, even if one believes that Pao was not specifically discriminated against at Kleiner, it is still apparent that there is some level of institutional gender problem in the tech sphere.

TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,forward4,2,Tue Jul 14 21:03:57 2015 UTC,"Who decides?   In reality, it's probably a group decision by the authorities of this privately owned website. In every domain, authorities take their consensus from the public, or a panel of experts who are hopefully somewhat objective on the issue and make an informed decision. Just because a decision limits expression of hatred, doesn't mean that this restriction of freedom is inherently negative in value. Its entirely likely that Reddit is also motivated by what kind of customers they want to use the site (by allowing a gigantic forum of fat-haters, how many fat customers or fat-sympathizing customers might they lose?).  Its similar to the violentacrez thing with posting photos of underage girls. By having Reddit associated with pedophilia, do you really think that's good for business? In this instance, I'm happy that business and my personal morality tend to overlap (I'm not happy using a site which encourages through the absence of reprimanding things like racism, sexism, and disgusting content). Its similar to how I would feel if a parent cared little about whether their child ate poop or called other children names.    Where's the line?   Well, I hope we can agree that it exists somewhere.   There is a difference between a poster saying ""that person is really rude"", vs. ""that person is really rude because they are black"", vs. joining a subreddit about rude black people vs. actively brigading black people and calling them rude vs. vandalizing a store of a local black family calling them rude, etc.     Just like if someone says ""I want someone to die"", vs. ""I want you to die"", vs. ""I'm going to kill you"", vs. ""I'm going to kill you Mark Johnson at 56 Greencrest Blvd."" vs. ""I'm going to kill you Mark Johnson at 56 Greencrest Blvd. at 5:00 Pm, thursday and I am outside your house"".  It is extremely easy to ask where the line is. It is the easiest thing in the world. And its also a good question to ask! That doesn't mean we shouldn't decide though.   How much of the actual prohibition is reactionary to very loud voices versus actual damage?    I'm not entirely sure I understand.   How do you measure the damage you're trying to prevent by taking action against these individuals or groups?   Well, I'm sure if you had the funds you could fund independent study groups which would survey how safe people of a certain, race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. felt while using this site.

It's too common, and habitual trolls will stalk your account for months. I know many users complain about overzealous mods, and I personally know some that are problems, but from my experience there are far more bad users that need to be managed.  When a stalker likes to follow you around to any sub you post in, it discourages mods from posting with their main accounts. Mods should not have to have anonymous alts and pose as non-mod users in order to participate on Reddit. IMO the Admins should step in and deal with bad users like that. Some trolls are ""real users"" too. Making some good posts shouldn't grant an open license to attack other users. If anything the Admins have been very conservative with shadowbans, because trolls are usually allowed to post threats and continue harassment without penalty.  I mod more than a few large, established subs, and I've put years of effort into building them. If more mod transparency and fewer shadowbans means it gets easier for bad people to harass me I'm likely to quit Reddit. I already donate an excessive amount of time here (including UI work requested by Admins), and I have no interest in spending more time dealing with harassment/threats/etc. - context   Also if you don't like a mod team, and enough people agree with you, you can make your own sub!

There was unarguably racist and sexist sentiment behind some of that. If anything, it hurt the message of the protest as far as more casual users and outsiders were concerned. Knowing details about Pao and her husband's legal problems is cause for alarm. Censorship on reddit is concerning (but also fairly complex once you start hearing from moderators about how bad it can really get). Memes like ""Chairman Pao"" mostly just made protestors look immature  The reaction to Victoria's firing was for completely different reasons and came out of the moderator community. It was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" related to a bunch of admin-moderator level issues. As far as the moderators were concerned, Pao's role was a lot more abstract because the issue was basically with all admins other than Victoria. While they liked Victoria and were probably unhappy to see her go, their main issues were that they were not notified and that they weren't told who to use as a backup.  From early on the complaint was ""you need to talk with us and treat us like part of the team."" Only after a few hours did the anti-Pao contingent flood the protests and re-framed them as a problem with Pao.  We're not seeing massive uproar over ""the real person who fired Victoria"" because the point was that the moderators needed lines of communication with reddit, not that they were protesting to get Victoria back. Reddit is in the process of responding to the moderators on these complaints, so the moderators are more happy."

The text in the petition doesn't reflect a very wide scope of research, it's possible they were just looking for quick and dirty things to include that would slam Pao. They did know, and chose to run with the lawyer persona over the engineering one because redditors would be more likely to sympathize with an engineer than a lawyer.   Redditors see STEM degrees as a sort of merit, and last week comments showing Ellen Pao's merit were being downvoted into oblivion. Lawyer definitely does ring of corporate pencil pushing, and that's much easier to hate. Reddit wasn't looking for facts last week, it was looking for reasons to hate Ellen Pao."

Her and her husband's somewhat shady history in general probably didn't help much either.   But I think the bulk of the rage post-Victoria firing would have been there if the CEO was a man who came from a venture capitalist firm and had shown signs of not really understanding Reddit. The other factors were icing on the cake, but that was the core reason why people were more willing to blame her than Alexis- he was One Of Us, the nerds, she was One Of Them, the corporate types who just want to ruin fun things to make money."

However, Alexis has already given us reason to believe that the second concern, being the one for censorship, is still going to survive Pao's firing.  So it really seems like nothing was accomplished other than abating a lot of misinformed and misdirected ire on the community's behalf."

Indirectly, it affected everyone who is a member of a subreddit which could be construed as offensive or unpopular.  That's a lot of people.    The Victoria thing indirectly affected everyone who works for reddit.  Not a lot of people.  I suppose it also indirectly affected many reddit users, by signaling that they may have to put up with a day devoid of the default reddit subs in the future.  Which wouldn't really be a big deal."
TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,chinkstronaut,12,Tue Jul 14 20:33:18 2015 UTC,You know there's a lot of the reddit userbase that doesn't care about all these drama things going on.  And it seems like this drama wave spluttered and died (we'll see if it gets another surge). But some people just might be tired of drama.
TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,Random832,3,Tue Jul 14 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"Alexis had a reasonably good name before all this started.  It's much harder to find a reason to hate someone after you already like them, versus someone you have zero feelings towards.   This isn't that complicated."
TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,whackri,3,Tue Jul 14 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"I think that Ellen put herself in front of this. I think, in retrospect, this was a doom meant for Alexis and he skived it off on an underling. I still do not approve of how Ellen handled this, but my opinion of her has softened slightly. I don't think this had anything to do with her genitalia, I think it had to do with her being the CEO. Responsibility goes with the job.   I think that actions have momentum and the backlash against Ellen may have wearied the board to further drama for while. I think many favor a ""wait and see"" approach. ""We just flexed our muscles, changes have been made, message has been sent, let's see if it affects anything before we go after anyone else""."

But it's not why people were angry in the first place, and it's not the majority of people who were angry. The outrage was fresh then. You can't take the lack of reaction after a new party to blame has been revealed, but no new things have happened to be angry about. The reaction burned itself out. It only lasted so long in the first place because there were multiple successive things to be angry about. Huffman and Ohanian have announced some of their plans, but haven't done anything yet, and even the details won't be known until their AMA this evening."

This entire incident has cast the reddit community in an extremely bad light. People jumped to conclusions, without ever knowing why Victoria was fired, or what went on behind the scenes to get her fired. Ellen was the new face in town, someone who took unpopular actions in the past, and someone who was in the spotlight recently as a loser herself. That's pretty much all it took for the mob to pounce.   I can understand the frustration that certain mods, like the ones at AMA felt. But the magnitude of the reaction, and the personal tone that it took against Ellen, was entirely inappropriate given the circumstantial ""evidence"" that we had. And now, we know much more about what has happened, and who the real ""villain"" really is... but by this point, people are just tired of the whole thing, they've lost interest, and they recognize that Alexis is simply not a juicy/vulnerable target the way Ellen is.   This is exactly the kind of thing our founding fathers feared, when they expressly denounced democracy and went along the path of a constitutional republic. Wisdom of the crowds is a real thing, but not in the form of mob rule. Society runs on the back of institutions, rules, and procedures, specifically designed to prevent exactly this kind of fiasco. Sweep all those away, ""give power to the people,"" and this is exactly what you'll end up with."

It just needs people who are irritated and have someone to blame.  I wish I could just beam this into your head. It's kind of an intuitive thing you pick up by watching things like this, you know? Not easy to put into words.  Thing is, Pao was designed to be a scapegoat and take the heat so that the board/a proper CEO didn't have to. Getting upset with people for falling for the game is blaming the victim. They did exactly what they were manipulated to do. And when Pao left, there was no ""next target"" immediately in sight.

TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,broadcasthenet,12,Tue Jul 14 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"The initial Anti-Pao reaction to Victoria's firing was perceived to be part of a pattern that included a failure to deliver long-promised tools to mods, arbitrary banning of subreddits, etc. Ohanion's firing of Victoria is not perceived as part of a pattern of such behaviors. The difference in perception isn't necessarily due to the difference in race/sex, but rather due to a difference in the context in which the decisions were perceive to have been made.    What if Pao was a white man who had failed to deliver long-promised tools to mods, arbitrarily banned subreddits, etc. and then was thought to have fired Victoria? I think it is likely (or at least plausible) that Reddit would've reacted in a similar manner to the way it reacted to Pao (i'm picturing a revival of the scumbag Steve meme). What I'm saying is: the difference in the reactions might have (at least in part) been due to the fact that the initial perception related to a pattern of fuck-ups while the latter did not. There are differences between the Pao and Ohanion situations other than race and sex that may account for the difference in reaction.   Did racism/sexism play some part in the anti-Pao reaction? Probably. You can point to the many sexist/racist posts as evidence of this. But that could be misleading. There are likely many people who disliked Pao's decisions (and signed the petition to oust her) who did not post sexist/racist sentiments and, in fact, were not sexist or racist. They were less likely to post, so you're less likely to see them, but they might still exist. It's actually quite likely that this is the case, because most people on this site are lurkers and do not post.   In short, it is extremely difficult to prove that the anti-Pao reaction was or was not motivated by sexist/racist beliefs. But to me, it seems highly unlikely that it was solely due to such beliefs."

Why didn't the users make racist memes about him in the wake of a number of controversial actions that took place? Though, nothing as controversial as anything recent.  Now he was a guy, so you may claim it was definitely due to sexism.  And I'd agree some of it was definitely due to sexism, and racism. However the answer to this   can we basically sum up all of the vitriol against Pao over the past few months to be a majority based around sexism and racism?   Is a no.   There definitely are sexists/racists who attacked pao in sexist/racist ways, however the majority of reddit users disliked her before the recent drama and fph ban.   Three main things were involved IMO.  The first was her lawsuit. A long time ago, a very long rant by an individual was posted to bestof. This brought the knowledge of pao's lawsuit to the userbase. A majority number of users really dislike dishonest people. And the fact the amount pao was suing her former employers coincided with the amount her husband had to pay made people question her character. I don't know the reason why pao chose that amount, nor am I interested in the reason. However what appeared to the users was a woman using a discrimination case to obtain money to pay off her fraud of a husband.  The second was the announcement of the reddit content policies update(prior to fph ban). It was announced that reddit would be working on safety of communities. Many many redditors hate the concept of safe spaces as well as any curbing of free speech. Now I do not think that post was implying safe spaces. However that is what it appeared to the majority of users. At this point Pao now had been characterized as someone who cries for discrimination for money as well as an ""sjw"" who wanted to instill safe spaces.  The third and perhaps most damning one was the statement to the media immediately following that announcement. Her stating that reddit's goals were not to be a completely free speech platform erased any hope for connection between reddit users and pao. In the wake of that article people reposted yishan's ""we stand for free speech"" memo. (This also evidence against a racist motives against pao).  Ultimately they found pao to not be for free speech on reddit, that is what the majority of users disliked about pao.   It is up to you to decide if that is an appropriate reason to dislike her. However IMO that is the majority reason why the users disliked pao.  The hate was obviously unnecessary and wrong. And that is something the reddit community needs to work on. But the hate for pao wasn't one you can reduce to just sexism and racism.

Much like Anita Sarkesian, any woman pointing to gender disparity -- whether real or perceived -- gets a lot of vitriolic hate around some circles of reddit, and that spreads through insular reinforcement and confirmation bias: ""I know those types of women, and Pao clearly fits the profile because everyone else seems to think so and if everyone is saying it, it must be true."" Regardless of the merits of that case, it seemed to be a pivotal starting point for a lot of the hatred of Pao. And while I'm sure there are some redditors knowledgeable about that case, the majority are probably more influenced by community consensus.  That's not to say that there weren't legitimate reasons to be upset with her as CEO, but the disparity between Pao and Ohanian has a lot to do with first impressions: reddit had a bad first impression of Pao, but are more inclined to give Ohanian the benefit of the doubt, and those both informed a lot of subsequent impressions of the two."

TheoryOfReddit,3da5lz,autopornbot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:19:08 2015 UTC,"The solution to this is easy.  Allow member and subreddit filtering.  Hide subreddits you dislike, and filter any comments from those subscribed to them.  This way reddit doesn't lose anything diversity wise, while making the experience pretty and safe for those that get uptight over whatever they chose to be uptight about.  I personally want an age filter.  Under 22?  Filter.  This way what's seen is what one prefers to see, without sacrificing the diversity of the user base.  I am not racist, but I personally am interested in what communities like that are like.  A lot of what I take from reddit IS being able to witness fringe communities to get a better understanding of what their hot topics and arguments are, and disprove them.    If you want a win win win solution implement this easy change, and the whole community will benefit in more ways than trying to keep hate away, while simultaneously supporting that purpose.  Do it.  The majority love unfiltered, and this is a site to learn what other corporate entities shouldn't allow.  So the community moves on.    People want to express ideas and argue, and the moment you start to police the conversations, the Internet will find an alternative.  The users provide the content, and you provide a message board for discussion.  It will not be hard to reproduce, and when the community leaves, reddit dies, just like digg.  Setup filtering.

Shitty management and poor treatment of mods was. Victoria being fired and it just being dropped on mods of /r/AMA with no warning was just the final straw.   No one cares who fired her, or really even why. I think most redditors like Victoria and would like her to have stayed on, but we don't know exactly why she was fired. And it's CN's right to fire employees. They fucked over the user base for far too long, though, and that is the problem.   Pao was CEO, which means she was responsible for guiding the direction of the company, and is sort of the top manager. So when the site is falling apart in ways that cause a mass rebellion, she holds a lot of responsibility. Add to that her pushing for censorship, which most redditors disagree with, and the fact that she's generally a scummy person (see fake discrimination lawsuit to recoup money lost in her husband's failed ponzi scheme), and it's clear that she just was cancer for this site.   And Pao was just a part of the problem. She did more harm than good, but the general direction of the site going to shit is ultimately the fault of CN. So getting a better CEO should be a step in the right direction, we'll see if they follow through with more repair.

It does not.  The entire purpose of free speech is that no one is preventing you from speaking. The fact that the public can say ""I don't want to listen to what you have to say"" -- however they may make that judgment -- has no bearing on whether or not speech is free. When some guy on the street is protesting and you walk by without listening, his freedom of speech is not being violated -- you just also have the right to ignore him.  The whole idea of the public forum is that anyone can have their say and the ideas will compete, and upvoting or downvoting is a literalization of that. Free speech only says that you have the right to have your say; if the audience boos you, your speech is not ""un-free"", but merely unpopular. Ultimately, freedom also means that others are free to ignore you, disapprove of you, or shout over you.  The echo chamber effect is indeed a problem, but that's a problem of community, not freedom."
TheoryOfReddit,3dbtdk,AhhhBROTHERS,4,Wed Jul 15 02:35:32 2015 UTC,"What if people voted on subreddits just like they do with any other content on this site? /u/spex said:  'The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.  Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen: These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It’s something we’ve been thinking about for quite some time. We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.'  I agree that these are complicated things for the site as a whole, but I think that trying to establish and enforce a single policy geared towards screening obscene/hateful/harassing content would be extremely difficult to apply consistently.   So why not let the community vote on what we view as being content that doesn't remotely benefit the community, or promotes hate speech and discrimination? Why not let 'wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities' play a role in determining which content we want in our communities?  I get that letting the community vote on the relative  appropriateness of content could lead to disastrous results in the eyes of a for profit company... but if reddit as a whole can't vote to ban vile subreddits (you know some of the ones I'm referring to) or blatantly vile posts, then the viability of reddit as a reliable revenue stream for Advance Publications has probably been in question for a while anyways.

I think he sees the world in the same way I do, but he just takes the exact opposite stance that I do and it's utterly infuriating. Chu's take on Reddit (fuck you I'm not linking it) is that the culture of Web 2.0 is fundamentally incompatible with corporate culture. Web 2.0 sites cannot be monetized in any of the traditional ways. The only *chan site that's actually profitable to my knowledge is 420chan, and their income is based on literally extorting pornographers. Twitter and facebook rely heavily on advertisers, but their status as a web 2.0 site is questionable. Tumblr is hardly profitable either, and their community's reputation has been a major obstacle to growth.   The point is, websites need to find a new method of monetization. Crowdfunding works well, but unfortunately patreon, gratipay, and even paypal have decided that they'll actively curate who can use their services. Bitcoin is nice, but fundamentally unstable. Ultimately there's very little reason to suggest that Web 2.0 is profitable at the moment. Perhaps innovators like weev or hotwheels can find a way, but I'm a bit skeptical about that."
TheoryOfReddit,3dbtdk,Eyght,4,Wed Jul 15 05:32:04 2015 UTC,"If I were to make Reddit a successful business, I'd take inspiration from someone like Malcolm McLaren. He took something that a majority of people absolutely hated, sold it to the youth of the time and made a huge amount of money. Maybe more importantly: he changed the culture of music and fashion itself.      The main (and arguably only) difference is that he had a well defined product to sell -- something Reddit lacks. But is it really that difficult to come up with a product? Reddit gold is basically just a glorified donation. It's nice to have the option, but it isn't exactly the sexiest of things to buy."
TheoryOfReddit,3dbtdk,t0liman,3,Wed Jul 15 09:42:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about McLaren (sex pistols, NYDolls i know, but the fashion ?_? i suppose it was the rebelling UK punk 70s)   If i had to guess, he's the father of punk / new wave then ? it's out of my wheelhouse, the wikipedia article paints a rather petty picture of his personality.  i would say that reddit has a long road ahead to monetize the userbase. web 2.0's reliance on social networking also means it has to act as a service, not a product.   creating an income from a service is a problem of either taxation or crowd assistance, or commercial content interleaved into the same domain, i.e. reddit Business vs Reddit regular, would be an odd paradigm.  The exception could be search, indexing or affiliate content,   Google, before they implemented adwords, had no solid revenue stream. now it makes billions.   Web 2.0 Sites and Programs acting as utilities like Skype, ICQ, and Norton (sic), have ventured into the ""business"" vs soho/retail products. and while this jump is justified as a software utility, it's arguable how much success ICQ for business or Skype for Business achieved without their counterpart.   Still, Very few sites acting as a service or index have successfully jumped from service to product, so few as to make the realistic proposition admirable. but, that's a long bow to draw.   Crowdfunding has so much more potential, sites like blizzard watch are funded from patreon, other podcasts and sites are funded with indiegogo, there's also bitcoin crowdfunding sites (they might still be around ...) and it's nearly impossible to leverage without an effort of the community of users to donate on a regular basis.   The other problem of sites like reddit is, they don't monetize commercial use, i.e. newspapers, facebook entries, corporate blogs like gawker, mary sue, etc. that get their news wholesale from community posts without linking or referring to content obtained from tumblr, facebook, twitter, and reddit. this ""sharing"" as a community could be monetized i suppose, but this would also lead to an inferential complex"

I would say that the tree does not make a sound when it falls in the forest and there is nobody to hear it.   This is the difference between free speech and free thought. For example, your definition of free speech could include a system where you can type out whatever you want, but you can't click the submit button unless XYZ.  In other institutions they uphold ""free speech"" this is normally not an issue because [theoretically] there is nothing stopping people on the street from hearing and partaking in discussion with corner yellers.   I would contend that speech requires two parts: a speaker and a practical possibility for an audience. Reddit is designed such that  it is practically difficult for people to listen to all but a vocal minority.  Many comments in askreddit threads are buried so deep that is isn't practical to see them.  Perhaps I am debating less with the ""free speech"" wording and more with the ""free speech platform"" in that it is a relatively poor way to disseminate opinions that don't ""conform""  I just reread this and I sound like a communist."
TheoryOfReddit,3dbtdk,PrivateChicken,5,Thu Jul 16 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"I'll get to free speech in a moment, but first I think it's relevant to take a look at democracy on websites like Reddit or Yik Yak, and their intended and actual effects. Often times we think voting, democracy and equality walk hand in hand. Afterall if everyone's upvotes are equal, that's leveling the playing field right?  However, in practice democracy contributes to equality far less than we might imagine. On their own, democratic systems fail to level playing fields, instead they make them bumpier, and can even exaggerate preexisting biases in that field. While we don't usually think of democracy this way, it's not to hard to see it in practice. Just think about all the entrenched gate keepers in American politics that exist not because of authoritarianism, but because of freedom.  So how does this apply to free speech and Reddit? Currently Reddit's free speech looks a lot like traditional western free speech: external accumulated influence, the zealousness of your own supporters, and the implicit biases of the userbase at large are the primary factors determining visibility (probably in that order, if I had to hypothesis).  So it's clear that Reddit has combined ""freedom"" and ""speech"" as far as our traditional understanding of it. While that free speech might be libertarian it isn't actually very egalitarian. And lots of people are fine with that. You may have noticed that libertarianism is very popular on Reddit. Who would of guessed that a website with a design that rewards that attitude would attract so many users with it?  Perhaps you feel that this application of ""freedom"" doesn't actually fit your goals. Maybe you were truly interested in a platform that levels the playing field in practice. If that's the case, then a voting system probably isn't part of the equation for that platform.  You might be interested in this video from PBS Idea channel about upvotes and their relation to political science. I'll confess that most of this comment was a directly inspired by that video. I think it's well worth the watch, at the very least for chewing on the idea even if you reject the host's conclusions."
TheoryOfReddit,3dbtdk,PrivateChicken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:52:24 2015 UTC,"I actually wasn't talking about the voting system so much as the subreddit system. The admins allow a lot of freedom at the site level, and the userbase has a wide range of different views.

TheoryOfReddit,3dbtdk,NotEtreo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:57:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't agree that's a problem with Reddit specifically, but the internet generally. It's unique that Reddit houses all those well defined spaces under one domain name, but the formation of echo chambers is unavoidable when you're free to ingest any content or partake in any community you like. If Reddit axed every white supremacy sub tomorrow, Stormfront wouldn't go away.  Do you feel that Facebook or Twitter or Tumbler avoid this problem? In my experience they don't. The divisions are less obvious, but communities still exist, and clash about as often. I think that if Reddit is a terrible platform for free speech because of subreddits, then the internet is simply inherently bad for free speech because creating your own forum is isn't significantly different in effect than creating your own subreddit, although the costs to the creator are different."
TheoryOfReddit,3dbtdk,dripdroponmytiptop,4,Wed Jul 15 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"Reddit's an intermediary between Tumblr and 4chan, I've always thought. Tumblr is the extreme end of the subjectivity scale, insofar as it's all blog/diary format and so very centred around who is making the point. We see that alot on news subs, with the outright banning of Breitbart and certain other sources from the URL whitelists. Reddit skews this way chiefly with the karma system, which encourages the sort of circlejerking that the identity-centric tumblr blogs do, albeit in a different form. 4chan exists at the other end of the scale, with the content being the only thing that represents a poster. No accounts, no user-created boards, just a fixed infrastructure and very little moderation. The forum-type layout of Reddit bears more resemblance here, and for me it's the only thing that makes the site bearable. There are very few usernames that I see and instantly recognise (GallowBoob, Warlizard perhaps) but even then there's barely any I've spoken to or know anything about.   So yeah. One could argue that reddit does encourage free speech by allowing all communities a place to exist (well, most). But places for debate are limited. Subs do exist though, I've found /r/politicaldiscussion among others to be rather good, and you can remove downvotes from the CSS. On the whole, however, it scores like a 5/10 on conduciveness to free speech."

Now you're painting those who disagree with the admin's hypothetical comparatively heavy handed moderation as white supremacists.     The administration of reddit isn't paying an employee to run a funny novelty; they are paying an employee to develop and train a Markov-chain powered Spamfilter heuristic that mathematically, statistically, analyses the characteristics of the writings typified in each of various subreddits.  Developing stylistic signatures. Performing author recognition. This ""experiment"" has been running, training on data, for months. The purpose is to provide a way for AutoModerator to recognise a variety of characteristics of authors, of their writing styles.

Also, once again you've managed to inject your biased 'people who are against what the admins do are white supremacists' view into a post ostensibly about hypothetical methods the reddit admins could 'better' moderate the site.     Separate hypothesis: They will almost certainly need to introduce a change to the way voting works, in order to choke out vote brigaders harassing users anonymously — in order to vote on comments, you're going to have to get voted on positively by the community at large, up to a certain threshold — effectively having the community vet new user accounts. In addition, if you and an insular group of friends all pretty much exclusively vote-jerk each other in one or three subreddits, and no-one else does — congrats, that won't qualify you, because you're not being trusted/vetted by the community at large.     Further demonstrating you have no idea what you're talking about, you've started a hypothesis with almost certainly, and I don't see how limiting the ability of new accounts to vote affects their ability to harass other users.

A great example of this are the subreddits devoted to parenting; the quality of the conversations here are much higher than those in BabyCenter's default communities, to name a specific example. Lots of women in particular are craving these more intelligent conversations, but they don't want to be bothered by all the other stuff on Reddit and are put off by the website's reputation. Expectant moms are also a really hot demographic for advertisers, because they spend TONS of money. That could be a huge source of new users and revenue for Reddit, if they cleaned up and started promoting these smaller subreddits.   There's plenty more interesting content that doesn't come from the more controversial users on the site; content like what I've listed above is extremely useful, in addition. Reddit could become a hub of interesting and useful content, which would be a big draw for many people (as much or more than the ability to see and discuss things that would give your grandmother a heart attack).

Reddit can acquire new users by advertising, just like any other business. Also through word of mouth, which it is currently not getting from women like me because at this point in time I would not admit to being a Reddit user in public. I don't even remember how I first stumbled onto Reddit, but though I have found it to be great in many respects, the vitriol and creepiness women often encounter when they go onto many of the default subs (even avoiding the smaller, more ridiculous subs like TRP) is enough to turn a lot of people off. If Reddit got rid of that stuff, a lot of those users would start spending more time elsewhere (even if they did remain here part of the time), and the content would diversify and, I think, become more welcoming for other types of potential users.    But subs like /r/DarkEnlightenment are a great aggregator for far-right content and allow pretty quality far-right discussion. My genuine concern is that they'll be removed for having the wrong politics rather than any particularly obnoxious behavior.   As much as I don't agree with far-right politics (I am a proud member of the reality-based community), I don't think subs will be banned as long as they aren't overtly hateful or violent. I just now glanced at their sidebar, though, and it does seem like they're dabbling in some racist and sexist pseudoscience, which is really unfortunate. (I almost started to respect them, and then I saw that and realized their critical thinking skills and knowledge of history are not up to snuff.) I don't think anyone's trying to ban political ideologies; I really wouldn't expect that sub to be on the chopping block, even with that stuff (unless that's actually a big part of what they're discussing, and they're prescribing things like forced repatriation or other violent remedies for the problems they see, in which case to hell Voat with them)."

So, um, by your outsider perspective you have deemed sarcastic mockery subs to be worse than racism?  Here's a lovely little Martin Luther King quote for you addressing exactly your kind of attitude:   I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.  I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive.   So there you have it.   You didn't address what I said. You focused the discussion on me instead.    I was trying to get you to focus on what you're saying. Because it lacks all sense of perspective. Here's a free bit of it: If you're comparing something to racism, most things are less bad than racism. Just ask the mods of r/blackladies and how ""casual"" and ""insignificant"" and ""don't leave their little whole"" the reddit racists are.   Not to mention you said it in a way that is almost identical to the other meta people who have responded. Do you guys pride yourself on using the same memes and methods of disinformation?   I can say exactly the same thing for you, dude. I argue with passive-aggressiveness now, because there's too many of people like you thoughtlessly spouting the same fucking idiotic clichés and fallacies to individually ""debate"" - which most of you don't care about at all, you just want an audience for your shitty views.

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,cluelessperson,3,Wed Jul 15 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"Dogma > critical thinking Right? Nope. That's just you imagining things.   Uh huh. That's why there's preemptive bans. Bans for counter opinions. Bans because the mods feel like it.  Definitely a free exchange of ideas! No rhetoric or dogma there.    So, um, by your outsider perspective you have deemed sarcastic mockery subs to be worse than racism?   For reddit? Absolutely. Those sarcastic mockery subs are the primary individuals who brigade, go to other subreddits to harass and bully people.    Racism exists. But constant meta brigades are a bigger issue for reddit's functionality.  Massively altering upvotes and downvotes derails organic discussion.

Just ask the mods of r/blackladies and how ""casual"" and ""insignificant"" and ""don't leave their little whole"" the reddit racists are.   I'm sure harassment of /r/blackladies requires a dozen meta circlejerk subreddits to come to its rescue!   I never said harassment and hate don't exist. I said meta redditors armed with dogma instead of critical thinking brigade, derail, bully, harass and hate as much as anybody.    Worse.  Because they use the words, harassment, racism, sexism, and hate so often to describe everything-- they start using it to describe everything.    I can say exactly the same thing for you, dude. I argue with passive-aggressiveness now, because there's too many of people like you thoughtlessly spouting the same fucking idiotic clichés and fallacies to individually ""debate"" - which most of you don't care about at all, you just want an audience for your shitty views.

I don't try to recruit like minded individuals to try and skew voting and participation.

The roots of GG lie in the idiocy of the games media. It started with TheZoePost, at least only temporarily. Zoe Quinn is an abusive, awful human being, and people were right to be upset about TZP. That the media wasn't talking about this was also infuriating. But anyone familiar with the internet news cycle knows that they could have just sat on the story and let it pass, and the whole thing would have faded away. Instead, they did the dumbest thing possible, they fired back. See, actual reactionaries and conservatives like me do make up a significant portion of gaming. Maybe not a majority, but enough to be a vocal minority. When the media put out those ""Gamers are dead"" pieces, they meant to specifically target people like me. But in the process, they overplayed their hand and attacked pretty much every gamer, even the ones who don't agree with me. Throw in the fact that none of these media people seem remotely capable of having a positive, rational discussion, and now you have a bunch of people who would have otherwise been innocent bystanders now pissed off and in on the fight. And while they still aren't susceptible to hardcore /pol/ content, they are more willing to listen when we point out how destructive and stupid the average SJW is, because they've now become targeted by them. At this point, we hardly have to do anything other than continue to piss SJWs off and get them to show the world how unpleasant they can be."

The only exception is the doxxing rule.   illegal & abhorrent content   I thought I agreed with you until you put these two adjectives together. I hate the abhorrent content on this site as much as anyone (I'm a proud member of the ACLU and resident of the most infamously liberal city in the United States), but conflating it with illegal content does no good for our cause. That gets us onto the same slippery slope that bedevils all conversations about censorship -- who decides what is abhorrent? Whoever is currently CEO? The moderators of SRS? Registered Democrats? The moderators of coontown? Should we put it up for a vote? Censorship only serves to further the agenda of the censor, and I'm don't think I'd even give myself that power. The ACLU put it best.  ""Over the years, the ACLU has frequently represented or defended individuals engaged in some truly offensive speech. We have defended the speech rights of communists, Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, accused terrorists, pornographers, anti-LGBT activists, and flag burners. That’s because the defense of freedom of speech is most necessary when the message is one most people find repulsive. Constitutional rights must apply to even the most unpopular groups if they’re going to be preserved for everyone.""  On the other hand, the line between illegal and abhorrent content is often hazy. I can think of real life examples of this but none on Reddit. Can you think of any subreddits that straddle this line?"

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,TheRedditPope,29,Tue Jul 14 18:16:00 2015 UTC,"Reddit is an open platform that supports free speech.  This means offensive and despicable speech as well.  Don't like it?  There are plenty of non-open platforms for you to go to - just make sure you toe the line.  To come to a stated open forum and complain about its openness says to me you don't actually understand or support the concept of free speech.  ""They can just go to voat,"" and what when you and your ilk show up there demanding once again censorship for the greater good?    I hate this stupid argument people parrot from xkcd that squelching speech is ok as long as its done by private entities.  That logic is exactly the same as saying, ""Hey, if my private restaurant wants to only serve whites, that's fine because it ain't Government racism.""  What good are governmental assurances of racial equality when a black man can't find a place to shop?  What good are government assurances of free speech when certain undesirable opinions have no place they can be discussed because whenever an open forum emerges, YOU come in and make sure it closes.  If it's desirable for one private entity to shut its doors on dissenting thought, why not all of them?  Why not have every ISP refuse to host or transmit hate webpages?   Why not have every publisher refuse to publish hate books?  Don't worry, you still have free speech because it's not the government stifling it!  Either you believe in free speech and thus that open forums like reddit should exist, or you don't.  If you believe in free speech, then don't come into the open sewer of ideas and complain about the smell.  They should go elsewhere?  YOU should go elsewhere!  At least the bigots at coontown don't try to shut down all the black-oriented and black pride subreddits.    If you believe in free speech, you must believe open platforms should exist.  If you believe open platforms should exist, you should favor that there actually exists one.  Reddit is one such.  Question: if Reddit shouldn't be open, why should voat?  Because most of reddit doesn't agree with coontown?  Neither does most of voat.  Where does it end?    At the end of day, if you support free speech in theory, you should support free speech in practice: reddit.  If you don't support free speech in practice, you don't support free speech in theory.  The whole point of free speech is you don't get to determine what speech is ok or not.      EDIT: Now that I'm off the train, let me expand a bit on all this and maybe explain why I'm so vehement in my defense of reddit as an open platform here.  There are plenty of closed platforms on the internet.  A hyperoverabundance of them, really.  And that's fine.  I don't think a Christian theology discussion board would be much improved for its purposes by allowing atheists to post there challenging everything and I'm an atheist myself.  So if some atheist started making a ruckus about how a Christian theology board was ""censoring"" them, I wouldn't pay them much mind.    But by the same token that I don't support people going to closed, purpose driven forums and trying to make them open, I'm wary of people coming into open platforms and trying to make them closed.  Reddit was explicitly founded as an open market of ideas - not a safe space.  So for people who came here because it's open, to see people try to close it to make it ""safe"" is very, very disconcerting.  Especially since so many other open forums have already capitulated to the safe space invaders.  It's not hard to see that the end goal of these types - your types, if you'll forgive my hamhanded strawman ad hominem - is to see every space made equally safe for their views and equally unsafe for any others.    I view bad ideas much like diseases.  Nazism is like the bubonic plague - let it run rampant and you get millions dead.  But, nowadays, if I catch the plague I just take a course of antibiotics.  If Nazism is a cancer, it's a benign one and in remission.  It's one we can treat.  The NeoNazis will never win.  They will never take over like they did before.  You and I won't let them, because we know them to be a disease.  So it's fine to let them be a tumor way off in some dank corner of the bowels of the internet - the surgery to remove them would cause more harm than it would prevent.  Nazism is a bad idea and defeated one.  We know how to fight it, so it doesn't scare me.   The idea that we need to censor and suppress - punish - our fellow citizens for expressing unpalatable views is also a bad idea, and quite an old one too.  Yet, like many cancers, its treatment eludes us and it arises again and again to spread its malignancy.  So we fire people and hound them from all industries for making racist comments in private texts.  So we try to drive nobel prize scientists from their profession for making bad jokes or, maybe, wearing tasteless shirts.      I find your ideas to be substantially more dangerous than those expressed on stormfront or coontown.  Your bad ideas are new and undefeated and look good, just like Nazism looked good when it was building the autobahn and raising the Weimar republic out of an economic crisis.  Because it looks good, your cancer is malignant, and spreads.  Because your ideas are like SARS.  Sure, SARS could never kill as many people as plague did - but we don't know how to stop it, and we're not really sure how bad it could get.    When a Nazi tries to spread his contamination, he is laughed at.  Maybe we humor him by letting him rant a little, but nobody takes him seriously.  We're immune.  We've been vaccinated.  When you try to spread your brand of totalitarianism, careers are destroyed, lives are ruined, and one more bastion of free speech becomes a walled garden for ""tolerance and equality.""    So yeah, losing free speech on the internet is a flu, and the KKK is polio.  But we cured polio, and the flu's still around.  But even though I think your totalitarian attitude towards differing opinions and ""hate speech"" is pernicious and dangerous and a disease on the body politic - I don't want it censored!  Yes, I want your ideas to fail.  But I want them to fail in the arena of ideas - the open markets and sewers of free speech - not because every time you tried to express them somebody deleted them and shadowbanned your account.  I want people to see what you have to say and  reject your ideas because they are wrong, and thus be immunized against them.    Because that's one thing I think you don't understand - letting people be exposed to bad ideas makes bad ideas weaker, not stronger.  If you coddle people from any untoward thought, they lose all critical faculties and are vulnerable to any cult or hate group that comes around, anybody who can package totalitarianism in a nice sounding package - censorship as making ""safe spaces,"" for example.  They are idea-immunocompromised, just as you would be immunocompromised if you grew up in a sterile bubble.  We NEED to let people be exposed to bad ideas so that they can recognize other bad ideas.  Because bad ideas never seem like bad ideas to those who have them.  Nazism doesn't scare me.  Because we're immunized, because a right thinking individual is unlikely to fall prey to it.  Your ideas DO scare me.  Because I don't get the impression at all that you're an unusually wicked or stupid person.  Indeed, you seem very smart and dedicated to the public good, which is fantastic!   And yet you advocate for a disease.    That's why this censorship scares me.  Because it's not so obviously wrong that honest, smart, and decent people won't fall prey to it.  Because it SOUNDS good!    I mean, anti-racism, who could be against that?   Who could be against rebuilding our great German nation?"
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Drinniol,8,Tue Jul 14 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"In amongst your most excellent polemic, I was struck by this;   the open markets and sewers of free speech    I think that that metaphor is particularly apt; and one of the issues, as demonstrated by the FPH banning; when you say 'these sewers are full of shit' and fill in the sewers, you tend to end up with your streets full of shit."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,moratnz,9,Tue Jul 14 23:34:29 2015 UTC,"This is a very thoughtful and well-reasoned argument, and I want to say first that I agree with it in the most abstract - abhorrent speech shouldn't be banned, it should be allowed to compete and falter in an ""arena of ideas"".  People with an intellectual curiosity about challenging viewpoints should be allowed to observe, interact, and even ""try out"" those viewpoints and reach their own conclusions.  As I said, I agree with all of this - strongly - in the abstract.  Unfortunately, we live in a real world populated by irrational actors and bastardized versions of our Platonic ideals.  As a result, where I think this idea falls short is the expectation that Reddit (or any single entity) carries a burden of responsibility to enable the full spectrum of free speech.  Dichotomizing the issue into ""you're always for full freedom of speech everywhere all the time without limitation or else you're against free speech"" ignores some practical realities.  The first (and perhaps most important) reality is scarcity... and I use that term in its economic sense.  Reddit (and the Internet, for that matter) is a finite resource, no matter how much it may seem otherwise.  There are staff to be paid, servers to be housed and powered, bandwidth to be supplied, and so forth.  If faced with a choice between continuing to supply manpower / CPU cycles / bandwidth to provide a free platform for hate groups out of a desire for ideological purity vs. having enough money to continue to exist, I know which choice I'd want Reddit to make.  And when advertisers are needed to pay their bills and more users are needed to attract advertisers, the only way to spur that growth is to severely curtail the content that would drive those populations away.  It may be ideologically imperfect and blunt - reality frequently is - but sometimes the least healthy bits need to be cut away to allow what remains to flourish.  I'd rather have 95% of Reddit than no Reddit.    Lest we feel too bad for those who get branded as ""objectionable"" in that scenario, those communities would have every right to reconvene in some other virtual place (at least in the US and other countries that guarantee free speech).  A place, importantly, where they aren't competing for resources with the content that makes Reddit so important to the vast majority of its users.  I think the second issue that bears consideration is whether or not an ""arena of ideas"" actually exists in reality or is just a really pleasant thought exercise.  Sure, in a perfect meritocracy, ideas would be born and either thrive or die out solely on their merits (or lack thereof).  Unfortunately, a perfect meritocracy is as much of a fantasy as any work of fiction - nice to think about, good to strive for, but ultimately at odds with human nature as we presently know it.  We don't see virtual recruiting fairs where multiple subreddits with differing worldviews politely compare and contrast their thinking with each other in a grand ""arena""; we see echo chambers designed to attract people predisposed to a certain way of thinking, reinforce their beliefs, and establish communities that normalize increasingly extreme behavior... much like Madrassa with a radical Imam (or, if someone wants to try to find implied bias in that example, then substitute ""Fox News"").   There are many other such points, but for the sake of brevity I leave it at these two, which I think make my point adequately.  Hopefully you can see another fellow free speech advocate's point-of-view:  providing protection for free speech is critical for a healthy society, but it's unrealistic to expect that any single private entity that should have to bear the entirety of that burden."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Stonevulture,8,Wed Jul 15 03:08:52 2015 UTC,"Dichotomizing the issue into ""you're always for full freedom of speech everywhere all the time without limitation or else you're against free speech"" ignores some practical realities.   Well, of course there are legal limits to free speech. Libel and slander laws are limits on free speech. Conspiracy and incitement-to-violence laws can make certain speech illegal. Copyright and trademark laws limit speech. False advertising. Threats. Obscenity and child-pornography laws. Perjury laws. And that's before we get to ""shouting 'fire' in a crowded theater."" No one advocates ""full freedom of speech everywhere all the time without limitation.""  Reddit's published policies do not unambiguously say that illegal content or links to illegal content will be removed when reported to admins, but Reddit states that it reserves the right to remove such content.  This, it seems to me, is pretty much the ideal policy. All of those kinds of content are illegal for good reason. Reddit's statement that it may remove such content is better than a pledge that it will always remove such content, because keeping such a pledge would require an onerous manual filtering mechanism that would surely fail in practice.  I think most redditors would agree that illegal speech should be removed from the site when brought to the attention of mods and administrators. And that most other posts and comments are fine.  The gray area, the one showing up in most of the comments here, is hate speech. This seems a gray area.  The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently concluded that hate speech is constitutionally protected. In 1969's Brandenburg v. Ohio decision, the court protected the Ku Klux Klan's right to hate speech, even speech that explicitly advocated the use of force and violation of the law. In 2011's Snyder v. Phelps, it afforded the same protection to Westboro Baptist Church's protest at the funeral of a gay serviceman.  The court noted in both cases that hate speech can be suppressed only when it crosses the established line between protected and unprotected speech; for example, when it is intended to incite imminent violence. In such a case, existing laws against inciting illegal behavior are sufficient. No new theory of illegal hate speech is necessary.  This is the right decision, and again, it seems that most people in this discussion agree with it. It's not hate speech per se that people object to, but hate speech that seems likely to inspire imminent violent action.  This policy seems correct but difficult to enforce. Determining whether a particular message or comment constitutes ""fighting words"" or illegal incitement according to legal standards will always be tricky. That's why the legal test calls for judges, advocates, and juries to explore the facts and the limits of the law's applicability.  It's surprising how explicitly the law protects calls to violence or illegal behavior. Here's what the Supreme Court wrote in the Ku Klux Klan majority opinion:     [T]he constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.   With these words the court established a two-part test: (1) The speech much be intended to incite or produce imminent lawless action; (2) the speech is likely to produce lawless action. That's a pretty high standard.  Of course, there is no reason that Reddit's rules should mirror U.S. laws regarding free speech. The posting policies at most websites go substantially further than the law. And indeed, Reddit rules prohibit spamming, vote manipulation, and doxing, which are nonetheless legally protected free speech. Should Reddit's users demand it, moderators and admins could implement a policy banning hate speech. This, I believe, is the proposal being debated in this discussion.  For what it's worth, even though I am a woman of color and I have been subjected to hate speech here and in real life, I do not favor a Redditwide ban on hate speech.  1990's Encyclopedia of the American Constitution says hate speech includes ""communications of animosity or disparagement of an individual or a group on account of a group characteristic such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual orientation."" In American law, hate speech has been linked to particular groups of people who have been subject to widespread systemic discrimination. According to this standard, racist remarks qualify as hate speech, while fat-shaming - while no less shameful - is not hate speech. However, a definition of hate speech could in principle be conceived sufficiently widely to incorporate fat-shaming and other types of hateful speech.  Were hate speech to become verboten at Reddit, it would be incumbent on policymakers to compile a comprehensive or illustrative list of groups of people who merit hate-speech protection. If we prohibit fat-shaming, then what shall we say to those who write that people with red hair lack souls? How do we justify protection for the overweight while leaving gingers to fend for themselves, except upon the murky, unenforceable truth that one ""feels"" like hate speech (to the person charged with enforcing the rules) while the other doesn't feel like hate speech? One reason not to ban hate speech is that without a sitewide list of groups one may not ridicule, content removal and user bans would necessarily be performed on a subjective, ad hoc basis.  Nor do I think compilation and adoption of a comprehensive list of safeguarded groups could be reasonably accomplished in any defensible way...and the process would surely include more than a little sturm und drang.  While I appreciate the intentions of those who would ban hate speech, I think ultimately Reddit's current tacit compliance with legal standards for free speech is close to ideal. Most of the commenters in this discussion seem to decry hate speech because it is likely to incite imminent violence or unlawful behavior. If speech that incites imminent violence or unlawful behavior is already banned (in accord with U.S. limits on free speech), then I think most redditors would be content to see the rest of the hate speech, no matter how distasteful, left alone."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,gwenthrowaway,2,Wed Jul 15 08:54:34 2015 UTC,I just want to say that your argument was very thorough and well-supported.

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,electric33l,6,Wed Jul 15 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"Good points.  I suppose I'd say that it feels to me that, for quite some time now, open spaces on the internet have been becoming less open, and this trend is only accelerating.  Why put up a stink at reddit being the latest casualty?  Why not?  Reddit was founded as a ""bastion of free speech"" after all.  There are plenty of open spaces left after reddit - but if those to fall to the same pressures, how long will this remain so?  I believe that free speech, warts and all, is valuable enough in its own right to be worth fighting for even if you take a beating for it.    But with the recent announcements, it appears that the current leadership in reddit no longer believe free speech is quite worth that cost to them.  That's certainly their right - but I hardly have to cheer at them for it.  I suppose there's not much for it but to fight it out, see what happens, and, if necessary, voat with my feet.    On your second point, indeed, free speech does have costs.  I won't ignore that.  If you let hate preachers preach hate, some people will get taken in by it who might not have otherwise.  This is certainly a true cost and downside to free speech.  That said, the benefits far outweigh it.    But even to that downside, it can be argued that banning certain types of speech or ideas paradoxically increases their allure.  Furthermore, by forcing certain groups underground, you only further insularize and radicalize them, and make it harder for those caught up in them by circumstance to escape.  I don't have great statistics to back this up (precisely because of the legal issue in question leading to underreporting), but it certainly seems like holocaust denialism is actually MORE prevalent in countries with laws against it than in countries without such laws (though the causality flows both way - high incidence of denialism creates pressure for legal action).    In a country with free speech, the holocaust denier spouts his nonsense and has it rebuked, refuted, and mocked.  Maybe he learns something, maybe he doesn't.  In countries without, he says nothing, because he doesn't want to get fined or go to jail or get put on a list.  He certainly doesn't have his beliefs challenged."

I just think that in Reddit's case in specific, they are a victim of their own success - the sidebar shows us every day how much Reddit Gold they have to sell just to keep the lights on.  If they decide that some content (including but not limited to illegal content) is too much of a drag on their ability to grow and thrive, then - unless we're willing to pay the bills - so be it.  Of course no one has to like it, and can voat with their feet or digg into alternatives, but I do think it's worth pointing out that what will have taken place is a variation of the ""free speech Thunderdome"" you referred to earlier - lots of forms of speech have competed for the right to exist on Reddit, and it seems some are about to be found lacking.  They have had their day in the arena of ideas and have likely lost... a sort of verbal Darwinism.  The fittest will continue to reproduce here at Reddit and the rest will have to find new homes.  Yes, free speech has a cost, and denying free speech has a cost.  And I agree that at a societal level, the cost of denying free speech is much more severe than the cost of allowing it.  It reminds me of the old Unix adage that's often attributed to Doug Gwyn:  ""Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things."" Still, I refer to my initial point - just because free speech is good for society doesn't mean that people should be obligated to build a business model around it.  And, whether we like to think of it that way or not, Reddit is a business.  Finally, let's extend the holocaust denier analogy a bit.  You say that in a country with free speech, the holocaust denier spouts his nonsense and gets rebuked.  I agree that he should have the right to spew his garbage and anyone else has the right to refute it.  But agreeing that he has the right to do so and choosing to invite him into my home for a dinner party or a book club meeting (even though those are expressly designed to be platforms for discussion that consume private resources, just like Reddit) are two very different things.  There's legal, and then there's moral.  People have the legal right to be assholes, but I don't have the legal or moral obligation to educate them or give them access to my home, my food, and my friends.  Ignoring or actively shunning them for their beliefs is just as acceptable a response to their reprehensible views.  Inviting someone like that to take part in a discussion at my home with my friends would be giving that person a platform they wouldn't have otherwise had, it would make some of my guests who I would personally consider more potentially valuable contributors to the discussions I was hoping to host feel unwelcome or even unsafe, and it risks normalizing their perspective or making me seem as though I implicitly think holocaust denial is an idea that has enough merit to be worth spending my resources on discussing.  Those costs would be far too high for me to bear, and if some people who have historically been valued participants in discussions at my house choose to leave on ideological grounds when I refuse the holocaust denier entry, then I will be disappointed but it won't change my faith in my decision.  That's where I believe the Reddit team is at right now."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Stonevulture,2,Wed Jul 15 14:57:46 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned, I think there's a large difference between opening a previously closed space (your home) and closing a previously open space (the town square or reddit).  Also, the relative amounts of material resources for you inviting a holocaust denier to dinner vs. reddit allowing offensive subreddits to exist are totally different scales.  It costs reddit much more in labor to police content than whatever fractions of pennies hosting a small subreddit costs.  But you know that and acknowledge the main cost is financial due to advertisers being reluctant to advertise on reddit if it has offensive content.  There's a lot to unpack with that thought, however.  Firstly, why should we just allow that these private actors support censorship?  Their reluctance to advertise on sites with offensive content comes from fear of consumer backlash.  If only consumers would be smart enough to support advertisers who support open platforms rather than the reverse!  In the end, it all comes down to which behaviors are, on net, supported or punished by the whole group.  Some people will leave reddit if it censors.  Some will leave if it doesn't.  Which group determines reddit's behavior?    Imagine a world where advertisers were as terrified of being seen as squelchers of unpopular speech as they are of having an ad accidentally appear on coontown.  But anyway - here is a matter of principle: if you cave to financial pressure over free expression once, why not again?  Even without coontown and fph and the like, do you really think reddit will be clean enough for most advertisers?  How long til the front page is ""curated"" to make sure stuff from, say, hailcorporate never appears?  Here's my opinion: it will never be enough.  The very instant an open platform shows it willingness to censor for money or to social pressure, they've signalled their weakness and now everyone has their own pet bugbear they want banned.  Previously, reddit could say to advertisers, ""Sorry, we're open, take it or leave it.""  Now advertisers and special interests can say, whenever they want something gone, ""We know you have a price, so let's hear it.""    Even banning for harassment opened up a can of worms, after fph was banned we had srs calling for mra subs to be banned, theredpill calling for srs's head, kotakuinaction and gamerghazi at each other's throats, and circlejerk furiously demanding that circlejerk be removed!  Previously, reddit could say, ""We don't pick sides"" and stay above the fray.  But as soon as they decide they're actively going to ""curate"" content, they're in the thick of it.  Now all the subreddits above fall under the umbrella of items I consider ""stupid internet bullshit,"" but the precedent is still terrible.  If reddit intercedes here, what will they do when palestinian and israeli subreddits mutually claim harassment, or when China demands a Tibetan nationalist subreddit be removed?  If reddit can't stand up to people whinging on twitter and blogs, how are they gonna stand up against an actual opponent?  And it will never be enough.  Reddit will never be ""safe"" for advertisers as long as it has even a modicum of its current system.  And remember - at the end of the day reddit is you and me.  If enough people and content leaves because of censorship - even censorship that doesn't apply to them directly - reddit loses money anyway.  Reddit turning on its ideals for money is bad.  Reddit turning on its ideals for nothing is worse.  Reddit turning on its ideals and ""digg""-ing its own grave, which is what seems most likely to me, is worst of all."

That is, I was in no way trying to evoke the cheap emotional reaction of, ""These dudes are just like Nazis!  Please boo.""  If it came off that way, I'm sorry.  I'm not sorry for using Nazis as an illustrative example.  The history of Nazism holds many lessons: how a seemingly benevolent movement can very quickly turn incredibly dangerous, the importance of actually paying attention to deeper ideology, how an idea can be so utterly discredited that even bringing up the word is a faux pas.  If you prefer, the history of the Soviet Union holds many similar lessons.  I doubt many of the workers who partipated in otherthrowing the Czar had Stalin's reign in mind, yet it happened.    You seem like a good person.  If you were the worst the current censorship movement had to offer, I wouldn't be nearly as concerned.  But it's not about you, it's about what kinds of evils you might accidentally unleash."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Drinniol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:11:34 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Sorry for comparing you to Nazis but yeah you're behaving like Nazis   If you were the worst the current censorship movement had to offer, I wouldn't be nearly as concerned. But it's not about you, it's about what kinds of evils you might accidentally unleash.   Dude it's the INTERNET. This is REDDIT. UNPLUG your computer for a bit. Go visit friends or family or your GF/BF or your old dog Matilda.  Come on. Staaahp.    Some distasteful subs are getting banned very soon. And yet, no one is going to the gulags. The world will continue to turn & you and me can still argue online.   Seriously, if you actually think like this you really need some perspective.   It's offensive (there's that word!) to compare our internet disputes to real people killed by totalitarian regimes."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,terminator3456,2,Wed Jul 15 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"You're really taking the analogy too far and too personally.  Nazism is useful because people know the story and the pattern of events has a certain structure.  Of COURSE our stupid internet forum argument isn't on the same scale.  It isn't supposed to be!  ""How ridiculous Newton to compare movement of planets to movements of objects in a vortex.  They aren't even close to the same scale!""  The analogy is about corruption of purpose and benign movements turning malignant once they obtain power.  I think it's more useful than an abstract made up example because it illustrates a thing that actually happened.  But ok whatever let's taboo Nazis and Soviets and Pol Pot and any real historical events because it's too emotionally charged.  I'm reminded of some phrase that goes like ""Something something history something doomed to repeat it"" but I can't quite remember it and I'm sure it's not important.  So anyway, suppose hypothetically we had an animal rights activist and an animal rights movement.  The animal rights activist joins up because the movement sponsors bills to protect animals and raises funds for animal sanctuaries.  This is all good.  What he doesn't pay attention to is the deeper ideology discussed behind closed doors about how animals are equal to people and farmers should be killed.  Because obviously that will never happen, that's crazy.  So anyway this activist raises money for the group.  A few weeks later they bomb a research lab and kill 10 people.    A well meaning individual supports a politician who imposes internet censorship in order to stop child pornography.  Half a year later small cup women are banned from porn due to looking too childlike.  Now that second example might seem ridiculous.  Indeed, if it hadn't pretty much actually happened, in Australia, it might be dismissed as ridiculous.  Which is why it is useful to make analogies to actual events people know about so that we're not just making shit up like, ""A well meaning reddit admin decides not to ban fph.  A fat person is then murdered by a mob of fph subscribers a week later.""    Consider this parallel analogy: ""A well meaning 4chan admin doesn't stop white supremacy posting on /pol/.  Later, a black church gets shot up by someone who frequented /pol/.""  Does this seem to have more weight to it?    See, made up analogies kinda lose a hell of a lot of argumentative force due to being... made up.  But any real scenario will involve real people and real harm and thus could be construed as offensive, I guess, because the harm we're discussing is still hypothetical.  But the whole point of all of these analogies is the rapid escalation of consequences that can ensue from new groups taking power who do not abide by certain constraints.    Reddit doesn't matter, but the larger trend of censorship in society of which reddit is one small part does.  Will reddit be a Stalingrad or a New Orleans levee?  Shit, sorry, there I go using history again.  What I meant was, will reddit be a hypothetical holdout who stops a seemingly inexorable social tide, or will it, by collapsing, lead to a domino effect of increased corporate and special interest control of internet speech?"

I do regret, in retrospect, my aggressive and confrontational tone.  I was unduly in the style of a political debate or rally.  It's bombastic and attention getting and great for rallying up supporters, but doesn't actually work well for convincing the actual opponent.  You said earlier you thought I had some interesting points and I'm thankful for your openness and consideration.  I also take your points seriously and admit that there is a serious argument to be had about what constitutes acceptable speech and when speech morphs from expression of thought to positive action inducing harm (like offering cash for murder)."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Drinniol,3,Wed Jul 15 18:21:11 2015 UTC,"So because there's no real consequences, you no longer favor free speech?  From what I understand, the concept of free speech being better than censorship is not an inalienable right of mankind.  Free speech leads to a better outcome for a society than censorship because it allows more creativity and conflict.  It is better a priori - regardless of level of persecution.   It's not a protection, rather it's a lack of protection that forces people outside their bubble and makes them deal with 'the unhappy thoughts'.  In my opinion, reddit has had a big influx of sheep and the sheep are taking over.  No conflict, no growth, please do not make me confront parts of reality that scare me!"
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Positronix,4,Wed Jul 15 02:47:51 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone say this as though it's something insightful?    To a lot of Redditors, it is.

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,terminator3456,5,Tue Jul 14 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"Um, the same philosophy does apply. Even the ACLU points this out here https://www.aclu.org/what-censorship   Private pressure groups, not the government, promulgated and enforced the infamous Hollywood blacklists during the McCarthy period.

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,rokuk,0,Tue Jul 14 20:32:38 2015 UTC,How do you not get that content doesn't hurt anyone? Don't visit those subreddits. It's as easy as that! Organized harassment should be the only reason to ban subs like FPH.
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Games4Life,11,Wed Jul 15 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"The subs exist to further their platform. Their members submit, vote, and comment in other subs. 17,000 coontown members can push all sorts of dog whistle and overt racism to the front page, making reddit a less welcoming place as a whole and hurting the site.   Stormfront has advocated exacty this technique for a long time and, slowly but surely, it's working. Posts about black-on-white violence and 'reverse-racism' are common on the defaults, as is overt racism in the comments of those posts. This pattern of using coontown, antipozi, European, etc. as the draw for fascists and then letting them passively alter the content of the front page for everyone has had a noticeable impact on the information presented to the average redditor (who is four time more likely to be a lurker than a commentor and, as such, sees only the front page.)  So, this content does hurt people. It isn't isolated to some dark corner of reddit only to be found by those who seek it out. It's pervasive in its reach in a subtle way and effects the narrative of this site for millions of registered and unregistered users every month."

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,TRVDante,4,Tue Jul 14 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"You confirmed my post with your own words;   Because as much as I appreciate Reddit's libertarian roots, those roots also mix with the more toxic libertine attitudes that allow such blatant degeneracy. It's why you get cesspools like /r/polyamory and /r/cuckold, because Reddit is an overly permissive society. As much as I appreciate how that permissiveness lets me and my associates operate without interference, it does allow a more problematic element that Reddit would be better off getting rid of.    From my perspective, you are that problematic element. A racist, sexist, homophobe operating in a place that never envisioned you being here. The difference between polyamorous people, cuckolds, and you is that they have no effect on you, despite your obsession with what they do in their own bedrooms. You, though, and ""[your] associates"" actively try to engage the reddit userbase to exclude them when it's you with an exclusionary worldview."

Not the worst thing in the world. If that becomes unacceptable to the leadership because of lost profits, they are free to change the site's policies and at that point it will be the money talking. If they decide that curtailing hate speech would hurt the bottom line more than letting it continue unabated, I am free to either stop using the site or blacklist it so I don't contribute to it financially."

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Games4Life,7,Wed Jul 15 15:38:08 2015 UTC,"I never said that they're automatically racist, but that they are frequently used as race baiting. Most murder in this country is intraracial, and homicide rates in general are far lower than they ever were. Black-on-white crime discussion on subs like worldnews is disproportionate to the actual rate of said black-on-white crime.   As for reverse racism, I just don't care about it. It's a stupid concept; racism is racism no matter who it's perpetrated against. But that doesn't change the fact that the perception of things like affirmative action is actually incongruous with how affirmative action works, at least currently."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,BasicLiftingService,3,Tue Jul 14 20:50:59 2015 UTC,Well when people bring up crime statistics I agree a lot of people in the defaults use it to race bait. But how do you differentiate between someone asking an innocent question or stating facts from someone using reddit as a platform to spread their racist ideals? Context clues and post history help but we know most redditors don't care and just agree and upvote.  I also agree reverse racism is a stupid term. But if I personally disagree with how affirmative action is handled does that make me a bad person?   It's not all black and white (pun semi-intended) and I wish we didn't have to worry about stormfront poisoning the well. But I truly think banning coontown and etc. is not the right thing to do. We need to continue to try and educate not 'delete' the problem and hope it goes away.
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Games4Life,6,Wed Jul 15 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"I personally disagree with how affirmative action is handled does that make me a bad person?   Not at all. We can totally disagree and respect each others opinion. I find it troubling that differences in opinion on reddit are so often perceived as some kind of personal attack. I'd offer you a beer if we were having this discussion in person.  I think an engaged user base and some heavy-handed anti-brigading tools are probably the best way to deal with this situation. A strong stance on brigading would please both sides of the ideological fence, hopefully reducing polarizing subs (specifically the chimpire and fempire) influence on the discussion. Then reasonable people like you and I could have reasonable disagreements in a reasonable manner."
TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,BasicLiftingService,3,Wed Jul 15 02:03:44 2015 UTC,I believe that could work. Now the admin team implementing that correctly... I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

It's a private company, and aren't bound by the first amendment, but it's clear that half the community wants that same application to reddit, or they will go elsewhere. It means, yes. SJW and coontown will still be here, but all that happens with banning them is they just spread elsewhere, it doesn't go away. It's the exact way that those college and social media echo chambers happen. everyone just wants offensive things NIMBY... then next thing you know everyone has no idea about anything outside of them. higher standard? They literally created an architecture, not a site, not social media, just an architecture for people to congrigate and discuss things, with as much granularity as they like. it's not tied to a single site, so if communities become too toxic to your liking, and theres enouhg of you... you can start another.   Great example. Red pill. Lots of 21 year old virgins in there, young, dumb and full of cum. Most older guys who have families and lives don't feel like the bravado is useful. they made married RP... now it's a bunch of toned down language, basically RP without the machismo. then some guys on there have open relationships, but it goes against most MRP tennants of fix your marriage if you can, but be prepared to leave if you must, so they made their own, specifically for poly relationships. Gay people made their own, and the wives and girlfreinds made their own RP women.  You couldn't get that with a normal forum.  But lets say you exclude things that offend you. lets say you have a gendered studies degree, a childish attitude, and believe that men are out to get you. since you've cried to ban them, all you know is it's neckbeard mysogenists. and since you believe that 100%, you get reddit to ban it. all the angry virgins coming to terms with the lies their mothers told them. all the guys who have fixed their marriages. all the wives to learn what used to make women happy. gay people learning it in a gay world.  maybe you don't believe RP life is worth of that option anyways. What happens then? Well, whatever is vilified tomorrow will get the same thing. Gaming subreddits would have gotten it, SJW would have gotten it (we can hope, but doubtful)  all beacuse 1% of the userbase makes an account. 1% of them decided to go to a sub, 1% of them actually create and vote for content, and 1% of them actually comment on it. And out of that tiny fraction of people, a handful decide to be giant dicks.  And we want everything out of here because of that.  Fuck that. I would rather have coontown, jailbait, and a hundred more like them around. Not because I like them, or think it's worthy of a voice, but because then I know... I know that people actually value the marketplace of ideas, and not just being pampered and coddled by some kind of authority...  It's not about whether I approve of racism or not... It's about whether we are willing to be uncomfortable, all on the assumption that it keeps our ideas safe, and the off chance that I may learn something one day.  So while they didn't talk that lofty, yes, that was the plan. the people of the world decide what they talk about, warts and all. One founder killed himself, ones still around and one cashed out... Doesn't matter.  And the one thing they stumbled upon, the pseudo anonymity that makes this place better than 4chan. you aren't the real you on here, but a character, based loosely on you. It lets you be a real human, but just anonymous enough that you can talk about real things.  So I hope that explains why I think the PAO hate, while largely crude, has some merit"

Allowing hate groups to find each other and reach a common cause, which greatly increases their destructive potential.

Allowing people to form groups and caucuses which coalesce in other forums and in other ways.

Yes, these phenomenae are real, and they produce a measurable and appreciable effect. But because they don't manifest in an obvious way -- because the roving gangs of sexists and racists identify as ""just asking questions"" or ""here for the lulz"" or ""harmless trolling"", rather than as something more overt, and because you choose to take them at their word when they do so -- you don't believe in it.

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,exoendo,4,Tue Jul 14 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"The fact that reddit imitates life so well is what makes it great and worthwhile. Reddit isn't some separate thing subject to different laws of nature just because it's a website.  However, this means any attempt at ensuring ""safety"" for everyone on an anonymous public forum the size of a nation is no less futile than the attempt to do so within an actual nation. A certain level of futility should be accepted and navigated rather than making attempts to eradicate it that cost far more than they're worth.  People participate in the site knowing that the risks of being offended, even of being harassed, exist, just like they do in real life. Reddit is the size of a nation, but in no nation is there the attempt to make it impossible for bad things to happen. Rather, there are consequences applied fairly and predictably. In reasonable nations, the response comes after the offense, and only affects the offender.  Reddit has a huge advantage over a physical nation: the ability to create new ""land,"" new subreddits. If you don't like the laws or the culture of a certain sub, you can move to another one or create your own. (You can also change your identity immediately, for free.)  It would be proof of nothing but its timidity if the entirety of reddit is kept palatable to the entire population of reddit. This is obvious to everyone.  The users of /r/fph were not only that -- they are contributors elsewhere whose contributions are appreciated by someone. Treating them like a black-and-white ""enemy"" and banning the sub as if the users will disappear, as if the community as a whole won't suffer for it, was a beginner's mistake.  There should absolutely be repercussions and law laid down, but there are other measures to take -- mods removed, warnings issued, IPs banned, etc. Even legal action -- get the IP, track down the user, sue them for emotional abuse. Perhaps a reddit ""sheriff"" could field requests for investigations into harassment so that admins are not burdened by this, and the site is free to take measures more moderate than banning city-sized subreddits without warning.  The world as a whole does not function well as a ""safe space."" It never has and never will. We're a hairs' breadth away from being eaten by lions on the Serengeti still. But we shouldn't ignore what we already know -- there's an incredible opportunity here."

This is all about the power dynamic between users who feel they should have inalienable 'rights' and admins who have all the power and exercise it in sometimes unpredictable, sometimes arbitrary-looking ways.  You've suggested one way that we might take some of the power back, namely by holding the site's traffic stats and maybe some revenue hostage until something changes.  The problem with this is that it is Occupy Wall Street all over again. There are only a few of us, we aren't sure exactly what we want, and except for the little buzz in their ears the admins risk virtually nothing by ignoring us completely.  I know you've tried the 'change the system from within' approach before, blackstar, so I'll assume that's off the table as well. What remains? Packing up and leaving for good (as you seem to have done), or accepting that this is how it is for the time being.  There is a much larger question here about what the internet itself is for, and right now the answer is overwhelmingly 'profit, driven by low-effort, high-penetration content' facilitated by sites like facebook and yes, reddit. The fact that reddit values visibility so highly is what makes a relatively small hate group like /r/FPH so pernicious. Not just that they exist (which would be true anyway), but that the reddit system of visibility allows them to get far more attention than they deserve.  The way to resolve this is to have an intelligent debate around what exactly constitutes censorship. There are many exceptions to 1A that have been defined by the courts over the years, primarily because 1A is not and has never been the One Right to Rule Them All.  What we need to do here is encourage Alex and Steve to create a robust content policy that allows neither too much nor too little, and then stick to that policy. The thing that sucks about Steve's statement 'I don't want to ban anything' is that it's completely unrealistic. We know things are going to get banned, and it's only a question of deciding what stays and what goes. You can either have a method for determining this that everyone at least knows, even if they don't understand or agree, or you make ad hoc decisions in closed-door boardroom meetings, and behave like tyrants when the time comes to implement the decision.  We might not have any power over the admins, but we do have the ability to light them up with good ideas, or at least better ones than what they've been utilizing up to this point. I have no idea if Alex and Steve are capable of making this site what it should be, but for better or worse this is their show now. For our part, I think we can do better than once-a-year shit-posting about how much things suck compared to before."

TheoryOfReddit,3d9e1k,Khanstant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:35:18 2015 UTC,"The solution to this is easy.  Allow member and subreddit filtering.  Hide subreddits you dislike, and filter any comments from those subscribed to them.  This way reddit doesn't lose anything diversity wise, while making the experience pretty and safe for those that get uptight over whatever they chose to be uptight about.  I personally want an age filter.  Under 22?  Filter.  This way what's seen is what one prefers to see, without sacrificing the diversity of the user base.  I am not racist, but I personally am interested in what communities like that are like.  A lot of what I take from reddit IS being able to witness fringe communities to get a better understanding of what their hot topics and arguments are, and disprove them.    If you want a win win win solution implement this easy change, and the whole community will benefit in more ways than trying to keep hate away, while simultaneously supporting that purpose.  Do it.  The majority love unfiltered, and this is a site to learn what other corporate entities shouldn't allow.  So the community moves on.    People want to express ideas and argue, and the moment you start to police the conversations, the Internet will find an alternative.  The users provide the content, and you provide a message board for discussion.  It will not be hard to reproduce, and when the community leaves, reddit dies, just like digg.  Setup filtering.  It's the only, and realistically best way, that will have more benefits than the problem you're trying to solve - and solve this problem as a side effect.  Cheers."

I didn't see this thread until just now.   Next time maybe shoot me a PM please.    I see most of the other points I would have made in response to you already made by some others in this thread, so I won't bother repeating them.     But I do want to reiterate one point that I think was large ignored.   Non-racists generally don't want to hang out with racists.   Racist users generally drive out non-racist users.      Everybody has a story about the racist family member that they only see once a year at some family gathering,  and we all dread running into that family member.   We really don't want to hang out, even for a short amount of time, with that person.   Well, when it comes to family we make sacrifices, so we (1) talk try and only about the weather or sports with them and (2) are very thankful it's for only one-hour a year.     But when it comes to non-family, you don't make the same allowances.    We just cut those people out of our lives.     Bad users will drive out good users.  And then more bad users will be attracted to this site.    These groups even know this, and count on non-racists leaving.  It's why they use terms like Colonizing when it comes to what they are trying to do.    They want to take over.   They are not interested in undirected discussion with anyone.  They want to control the narrative and how any discussion happens.  They are actively trying to turn young people who aren't already racist bigots into racist bigots.      If you allow them to run wild, 90% of the good users will leave.  And what's left will simply be a Storm Front members wet dream.      I want to address the BS that some limits on free speech are inherently bad.   Because the only country that really thinks free speech means ""Anything Goes, including extreme bigotry"" is the United States.     But other nations, such as Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, etc.  place some limits on ""Free Speech"" via bans on things like Holocaust denial.    Now..... I'm sorry, but you can't tell me Germany or Canada is any less free than the United States.    The reason the Germans don't allow open-Nazis into the political debate in their country is that they tried it once.   It ended badly.   In short, you don't allow these people a foot hold because their goal is to eliminate people they disagree with."

There are communities established here--for games, for shows, for ideologies--that are incredibly large and cohesive.

While Reddit may be 80% white... it's quite normal.   You're misinterpreting the statistics. You're pulling data from different sources together incorrectly. Look, your column for USA adds up to 117.1%. The main issue is whether ""Hispanic"" (or something similar) is listed as an option on the survey. 77.7% is the fraction who identify as white when Hispanic is not an option, which is not the case in your survey. If Hispanic is listed as option, the fraction is 62.6%.  Furthermore, ""does the white percentages match up?"" is a very narrow way of looking at the question of whether the USA population is represented. The biggest discrepancy is obvious black people. Look, it differs from the USA demographic by a factor of 5 to 13. So your general implication that the demographics of Reddit mirror the demographics of the USA is way off."

Reddit is a site that primarily appeals to geeks/STEM/techies, a group that is heavily Asian and white and with a relatively high IQ (Steve Urkels are pretty rare). Though it would be easy to say that Reddit users are dumb lol, the average IQ on this site is probably around 110. If you were to breakdown the ethnic groups/races of people in America with IQs of 110, it would look very similar to the ethnic breakdown chart you posted. Asians, for example, make up less than 5% of America but definitely a much higher percentage of Americans with IQs of 110 as Asians have an average IQ estimated at between 103 and 105."

He had different ideas for AMAs, he didn't like Victoria's role, and decided to fire her.  Pao wasn't able to do anything about it.  In this case it shouldn't have traveled upstream to her, it came from above her.     Then when the hate-train started up against Pao, Alexis should have been out front and center saying very clearly ""Ellen Pao did not make this decision, I did.""  Instead, he just sat back and let her take the heat.

I always post shit against the mob mentality every time it flares up on here, and sometimes the mob shits on it and other times they get it (assuming I get any attention at all). Of course I have no visibility and no reputation so I don't have to worry about the mob swarming me.

I wasn't someone who acted like a complete tool towards Ellen like many others here, so I didn't need Yishan to come in and tell me the truth so I would behave nicely, I just did it because that's the responsible thing to do. I wasn't the only one either of course, plenty of people were behaving responsibly, but the mob certainly makes it seem like those people didn't exist. It seems some other people somehow needed this information to not act like complete douchebags, but they shouldn't have been acting like that to begin with.  We should take the information Yishan gives and apply it to the future. In the immediate future, this is something that applies towards how people deal with Alexis.

While that is ALWAYS an inherently (at least potentially) problematic situation, it is hardly uncommon.  There are plenty of businesses where the majority owner (or in some cases even 100% full owner) will hire a ""President"" (aka CEO) to run the operations of a business ... and then will also WORK in some lesser role (either as some engineer, or possibly a department manager), and will REPORT as an ""employee"" to that person during the day to day operations.  There is always the POTENTIAL for problems in that.  But here's the key point... its OBVIOUS AS ALL HELL!  So anyone who is competent will only take on that role of ""President"" with very clearly delineated policies as to WHO is in charge of the operations on a day to day basis; and the board member/owner will agree (invariably in writing, subject to some significant penalty, and possibly to the judgement of some independent arbitrator) that they will NOT seek to ""overrule"" or ""micromanage"" (and thus subvert/undermine).   Specific situations & MAJOR disagreements will almost INEVITABLY occur* -- and there are then pre-defined, pre-agreed upon ways to deal with that -- that's how actual competent ADULT businesspeople handle this kind of thing. (Hint: what they don't do is go into some online forums and bitch & whine about being ""powerless"" and ""unable to do anything"" etc).  Besides, it's not like there isn't a whole SHITLOAD of ""case studies"" (as well as books, management training, etc) on this issue, it's not that unique of a thing.    * EDIT: And duh the SINGLE most obvious of ALL the potential ""major"" conflicts will be when the owner/board member (while working as an employee) somehow gets ""pissed off"" at some OTHER employee (most especially someone outside of their own department), and either threatens to, or claims to have ""fired"" them from their position as ""owner"" -- that one gets ""nipped in the bud"" via company policies -- no competent CEO will stand for having either their own OR their management hierarchy & policies being undermined and subverted in that way.  That Reddit STILL hasn't dealt with this in a professional manner... well it doesn't reflect well on ANY of the recent managers (especially the CEO's)."

This quasi-faux-""interim""-CEO euphemism -- that ostensibly the person has been appointed to ""find & hire a replacement CEO"" and is only temporarily filling in the role in the meantime -- is a fiction that NO ONE actually believes.  Alas among other things, it is one of the more ridiculous things to come out of Silicon Valley (and worse is part of the -- rather childish -- inane ""Steve Jobs"" worship-legacy).  You cannot effectively RUN an organization -- not even for a few weeks or months -- without some clear delineation of responsibilities and authority.  Now if Ms. Pao was give the title of ""interim CEO"" -- but without the actual authority of CEO -- well, that's really just yet another sign of incompetence and/or mixed-up priorities (both on her part and the Reddit board); it means that she wasn't really interested in assuming the actual role so much as having that title (regardless of the circumstances and/or constraints she might have to suffer to obtain it)."

Kn0thing made very clear he wants the site to appeal more to the affluent individuals and celebrities that do AMAs so they can roam around without a leash and run into users that appeal to them.  /u/Kn0thing / Alexis Ohanian Jul,09,2015 ~03:30 minutes into podcast | mp3 direct link | soundcloud   Reddit feels like a place that is judged by their ideas instead of how they look or how they present themselves ... The reason we are making the decisions we are making is to realize the full potential of the reddit platform.  We are doing that because we want it to be the most authentic place online to have discussions. Which leads us to the role of celebrities on reddit. Well not just celebrities but noteworthy people. We want to see them actually become a part of the community. And we felt that in order for them to want to part of the site more they actually have to be on the site and interact without a buffer and that includes AMAs. Our goal is for these people to have more relationships on reddit similar to those such as Arnold Schwarzenegger.   Contrast that with Pao's exit statement that shows there was a lot of pressure to violate principles in hopes they would increase growth:  Here is Ellen Pao:   So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit’s core principles.    And that the board seems to demand empathetic users, the question is at what cost to the userbase:  Here is board member Sam Altman   I think figuring out how technology can encourage empathy is one of the more interesting and important open research problems in the world right now.  If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.

It is improper to fire someone because of race, ethnicity, religion, age, etc. There are Federal standards and there are addditional state standards in play here.  So from a legal standpoint, yes, you can walk up to someone mid-day between appointments, and assuming you otherwise have the authority to do so, fire them and have a security guard escort them off premises with a shoebox of personal items.

In short, this isn't HIS fault because he did the firing poorly and then handle the aftermath poorly, it is REDDITs fault for allowing such a workplace where such a thing could happen to even exist.    BINGO.  And since a ""company"" is a fictional piece of paper, what this really means is that it is the MANAGEMENT'S fault -- i.e. the current (and prior) CEO.  For Yishan to say that he (and Ms. Pao) as CEO were ""unable to do anything"" -- means either that they really weren't in fact the ""CEO"" (i.e. it was a meaningless title, words on a business card, no contract no actual authority) -- or that they were fundamentally incompetent in the role.  Both from not DOING anything about a specific problem situation (an ostensibly inappropriate ""firing"" of an employee), as well as from not PREVENTING it in the first place by establishing a solid ""chain of command"" with specific hire/fire scenarios, and other policies in place (including documenting of people's duties & jobs, cross training employees, etc*).  It sounds like Reddit is -- and for some years has been -- a very UNprofessionally run place... a lot of arrogant little incompetent children running around playing at something they really don't have a clue about how to do properly (alas that probably describes a LOT of silicon valley).  One wonders if they even HAVE any written ""management policies"" at all -- much less an ""employment handbook"" or HR guidelines -- of if they play everything ""fast & loose"".     Your response here, and your one further down the chain, while tickles reddit ""yeah, we got the truth and that guy got told"" fancy, is highly unprofessional of you and you should be ashamed.    But it -- alas, more's the pity -- is pretty much the kind of unprofessional thing that both Yishan AND Pao are now increasingly well known for.

Right, but see you're assuming that Reddit operates anything LIKE a normal ""formal"" (and ""sane"" adult) corporation.  From basically everyone's testimony here (whether it is Yishan's or or Ohanian's perspective)... Reddit apparently DOESN'T operate in a professional manner like that.    Near as I can tell from their ""team"" page they not only don't have an ""HR Department"" but not even an ""HR Manager"" -- the closest they come is a ""HR Generalist"", a ""Head of Recruiting"", and a couple of what I guess are local ""Office Managers"" -- titles at Reddit seem to be a ""create your own bullshit"" kind of thing, lots of ""Directors"" and ""Managers"" but all of relatively weird crap.    Since Yishan was in charge of Reddit for over 2-1/2 years, the lack of any fundamental procedures or departmental structure, managerial hierarchy -- well it all lays pretty squarely at his own feet.  But of course, Pao was (at least ostensibly) in charge for over 6 months (albeit heavily distracted by personal affairs) -- and so has to take at least SOME responsibility for that quagmire-culture as well.   And the claims that she was ""powerless"" to establish policy because she was some lesser ""interim CEO"" -- well that doesn't square with the very PUBLIC pronouncements of other rather fundamental and somewhat dubious ""policies"": i.e. the whole ""no negotiation on salaries because women are bad at negotiating"" bit.  If she was some powerless/constrained CEO, then how did she do that?

Reddit simply does not have the option to attract star studded celebrity users with its current mechanics set, unless it is a one-off promotion. It's a pipe dream without some fundamental changes to the site.    I once ran across a Redditor that I thought was hilarious, and I wanted to see what he had to say on an ongoing basis.    That meant I was out of luck and I couldn't see what he had to say on an ongoing basis.    I had to stalk his comments and look for clues as to where he might be on other sites, and finally I just messaged him for his Twitter. One of the more enjoyable content creators I follow on Twitter for over a year now. Reddit made damn sure what he had to offer wouldn't surface for me here."

TheoryOfReddit,3d2hv3,KiraKira_,4,Mon Jul 13 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"I have been very disappointed in the reddit community for a while now.   There were often submissions to backwater hate-based subreddits about Ellen Pao that had comment chains which were all comments about her sex and race.  This was well before the blow ups with the mods.  Nominally the news story submissions were about her law suit with her former employer, but they were all nothing more than excuses for idiots to gather round an make  sexist and racist comments.    Subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/SubredditCancer, /r/Undelete, /r/KotakuInAction, /r/Redpill, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/GreatApes, etc. all made common-cause in the effort to say nasty stuff about Pao.  Then when the ruling about FPH was handed down, they made sure to invite all those hate-based users into their idiot-clubhouses.    When the mods of the defaults acted, independent of of any of that crap, those idiots pored out of the word work again.    Mod teams wanted to make sure that our users and the press knew that we didn't care about Ellen Pao's lawsuit or be thought to be in common cause with a bunch of hate-based idiots.  At /r/History we threw together a wiki-page to explain our reasons for going dark.      Now something that needs to be addressed very quickly are the various hate-based groups which are actively attempting to colonize (their word) parts of reddit.   Several hate based groups of white supremacist, neo nazis, holocaust deniers, etc. are setting up shop around Reddit.    Right now, /r/coontown almost gets as much traffic as stormfront.org.  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.    As such, the admins need to directly address the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/Holocaust and other subreddits that solely exist as propaganda outlets for pure hate.     If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.    Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it.   I've been saying this since before Ellen Pao resigned.   I'm saying it now.  I will continue to say it in the future."
TheoryOfReddit,3d2hv3,InternetWeakGuy,63,Mon Jul 13 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"When the mods of the defaults acted, independent of of any of that crap, those idiots pored out of the word work again.    To add, most of the mods in /r/Blackout2015, the sub that pushed hardest against Pao during the blackout, also mod SRC, one mods CoonTown, and at least two (maybe three or four) are former FPH mods.   The nastiness coming out of that sub was conflated with something completely separate."
TheoryOfReddit,3d2hv3,KiraKira_,47,Mon Jul 13 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"Remember the outcry when /r/whalewatching got banned, but turned out to be a two year old sub dedicated to actually watching whales? Here's the results of a quick investigation I did in June into the mods of that particular whale watching sub - hint: they all turned out to be mods of hate subs.     Also this is supposedly ""banning actions not ideas"" even though they even deleted whalewatching which was an ACTUAL whalewatching subreddit that got hit in the crossfire. THen after that was cleared up the SJWs still want it perma deleted.   If you look in that sub's new queue, they have a total of 12 posts all time (since all the FPH posts were removed) - the newest six of them are all since 11pm the night after FPH was banned (two are metaposts about the drama, one is an invite to /r/drawpeople), the newest of the remaining six posts on the sub is from April 16th, 2013.  So while, yes, it is technically ""an ACTUAL whalewatching subreddit"", prior to two days ago it had taken a 786 day break from posting wildlife (and the account who set it up hasn't posted in two years) and it's mods are ten shitlords (nine of whom became mods at the same time nine months ago, one 18 hours ago) who mod (picking a few well known subs from the tens of subs they each mod)  (by the way, the links are to the users profiles, not to the actual subs, so it's safe to click)   strugglefucking, SRSSsucks and beatingwomen2 in one instance,  subredditcancer, shitlordlounge, and niggersrebooted in the next,  strugglefucking, againstsocialjustice and subredditcancer in the next,  strugglefucking, SRSsucks, subredditcancer in the next,  subredditcancer, privilegeparty, punchable_children in the next,  SRSPornography in the next (lazy that one - probably an alt),  FacebookCleavage, Dopplebanger and Prolapsebanger in the next,  WatchNiggersDie, NiggerDrama and TrayvonMartin in the next (that dude in particular has almost all racist subs to his mod name),  DogFighting, FacebookCleavage and TwistedFaggotry in the next,  and finally, for the last 18 hours, one totally innocent individual who also mods CandidFashionPolice, StruggleFucking, Coontown, Subredditcancer, CuteFemaleCorpses, Raping Women, Ellenpaoinaction, beatingwomen2, killingwomen, WatchingNiggersDie, BeatingCripples, CuttersGoneWild, NationalNaziParty, NiggerSafari and a whole host of other awful shit.

It's just an anti-censorship alternative to r/europe, a sub you used to moderate until there was so much uproar by the userbase they had to kick you out. r/european was needed due to amount of censorship taking place on r/europe where posts involving immigrants and Muslims are deleted routinely for spurious reasons. r/subredditcancer is needed to document and log this censorship. Here are some examples of it being used to document the censorship on r/europe:   Here is one post they removed about Africans saying they have a right to live in Germany: https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/39ypgg/reurope_remove_video_link_titled_african_migrants/ The mods removed it claiming it was ""low quality"". Here is another when the mods removed posts about Muslim migrants murdering Christians on boats in the Med: https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/32vq25/reurope_cancer_removing_any_discussion_about/ Here is a post about DavidReiss banning a user for saying ""This is stupid because it is racist towards white people"" https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/2xilod/reurope_bans_a_guy_for_saying_this_is_stupid/   There are many more examples. search for r/europe, r/unitedkingdom or r/ukpolitics and we see the same pattern.    When the Tunisian terrorist attack happened, Europe removed any news about it claiming it was not a European issue despite Europeans being targeted and murdered. Again they had to relent when there was uproar from the sub but minor stories are frequently removed without the userbase realising.   DavidReiss is part of the reason subreddits like r/european and r/subredditcancer exist. Of course he is going to whine when people document his censorship."

You seem to be--no, you ARE advocating that Reddit kicks out these groups because it doesn't like what they have to say, or that they are free to mingle with the rest of the population. Are you going to kick me out too, if I start holding views contrary to your idea of a Reddit utopia?  Reddit is as much a medium as it is a community. It's a virtual community center where anyone can create a meeting room. The second you start denying people the chance to gather and discuss their legal and non-harassing ideas, you're actively choosing to shape the future of public discourse via censorship. I don't trust my government to do that, and I certainly don't trust you."

He helped hire Pao after she agreed with his vision for the company.  But, reddit users like kn0thing because he founded the company so he has a lot of built up karma, for lack of a better word.   Pao was executing his plan while taking most of the heat for it since she literally didn't have his karma.   Even firing Victoria seems like it has his hands all over it.   Sure Pao wasn't a very good CEO by a lot of standards, but I think kn0thing should take most of the blame because she can't execute anything unless kn0thing and the board agreed with it.  I think kn0thing has a lot of unresolved issues with reddit. He infamously has that picture of him giving a speech with the slide ""You no longer control the message, and that's OK.""  He is a very political and activist type person, but he also has a lot of very strong opinions about ""harassment"". I think he wants to do what he has long claimed to hate, censor reddit into a place where people don't get ""harassed"".    He essentially hates what reddit has become in the mainstream's minds, that reddit is a place where people go to make fun of people and swap stoled nudes.   It's one thing to talk about free speech and letting other people control the ""message"", but it's another thing to actually see it happen on a platform you created.   Some might claim that this is about money, but given his background, money doesn't seem to be a huge concern of his. I think it's important for reddit to turn a profit, but I don't think he is doing all of these unpopular decisions because he wants more money. I think he is doing it because he doesn't like what reddit has become.  Regardless, he is a conflicted person from all that I have read and seen, so I don't know where this all goes from here."

The only thing I can think you'd be alluding to is that kn0thing now actually is trying to control the message, so it's ironic and sad.  I disagree that banning Fat People Hate is controlling the message. The stated reason was that Reddit wanted to control the action, not the message.

If you want proof of the last sentence, notice the passive aggressive ""Reddit won't rollback changes"" spam. If we can examine the forces at work, maybe we can better understand why things happened the way they did and why there is still a high amount of dissatisfaction. Pre-Pao's exit:   The FPH folk were in full uproar. They frequently posted passive aggressive articles about Pao. They were obliterating /r/all with swastikas, safe spaces, general Pao, articles about the lawsuit trouble, and then the petition. This blame towards Pao was loud and constant in posts and in comments. The moderators blacked out most major subs, citing lack of communication between them and the admins. This, following Victoria's firing, was a clear response from the community that they needed more from Reddit (the Company). Moreover, they pointed to mod tools as a serious point of contention. This blame was mostly one-off and highly focused in the form of the blackout and stickied posts. It has continued through the countdown to mod tool. It is being mediated through /r/modsupport.   The most important thing to understand here is that these were separate forces. All the ill will was thrown into one bucket and swirled around, but the sum of it came from these two parts.   Notice anything about the two forces, though? The Fattening folks centered all their hate onto Pao, while the moderators and community at large realized the entire company had been poorly handling community resources for some time.   The other thing I notice is the outcome for both groups. The moderators have been given a very rough time table, but they have a subreddit. They get the admin interaction they requested. They will rally again if the admins don't make some hay.  The FPH folks, however, get NOTHING. They don't get their hate palace back. What I'm realizing as I write this is that the reason they don't get what they want back is because they focused on the wrong thing. Also, they were huge douches in the first place, but that part is just my opinion.  The reason the hate was thrown onto Pao is complex. My post here doesn't really explain that, but I do think it shows WHO. It's not the moderators clamoring to get her fired after Victoria's exit. That premise of your question is flawed. It wasn't that Pao fired Victoria and shit hit the fan. That's how it played, but there was already a high level of dissatisfaction from FPHers (because their hate palace was ruined) and moderators (this dissatisfaction being much more rooted in factual truths about Reddit helping them).  All this to say that the FPHers are the reason for the Pao hate..not people upset about Victoria's firing. This is why even today you see posts like ""Reddit refused to rollback changes."" HMMMM. What changes are there to rollback? Bring Victoria back? That was never an option. No one knows why she was fired, either. The big mods have come out and said, ""we understand V had to go."" They miss her I'm sure, but they don't blame Reddit. Why not? Because they're smart folks who realized she could have been fired for a good reason. Okay..not that. What other change was there? FPH ban. Fin. That's it. That's where all the Pao hate was coming from, and that's the hate towards Reddit that we're still seeing traces of today. All the monetization lingo is a result of that ban, too. There has been NO heavy handed attempts at commercializing the site, yet. If you ask an FPHer they'll tell you differently, though. They are the ones that blamed Pao.   I didn't answer your question, but I hope I've refocused it. It's not about Victoria. It's about FPH."

I thought so too based on how ""We Apologize"" and Upvoted Weekly issue 11 were spinning the blackout as just moderator issues, but it's changed with spez's return.   Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  We want to support as free and open a discussion is possible.  Real users should never be shadowbanned. Ever. If we ban them, or specific content, it will be obvious that it's happened and there will be a mechanism for appealing the decision.  I want to be very clear: I don't want to ever ban content. Sometimes, however, I feel we have no choice because we want to protect reddit itself.  I think mods should be able to moderate, but there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed.   Obviously reddit cannot harbor literally all content and survive. Providing a clear, consistent content policy and sticking to it is the most the free speech crowd can ask for.  Edit: I don't want to be your enemy. I'm delighted that /u/spez wants to create an algorithmic solution to toxic users, for example."

My comment that you replied to points the difference between the two forces out. Let's be honest here. /r/blackout and a fraction of subs that joined in citing ""censorship"" were butthurt FPHers. They were (and still are) trying to hijack the big sub mod's legitimate (UNRELATED!) concerns about communication and mod tools to get their way.  My guess is that the new content policy is going to clearly articulate why FPH was banned. Best case scenario for FPH is them getting their sub back. In their minds they still think it's possible. I really don't see that happening. The most they can hope for is that SRS (and/or the coontowns) get banned too like they've been retorting from day 1. That's not a victory when you consider that most of these people do not really give a shit about free speech. It is, again, another way to confuse the issue and press for what they want.

Initially the protest was to block the raise of a bus fare in a specific city (and as a long term goal, about raising support for free public transportation), and was limited to the city of São Paulo. Due to police violence and other factors the protest grew to various Brazilian cities and also grew in scope. A lot of people were protesting against corruption or other topics.  In almost all cities, the people actually organizing the protest were the local chapter of the free fares movement, trying to keep the goals on the topic of public transportation, with very specific, local, actionable demands. Such as: we want to have access to the books of companies with public transportation contracts. But the people actually attending the protest didn't understand or care about those specific demands, instead demanding less specific things from the federal government (like increased funding for education, harsher punishment for corrupt politicians, etc), that weren't immediately actionable."

Some of the subs that participated in the blackout following Victoria's firing were diametrically opposed to the anti-Pao sentiment (such as /r/gamerghazi). The Pao haters deliberately muddied the water between the two in order to attach their demands to a larger, more respectable protest.  I have only one addendum, the hatred of Pao did not start with the banning of /r/fatpeoplehate. It has been simmering for quite some time, at least since the mass deletion of gamergate related threads for doxxing in /r/games last August. Possibly longer.  As for why, it's part of a larger trend on Reddit and around the web. The moment racists and sexists meet even the slightest bit of resistance or criticism they characterise it as oppressive censorship and construct elaborate conspiracies about the powers keeping them down. Ellen Pao was simply the nearest available woman and/or non-white person to blame."

She could have been called Hitler, Stalin, Mugabe (actually that is a lot more apt of a comparison, as he took a country ran it to the ground and will not leave) and it would have been fine. But they chose an asian figurehead, and continually used her image with asian propaganda.  Also the name sounds similar is a joke. So if a white guy was the CEO named Stacker we could make Stacker the Cracker jokes? Hell no. The fact is we have been conditioned to see racism when it comes to any other race but asian.

As far as monetization, I think celeb AMAs should be paid. I don't see why, between reddit gold for sale, and charging celebs for pimping their products, this site couldn't be profitable. Not all AMAs need to be monetized, but someone should have to pay to come on here and talk about Rampart.

It wouldn't make sense the other way around, since a celebrity could still just sign up, prove they are who they are, and then do an AMA, just like anyone else in Reddit can.   Rampart   Hopefully Reddit doesn't encourage anything like this to happen.

TheoryOfReddit,3d1m2x,metafish,2,Mon Jul 13 06:45:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously it relies on users supplying content - but that can be said about every 'social network' from imgur to twitter to 9gag tumblr etc. What's unique here is relying on the mods and them having significant control over subs of 9 million subscribers.    As far as monetization, I think celeb AMAs should be paid. Not all AMAs need to be monetized, but someone should have to pay to come on here and talk about Rampart.   I agree with this to some extent. Some celebs do an ama as part of their marketing circuit to promote a new movie/show/book etc. They do the Late show, Leno, get a Colbert bump and do an ama. These other places all charge 2-5k (or used to), but it depends on the supply/demand - if celebs are rushing to stop by at reddit or not. But once you start to charge, then we may lose the negotiating power to deny use of pre-canned questions. A lot of good ama's started off with marketing a product but evolved into personal/entertaining discussions.    Maybe I'm dreaming, but I don't see why celebrities haven't come to embrace Reddit as an extended Twitter channel.    Two words - personal attacks - from anonymous users. In the earlier days of twitter (post growth), a lot of celebs took to twitter and it was great for normal people to be able to interact with them directly. However when millions and millions more users joined in, they get a lot of negative feedback from people with a false sense of entitlement. A lot of the bigger celebs put a PR layer between them and twitter users and the medium sized ones learnt to ignore most comments except when it's time to promote something.   Very few celebs can be themselves and handle the stress of interacting on an anonymous platform. There are some who openly quit and others may come if there is a PR layer in between. Also, what's the ROI of an extended twitter for them? Some innovation needs to be done to make this work. I am sure there are lots of celebs who use reddit anonymously - to interact with other anonymous users."

There's been a ton of really bad celeb AMAs where they only answer certain questions, they have a shill asking specific questions they want to answer, or can't actually be verified that they're participating other than a tweet from a different account they probably aren't controlling either.  As far as ROI, honestly the only celebrities that would stand to gain anything out of it are the ones that don't need it to begin with probably. Major investment being time.  Reddit has become very toxic lately though it seems. I read on here earlier someone put it like - 'It went from being a place where you shared the things you liked to a place where you shared the things you hate'. Not in a big way, but in a noticeable way. Ideally it needs to become the place where celebs would want to come and socialize but it has that potential."
TheoryOfReddit,3d1m2x,FearAndLawyering,2,Mon Jul 13 06:57:22 2015 UTC,"Did that power ever really exist?    You can't really negotiate with free. For example, the Colbert bump (used to) gaurentee ~2M views of a certain demo and a positive, canned, clever interaction for a cost. If we charge celebs for ama's idk if we can say 'users just ask anything and you just have to answer - we have a host who may/may not pick difficult questions'. Again, it depends if celebs are lining up to do ama's or if we're pursuing them - I don't have any data.   Ideally it needs to become the place where celebs would want to come and socialize but it has that potential.    There are huge differences between a celeb-fan relationship, friend-friend and anonymous redditor-anonymous redditor relationships. I am not seeing why most celebs want to generally hang out with their fans except when they're marketing something. Especially with anonymous people? I am missing something here.   Edit: OK I think I know what they're trying to do. They want celebs to have permanent accounts here and use them to post announcements - like ""Ryan Reynolds tweeting that the official trailer release for Deadpool won't be available for a few more weeks"" but in long form and allow for redditor comments. hmmm interesting."
TheoryOfReddit,3d1m2x,BananaToy,2,Mon Jul 13 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"I guess I should back up and explain a bit - I see reddit like a funnel that all other internet content can be poured into. If a celeb set up a subreddit, they wouldn't really have to make any additional content, it would just exist as a channel that picks up everything they're already putting out - links to popular tweets, instagram photos, etc. Reddit is the box that can hold all their other media and also allows them to get feedback from their user base in a way that matters - I feel like on reddit you can have an actual discussion with someone, that it doesn't have to be the shouting match that exists on other services like Twitter.  Celebs in AMAs have never answered any questions they didn't want to and I don't see that changed regardless of which side charges money.  I think celebs need to just change their approach, I mean look what Arnold Schwarzenegger and Snoop are able to get out of it by participating with people in that gray area between friend and fan.

They're a log floating in the stream. They have to get in line. They have to, in a sense, lower themselves to the point that they fit into a system that at least on some level treats us all as equals. Even though the end result is not equal at all, there's still a sense that we're all participating on a similar level through consistent mechanisms.  There's a great deal of consistency between AMAs, from a technical/mechanical perspective.  Whereas pages would experience a lot of inconsistency. So in a way, this is a pretty amazing tool to get social interaction to follow a consistent pattern. Consistency is dependable and highly valuable on the chaotic internet, where otherwise information comes to us in a million different sizes and frequencies.  With AMAs, it's like a cute little gift you get every day and there aren't any surprised about how it works, only in what the actual content is."

Victoria being fired isn't a thing that any of us can truly say is a bad thing. We don't know why she was fired. We won't ever know, likely. The new CEO stands by the decision to fire her, made by his fellow cofounder of the site, not Pao.    Other shit happened as well like people's post being deleted and shadow banned and the mods having nothing to do with it.    Which is not new, nor is the result of any action Pao has taken.    They were trying to bring in more people to reddit to increase cash flow. Their goal is to get to 1 billion users so they went on a crusade on knocking the subs that are 'negative' out. In hopes that it will bring more people onto reddit. What they fail to realize is that most people don't use reddit because it looks dated and hard to navigate for someone who has never been here. Every person I have talked to about reddit has said this. It's not because of the negative shit that goes on within reddit.   Did you read why Pao quit?

And by vast orders of magnitude.   For example,  white supremacist hate groups are bad.   I think we can credibly say that without worrying about extraneous factors.     The same goes for similar groups that espouse holocaust denial, proponents in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Lost Cause of the Confederacy crazies, believers that all-Muslims are terrorists, etc.   One also finds that these other fringe groups all have more than a small amount of overlap with the white supremacist racist groups.   So much so that I think we can begin to speak of them as one large hate-feast.   Right now, /r/coontown almost gets as much traffic as stormfront.org.  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shithole subreddits on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylan Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.    As such, the admins need to directly address is the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/European, /r/Holocaust and other subreddits that solely exist as propaganda outlets for hate.     If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will soon have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.    Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit, or any other corporation.   This is something that the Reddit admins need to immediately address.  If the admins don't want to take the lead on this, then hopefully one or more media outlets will pick up on it and force the Admins to deal with it."

Victoria was in a role which stepped outside the 'maintaining a framework' job of the admins, she was a part of the content generation side which until that point was exclusively within the purview of the users, hence the furor when she was fired, as it was seen as another infringement (and a major one at that) into the domain of the users.

It's lead to a more free and more diverse community, with the drawback that the users have a correspondingly larger amount of power to influence the site.  There's nothing unique about Reddit - people like freedom. Or rather, people like power, and power to control what you do (which is freedom) above all else. That like of power also applies to mods except instead of freedom, it's power to control their subreddits and userbase. And as above, because Reddit gives its users and mods such a wealth of power/freedom, of course people will be loathe to give it up. Even in FB - people liked the freedom of making pages using whatever name they wanted - and there was a huge backlash against FB's 'real name' policy (so much so that afaik it's no longer being actively enforced), and ditto with the gender situation where FB has something like 50+ different gender options."

The subreddits banned weren't innocent little communities dedicated to niche interests or hobbies, they were troll/hate groups dedicated specifically to harassing other users and legitimate communities. When you're ""remembering the human"" in this case and using it as a defense not to ban subreddits, you're applying it in reference to what are functionally harassment hubs."

People are angry that others want to take that away from them. And rightly so. When you deny someone the right to speak their views, you also deny me the right to hear what they have to say.

TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,theyellowgoat,12,Sat Jul 11 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason people see the pro harassment and/or pro racism thing is because some of the content that got upvoted to the frontpage (depending on what subs you're subscribed to) was really nasty towards Ellen Pao. The content was itself harassment. People were making fun of her appearance. They were constantly bringing up the fact that she had a relationship with a married man. I know that may have to do with her character, but how much people cared about that particular part of her history seems to be partially chalked up to sexism."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,metafish,2,Sat Jul 11 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"People who present themselves in a public light will always have more media attention (and I mean ""media"" to include things like Reddit posts/commentary).  The issue wasn't that she had a relationship with some random married man.  The issue was the observation/speculation of how that particular relationship fit into the type of person she was, fit into other patterns of behavior, and what that meant in terms of her being CEO of Reddit.  I certainly don't condone harassment like death threats or even anything even indirectly suggesting someone should be harmed.  But if a wide latitude of speculation about the history, motives, and character of public figures is not allowed on Reddit, then Reddit should be trimmed down to subs like /r/Awww and the like."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,Reddisaurusrekts,2,Sat Jul 11 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"That's a common misconception. Making race-related and gender-related insults is not the same as racism and sexism - because the latter two require that race or sex is the motivation behind the insults. The antipathy for Ellen was there to begin with, her race and sex just served as convenient avenues of attack. If she wasn't Asian or wasn't a woman, she would have been insulted, attacked and vilified to the same extent, just using other more fitting insults/slurs."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,theyellowgoat,-1,Sat Jul 11 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"Making race-related and gender-related insults is not the same as racism and sexism - because the latter two require that race or sex is the motivation behind the insults.   I completely disagree. What you're saying requires that the individual be fully aware of their own psychic motivations and drives, whereas racism and sexism can absolutely be subconscious forces. You can be racist or sexist without knowing it. In fact, many people who are racist, sexist, or biased in any other sort of way, seem to not be aware of it or its possibility until the allegation is brought up against them.  What you're saying about making race-related and gender-related insults does not make any sense. There is no distinction between defining an insult as ""race-related"" or ""racist.""  I understand what you're saying though about her appearance; that if she wasn't Asian or a woman, there still would have been a backlash that resulted in insults ""fitting"" her situation. And I don't entirely disagree, but nonetheless, the insults that were made were disgusting and had nothing to do with the issues at hand. If anything, a lot of the insults showed that people were having fun just running with the mob mentality to make fun of someone because they're the ""bad guy."" There's clearly an inherent problem with this."

Pretty damn impossible to argue with that actually.  But racism and sexism can definitely be subconscious, but that means any accusations of the same would require you to know someone's subconscious ""motivations and drives"". I didn't say that they had to be the conscious motivation behind insults and slurs for them to be racist or sexist, but the motivation still needs to be, otherwise it's just an insult.   And again, there is absolutely a difference between a race- or sex-related insult, and racism or sexism. Racism or sexism are, by definition, prejudice or discrimination because of race or sex. There has to be a causal relationship."

TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,InRustITrust,14,Mon Jul 13 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"The biggest problems with FPH were that it was pushing its way to the front page of /r/all and that the users absolutely were brigading other subs to attack anyone who they deemed fat.  The rest of the hate subs mostly keep to themselves and never make it up to /r/all.  They might have wanted to, but they couldn't.  FPH was different because the unifying principle people got behind is pretty easy to recruit people to do.  Reddit essentially got a crowd of high school bullies that roamed the halls looking for the next fat kid to pick on, and it always gathered a big enough crowd of observers that the shame became the site's, not just the perpetrators'.  Reddit's got a business to run and advertisers aren't going to want to fund that sort of thing.  It is also a private institution and under no obligation whatsoever to provide a venue for every type of speech under the sun.  Moreover, there are sorts of behavior which aren't tolerated practically anywhere.  You can stand on the street and protest whatever you like and that's protected under the law because everyone's tax money pays for streets.  You cannot incite riots, threaten violence (death threats are not protected speech), be too loud (noise ordinances), slander or libel, follow someone everywhere they go (harassment), or trespass on private property without permission from the property owner to say whatever you want (and Reddit is private property).  The vast majority of people believe that these restrictions are reasonable in order to protect public safety and respect property rights.  There should not be any surprise when these restrictions find their way into other media (many of the listed behaviors don't change form too much simply because they're online).  What I think Reddit should have done was to force the sub private (whether temporary or permanent, I don't know) and anyone who had commented there gained automatic membership.  Then they should have been given a stern warning not to brigade other subs or face a full sub ban and user bans.  It would have been practically the same outcome (because FPH wanted to create a massive public shitstorm), but nobody could make any censorship claims since they would still be permitted to say whatever they wanted, but simply out of view of the public eye.  They'd effectively have the venue they wanted, but would have quickly died out because it wasn't generating the public furor they sought."

From what I gather, the issue with FPH was that they kept bullying people on other subs, and that this was encouraged and actively supported by the sub's mod team. Making the site private probably wouldn't have prompted any change in behavior on their part.  Otherwise, I agree, and thank you for this well thought out post."

Honestly I feel as the the admins realised FPH presented a PR problem for Reddit, but felt that the best way to address it was in a huge public way to make the headlines and make it known that Reddit was doing it, than more effective but less visible and less attention-grabbing actions like just talking to the mods but leaving FPH up."

That has everything to do with Reddit, and is one of the few things subreddit mods can do that will trigger an admin response.   Apparently differently than your perspective, but the larger site being upset about Banning has little to do with people upset about not being able to hate or be racist and everything to do with a larger trend on reddit over the last few years.    /r/Blackout2015 seems to have a different opinion on that"

TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,rather_dash1ng,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"What about allowing hate speech makes reddit better. Essentially that is what I want to know I guess. How would reddit or the users of reddit be better off allowing such hateful communities to fester among us? I would have zero problems banning all such hate based communities if I was the decision maker. Now, banning and deleting every user or comment I don't think so, the down voting system would work pretty well for that especially if you don't allow a place for them to organize brigades. I made an analogy a few days ago to a cave system of bandits near a city. The government kept dealing with the individual bandits but as long as they have a safe haven to organize the city won't be safe from them. Take that away and the system can handle the individuals."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,A-A-A-A-A,10,Sat Jul 11 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"I think banning hate speech is a good idea in theory, but in practice it doesn't really work because its too hard to establish a clear moral frame of reference, as in who decides what is ""hate speech"". Most people would agree that the really racist subs are hate speech, but subs like fph that made fun of fat people were essentially making fun of a lifestyle choice (Not that I think this is good behavior, but I don't think that at its essence this is hate speech, unless they were threating people or something.) That's probably not the best example, but a better one might be /r/atheism. A religious person might feel that this sub is hate speech against their religion, and who is to say they are wrong? I think its too hard to establish a single moral reference point for what's good and what's not. I like your example of the city with the cave system, but I think the internet is a little different. Removing offensive safehavens from reddit will just result in those people moving somewhere else. Content made on reddit is just a reflection of real people, so bad subreddits exist because bad people exist."

I'm not sure if it's quite enough to change my own opinion, meaning if I owned a similar website I still think I would not tolerate hate based communities. However I at least finally see why some people do defend these groups even when they abhor everything they stand for, and that's what I was going after.

I go on 8chan /pol/ sometimes - not because I actually agree with even a quarter of what they say, but because I would never get to hear these opinions on Reddit. It just wouldn't happen.

But it is extremely unlikely that SRS could be responsible for even a fraction of those votes considering the submission itself had only 151 points.  It's far more likely that, for example, when the reply pointing out that the poster was an actual legitimate white supremacist reached the top (and based on the snapshots it was well on its way there when it was posted to SRS) made some people reconsider their decision.  It just doesn't make much sense to assume that a sub with only a few hundred users active at any given time has any significant impact on one of the busiest posts of the week.  If you think brigading = harassment you shouldn't be saying 'what about SRS?' I'd start with 'what about bestof?'    Edit: in fact, looking at the time stamps, around a thousand of those downvotes came in within less than 30 minutes of the initial post. There's simply no way in hell that was SRS."

Subs very rarely get banned just because some of their members are brigading: they shadow ban the brigaders instead.  Some time ago I saw a vote analysis that showed that vote ratios did not tend to change substantially after being linked to SRS, so if that's changed, there should be evidence of it."

TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,Harald_Hardrada,-2,Sat Jul 11 18:11:46 2015 UTC,the fph ban is a perfect example. Those pictures were posted voluntarily by the imgur company. In that sense the images used were of public figures. I can understand rules being applied to normal people but if redditors cant criticise public figures then there will be nothing left to discuss.  that being said the fph ban was obviously about commercial considerations and the rule breaking was just a flimsy justification.
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,morpen,6,Sun Jul 12 00:29:03 2015 UTC,"Being an employee of an image host does not make you a 'public figure.' But I didn't say they doxxed them, I said they harassed them. That's in how they used the information, not how they got it in the first place. They were targeting them for harassment because imager started delisteing images that were linked to fatpeoplehate because it was causing problems for them. FPH responded by holding them up to their notoriously hateful community for 'criticism,' and that seems like it may have been what spurred the move.   Your claim hat this was about commercial considerations makes no sense because there are so many subs still open that look so much worse for reddit PR wise."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,BipolarBear0,0,Sun Jul 12 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"Realized the mods themselves did this to other redditors as well. If some girl posts her dress to /r/sewing, it is not FPH's right to link to that picture and mock her. And if she emails the mods asking to have the cross post taken down, they should take it down, not put her in the sidebar and mock her some more. That's textbook harassment and bullying. At that point FPH is infringing on other redditors rights."

TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,morpen,2,Sun Jul 12 02:18:49 2015 UTC,Also /r/hailcorporate is the worst example for a brigading sub
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,dominotw,2,Sat Jul 11 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this. I know subs don't often get closed for brigading, but that's partly because it's not something mods can do much about beyond banning meta discussion entirely, so it's supposed to be handled most of the time by banning the brigaders. But if someone's staging a harassment campaign on a sub, there is plenty the ms can do about it."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,shhhhquiet,-1,Sat Jul 11 18:51:23 2015 UTC,There can be a very thin line between brigading and harassment.
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,freet0,7,Sat Jul 11 20:07:14 2015 UTC,Nah. Harassment usually involves brigading but the converse isn't true. Harassment is a sustained campaign to mentally harm an individual or group of individuals. Brigafinh is just downvoting something you disgree with in a cross-community way.
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,dragonicus,-12,Sat Jul 11 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"If they were just banning for content, there are tons that any reasonable person would say should have gone before freaking fatpeoplehate.   They are taking a page from pintrest's book and making a place where women feel safe. Obesity is a problem that has effected women more than men, its only logical that subreddits targeting their potential consumer base were banned first.   They are just following the money and young white women hold the purse strings in America."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,SoMuchNot,8,Sun Jul 12 06:55:15 2015 UTC,"No, that's definitely not what's happening. If it were about making reddit more welcoming to women, subs like /r/theredpill and /r/philosophyofrape would still have been on the chopping block first.  And where are you getting your information about male vs female obesity rates? I've been through three sources (Kaiser Family Foundation, the CDC and obesity.org,) and in all three the obesity rates they reported were either similar for both genders across age brackets or in some cases significantly higher for men. it's just that subs like FPH for some reason get more worked up about fat women than fat men, which I guess could create the perception that there are way fewer fat men than fat women."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,dragonicus,3,Sat Jul 11 22:48:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's much merit to the slippery slope concerns. But there is an ideological argument. One of the great things about reddit is anyone can create their own community, so there's always a place to say what you want to say. Banning these communities for the things they say really isn't in the spirit of that at all.   Now I'm not a fan of hate subs, I don't personally see the value in them. But some people clearly do and they want a place to express their views. I don't think the fact that I don't like what they say is a good enough reason to deny them this ""reddit dream"". Being a community open to everyone means you have to take the good with the bad.  Now, reddit doesn't have to be open to everyone or every view. Lots of websites are like this. But it's a lot of what's so attractive about the site and many people don't like to see that compromised, even for hateful subs.  Of course FPH wasn't officially banned for what they said in their own sub, they were banned for harassment. But I find it hard to believe there was no way of curbing harassment without going this far. The admins didn't even try talking to the mods about it beforehand. I think a non-hate based sub would have definitely been treated differently. Lots of currently active subs have had problems with brigading or harassment, but worked with the admins to fix them.  TL;DR One of Reddit's main attractions is that its subreddit system means it's open to every person and every idea. Banning a community, even a hateful one, for its views goes against this."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,SoMuchNot,11,Sat Jul 11 21:20:51 2015 UTC,Because it turns out the rules do apply to them.
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,TheFatMistake,-1,Sun Jul 12 04:39:35 2015 UTC,Please elaborate.
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,dragonicus,23,Sun Jul 12 10:16:50 2015 UTC,"Well, it turns out that if you're going to harass people and give site admins a headache through your juvenile antics, you're going to get kicked out.  I think that shattered a lot of people's false impressions of reddit as a place where truly anything goes, a la 4chan, and it's just like the small child getting caught with his hand in the cookie jar - it's not like they're putting up a moral defense in favour of what they were doing, they're just feeling scornful and probably mad at themselves for crossing the line and getting caught. Trying to turn the tables, crying censorship, is just a way to deflect the shame away from themselves. As if anyone really wants reddit to be a safezone for this kind of shit. Censorship/1A rhetoric is an attempt to create an obligation, a necessity on the part of the admins and the community to accept what they're doing even though we don't like it. Sorry guys, this is a private enterprise, not the courthouse square. 1A applies only insofar as the admins choose to enforce it, and nobody should be surprised that these kinds of actions do indeed have consequences."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,SoMuchNot,-4,Mon Jul 13 07:58:22 2015 UTC,"Why do you think subs like SRS or SRD seem immune from these rules? (The entire original point of SRS was vote brigading, doxxing, and general harassment of folks that they disagree with. I love SRD, but I have to admit that vote brigading happens from there all the time.)  In the interest of full disclosure, I don't really have a ""dog in the fight,"" but I can't help but see a bit of a double standard.  FPH was mean and distasteful, but I'm not really convinced that they engaged in nearly as much harassment or vote brigading as SRS or SRD."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,jimmyolsenblues,5,Sat Jul 11 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, I am an active member of SRD. If you could point to a single instance of SRD harassing or bullying other users, show me the evidence, or better yet, show the mods and they will very prompty ban that user.  The mods of FPH actually enforced the harassment of other users from other subs. They allowed crossposting to images of fat redditors and would put those redditors in the sidebar if they complained.  In SRD, you're not even allowed to link to a username (example: /u/TheFatMistake ) when commenting in the sub anymore."
TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,Reddisaurusrekts,4,Sat Jul 11 18:33:29 2015 UTC,"Most of the 1A activists seem to be arguing that the fact of the rules being unclear or arbitrarily enforced means that the rules shouldn't exist at all. I find this to be a very weak argument. I stand by what I said earlier, that admins have the power to tolerate what they will tolerate and ban what they won't. Perhaps the redeeming qualities of SRS and SRD are enough to offset any damage they may have done, and the same cannot be said for FPH. I don't know. I do know that this power dynamic where the admins get to choose winners and losers gets people enormously upset, and they can't accept that there is no greater power beyond what Steve or Alexis wants. In that sense, the hate against Ellen was understandable, even though I (and many others) think she made a solid, defensible decision in banning FPH.   FPH was mean and distasteful, but I'm not really convinced that they engaged in nearly as much harassment or vote brigading as SRS or SRD   You're probably right about this, but I think the charter or guiding principle behind FPH was what got it banned, and the actions its members took were the excuse for banning. I think SRS and SRD continue to be allowed because they at least aspire to a greater purpose."

The point about free speech being Constitutionally only protected from the Government is irrelevant - it's a good principle in and of itself. The fact that China doesn't have Constitutionally protected freedom of speech doesn't suddenly make censorship in China a good thing.   And FPH was a vile sub, which, per the maxim that you only need freedom of speech to protect unpopular speech, means that it served as a canary in the coal-mine of Reddit's tolerance of speech, no matter now unpopular or vile. It was a tangible sign of Reddit moving away from near-absolute free speech and embracing the 'safe spaces' rhetoric that's currently trending in popular culture. And most Redditors are nothing if not counter-culture, at least in their minds. They want to be, and think of themselves as being, different and better than the mass/pop-culture that everyone else is part of. They revel in being the trend-setters not followers.  So Reddit regressing from its adventurous, avant-garde free speech principles to a regime of censorship and top-down control, no matter how warranted, signified Reddit becoming just another mass media site instead of... well... Reddit."

TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,xkforce,7,Sat Jul 11 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"Because censorship as a principle.   In the past, reddit mainly took a hands-off, free speech philosophy, and only took action when there was significant media attention/pressure to do so. However, the fph bannings seemed to target a select few arbitrary subs without any media prompting at all. And a lot of people were upset that (1)subreddits were being banned at all, due to this going against reddit's traditionally free speech(unless pressured by media) policy, and that (2)there still existed bigger, badder subreddits, that if you are going to ban subs, these worse ones should go.  Fph was a pile of dog shit as far as I'm concerned, but I support free speech and think they should be unbanned. I think there should only be bans for blatantly illegal things."

Some people believe there is speech that should not be condoned and should be prevented, which infers that some speech is inherently dangerous. Other people believe that the only recourse against speech should be debate (or more speech).  Real question. Is religious censorship still censorship? Should someone who does not believe in someone else's religion have to follow those blasphemy laws? Should atheists who believe that all religions are man made be ostracized in a predominately Christian community simply because their belief system is different from the community they're a part of?

How could you claim you have truly free speech if there is a kind of dialogue that you simply cannot have, for fear of retribution for saying so?  On an internet message board, the stakes are literally as low as they come, but that doesn't mean there isn't an analog to the real world. Should companies like Comcast be allowed to limit what kind of internet traffic you are allowed to get? I mean, they're not the government, but if they decided nobody was allowed to say anything negative about them, would they be advocates of free speech by limiting what people can say simply because they're not a government entity?"

In any situation with bullying your options are to stand your ground or walk away. You can ALWAYS walk away from online bullying. If someone is sending you mean messages on the internet, just walk away from the computer. Nobody is tying you down, forcing you to read the mean things on the internet. Like everyone else using it, you're a participant.   For the record, FPH is 6 of one, half a dozen the other, IMO. The thing that REALLY rubs me the wrong way was the fact that Reddit continued to ban communities that sprung up out of it before they even had a chance to do anything bad, and then had the gall to say that they ""ban behavior, not ideas"", and retroactively claiming it was 'ban evasion' but subs like /r/beatingwomen2 STILL exist. The fact of the matter is that even the IDEA of hating fat people isn't allowed on the site. That's the issue. The line was drawn in the sand that certain ideas are too dangerous for people to discuss."

Reddit claims to be the front page of the Internet and not the Conde Nast forum. This gives Reddit a responsibility to uphold neutrality in the eyes of the users.   This is still the draw for a lot of redditors. To then say that was all a joke and this ideology will be supported over that ideology is a deep betrayal of what is promised.

TheoryOfReddit,3cwh0a,Anouther,2,Tue Jul 14 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"Simply put, absolute free speech should be allowed in terms of subreddits. The community should police itself by deciding what things it will upvote and downvote, which subreddits it will and will not participate in, and so forth. The individual should be allowed to have a choice. And if some individuals want to build their own hate filled little communities, they deserve to be able to do that. Just because you disagree strongly with the ideas someone expresses, just because you might find it offensive and repulsive, even immoral, they still deserve their own platform, their own community.  The up/down vote system exists for a reason. Reddit was founded as a free speech platform that would emphasize community policing rather than authority from on high. Unsurprisingly, the userbase that was first attracted to this website because of that is now angry people are wanting to push the website away from that model. People on this website value free speech and are angry that people higher up the chain of command are starting to no longer share that value."

Those are groups that rightly point towards subs like FPH as bastions of shit, but they are also groups with extremely problematic track records against groups like sexual minorities. Yes, they aren't going to call for banning content dealing with homosexuality now. But they would have twenty years ago. And they are perfectly fine with attacking areas of controversy today. It has been widely reported that Neilson would like Twitter to ban sex workers from being able to freely post there for example. Those are vulnerable minorities who face being thrown under a bus because their existence is controversial.  And yes, it's a huge shame that in order to protect the expression of vulnerable groups the best way is to not have any moderation so shitshows like FPH exist. But the proof, particularly for sexual minorities, is HUGE over the last thirty years that any moderation power is inevitably abused to attack them."

After I said I wouldn't delete they overstepped their bounds and said I was going to be shadowbanned from reddit. Something they absolutely can't do. This only strengthens the argument that they are just every day Joe's who lucked into the mod position and are just as imbalanced as the next person.   When someone actually wants to use the sub they might be upset because they would like to contribute instead of lurk. Unfortunately you would have to beg the mods and apologize. This type of behavior is pathetic in the context I gave above (average joes).   In my experience my attention was directed towards the sub that I'd never interacted with. Once I saw what they were doing it felt pathetic and petty. So, right now I can't sympathize with those who would be banned and upset about it. I can empathize."

That might seem like it has an obvious answer, but it might not be that obvious. See Amazon.com. They've gone a number of years (20 years now I think) just growing their site, expanding their market and becoming a literal one-stop-shop for everything and anything. They are known for running at a loss and not caring (as much) about profits as long as their brand and market expands. Granted, eventually investors are going to want to make some money, but it appears they're fine with it remaining an ultra long term goal. With examples like Amazon around, it's not super hard to believe that it's possible for a company to have profits in mind, but not a priority.   And with a limitless number of horror stories of websites focusing too soon on profitability (Digg comes to mind) it's easy to believe that investors can hold off for quite some time.

The original announcement said:   We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action.    That feels clear enough to me - when the admins have to get involved and put more resources into enforcing rules because mods aren't, it's not worth it for reddit to keep the platform up."
TheoryOfReddit,3cum80,sanfranidiot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"You know what I would do if I was one of the admins, every user on the site gets held accountable for their actions.  Meaning if you break the rules purposefully with intent for example those FPH's or whatever going and harrassing the Imgur people, If I investigate it and see clear proof of it and I start handing the bans and closing out the subreddits I'm going to state the reasons along with showing the proof.  In other words the transparency everyone wants is going to cover everything, transparency doesn't only cover what goes on behind the scenes it's going to apply to everyone's actions.  You don't get to say you got unfairly banned, the proof for the ban will be right there, along the lines of when Yishan posted about that admin who was trying to spin why he got fired.   No, you don't get to try and spin it back onto admins and mods without it being exactly clearly proven and shown why you got banned.  Airing the dirty laundry would hopefully make people see that there is going to be consequences to what they do, sure go ahead and harrass people or whatever but don't come crying I got unfairly and unjustly banned when the results of the investigation get dropped right in front you for everybody to see."

If a mod wants to abuse their power that's fine, if I was to investigate it and find enough to justify it they can get banned just like any other.   As big as the community has grown over the years there won't be any shortage of people to mod.  See there's a fine line that has to be clearly crossed, users, mods, and even admins themselves wouldn't be immune to anything.   You would want to see everyone held accountable, no one and absolutely no one in any of those three groups gets a free pass on anything, everybody gets an equal treatment."

TheoryOfReddit,3cum80,shivasprogeny,11,Sat Jul 11 01:19:58 2015 UTC,"One thing that I think the admins are going to need to directly address is the proliferation of hate-groups on Reddit.  There are lots of subreddits like /r/Coontown, /r/GreatApes, /r/Holocaust and others there exist solely to spread hate.     Right now, /r/coontown almost gets as much traffic as stormfront.org.  And that's not including the traffic from all the other racist shitholes on the site.  That spike in traffic is the Dylann Roof shooting, and the extra traffic seems to have staying power considering they picked up 4,000 subscribers in two days and another 1k at least since.    If they don't take care of it soon, reddit will have the dubious honor of being the most active white supremacist forum on the the Internet.    This info was brought to my attention by /u/PraiseBeToScience in another discussion.   I didn't know the problem was that extreme already.    Hate Speech should not be a profit center for Reddit. Or any other corporation for that matter.   This is something that they need to address.

TheoryOfReddit,3comgw,umbrellasinjanuary,20,Thu Jul 9 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"The replies so far are a bit.. uninformed... for TOR, let me elucidate.  Copyright is automatically assigned to the creator, period. Outside the boundaries of fair use and barring local legal shenanigans, it is not legal to do as you please with other people's work, period.  Reddit and Imgur are different in that they do not revolve around deliberate copyright infringement. Reddit's doesn't host anything except text and that's 99.99% original comments... for a given value of original, copyright the authors. Imgur may well host a lot of copyrighted material, but they can't know that in advance, and will deal with copyright infringement if demanded, and for the practical application of running a website one cannot have staff poring over everything that's submitted.  There's also an interesting reason why one can't do that, because if content is pre-approved the liability for it shifts to the approver for having taken an editorial role, in the eyes of the law essentially having said ""this is fine by me""... depending on jurisdiction. Thus, even with the best of intentions letting as much as possible through then cleaning up later is the way to go.  The reason websites get away with this sort of thing is ultimately just the nature of the internet. It's hard to prevent and people are accepting, often demanding, the violation of other's rights. In a minor way, I'm sure we've all done it by uploading to imgur. Chances are you have no way of even knowing the original source anyway.  Should the owner of the photos wish to take the time to tackle the website, a DMCA notice served to the host is simple and almost certainly effective.  Places like this in particular will simply capitulate at the first hurdle since there's zero financial or legal penalty for doing so and your claim has no effect on anything else there. Which makes it an impossible task to keep up with.  If that isn't the case, and the stars align correctly in that they initially dodge responsibility but cannot in the long-run and you have the means/patience to pursue it, it's actually pretty lucrative. I've known businesses pay hundreds of dollars for using a single image used without permission, it can be an unfortunate side-effect of shady website developers who leave the employer to deal with their pinching.  Perhaps a reason websites like this are common but everybody isn't doing it is simply that most people aspire to do something better with their lives than stamp their name on white goods and jack up the price. But if that's how you want to make a living, I guess the door's always open when it comes to websites.  tl:dr; illegal  Edit: Did I say hundreds? I meant thousands. Here's a perhaps rare story from the other side, of somebody who had to pay: http://www.contentfac.com/copyright-infringement-penalties-are-scary/  Edit 2: An enormous judgement against a website development company (told ya) who ignored claims for six years straight, a vast amount of money for a dozen images... or however much they actually ended up paying: http://www.photoattorney.com/court-awards-maximum-statutory-damages-copyright-infringement/  Edit 3: Not a lawyer, just a web... talking... guy."

TheoryOfReddit,3comgw,beargolden,9,Fri Jul 10 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"And in case you don't realize it, I'm talking about reddit   No. Not even close. Reddit is a link aggregator. If you want to view the content of a submission, you click a link and then go to the source website to view the content. This is reddit's main function. That gives the original authors/content creators traffic. People aren't copy/pasting entire articles and then hosting them in a self post. People actually have to leave this site in order to view the links. What reddit is doing is closer to google; they aggregate links. Reddit just sorts them through votes while google's is based on a search algorithm.  What OP is referring to, is sites that literally copy & paste the content from a target website onto theirs. You do not have to leave their site to view the content. I don't know what's more surprising, the fact that you actually believe reddit is like that Viral Nova place, or the fact that 20 ill-informed people upvoted you. What reddit is doing is nothing like what blogspammers and plagiarizers do.  You want to know how to easily tell the difference? Most people want their links on the front page of reddit. Some engage in elaborate SEO and spam techniques in order to make it happen. The same goes for google. People pay SEO companies a lot of money to rank high in google. Nobody is fighting to get their stuff stolen by Viral Nova. The opposite is probably happening with them, people are sending them DCMA complaints left and right to get their original content taken down and off their site.    because reddit is full of idiots.   Dunning–Kruger effect"

It applies when the copy serves the purpose of educating or informing, but not if it would act as a replacement for the original work. If your news article contains so much of the original that now I will gain nothing from viewing the original, then you have violated copyright.  Some news sites do get in trouble for reproducing copyrighted material in its entirety. The problem is that they usually only steal content from people who don't know better or can't afford to fight back."

No. Of course not, if you think about it, because otherwise content creators would never have any chance of controlling their intellectual property - you could sell a book someone else wrote as long as you put their name on it. There'd be no point to copyright, except the non-monetary benefit of ""getting credit"".  If you see a situation where someone apparently posted their own original content to reddit and then an external website rehosted it, it might be downright ethical of you to tell them about it, and maybe advise them of their rights. But most of the content you see here isn't original from the poster, even sometimes when they claim it is.

It's a perfectly clear rule about grass and walking, until you find that people coming home from bars are being ticketed, while people coming home from church are not.

As users of Reddit, we are in the unique situation where we actually sell the product (via posts) and buy the product (via page views). And yet, here you are referring to people who post things; or in ways you don't agree with, as 'rule breakers'. This isn't Kindergarten, or high school. You aren't the big bad principal, and we aren't snot nosed children running around without care or control. We don't owe you anything, and you are not above us in any way. The fact of the matter is, your business model is 100% based on the satisfaction and activity of your customer.   That was actually the beautiful thing about Reddit, millions of people around the world had actual freedom of speech at the touch of their fingertips. But here you are, looking to censor it. And babysit it. First it's this subreddit, or that subreddit. Who's to decide? You. Not us. By stripping us of our power to moderate ourselves, you have basically removed our freedom of speech. And you wonder why they hate you?  That being said, if you continue to piss off your resume stream, ie, your REAL board of directors, you won't have a company to try and mainstream to the 'real' front page of the Internet. Don't believe me? See Digg. See 4chan.  See the mirror sites that have already been put up as your competition and could easily surpass you given enough steam (Voat).

In contrast, we refer to people we respect and to people who commands a higher position than us with their last name, e.g. Mr Obama. Now in normal circumstances, full name is used when the person is being introduced to strangers, or within a legal setting. It has a neutral tone. But more often than not and especially in the context of ekjp, it is said with a negative tone. In this case, the full name is used because we don't respect said person. Calling a person with their full name shows that we ""respect"" the person out of spite. Other reasons for using someone's full name include making fun of them, or showing full disrespect."

I like Reddit because the celebrity stuff is held to pretty much one subreddit (a subreddit which was much more interesting before Reddit blew up and it became all celebrities but I can deal with it's downfall if it keeps the rest of Reddit clean of celebrities). I don't want to read or try to care about someone's opinion here just because they are a celebrity yet we already see accounts like Arnold's that will get upvoted no matter what they say.

Reddit benefits by having a more diverse userbase. Celebrities, athletes, experts and other types of successful people offer unique perspectives and knowledge. People want access to successful people and brands. Reddit could be a place where successful people/brands become more accessible to the public. For example, the value of /r/startups would rise significantly if Peter Thiel was a regular user.

And they a lot of them are people who work on the code.  Also there's /r/hearthstone. I think the subreddit is really important too. It really helped kickstart all the youtubers who do content from it. There's a ton of twitch personalities and they post a lot, interact with the community. I think Reddit was a really important piece of those communities.  Sure there's twitch, YouTube, and twitter, but no one really used the game forums.

Reddit wants to attract these large celebrities from all sources and make the website explode into extreme popularity like the likes of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube/Google+. Instead of just 163 million unique monthly visitors Reddit could have 700 million or even 1+ billion monthly visitors. Reddit, as a concept, can make this happen. Heavily increasing the sites audience can possibly carry this website above the red line and heavily increase the amount of active/frequent users."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,rosecenter,7,Tue Jul 7 07:58:31 2015 UTC,"It would be great if those celebrities join those communities, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO, and if they do want to, they wont need convincing. If they don't, then no it would NOT be great. It would be like having someone join a party that really rather would have stayed home. I'm sure that most people have been to a gathering of some sort with someone like that. There's few things that can dampen the mood more than someone wanting to be elsewhere."

I can only think of promotion as the different driving force, but I'm sure there must be others. And I'd imagine you've given this a lot of thought so I'd love to hear what you think."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,Splendor78,4,Tue Jul 7 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"I do know of a celebrity that regularly uses Reddit, and perhaps /u/wil might have time and ideas to toss in about getting celebrities to be more active on Reddit?

Skulking around the bottom of every AMA is a mountain of abuse which Victoria could filter out. Some celebrities might have the will to wade through that, but responding to any of it at all is just asking for PR disasters. If I were famous I wouldn't use reddit so that people could call me a hack or a shyster and tell me everything I've ever done is garbage, and probably PM me death threats on a daily basis too.

The downside is that celebs, for instance, can't just treat it like twitter/facebook (spam machine: ""hey look at me i like cats"", ""buy my album"", etc)  The upside is that when they do engage authentically, they can spend 5minutes writing a thoughtful post that will get more views and more goodwill than spending a week straight on twitter.  This Arnold post on r/gainit (small community) generated hundreds of thousands of views and tons of press. All he had to do was take some time in a community he genuinely was interested in and be authentic.  Not everyone will do that, but that's OK, that's what makes reddit special: the few who do are going to be reaching an audience more relevant and larger than anywhere else.  edit: There are no plans to monetize this by having paid celeb accounts."

Do you really think from a PR side it makes sense to post on small sub-reddits instead? And it takes them literally a few seconds to reach those millions of users with a twitter or instagram post.    Granted, some reddit posts blow up and go viral, but one of the reasons for that is also that it is so special and rare that a celebrity is posting on reddit. Most posts won't get that amount of views -- and most posts won't be of that great quality either, it would just take too much time.    What is the pitch here? ""Hey, can you spend a couple of hours per week/month on reddit posting meaningful and authentic content to get some views? But don't post advertisements or the community will bully you like no other!""    If they genuinely enjoy posting on reddit, cool! Support them!

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,rosecenter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:28:11 2015 UTC,"While I understand the concept, I can't say that I think it's going to work either.  Celebrities stay that way precisely because people have limited access to them.  The mystique makes genuine encounters with them more interesting.  Without someone helping them manage their image, people would find out that many of them are just ordinary people, prone to all the same human failings all the rest of us have (occasionally we find that out anyway).  Twitter works for quite a few of them because they can use it for one-way broadcasts and avoid responding to others.  I don't think celebrity access on Reddit will ever be more than hit-and-run encounters."

I'd be willing to lay down good money that if a survey of films were done, it would be found that across films that aren't comedies bathrooms are far more often used for sex than excretion.

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,Fletch71011,-1,Tue Jul 7 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"I get why traffic is important.   My point is a) Reddit is not going to get a sizeable number of celebrities doing what Alexis imagines, and b) Even if it did, Reddit is not going to get significantly more traffic because a few more celebrities become public redditors. Twitter has celebrities out the yin yang, they aren't growing and they are going bankrupt.   To be clearer, I don't think Alexis is even thinking about increasing traffic directly.

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,random12356622,7,Tue Jul 7 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering me Alexis.   My issue is that we are likely to see shitposting on a whole new level if there are multiple celebrities participating. As it is right now, anything a known celebrity posts is pushed so high with votes that nothing else can compete. It won't matter what the quality is -- Reddit's average user sees celebrity and upvotes away. Imagine the front page filled with shit posts like what Verne Troyer (a D list celeb, mind you) does -- this is like MrBabyMan of Digg fame on steroids. Not to mention we found out it is not even just him behind that account but rather someone who specializes in social media -- we would have no way of knowing if it even is the actual celebrity posting and 9 times out of ten, it wouldn't be.  I like Reddit because for the most part, there is no special treatment. Celebrity participation will erase all of that."

There is a reason anonymity is important to reddit, I think William Shatner request is proof of that. That wasn't even bad things, just requests really.   It is bad enough when the average user gets targeted, what happens when it is a celebrity?  Also would this policy promote normal users to out themselves? How disastrous could that be when someone takes a disliking to them."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,kn0thing,4,Tue Jul 7 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"What you said is spot on. I think it really depends on the nature of the person and how much they want to put in to it. One of the subs I hang out in most, r/fantasy, has quite a few authors that are regular users. It's mutually beneficial having them participate in the community because the community members get to have interesting conversations with these folks and the authors get their names out there.   I would hope that other 'celebs' would see the benefit of becoming a part of a community (or two or three) around here, but realistically I don't think they would bother."

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,boobookittyfuck69696,2,Tue Jul 7 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"I think that it would be really interesting to have thoughtful interactions with/input from celebrities, as sometimes happens on Quora, for example. But I can't imagine that many celebrities would sign up to receive the kind of disrespect that Jesse Jackson faced during his AMA. It's one thing when you're on a publicity tour; you stop in once, maintain your agenda no matter what, and continue on your merry way. Why would a celebrity (especially one who is not white or a man) regularly take time out of their day to ""engage authentically"" with people who feel empowered to spew hate (and creepiness - can you imagine the creepiness that would ensue if Emma Watson or Jennifer Lawrence started using Reddit?) the way many Redditors do? Why would celebrities engage with such people without the safety and cover of anonymity?  I, an absolute nobody, have attracted downvote fairies and the occasional nasty PM just by disagreeing with someone once; I can only imagine that celebrities would suffer far worse and on a more regular basis, given that they are more widely known and would attract more attention. I also imagine their PR teams would be scrutinizing the site more closely for negative mentions of participating celebrities (with and without username mentions), and they'd probably be quite likely to find more after a celeb has participated. This would all, I imagine, lead to even more negative attention being drawn to Reddit when celebrities and their staff begin complaining about how they are treated/depicted here and how little is done to curb hate speech (and creepiness) on this site. It seems to me that if you're serious about this plan, you're going to have to really clean house."

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,Asshai,54,Tue Jul 7 02:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I don't see the link between that, and Victoria being let go. On the contrary, it would seem to me that someone nice and professionnal introducing Reddit to the celebrities and vice versa would be a great way to let them stay. Letting them know the dos and don'ts (don't talk about Rampart, do chime in where you're not expected, don't fall asleep with a photoshopped sheet of paper on you, do accept being promoted to moderate subreddits on marijuana use) of Reddit, I'm sure it's still the best way to let the celebrities enjoy their IAmA, and maybe they'll stay.  But Victoria never prevented anyone from writing their own IAmA, if I remember correctly, in her own IAmA, she said her degree of involvment in IAmA's varied depending on the celebrity's wishes. She could simply tell them a few guidelines, or completely write the IAmA while speaking with the celebrity on the phone.  Plus, what you're saying here isn't really surprising. Of course it's in Reddit's best interests to have some celebrities to showcase. It makes the already existing users feel important, and in a special place. It makes fans of the celebrity curious about the website. It's added advertising for reddit as other news outlets will reference what such celebrity wrote on Reddit. It's just gold to them.  But still, I don't see why that couldn't happen with Victoria still on the payroll."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,concise_dictionary,20,Tue Jul 7 16:28:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, their reasons don't seem clearly connected to firing Victoria but it's the reason Reddit is giving so I went with that, and I think it's worth discussing.  They could have instructed Victoria to put less emphasis on ""transcribing AMA's over the phone"" type of AMA's and focus more on getting the celebrity involved themself.  In fact it seems like they're going to have someone (or a whole ""talent relation team"") doing just that, so why not Victoria?  I can't answer that.  Maybe they wanted a fresh start, maybe she didn't agree with this new direction, or maybe there are additional reasons she was let go."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,80sKid,24,Tue Jul 7 02:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, and as a matter of fact, I think celebrities becoming redditors has to happen organically, it's not something that should be actively pursued. Plus, Anna Kendrick is a well-known lurker, I wouldn't be surprised to learn there are a lot of others like her, when you can't show the tip of your nose outside without mobs following you and asking for photos and such, it must be refreshing to get some anonimity back on Reddit. You know, talking and being talked to in a normal, non-starstruck way."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,80sKid,16,Tue Jul 7 03:27:48 2015 UTC,"a well-known lurker   I think it should stay that way.  I like it better when everyone is fairly anonymous so people focus on the comment not the commenter.  If a celebrity wants to post about themselves then that's one thing, but for general reddit commenting and interactions I think it will be a distraction."

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,80sKid,18,Mon Jul 6 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"No, the reason why it was set up the other way is because most celebrities don't use reddit.

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,Margravos,10,Tue Jul 7 00:29:27 2015 UTC,"To me, this sounds like a noble idea, but what does it amount to in practice?   Phasing out our role being in-between interesting people and reddit   This explains the sack of Victoria. Reddit HQ wants to move AMAs away from an interview-like process with crowdsourced questions and give more control to the interviewee. That's not necessarily a good thing.  Think about celebrity accounts on other social networks, especially Twitter. It sounds like that's what Reddit wants. It works sometimes, but as often as not, the accounts end up being run by PR employees. We already have outlets for that.   The thing that celebrity AMAs (used to) offer that nothing else did as well is the chance for people to interact with powerful people in such a way as to get questions they actually care about answered, in an environment that isn't completely controlled by PR teams.  Reddit HQ seems to be taking the one competitive advantage of the one thing that is truly mainstream about Reddit and trying their best to get rid of it."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,quarensintellectum,8,Mon Jul 6 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"This explains the sack of Victoria   Except it doesn't.  Because /u/kn0thing goes on to say as part of his hearty helping of crow that:   There is an email setup, which is triaged by a team of people in addition to their other jobs, but will ultimately be replaced by one full-time person.   Which makes NO sense.  They had a full time person doing the job.  And, by all external accounts, doing the job exceptionally well.    This only further fuels speculation like what Marc Brodnick claimed on Quora (and later deleted).  Namely, that reddit is eyeballing big commercial changes to AMAs and Victoria wasn't willing to go along with it.  This is also reinforced by /r/IAMA mods refusing to work with the admins any more since they couldn't get the info/transparency they felt they needed."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,itty53,6,Mon Jul 6 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"That's certainly a possibility.  The ""email team"" feels to me like a stopgap measure implemented after they realized they had no transition plan in place, rather than their long term plan.  As far as the monetization speculation, I wouldn't be surprised if it was at least partially true, but the fact is we don't know at this point."

They can still get the info they need. Just ask Victoria for it. The admins didn't delete her account or her mail. She still has all that info.   As far as transparency, I find that point hilarious. Mods have private mod subs that they don't let users into. There's modtalk and defaultmods and however many other exclusive mod only subs...but they want transparency."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,william44isme,2,Mon Jul 6 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"I believe the main point of contention was a lack of clarity on if and how AMAs were going to be commercialized.   That seems like a worthwhile point to want clarified, not just for mods but for reddit as a whole."

It's not like this is an invite-only club.  I also think it's absurd to try to get celebrities to use your social media platform; they're notoriously technically inept. I doubt Morgan Freeman can even type well, for instance. He can certainly talk all day though.   In fact, I argue that there are many celebrities who are active redditors: They simply don't come right out and say who they are. Why should they? Would you? I won't even tell people which alt accounts are mine, let alone my full name or a photo of me holding a stupid piece of paper as 'evidence'. Edit: There's also precedent for this. I recall a few times the subject of an AMA would state something like 'I have a personal account here, but this one is strictly for the AMA'. So we know that there exist at least a few closet-users who spend their days in the limelight.  I mean seriously; it's even against reddit rules to say outright who you are. That's private information. You're not supposed to post any personal information about anyone, including yourself. Granted this rule is broken by many AMAs and beyond: See /r/RedditGetsDrawn for people posting photos of themselves all the time. But that'd be a tu quoque argument; the fact remains that it's against the rules to out yourself on reddit."

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,ReBurnInator,7,Tue Jul 7 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like Reddit's anti-corporate paranoia will prevent it being an attractive place for celebrities to use as another social media outlet. In virtually any post that even vaguely mentions a brand or company you can usually find multiple people replying with ""/r/HailCorporate"". Also, many people feel that celebrity AMAs are just publicity tools (which may well be true).  Given this rampant anti-advertising stance Reddit just makes no sense at all for a celebrity. The whole point of social media for celebrities is to connect with fans and to promote their content. If they can't promote their content without facing enormous suspicion and hostility, then Reddit as a platform really makes no sense for celebrities.  Given the choice between Reddit or another platform like Facebook or Twitter, the choice is obvious - not Reddit."

TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,Unicormfarts,3,Mon Jul 6 21:13:18 2015 UTC,"So, I have a theory for this but idk if it fits with the AMA app development and video AMAs. Perhaps the whole pull-back is an about-face on those efforts.  I'd assume reddit doesn't want to waste resources on coordinating with celebrities as much as they do. Also, having someone like Victoria who basically did part of some mod's job for them blurs the admin/mod/user line quite a lot. So instead, they just pull back.  The celebrity AMAs are just PR stunts 98% of the time anyway. Some are really interesting. Some are fun at least. Most are just ""did this person give a funny or silly enough answer that we like them."" I'm not sure why reddit corporate would want to be in that business instead of letting the sub run itself accordingly.  The infrastructure of running a sub (the tools, clear rules, etc) should be on the admin teams. The daily operation of a sub should be on the mods unless it poses a problem for reddit inc. So just invite celebs to be users if they'd like or do their own if they'd like. I never understood why reddit wasted staff resources on that anyway."
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,resonanteye,4,Mon Jul 6 23:09:55 2015 UTC,reddit is for people who don't have anything better to do. Celebrities have better things to do.
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,Thoguth,6,Mon Jul 6 22:59:04 2015 UTC,"I think that's a mistake in thinking because it is an misunderstanding in what an AMA actually is. An AMA isn't a way to convince celebrities to come and use reddit. Reddit is supposed to be a place of anonymous interaction and content sharing. Any celebrities that join reddit (this part is a personal belief) should not rely on their original fame to interact with other redditors but should be able to hold their own based on their own personal interactions and content from their sign-up not from former fame. The anonymity is one of the reasons that everyone is able to stand on equal footing and I'm able to comment here just as easily as Obama could without his opinion being overpowered because he's the president and I'm a lowly citizen.  The point of an AMA isn't to invite celebrities to use Reddit and frequent it. Then Reddit would just become a place revolving around famous people rather than around anonymous users. We'd become a sort a reality TV. Instead, AMAs are purely used to ask questions about people that an average person would not have access too. So if I want to ask questions of a top executive or I want to know more about space exploration, I have the access to ask questions from those people and have them answer back rather than rely on third-party sources. And so Victoria (or the AMA mods themselves) were essential in that regard. Because I don't believe that the reddit administration should be striving to integrate celebrities into the reddit community. They should (at least with respect to AMAs) have the one goal of giving celebrities the access to reddit for a one-time opportunity to answer questions posed to them. It's like an interview with a network station or a speaker at a work company. The network station or company makes it easier for their speaker to address the audience. They don't seek to have the speaker join their community.   It's not a perfect analogy but it fits well enough. An AMA is ONLY to ask questions of a celebrity and anyone working with an AMA behind the scenes should only make it easier for this to happen. If celebrities want to join the reddit community, they should do it separately not through an AMA.   note: as a personal opinion, i do think that all the work Victoria did seem to do a better job of persuading celebrities to join the community based on her efficiency and good work than anything currently going on btw"
TheoryOfReddit,3cbydv,thebigbabar,4,Tue Jul 7 07:35:12 2015 UTC,Reddit wants a PR haven. Have some cheaply run accounts associated with (but never used by) celebrities.  And it'll work really well because reddit users are the most sheepish users on the internet.

They make accounts for AMA's and switch back to not get stalked.  Victoria helped organize AMA's so we stopped getting celebrities abandoning them after a couple questions and leaving or completely ignoring good questions.  By helping schedule them and making it easier for the celebrity we were sure AMA's had a decent amount of content.  It didn't stop random celebrities from doing their own or just popping in..

Of course maybe they offered her the option to change from her current role to one that does more to help celebs become redditors themselves, and maybe she declined in a way that caused her job to be over.

But if reddit wants Dwayne Wade to browse and post on r/nba as u/somerandomdudethatsnotdwade, how does that help reddit much?  Reddit isn't getting any credit for having Wade be a redditor.

Especially the former group you mentioned, they seem to want their ideas to propagate amongst the general populace, as if they're fighting a war and need to win. I've also found that most of them excluding the extremists browse general, normal subs, so both groups intermingle a lot. I'm sure a happy medium can be found."
TheoryOfReddit,3cc574,LuisN,42,Mon Jul 6 19:42:57 2015 UTC,"As I see it, here are the parties in play here:  Actual reactionary conservatives: people who don't participate in a forum like /r/fatpeoplehate or /r/coontown in order to feel edgy, but who genuinely wish to associate themselves with the sentiments and feelings expressed in these forums. People who are using these forums ""as intended"", in good faith, because these are their political beliefs.  These people are being straight-up attacked and are reacting as such.    Reactionary libertarians: people who don't like the idea of rules, broadly-defined, and who especially resent restrictions upon what they'd characterize as freedom of speech -- and who therefore dislike ""SJWs"" and ""uppity feminists"" and ""tumblrinas"", and so on. (So Ellen Pao, as a woman of colour who has sued a past employer for discrimination, is basically Satan to thse people.)  These people see the opportunity to destroy an SJW and take a stand for free speech. (And, IMO, feel sooper sooper special and edgy for sticking it to the man like an Ayn Rand hero, etc.)  Many of these people also think Reddit is on the wrong track (they still haven't ""forgiven"" site leadership for ""censoring"", say, creepshots) and are looking for anything they can wedge into a narrative about the demise of the site, administrative overreach, etc.    Channers and other trolls: people who are on the surface indistinguishable from the reactionaries, but who are involved not out of a solemn desire to advance these causes, but because they see an opportunity to cause mischief and human suffering, because it'll be lulzy.    Friends of Victoria: not necessarily personal friends, but people who have worked closely with and come to respect her, and who are saddened by a friend's firing, especially if it makes their jobs more difficult. This group is not exclusively composed of moderators, but includes thousands of people who have seen and appreciated her work in some way or another.    Useful Idiots: users who are not predisposed to support the end-goals of the Reactionary Libertarians or Actual Reactionary Conservatives, but who have gotten drawn into this fight.  It's important to understand that these people are not stupid, nor are they dishonest. (""Useful Idiot"" is a Soviet-era term of art: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot)  These people wind up involved in the movement for various reasons. I mean, let's be honest, it feels good: ""Stand up for Reddit, stand up for Free Speech, stand up for Victoria"". (What do the opponents have, ""LEEEAVE REDDIT ALOOOOONE""?)  The defining characteristic of this group is that, if you pull them aside and start talking to them about specific decisions and specific forums -- so you support the existance of /r/fatpeoplehate? was creepshots okay? -- they often express genuine distaste or disgust.  But.  So long as they can stay zoomed out -- so long as ""the Demise of Reddit and the Tyranny of Ellen Pao"" is a story which floats in the air, independently of actual events or decisions -- they whole-heartedly support the movement, and don't want to get bogged down on specific considerations. Shut up about /r/thefappening, they've got important work to do!    And the key thing to understand is that, so long as the useful idiots are at a critical mass, they are both self-propagating and capable of operating independently of the reactionaries who benefit from their actions. Tens of thousands of earnest people putting their heart into their words, believing themselves to be part of this enormous social movement for uppercase-Real Change, etc. All this activity legitimizes the cause, attracts more useful idiots, and thereby keeps the movement going. For every person who twigs to the fact that they've accidentally wound up standing up for /r/fatpeoplehate, two more join the party.  Having whipped this movement up, with an inadvertant assist from the Friends of Victoria, the reactionaries now get to lie back and let their work be done for them.  (And the Channers are having a fucking ball, but you already knew that.)    I think this situation is much more complicated than just two pivotal groups. I think we're dealing with a much more fluid, overlapping and inscrutable setup, with all sorts of masks and disguises as well."

You have a more nuanced take than I do, and a better grasp of the history and larger context in which all this is happening. Also, TIL the term ""useful idiot"", so thanks for that!  I suppose I'd say that while I agree that there are more than two groups if we define ""groups"" by their ideologies, motivations, behavior, worldview, etc., I was looking at ""groups"" defined by their shared goal: get rid of Pao. Though these groups could be heterogeneous in every way BESIDES their shared goal, this may not matter in terms of how they are perceived by others (especially those outside of Reddit), and their ability to affect change.   This certainly isn't the first time there have been ""strange bedfellows"" with shared goals; the Republican party in the U.S. over the last decade comes to mind."

Freedom of speech has no value to me if I'm listening in a playground. Censorship isn't the only way to ruin a community.  Besides, one of the most profound changes I've seen in reddit since the early days has been the rise of hate... stuff. If anything, early reddit was even more naive about democracy and free speech being the solution to everything ever, but I'm also sure people would have made their anti-censorship speech and then downvoted every FPH-er into oblivion."

I take issue with this, though maybe you'd class me as a reactionary libertarian. I am completely aware that subs like FPH and their ilk would disgust me. At the same time, I think things which disgust me warrant more consideration before I support banning them because that would be the natural/emotional response and I like to act deliberately, not reactively.  And having a background in law, I actually understand (or like to think that I do) the actual importance of free speech no matter how vile and the potential chilling effects of censorship, and so I am actually very genuinely behind the ""Free Speech!"" argument.

Edit/PS: Seriously, did a tonne of people just recently find out that restrictions on freedom of speech is Constitutionally only barred in respect of the government? Because that's what it seems like with literally everyone and their dog pointing it out, even in situations where the distinctions is irrelevant."

You're the one being a hipster and trying to be smug about it instead of giving a fair share. We're mad because we are told we love FPH and we genuinely have that as our politics, but we don't. We are mad because the site was originally founded on free speech principles and an open platform was promised. We are mad because it's clear that reddit under Pao is about commercialization and not community ties. And while I find Pao obnoxious for playing up the victim narrative (which I'd consider typical SJW behavior) I really could care less about her ethnicity or gender. She lost her court case because she made a case out of nothing and got called on it. Her decisions while CEO of reddit are also concerning and show a disregard for the actual users of the site.   At the end of the day, people like me helped build reddit. Why are people who came later more important? Does it matter if the majority are passive observers of image macros and not invested in the site? I am and it seems like the only people arguing with me are hipsters and SJWs who don't even want a real debate. They want to laugh and use quotes around words to mock their usage and refuse to actually have a discussion. And then, as I said, I'm likened to some kind of neocon and told I must love Ayn Rand?

The more you push, the harder they will push back.  So you don't push, you subvert.  You be there at every last moment to show how people are fucking wrong, and have no basis for where they stand.  Do that long enough, and they change their views on their own, rather than learning to be silent about them, or to have a new group to hate.   I'm not having your lectures on the evils of ""shutting down discussion""   Then stop reading, and stop responding, unless you are going to thoroughly say I am wrong for reasons other than ""I wouldn't dare respect people with that opinion.""   And I'm not having your tedious, milquetoast whinging about hurting the reactionaries' feelings.   I don't give a fuck about their feelings, I give a fuck about what they do when you take the wrong course of action.  It's a very common thing in modern ""liberal"" ideals.  The actions of people are not decided by free will, they aren't a free choice, or they aren't as much as we ever thought they were in the past.

What happened there is that /pol/ became (and still is) one of the most visible and active producers of original content. Even benign memes like ""Into the trash it goes"" and ""IT'S HAPPENING"" originated from /pol/ and helped spread to the rest of the site. Arguably by the end of the Zimmerman trial, /pol/ had cemented itself as the most influential board on all of 4chan (with some help from /sp/ and /int/) and took over the site. While there is still a vocal leftist and anti-/pol/ element on 4chan, /pol/ has become so commonplace and frequent that the people complaining about /pol/ are more obnoxious than the /pol/acks themselves.   In that sense, I can see the same happening to Reddit. Posters from the Chimpire need to step up their original content and work on more subtle infiltration of other, apolitical reddit boards. Before long, they'll be accepted as usual posters and the people who raise hell about them by using stuff like that isreactionarybot will be more annoying and obnoxious than the Chimpire posters could hope to be. Thus, the backlash from neutral redditors will be focused more of the ones raising hell rather than the Chimpire guys who are spreading their ideology while trying to have a good time.

The firing of Victoria Taylor, who oversaw the company’s  relations with the volunteers who moderate its thousands of  discussion boards, or subreddits, prompted fury. Many of them shuttered their forums. Even the well-known “Ask me Anything”,  which Ms Taylor helped co-ordinate, went dark. Managers have  (understandably) been putting a greater emphasis on making  money; the moderators (understandably) worry that this is  destroying Reddit’s distinctive culture of link-sharing and  discussion. Ellen Pao, the interim chief executive, has apologised  (twice) but 200,000 have signed an online petition calling for her  resignation. The episode exemplifies the online world’s perennial  tension between commerce and community.

How old is the thread?  By the four hour mark, the top comment in the thread has almost certainly been made.  Too much longer than that, and everything about the topic has been said.  The lower comments tend to be rehashed jokes and repeats of the same thing.    If you have something unique to offer, it probably won't be seen unless you make the comment in a comment chain closer to the top.     Think about the attention span, too.  Who is going to read all the way to the bottom of the page?  The top few comments tend to be the most interesting, depending on the subreddit.  It varies by content in the submission, but in /r/askreddit you'll probably have the top 20 comments be pretty good, but in /r/pics, /r/funny, /r/gaming?  Probably only the top 5 are going to be worth reading.  Of course there are exceptions, but this has been my experience.  Plus, once you've seen a submission, how many times will you open the comments section to read through it?  I usually don't, unless I have a reason to.  If I see something on the Front Page, it's likely that everything interesting to say about the submission has risen to the top, so I think most people find something toward the top to latch onto and comment on, and the lower comments don't get much interaction."

Admittedly, the previous top comment was agreeing with the OP, and my comment was disagreeing with the OP - which aligns with your follow-up point that everything has often been said in older threads, because my comment expressed a different point of view which had not already been written.

Then there's subreddits like /r/manufacturing (full disclosure: I mod there) that attract a lot of spam. Without moderators filtering this out, these subs will become uninhabitable. This process can only be automated so much: there's still a lot of manual work there to catch false positives or spam that slips through the cracks.   Finally, there's all the side work mods do like building and maintaining wikis and the subreddit css.   Without mods, all these things would become impossible.

TheoryOfReddit,3c8cc2,jippiejee,9,Mon Jul 6 10:50:29 2015 UTC,"No, reddit does not need moderators. No internet forum needs moderators. All they need is a method to submit content and post comments. That's it. Everything else, including moderators, is optional, depending on your requirements for the forum.   So you're absolutely right that an internet forum could merely consist of sub-fora for different topics.   The question is... would you want to go there?   The first issue to consider is spam. Any unmoderated forum would attract lots of advertisers submitting links to their content or products. This spam would come to drown out other content.   The second issue to consider is whether the forum is welcoming to newcomers. Even here on reddit, where some people complain that moderation is too intrusive, we have subreddits which are centres for racism and bigotry and hatred. An unmoderated internet forum would allow these people freer access to post their racism and bigotry and hatred throughout that forum. Here on reddit, the moderators of each subreddit are able to stop those people posting in their particular subreddit.  Would you want to go to an unmoderated forum where the content is dominated by advertisers and the commentary is riddled with hatred?  Sure, you don't need moderators, but many people want them. Most people on reddit want some moderation; the main problem here is agreeing on how much moderation is enough and how much is too much."

If for no other reason, we need moderation to keep illegal and highly unethical information off Reddit.  Do you think the few admins we have are capable of catching every single time underage porn or dox are posted?  No, users have to report it to mods, who remove it immediately and then report it to the admins.  And if you advertised subreddits as being completely unmoderated, everyone who wanted to post that stuff would immediately go there."
TheoryOfReddit,3c8cc2,KiraKira_,3,Sun Jul 5 23:05:57 2015 UTC,"The idea of ""no moderators"" sounds fantastic on paper where everyone gets behind the goals of the place and contributes in a rational, educated fashion. The problem is that no such place actually exists.  All public forums that achieve any kind of popularity will eventually fill up with hostile users who are there for selfish reasons and do not share the goals of the forum. Just a few kinds of selfish users as an example...   Spammers who want you lure you to their sites for monetary gain Self-promoters who think their crap content smells like roses Astroturfers who use your forum to push their own agendas and views Just plain stupid people who haven't read the rules and have nothing constructive to add Immature children who would be better off caged in a littlerbox until they grow up Trolls and other saboteurs who want to disrupt the place for their own amusement   This is a fact of life. If you can't control the effect that these people have on the forum, you will see an inexorable slide in content quality that will drive away all of the good contributors who are sick of putting up with the bullshit. They will move on to a place that hasn't got these issues, and eventually hostile users will be the only ones left. This is the Eternal September effect and it is older than the internet, and not exclusive to online forums. It applies to any gathering of people and power.  You might want to ask a better question. Can we achieve a system of distributed moderation that quietly identifies the best actors in a community and assigns a slightly higher degree of power to those people, so that the moderation effect comes from an aggregate of users instead of a small, easily corruptible clique? That's what progress would look like."

The big issue with modern reddit and no mods is that the admins don't want to enforce most site wide rules. They want mods to do it for them, and get mad if the mods don't enforce the big ones.

TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,KiraKira_,9,Thu Jul 9 13:33:32 2015 UTC,The problem between the mods and admins has been happening since long before anyone knew who Ellen Pao was.  That more than anything should demonstrate how these people are just latching onto this to push their hate of her.

TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,Churba,7,Mon Jul 6 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"Hell no. Kn0thing straight up mocked the drama, and while that was an extraordinarily stupid move, and ended up being like pouring petrol on a fire, it gets mentioned a miniscule fraction of the time, compared to people lashing out at Pao. Even in threads like the announcement thread where they have a reasonable expectation of having the admins read the comments.  In fact, if nothing else, it actually ended up increasing the amount of hatred being directed at Pao and gave the people doing so a sense of justification, despite the fact that it was a white dude saying it, and Pao had nothing to do with it."

I feel like the FPHers and the muh-free-speech people are trying to use the backlash against the admins to further their anti-Pao stance which is really unfortunate, since the blackout has legitimate reasons behind it, as you've said.   She's the head of the organization and as such, any decision the organization makes is ultimately her responsibility. The backlash, whether it's due to firings, subreddits being shut-down, or even aggressively administration (i.e., shadowbans), is due to decisions the organization has made.

No he isn't. At least Not in this thread and not in this place, and not with such a poor argument.  The argument is literally piss poor, and anyone who has the faintest inkling of how forums work, how finance, investing, or even Steam/TF2/DotA works, will know what a lurching unfinished beast of an Idea that is.  And since you may actually need to have this pointed out to you, and anyone else reading this:  1) Ad revenues are down. Ad blockers and user behavior has changed to stop clicking.  2) Ad revenue is crap anyway  3) The better model they figured out was reddit gold. Its been somewhat succesful.   4) Reddit gold works under a similar reward model similar to, but more complicated than the amusement park analogy for video games/ Steam. This requires people to be happy or think happy thoughts about the site.   5) If people are unhappy, then they don't spend money. The counterintuitive inference here is that if people had spent more money on Reddit Gold, and they had given other monetization alternatives, or even reduced the price of gold, reddit would be more profitable and these ridiculous theories wouldn't exist (they'd be replaced with something else. because the most upset are the ones most vocal online)  6) Finally No one will pay reddit to let the interview, because people online know when they are being had and are exceedingly vocal about it.   My use of language may be poor and convoluted, but the fact is that any cursory understanding of how forums/finance works would immunize you to such theories"

But they didnt realise that it would create another one instead.  The real value and what a salesargument, if any exist, will focus is the size of the user base. Period.

I don't believe that's true at all - with or without those subreddits, I'm sure advertisers rest assured that many overweight people regularly use Reddit.

I know a few women who've had issues with discrimination in the workplace, one of then took legal action. Although there was a body of evidence she was discriminated against based on her gender (really gross stuff) that's really hard to prove so they dropped that whole angle."
TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,Churba,7,Mon Jul 6 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yep. Here's the money shot from this article when it comes to how reddit likes to use that verdict:   And yet even those who sided with Kleiner wanted to see the firm ""punished,"" believed Kleiner’s culture was lawless, and agreed that venture capital's gender imbalance was ""appalling.""   Literally the opposite of how reddit likes to use it, to try and pretend her case was frivolous and that it was proven beyond a doubt that no discrimination occurred.  And often outright calling it Frivolous, to boot, showing that the person saying so has zero idea that ""frivolous"" actually has a proper meaning in law that doesn't apply in this case."
TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,telestrial,48,Mon Jul 6 23:24:05 2015 UTC,"The answer is yes. I got into a heated argument with someone two days ago about this. He insisted that FPH being removed and Victoria's firing were related events. He told me Reddit is being sanitized for commercial consumption and firing Victoria was a way to get at monetizing AMAs. The only thing he had proof wise for any of his claims was the anonymous source that spoke of chooter's firing. That source still hasn't been verified with any hard evidence. He wouldn't have it. He again insisted it was obvious. He told me that I had to prove that the events were unrelated. As if, by default, they were related events. No matter what I said he disagreed, insulted my intelligence, and I was down voted to hell.  I'm venting here, but my story does illustrate a narrative that these people have. They're looking at all the events since the FPH ban as one huge blunder by Reddit's administration. They've taken the subreddit blackout and forced it into the story they believe is happening behind the scenes. Mind you..they have NO proof. That's never stopped anyone on Reddit, though.  The subs going dark was due to a lack of communication. The FPH community has taken this event and blown it up into something it isn't. The problem is that they are being extremely ""loud"" about it. They're like the Ann Coulter of Reddit at the moment. They think if you just talk over everyone else you win. Generally speaking this can work over time. People will believe the loudest voice, regardless."

I've been thinking about who has the most power in this scenario: the smaller, angrier group that posts a lot of comments and upvotes/downvotes anti-Pao stuff, or the larger, less-angry group that doesn't bother to comment or vote on Pao-related posts. The way Reddit is structured might mean that those with the loudest voice end up screaming in a small echo-chamber. If they're in a very large subreddit (like r/gifs), they'll be drowned out by the majority that just want to move on, and if they're in a smaller subreddit, people who don't share their views will just unsubscribe to that subreddit. The structure of Reddit may work to isolate those with the loudest voice (or so I hope)."
TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,jhc1415,39,Mon Jul 6 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"in particular that firing /u/chooterVictoria so suddenly and with no warning was a clear indication of this pattern.   I agree with everything except this. Why would they notify the mods before firing an employee? This makes no sense. How would you feel if you found out you lost your job through a PM from a user you know on reddit. They are not going to tell anyone about  this before it happens.   Now having said that, they definitely handled it poorly after she was fired. They should have immediately gone to /r/iama and told them what just happened and what their plan is moving forward. For that, I understand the mods concerns.   I also believe the mods handled this situation poorly as well. They shut down the subreddit in the middle of an AMA for something that could have been resolved internally with the subreddit still open. The protests thing was ok. But I think they should have waited until all active amas were finished before shutting the sub down.   All around, poor decisions were made. And they are still being made. /r/nexus6 reopened. The community freaked out at the mods, so they shut it down again. That is not an entertainment subreddit like /r/funny or /r/AdviceAnimals. It is a sub people use for actual help with their phones. Shame on those mods for caving in so easily. Those people complaining don't give a shit about this issue. They just want to see some drama. This is an issue between mods and admins. No one else. It is up to the mods and mods alone whether or not they want to protest. Clearly these ones didn't. But they have no balls and just did it to appease the idiots."

What they could have done, and what they now said they wish they had done, was to have a plan for someone else to pick up her immediate work (like scheduled AMAs in the near future where she was the only person in contact with the guest) and make the transition as seamless as possible.  So ""hey guys, just wanted to let you know we're going to fire Victoria in six hours"" is obviously off the table, but ""hey guys, just wanted to let you know we've let Victoria go, so for the interim so-and-so is now handling the AMAs that she was working on"" would have gone a long way, even if there were still hiccups."

It makes sense for subreddits that were directly affected by Victoria's sudden removal to react. But, for the most part, there wasn't really a good reason to try and shut down all of reddit. I mean, ""mod tools,"" sure. But it's an awkward, hamfisted way of trying to get what you want, one that could only emerge in a system like Reddit where spontaneity, circlejerks, and rash decisions rule, for users, moderators, and even (of course!) the administration.   Give it a while more, and it, like every ~internet revolution~ before it, will fade away. Not as in ""people are going to stop making hilarious calls to arms and being generally ridiculous,"" but it will become very clear that there is no actual influence or power held by these kind of agitators. Maybe they'll get a few subreddits, like /r/crappydesign. But, at most, that's an inconvenience, most likely it will just piss people off. I don't really know if it can be co-opted. It wasn't really a movement in the sense of being good and proper, it was frankly too spontaneous and short-lived to be really described as such.  There's a certain fickleness that lets these things happen. People want to jump on the crazy bandwagon of ""fuck the admins!"" But, aside from dedicated /r/fatpeoplehate users and Gamergate members, very few redditors actually really care. It's a double-edged sword. The prototypical redditor is really, really easy to rally to your cause. But just try getting them to stick with it, to actually make any meaningful sacrifices, like moving to a different site. It won't happen. They want their cat pictures and AskRoddits, and frankly, I'm not saying that judgmentally because there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. They probably live more fulfilling lives than I do, dammit.  Also: frankly, the outrage over the firing is a bit overblown. Yes, it totally sucks to lose a job. But, at the same point in time, Reddit is not a sustainable business right now. It's been bleeding for a while, and cutting staff is a very common thing in bad times. Was their choice of who to let go a mistake? Possibly, given that Victoria seemed to actually be one of the few administrators that wasn't generally hated by a large portion of their site. But sometimes, people lose their jobs, even when they did nothing particularly wrong, and that's kind of just how the private sector tends to operate."

There was no real attempt to reason with the community at large pre-hammer, and 3. Sub bans had dubious requirements for taking effect, at the liberty of Reddit.  Chooter is different, but similar to the above, problem caused by a new change left to be figured out by the user post-solution, the powers that be offering chill pills and claiming everything will be the same and better, somehow, we promise. The big difference is that Reddit is taking responsibility, compared to saying that the community is to blame for the communities mistakes, because there is no reasonable way to tie Victoria being let go and the lack of mods in the know to the community, and I suppose Reddit has a little more reason to be mad then the PTB saying, ""no, we are fixing your problem."" But it all ties back to what presses which button on any given person."

Its like if you walk into someone's home, yelling obscenities at them, and then when they ask you to leave crying censorship.

TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,wtjones,17,Sun Jul 5 07:54:46 2015 UTC,"Reddit is a community (this is the product that they sell) run mostly by volunteer moderators. Those moderators have been complaining about a lack of communication and transparency from the admins for quite a few years. Firing Victoria was a glaring instance of the admins, and management in general's, lack of communication and general disregard for how the mods and community feel.   I'm not sure what Reddit brought EP in to do but if it was to raise overall morale and instill a sense of trust between the community and management, she is failing miserably. If it was to make Reddit profitable and she thinks she's going to do that by alienating the community and the moderators, she's going to fail miserably at that. I don't think that all of the blame should fall at the feet of EP. /u/Kn0thing should know better, but he seems openly hostile to the community as well. He seems to think Reddit is bigger/better than the community. This will be the ultimate demise of Reddit.   Reddit needs a CEO who cares about and is a part of the community. A CEO who understood reddit could have straightened a lot of this out with clear communication. Hell, even /u/yishan's terrible handling of that ex-employee AMA last year was better than doing nothing. Giving the moderators a head's up about what was happening and then speaking to the community directly about what was going on would have gone a long way in not fanning the flames.   Morale is awfully low around here and management isn't doing ANYTHING to try to improve it. In fact it seems like they're so disconnected from the community that they don't even see there's a problem. They still haven't come out and tried seriously to address the issues the mods raised.   Trying to pivot this to Reddit hates fat people and women seems disingenuous and continues to miss the actual point that redditors and especially the mods who do so much work for free, are suffering from low morale caused by a lack of communication and a sense of entitlement from the admins.    Here is an archive of messages between /u/kn0thing and /r/science mods http://i.imgur.com/ICSz7Xp.jpg.

Since you seem confused, let's work through it in more detail:  If users objects to the moderation regime in - say - r/IAMA, they can always defect to another (or elect to start their own) AMA subreddit with a different moderation team.  If the mods of r/IAMA are trying to organise and bring celebrities in to do AMAs on reddit (something the reddit admins recognise is an extremely desirable, valuable addition to reddit's public image), but the reddit admins either neglect (or, with Victoria's firing, actively sabotage) the mods efforts to do so... how does setting up a new subreddit change anything?"

TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,telestrial,0,Mon Jul 20 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think the AMA furore has been co-opted by ""the Fattening people"" at all.  I suspect what you're seeing is widespread and increasing dissatisfaction with the governance of reddit by normal users and mods, that's leaking out anywhere it can find an outlet.  The problem is that for much of the reddit community (or at least, the commenting/posting community) the reddit admins have practically negative credibility - if the admins told the average user the sky was blue, they wouldn't believe it until they checked for  themselves.  This has been happening increasingly for years (literally - at least half a decade that I can remember, and I suspect even before that).  The causes are widespread and go back a long way, but it's basically because of:   A long history of terrible communication by the admin team and non-transparency with the userbase, combined with high-minded rhetoric on freedom of speech, democratic ideals and community involvement that sets user-expectations and leads to the perception of hypocrisy. A number of decisions that were flat-out unpopular with the community (everything from the admins spiking the ""AT&T Blocks 4chan"" story because it was ""embarrassing"" years ago to forcing reddit employees to relocate to SF and appointing a figure like Pao as CEO more recently). A number of decisions that might well have been understandable or reasonable, but which (thanks to poor communication and a lack of transparency by the reddit admins) could be interpreted as moves that would be deeply unpopular with the user-base (the jailbait and creepshots bans, the Fattening, etc) An (accurate) awareness that reddit is short of cash, difficult to monetise via adverts and the fact that the murkier parts of reddit are largely the problem with attracting more advertisers to the site, creating an obvious tension between the community's continued freedom of speech and reddit's commercial success).   These four circumstances combine to form a context where the community largely distrusts the admin team, and is almost waiting for them to sell out and screw over the community.  That means that every unpopular or divisive move the admins make are remembered, and questionable or possible-to-misinterpret moves quickly generate negative interpretations or outright conspiracy theories.  These negative interpretations and conspiracy theories then disseminate quickly through the reddit community, and the admins' corrections or explanations are usually either entirely absent, or are offered far too late, purely reactively and posted half-way down obscure comment threads, which strictly limits both their persuasiveness and how much of the community they actually reach.  That sets up a self-reinforcing cycle, where poor communication and debatable decisions result in negative perceptions about the admin team, and these negative perceptions mean that debatable decisions in the future are even less likely to be given the benefit of the doubt.  Most people protesting the Fattening shutdowns weren't approving of FPH - those were a tiny and largely unsympathetic minority of the people arguing it was wrong.  Most people protesting were concerned it was closed because it was a toxic community, as an act of censorship... because that was the negative interpretation, and the admins' reassurances it was because those communities were engaged in harassment or brigading were too little, too late, and didn't play into the community's pre-existing prejudices and expectations.  Likewise, Victoria's firing was the spark that caused AMA to temporarily shut down, partly in protest at the lack of support from the admin team, but mostly for sensible logistical reasons.  Other communities then started going private in solidarity with the AMA mods' plight, and as a general protest against the admins' lack of support (a complaint which dates back years amongst most mode-teams).  The reddit community then joined in with the protests, partly because Victoria's firing was a sympathetic story of ""little guy vs. big bad corporation"" and partly because they assume if it's the reddit admin team vs. anyone, the other guys are most likely to be the the sympathetic party.  It's not that the pro-FPH Fattening protesters have co-opted the AMAgeddon protests to advance their anti-admin agenda.  It's that the reddit community is increasingly anti-admin in attitude, and debatable, unpopular or misinterpretable decisions like AMAgeddon and the Fattening are both merely opportunities for the community to vent its increasing enmity and distrust of the reddit admin team."
TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,KoKansei,17,Sun Jul 5 12:44:03 2015 UTC,What's hilarious about your comment is that you are deflecting. This is a legitimate question. The mods didn't black out because they don't agree with FPH ban or even because they don't agree with Victoria's firing. It goes further. They didn't black out because reddit is getting over commercialized and they didn't blackout because Ellen Pao is mismanaging anything.   They blacked out for one simple reason. Communication is and has always been bad between admins and mods. That's it. Literally every other reason you think they blacked out is 100% wrong. You have no proof of anything. You're just riffing off a narrative you think is true. You don't have proof.
TheoryOfReddit,3c58qc,CUNTPUNCHER-4000,-15,Sun Jul 5 12:53:43 2015 UTC,Victoria's firing is organically connected to the other prior censorship debacles. Co-opt? Are you daft?

TheoryOfReddit,3c0s8w,gamblekat,25,Fri Jul 3 18:46:55 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with this theory (as it stands now- maybe not so much earlier when the site was potentially more attractive), is that most buyers outside of the pure entertainment/soc networking would likely attempt to fold the site into their existing infrastructure.  Integration is what will happen in the event of a Reddit buyout. Pao and her team are no doubt poised to make millions in the transition. She's an attorney, this is probably right up her alley. This Gizmodo article about how yahoo killed Flickr is an excellent example.   Even under our current setup, with Condé Nast the changes have been significant and far-reaching. The Reddit team needed a revenue stream (for potential owners and shareholders). They couldn't find one and they weren't creative. For example, they could have rolled out corporate pages, say under /c/ where people would be able to discuss products and offerings, receive and discuss news updates or sports fans could have a community for their favorite team, but that largely didn't happen.   The point is to say that in that scenario at the very least it would be more transparent. But alas--because instead Reddit pursued an aggressive and subliminal marketing strategy sitewide, thinking that users and moderators wouldn't notice or would just ignore it. That combined with its inability to effectively communicate with moderators, it's underwhelming modtools, and its otherwise blatant disregard for the userbase is what eventually led us to where we are.  Even if all of what OP says is true I'm just not sure Reddit is marketable."

But if you go to subs like /r/americanairlines or /r/pepsi you'll maybe see a custom style sheet every now and then but other than that subs for companies are just in the simple organic construction of the site. I'm pretty sure most companies have PR and tech related employees that could theoretically operate such an environment were it to exist, in addition to probably having many redditors on their payroll.   Name one presidential candidate who doesn't have a redditor in their constituent support network in the run up to 2016. Alas, Reddit admins and developers overlook simple solutions in pursuit of their thinly veiled corporate interests as though it's seemingly impossible to find some way for the website to gain revenue.  They could reasonably charge in the thousands for well run and heavily supported corporate pages, at least for companies that sell products to people like auto companies, retailers, airlines, or entertainment companies.  e: a word"

Raising $50M was a reflection of the fact that reddit has never been cash positive and needed breathing room to expand operationally. If that round had been intended as some sort of bridge financing leading up to an acquisition, the press coverage and the list of investors would have been different.  All of the other things seem like normal course of business. Choosing a CEO with a VC background is probably due to familiarity/comfort level of the new investors with that person and the belief that reddit needs someone with a financial bent who can develop a business model for the company.  Because imagination is lacking in the industry, developing a business model means finding things to sell to advertisers. Hence, the ""clean-up"" and highlighting unique features which make the site more attractive not to investors, but to marketers."

The idea of a usenet simulator isn't new, the idea of user reputation scoring even takes the name from earlier implementations.  Reddit's only real value is a broad and diverse community of people who communicate with each other via text. This is so obviously desirable as to have been reinvented multiple times in the last two decades, and so hard to articulate or realize as cash that it's been through several implementations.  Google could step up tomorrow with a reddit face for usenet requiring G+ accounts, make major bank on noticing what's being talked about, and gain the undying love of people who want to form communities based on ideas.  Reddit itself, at this point, is probably mortally wounded. It is history, it is tired and shagged out from having a long squawk earlier, etc. The disregard for users and moderators that has been shown cannot be forgotten, the people who are passionate enough to form these communities will not give up those passions but will move their efforts elsewhere.  I personally feel that having a common user interface and platform for such diverse interests was a good thing, so that the horse fuckers and the electronics enthusiasts could speak with equal effort to philosophers and pop music fans. That kind of open cross pollination is a good thing and produces great things.   I really don't see anyone but google as able to step up and profitably run such a service, and I certainly don't trust the people running reddit anymore.

TheoryOfReddit,3c0s8w,valakut_,21,Fri Jul 3 20:09:29 2015 UTC,Reddit has users and eyeballs. Possibly some advertising and marketing contracts. A strong though increasingly complex brand. Engineering talent.  It may also have shutdown or rivalry value. E.g.: Facebook or Google might either prefer Reddit didn't exist or might seek to buy it or bid up the price to keep the other from claiming it or increase cost of acquisition.

My poorly articulated point was that whatever value reddit had a year ago, six months ago, 48 hours ago, its now measurably lowered and has sometime recently passed the possibility of bouncing back. There's now more value in being the reddit replacement than being the reddit savior.

Anyone who cares to find out who you are, where you live, and what unsavory habits you have can do so, and it takes less effort now than it used to.

Aside from the privacy issue, I'm not concerned about the government investigating my posting habits (because I'm boring) -- but I appreciate the veneer of anonymity that, ostensibly, allows me to say anything to another Redditor without fear of personal reprisal.  That's important, and why Facebook or Google+ won't replace Reddit.  I agree that someone with enough time, patience, motivation, and tools could go through my comment history and probably figure out who I am in real life, but at least this level of abstraction protects me from casual intrusion."
TheoryOfReddit,3c0s8w,neodiogenes,2,Sat Jul 4 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"It's not the government he's talking about (or at least not exclusively). The problem with any forum like this where we have a screen name that we consistently use is that it's easy to let slip a lot about ourselves that other users can then use, whether we realise we're doing it or not. It's why doxxing can be such a big problem on Reddit - we give a lot away, and that anonymity can be ripped to shreds. Indeed, I sometimes think that it's impossible to say we really ever have anonymity on a site like this."

In order to make it profitable, it'll have to make some changes that will probably drive some users away.  Maybe they had advance warning that they need to make the 50M last a longer time than what they are currently burning right now, and in order to do that, they might have done ""soft"" layoffs by moving out of SF (some of the best developers will leave, and they can hire some engineers who aren't as expensive because now they are more accessible to more people), and maybe right now they are cutting down some non-essential (for operation of the business) roles like the AMA girl.   All of this could lead to a potential acquisition-- but I think what Reddit needs is a Product-focused CEO who can create some pay-products without alienating the current user base who values privacy and as few ads as possible. and that's going to be really really hard.  What's troubling is that they had some high-profile failures with monetization strategies.... And a lot of media outlets have been critiquing reddit a lot recently (these types of stories don't just come from nowhere-- a lot of investors are investors because they are well-connected, and this could be a reflection of the souring outlook). Not sure if in a few years we'll view Reddit right now with nostalgia.. like Napster. That's how bad the company as a business looks to me.   Craigslist one example of a great website unblemished by ads, but it's also run on a shoestring budget and they actually do charge for job postings."
TheoryOfReddit,3c0s8w,Ask_If_I_Care,2,Sat Jul 4 18:08:34 2015 UTC,"My opinion: Advance Publications likes owning ""the AMA company"" but they don't see a way to grow or monetize Reddit effectively. I don't think Reddit/Advance management viewed the AMA woman as non-essential. I think the person responsible for authorizing the firing was honestly unaware of her role at the company until it was too late to change their minds.   Not sure if in a few years we'll view Reddit right now with nostalgia.. like Napster. That's how bad the company as a business looks to me.   Some people are still nostalgic for Usenet. Napster was garbage when it was around and vastly superior file-sharing software was available shortly after it's shut-down. Those two services were only good because superior alternatives did not exist, and the same holds for Reddit (and other sites of it's ilk, like old Digg or Voat).   Craigslist one example of a great website unblemished by ads, but it's also run on a shoestring budget and they actually do charge for job postings.   4chan runs on the same mentality... Except somehow 4chan has better moderation tools (and moderation) than Reddit.

Instagram, ... Vine, ... Snapchat, ... YouTube. Why can't (and won't they) Reddit AMA's (its most popular product that often gets newsed) be partially monetised! And also include video.

TheoryOfReddit,3c0s8w,jambox888,8,Fri Jul 3 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"Reddit isn't a site that could attack FB (from whatever vector) or even rival FB. FB aquisition and product strategy turned from the offensive (innovate on social, real name policy, pages, platform, universal log-in, graph, newsfeed, ...) to defensive (who could be the next FB? and what do we need to add to make it more attractive here - see FB's recent push into video).   Instagram was bought bc FB lacked photo product and Mark told he wants to make Instagram big and sees its potential and will leave it to the team. WhatsApp was bought bc FB lacked messaging and is/was big outside USA and company was also approached by Google. Everyone in the tech said 19bn was ridiculous.  FB/Mark offered +3bn for Snapchat. Oculus bc of a vision ... VR = Entertainment of the Future. Is along the same product decision mantra FB has internally: ""What can we do to keep people on Facebook.com?"" Most recent product update: Facebook Instant Articles. Future updates: tweak Newsfeed with AI (see its opening of an AI focused office in Paris). Equals increased time per user on page, equals more clicking on ads or promoted pages/content. FB dominates social, keeps +70% of industry wide ad spend (social media) for itself. FB ARPU (average revenue per user) is in the 40/50 dollars. Versus 3-5 dollar for Twitter? Just google 'Facebook ARPU'.   What can FB be (as multi-product company) and do to be the Internet people use? Literally.   Thus its initiative Internet.org and the millions of dollar of investment to beam internet from the sky with oversized drones (as big as a Boing passenger plane and lighter than a car), that got recently cancelled because development cost seemed to be running into the unknown with revenue streams of the future from said future customers in today's developing world and frontier markets indeterminable.

As such, they would only buy reddit if it brings them new people to sell on to advertisers.

Granted there are a lot of novelty/alt/throwaway accounts, but nonetheless everyone suddenly is the biggest proponent of Victoria and the quality of IAmA despite 76% of the users not being subbed there.    On the user side, likely nothing will change as far as the experience.  People will keep posting, new users will come along, and the old users will stay because (despite the big voat.co supposed pilgrimage) there are no alternatives with anywhere near this amount of content.

I haven't seen any admins say otherwise, and a good example sub is /r/poetry and /r/film, whose subscriber counts do not match the activity level and voting of the subreddit at all. Those levels would only make sense if most of those subscribers were no longer active, and it makes sense to an extent since I imagine in the earlier years people just typed in subreddits to find stuff and subscribe.

The only change that actually happened was AMA's lost a form of verification that they grew accustom to. It didn't shut down future ama's, it didn't change how the site worked, within the week nothing will be different.   To compare this with the fall of Digg is asinine. Digg 4.0 changed how people used the site, it gutted some features and fundamentally changed how the site functions. Reddit would have to remove its entire voting system, make all child comments share the same parent like youtube, or force people to watch ads before visiting links to approach the disaster that was digg 4.0. Its not even close, and its not even headed in that direction.  Reddit isn't going to die unless they make some insane changes to how the site functions. Maybe the majority of users who only visit reddit for the default subs and image macro's will leave, but who gives a shit. That won't kill what reddit is. Reddit is full of vibrant communities that focus on specific topics and serves as a hub for all manner of forums that otherwise would be scattered in every corner of the web. You can visit your model airplane forum and rubik's cube forum on the same site with the same layout and the same login.

The only way this was different from any other day was that a large number of moderators got involved just long enough to make a point about features they want to have, features that have been long-requested, often promised, and never delivered.  There is a deadline for delivery now that many moderators will hold the site accountable for. If there is no progress by year end, reddit will have another significant disruption.

I fully understand that it is incredibly difficult and even reddit itself still has trouble with it. The fact remains, tho, that voat is fundamentally unprepared to be a reddit alternative and no investor in their right mind is going anywhere near them unless they crack down on the unsavory aspects of their site. They need user donations to handle the new users, which means they need new users who will donate, which they can only get in limited numbers because their site is incapable of handling the traffic.  Every problem they have is a problem that reddit has already been forced to deal with, and they still don't have a viable funding model. Voat will remain the obscure backwater founded on the worst aspects of reddit."

The rest voluntarily removed themselves from the front page feed, so they exist, but you'll never see them if you don't actively subscribe to them. They also have about $20k in user donations, I assume that's only growing as more people come in. There are already investors lined up, Atko is having trouble deciding if he wants to go for user funded or get VC involved right now. I'm betting they go for a user funded model.  They are most definitely behind the curve on many of reddit's features. They are ahead of reddit on one critical design choice, however. On Voat, subs aren't a hack like reddit, they are a fundamental feature. Earning your way into one doesn't give you anything in another. Reddit's got a ways to go to get to that point yet... though I think reddit has the easier task, and certainly has more resources to spend on it."

If the reddit admins wanted, they could take Voat's code, improve it however they like, then migrate reddit's existing data over to it. All of this is perfectly legal.  Voat's problem is not their servers, either. Voat's problem is that it was not written to scale, it was a hobby project never intended to compete with reddit at all or even be a public active website.   Disgruntled redditors found the alpha a year ago and jumped on it as a replacement."
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,evilnight,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"Correct. Had Voat been able to handle this traffic spike and remain up the entire time, they would have permanently stolen a significant section of reddit' user base.  I think it's worth pointing out, however, the OP is on to something. The reason Voat is popular, yet all of the other alternatives are largely ignored, is because Voat offers the same subreddit-like experience where multiple communities can form and interact. There are no other sites on the internet that offer this same ecosystem, and any that don't have it are one evolutionary step behind, unable to compete on the same level.  Yesterday was a signal that many people won't miss, however, so expect to see a hell of a lot more reddit-like sites than just Voat in the future."
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,evilnight,6,Mon Jul 6 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"So the problem with natural selection in these situations is that it's tautological.  Everything in the human realm -- literally every phenomenon caused by humans -- is the result of natural selection. To say that a phenomenon ""analogues natural selection"" is to say that a thing exists, and that's not very insightful."
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,adminbeast,3,Sat Jul 4 13:28:55 2015 UTC,"It sounds like, in the body of the post, that OP is likening the survival of Reddit not to natural selection as a whole, but likening the diversity of interests and sub-communities that the structure of Reddit encourages to the diversity of Life on Earth. The analog would be that Digg is like Life if there had only been one species: a virus could easily spread and wipe it out. But Reddit is more like Life on Earth: it would be hard to do away with every single organism given the diversity of life. Some organisms could survive one cataclysm while another would survive a different type of cataclysm."
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,goshdurnit,4,Sat Jul 4 21:56:53 2015 UTC,There are always tremors before the major earthquake. Yesterday was a tremor. But it showed that a major earthquake is coming.
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,ChaosMotor,5,Sat Jul 4 15:29:25 2015 UTC,I disagree. I don't know if a major earthquake is coming or not. What this minor earthquake did show though is that a relatively small group of people can easily organise and pretty much shut down the site. We definitely learned something. This was the first time we saw the mods of the largest subs collectively use their power to send a message.
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,Ahuva,4,Sun Jul 5 11:47:16 2015 UTC,"Digg died because it broke how site worked. V4 was hugely different, broke user experience in a huge way, corporatizing website, allowing for mass corporate spam (at one point most of front page was Leo Laporte spam), also preventing certain benefits power users had. It was huge change, and for the worse.  Reddit so far, hasn't introduced such game breaking user experience changes so it is less likely to happen what has happened to Digg in a way it happened to Digg. Still remains to be seen what all the impact this will have in the future, and if Reddit will make more wrong moves.  One way to know when site is dying is when top comments stop being insightful and/or knowledgeable. Then you know intelligentsia has left the building and death is imminent."
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,kontra5,2,Sun Jul 5 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"But the core of reddit can die and leave a festering tumor behind.   Communities this big don't die overnight. They hemorrhage. And they become husks. And there's enough of a shell left to say ""looks big to me!"", because what does the husk care if it surrounds a living organism or not?"
TheoryOfReddit,3c3foa,TheCodexx,2,Sat Jul 4 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"Reddit would go the way of Digg, yesterday was the day. But it didn't.   Reddit is orders of magnitude larger than Digg ever was. It's the 10th or 9th largest website in the U.S.   I don't think you can compare reddit to digg anymore, not in any meaningful way. Reddit is a different beast now, it's too large. It's like comparing the economy of Bangor, Maine to China. Sure, there are similarities (both use cash to exchange goods for products) but the size and scope of the two sites could not be dissimilar."
TheoryOfReddit,3c2p1e,Ahuva,15,Sat Jul 4 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"This whole thing is a fucking shitshow. Sorry you were initially downvoted for this post, because I think you bring up a very valid point.  There's a lot of emotion floating around, and a lot of speculation. It's okay to make educated guesses about what might be going on, but it's also important to realize that none of us has all of the answers right now.  I do understand that Victoria's firing was merely a catalyst for this strange revolt, which actually has more to do with an ongoing lack of good communication between admins and moderators. However, just looking at the /u/chooter situation on its own, no one knows, or even should know, why she was fired-- well, other than her employers, and possibly Victoria herself. She could have actually been fired for a somewhat reasonable cause, such as failing to meet performance goals, or some kind of misconduct. Everyone's been so quick to saint this person. Although I actually like /u/chooter as much as anyone else, and definitely appreciate her importance for /r/IAMA and Reddit as a whole, something about all of this doesn't quite feel right.  There's also the fact that at the root of it, it's not really about Victoria at all. Many people are aware of this, but as awareness of the problem has spread, I feel like many others don't quite realize this. It's about poor communication, a lack of proper mod tools, and what many see as a misguided prioritization of ""gimmicks"" (Snoovatars, RedditGifts) over improvements to Reddit's functionality. Mods feel screwed over by the admins.  This discontentment points to a deeper problem, I think. Reddit is a company and a business, which isn't necessarily intrinsically negative. However, moderators put a lot of volunteer time and effort into their communities. Many regular users put a lot of time and effort into their own contributions to these communities, as well-- a fully sourced /r/AskHistorians post probably takes a couple of hours to put together. We kind of feel like it's ""our"" site, because the community actually does, essentially, belong to the users. However, the site itself belongs to Reddit, a company under the Advance Publications umbrella. Although the company and admins really ""own"" the site, we all feel attached to it, in some way or another.  Because of this, because the communities within reddit are created and sustained by its user base, I think it really bothers people a lot that the admins have seemed increasingly out of touch with the wants, needs, and concerns of their users. To be fair, there have been changes recently, many of which people aren't too happy about. They also seem rather aloof, and appear largely unwilling to really listen to the ongoing concerns and complaints.  I think that as the admins have become more removed from the community as a whole, it's led users, especially heavily involved users like moderators of large subreddits, to feel increasingly alienated by them. Given the amount of unpaid time and energy that so many people put into the site's content, many people seem to feel very betrayed.  How do they fix this? Well, first of all, they will probably need to make a formal post on /r/announcements or /r/blog with a sincere discussion of their side of the story. I imagine they're probably working on that now, and that there are valid reasons why they've kept so quiet overall. Secondly, I think that Pao will need to be replaced. I'm not one of those people who calls her ""Chairman Pao,"" nor do I have anything against her personally. However, with that said, it's clear that her leadership has been overwhelmingly unpopular with Reddit's community. Sure, she could change her general direction and approach to managing Reddit, but I think it's too late for that. The hivemind hates Pao, so much that she's become a full-fledged meme. It's too late for her to salvage her reputation among Reddit's users, and it would probably be best if she moved on. To be fair, from what little I've seen of her comments and such, she seems less ""in tune"" with the Reddit community than Yishan Wong was.  It's 2 AM and I have no idea where I was going with this. TL;DR shit's fucky up in this ma'fa."

I agree with most of your analysis of the roots of the problem that caused all of the drama of the last few days. However, I really agreed with /u/firedrops when he said ""We don't want to break Reddit. We want to fix it."" and I feel that these unsubstantiated rumours are part of what can break reddit. I understand that the admins could do things differently that could really improve the situation, but I'm just a lowly user and I am interested in what I (and others like me) can do.

Initially, I thought it was going to be a place to discuss issues regarding the lack of communication between the admins and mods, but it's turned into an Ellen Pao hate circlejerk.

TheoryOfReddit,3c2p1e,dakta,5,Sat Jul 4 23:22:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed, thoughtful post. I'd like to ask you a question, if you don't mind. Do you think it is likely that Ellen Pao will step down/be fired from her CEO position?  Although I don't believe the comment from /u/dacvak's IAMA saying that Ellen Pao said her position would have to be ""pried from her cold, dead hands"" (not exact quote), I find it highly unlikely that she'd step down voluntarily, especially given her recent statements in the NYT. There is no reason for her to leave her current position. I agree that the ""hivemind"" hates her, but I feel that they are a vocal minority, since I'm guessing most of the users of Reddit are casual users who don't post. I just think that this is going to blow over like the chaos following the banning of /r/fph."

This happens to a lot of people in close relationships: people linger long after it is to anyone's good for them to stay. I'm beginning to see the relationship between mods and their work as less like the traditional employee/work relationship (in which laborers are commonly ""alienated"" from their labor) and more like some combination of a close personal relationship with a community AND a sense of ownership (""I helped create this website, so I won't just leave"")."

TheoryOfReddit,3c0itz,Morningwoodlumberco,2,Sat Jul 4 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"To clarify: I shouldn't have used such a ""click-baity"" headline. I guess I was struggling to think of a succinct way to put this.   Really, I see this as an employee/employer conflict, but with a twist. In the traditional employee/employer conflict, the employees make demands of the employer, and if the employer doesn't meet those demands, the employees can quit and find work elsewhere or they can engage in collective action (like a strike). The employees' power is traditionally contingent on whether or not they could be easily replaced by employers. In this case, I'm pretty sure the employers (admins) could find other people to be mods, and it's not even as if they are paying the mods. And yet the mods simply won't leave. I understand WHY they aren't leaving, but I think the fact that they are so emotionally invested in their position (and are, evidently, capable of altering the site for a lot of would-be users, at least temporarily) makes this a unique labor/management conflict (although, with more companies like Uber popping up, I'm sure the definition of ""employee"" and labor/mgmt. conflicts will only get more complex).   I'm quite sure mods would say that they're making entirely reasonable demands, but what if, for the sake of argument, they were making unreasonable demands, demands that couldn't be met by admins and the higher-ups for a variety of technical and economic reasons? Because the mods are volunteers, it seems that no matter how shittily they are treated by admins, they'll stay...and do what? Let's say the admins treat them even worse. The only way that I can see that mods can exercise their power is to ruin Reddit, either by encouraging a mass exodus to another website or by blacking it out, right?"

TheoryOfReddit,3c2ump,KiraKira_,5,Sat Jul 4 06:31:25 2015 UTC,"I  think a large percentage of Reddit's users will keep on using the site, despite not necessarily agreeing with many of the recent decisions that the admins have made.  First, there's the fact that visible users, who post and comment, don't actually seem to make up the majority of the site's unique visitors. (It's late and I'm lazy, so I don't have actual statistics for that, but it's what I've unanimously read). It's sometimes called the ""10%"" rule. Of visitors, 10% or so actually generate content actively. The rest are just readers.  Secondly, not all users are really into ""Reddit culture"" as a whole. I feel like I fall into this category, although I do follow things like /r/TheoryOfReddit out of sociological interest. I joined Reddit in May 2014, and so I kind of missed out on the early days, when Reddit was smaller and a bit more like one cohesive community. To me, ""Reddit"" per se is more like a centralized hub for a collection of diverse forums that don't necessarily connect to one another. While some of the major subs, including both defaults and large non-default subs, are more tied into ""Reddit as a whole,"" you also have communities like /r/thetruthishere or /r/unresolvedmysteries that are rather insulated from things like AMAgeddon and The Fattening.   Also, different people use Reddit rather differently. Some, like myself, have curated various niche subreddits while largely avoiding large subs like /r/pics or /r/funny. Others don't really curate much, and may not even have an account. For example, my SO basically uses Reddit like an imageboard and prefers visual content, whereas I gravitate toward text-based subs. If you're the kind of person who comes here to browse /r/adviceanimals and not much else, you probably don't care too much about Reddit's corporate decisions.  Personally, I actually really like Voat and have become increasingly engaged in its community, particularly /v/chatbox (basically the chatroom there) and /v/smuckersclub (a very, very bizarre offshoot from chatbox). Voat is rather small, and though there are all kinds of diverse subverses, it feels more like one community than Reddit ever did for me. Also, with defaults have four-digit subscriber counts instead of millions, it's easier to have one's voice heard in popular discussions.  Although I love Voat, I'm not necessarily abandoning Reddit forever. While Voat's default subs, like /v/news and /v/AskVoat, are arguably superior to their Reddit equivalents, it has a lack of smaller, more niche communities. Many of the subreddits I enjoy, from ""recreational reading"" stuff like /r/UnresolvedMysteries to professional resources like /r/freelancewriters and /r/seo, don't have a Voat equivalent. Subs like those two are also quite insulated from the overall drama of Reddit as a whole.  Sure, it kind of feels like the sky is falling. But while big subs like /r/science and /r/AskReddit, along with distinctively meta subs like /r/OutOfTheLoop, are abuzz with drama, no one at /r/marketing or /r/seo is really batting an eye. I've kind of migrated to Voat, but many subreddits are still valuable and interesting enough for me to come here.  This long, rambling thing I just wrote, at 2 in the morning, is just my own opinion as a casual Reddit user who's recently gotten into Voat. Part of my issue with Reddit, outside of niche subs like those I've mentioned, is that in many ways, it's too far up its own ass with all the drama.  *EDIT: I just realized that /r/SEO and /r/marketing are both private, in solidarity with what is apparently becoming known as ""The Darkening."" I'm actually kind of disappointed, because those kind of subs were always some of the first that came to my mind as being insulated from overall Reddit drama. I'm not saying I necessarily don't support The Darkening. I actually understand where they're coming from. However, as more small subs go dark, this site is getting harder and harder to use. Plus, Voat is down. What am I supposed to do, sleep? Be productive? Eff that noise."

However, this issue only affects a certain percentage of the user base on Reddit, compared to when Digg rolled out its new layout which impacted every user on that website.

Seriously, on those ask subs, I want to hear from someone qualified to talk to me. That's why moderation exists: I can, without experience in the field, submit something I know about Uralic dispersion, but I have to site it. Easy agreement.

That said, I think it is very likely that Reddit won't disclose why they let her go as terms of her separation from the company. This happens all the time. Someone gets an ultimatum like ""resign and we'll be quiet or we'll fire you and tell everyone why."" Literally happens ALL the time. The community can't see that, though."

Things I'd like to know   Who's running AMA@reddit.com? Do they have any idea what they're doing? Are the capable of shutting down staged PR AMAs? Will they enforce our rules? What are their goals? Quality or Quantity? Why should my team and I trust this unamed person with representing my subs best interests to the outside world?  Vic told people that wanted to come here to solely promote a product that that'd be a no-go. Will this mystery person hold to the same standard? (and everyone's been asking for a name, with no information forthcoming) How will krispykrackers manage all 'moderator issues' when a team of 70 people (reddit staff) with access to /r/reddit.com modmail couldn't manage it for two days in a row?   There's more, but this is the gist of it. The responses may seem like info to you, but we've been hearing about ""modmail/ mod tool improvements are at the top of our priority list"" for about 5 years now.

TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,haste75,10,Fri Jul 3 14:07:55 2015 UTC,"No, it really has nothing to do with Victoria herself. She may have been fired for a perfectly good reason, and of course Reddit wont comment on it either way. No company in their right mind would do that.  However, what the protest is centralisd around is the lack of communication, clarity and actual effort the admins put into the running of this site."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,sleepy55,6,Fri Jul 3 11:14:46 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm kind of torn about the whole thing.  I think there is a lot of truth to the mods complaints and that there are issues that go way past just Victoria. But the community seems to jump at the chance to ""stick it to the man"" like the comment above you said. And the community tends to blow things out of proportion and just turn into a hivemind bandwagon where nothing of substance gets accomplished.   So it's hard to really figure out where the legitimate complaints ends and the pointless ""Chairman Pao"" circle jerking begins."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,sgamer,23,Fri Jul 3 14:39:21 2015 UTC,"I am with you in thinking this whole thing is really stupid. The company who runs this site had to fire someone on the spot, without a contingency plan in place, and people are giving them shit about it why?   What is the end game? To get her re-hired? To get someone else hired in her place? I'm pretty damn sure they're looking to get someone else to do the work right now, but it's never going to be instantaneous, especially not with someone abruptly leaving a company. So, a bunch of people are protesting, breaking parts of the site that they control, for no apparent end or reason other than ""you did that wrong, and you should have talked to us first""? They don't have to talk to any of you, NONE of you are reddit employees, and NONE of you would or should have needed to know she was being fired before it happened...even telling you beforehand to brace for the situation could have had legal consequences for them in regards to her privacy. Afterwards, they still can't tell you everything about it, for those same privacy reasons. Those laws are in place to protect her interests, is that not important?  I swear, it is like some people don't understand how businesses work, and expect them to have always anticipated the situation in which we are in now. You can't plan for everything, and you can't let someone stay on with a company if they need to be immediately let go, just because ""they're too valuable"". No one is that valuable in a company, quit fooling yourselves."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,Algee,17,Fri Jul 3 07:32:42 2015 UTC,Yea I just came across this. Apparently they did have a contingency plan in place but just weren't clear about it before hand.
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,the_1ceman,19,Fri Jul 3 07:38:58 2015 UTC,"That is completely the problem, they weren't clear about what they are doing with the people that actually run the website they are in charge of. Saying sorry and making promises doesn't make many mods feel confident considering the recent trend of reddit admins being very disconnected with the website and it's userbase.  It's definitely good they said sorry and have a plan in place, but if I was a mod, I wouldn't open my sub until I actually saw the change."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,Infamously_Unknown,14,Fri Jul 3 07:53:00 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how I feel about the response. I mean, when he says that:   At this point, however, the blackout has served its purpose...   That doesn't really sound like something that's up to admins to decide. It's like if a union went on strike and the employer said: ""Ok, we now know that you're disatisfied with x and we're sorry about that. Now get back to work, our customers don't deserve to be punished. We'll continue working on that issue.""  Seriously, that's not how it works."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,the_1ceman,6,Fri Jul 3 09:59:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly! And to make it worse, this isn't the first time it's happened.

It won't work until we force them to show us change. And, this time, it's actually working. Default subs are staying private. Small subs are joining, and if it stays that way, we win.

I'm not sure I could do much better, honestly, but a lot of people on this site sure think that they can.   I've also moderated another very large site in the past, and I can tell you that I'm not surprised by how they act on a day-to-day basis as admins, and I don't blame them. This place (and, many, many others where people congregate on the internet) is a large clusterfuck of opinions and powderkegs, and at some point you basically have to take dictatorship on as a mode of operation to just shut shit down."

If your employer asks you to do something as mundane as making video AMAs or doing more commercial things with AMAs (which is hilarious as AMAs on that subreddit have mostly been for advertising purposes for the past couple years), and you refuse, you best believe you're going to get fired.  The fact that this, of all things, is what Reddit decided to throw a fit over, is frustrating and hilarious at the same time. There are a lot of problems with how this site is run, but this isn't one of them, if what Mr. Bodnick says is true."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,letgoandflow,6,Fri Jul 3 11:53:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if she had that much of a purist mindset when it came to AMAs then it was probably obvious to the admins that she would be a hindrance to the progress of reddit. I'm sure Victoria is a great person, but it's probably better to have a small team of less important (and less notable) people doing her job to avoid situations like this in the future."

TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,Catman789,3,Fri Jul 3 12:17:16 2015 UTC,I disagree that it won't do anything. Shutting down high traffic subreddits might be hurting the site's revenue because many people probably aren't using the site and not as many people are going to be giving gold if the comments pages to the biggest subreddits are down. /r/askreddit especially comes to mind.
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,the_1ceman,8,Fri Jul 3 12:32:38 2015 UTC,"The protest hurts users in the short term, but it'll hurt reddit the longer it goes and the bigger it gets. Although not the same whatsoever, protests are protests and be comparable. Many of the major protests in history have plently of stories of the small and individuals hurting. They get arrested, pepper sprayed, hosed, doxxed, and so on, but the movement as a whole wins out the longer the protest goes. The smaller and more secluded subreddits probably don't hold much sway in the matter, but when the default subs and 1,000,000+ user subs close, it sends a message that either gets heard and changes come of it, or falls on deaf ears and people move to better communities. In the short run, we lose because our time-killer, hobby, or whatever reddit is to you, isn't as fun or as friendly as it was. In the long run we win though, because we made our opinion heard and changes that we wanted were made."

There are also some who have tried to use this as a platform about the quality and quantity of mod tools. But realistically what can the admins even say? Isn't it basically that yes she used to work there and if they would hire her again? I mean if they said she was fired because she picked her nose and flicked boogers at people or something like that, well then it's a former employer announcing to the public reasons for the dismissal.   It isn't just two people talking about it and we are not legally or ethically privileged to that information. We collectively are neither a former or future employer. It would also be messed up for us to pressure her to disclose that information. That's something she can talk about with a future employer without letting the Internet twist stuff around.

The Victoria thing, while sucky (and probably with a behind-the-scenes story that none of us know), only really affects a small fractions of subreddits and even for /r/IAMA to go private seems like an overreaction. But okay, those precious celebrity IAMAs. The rest of subreddits mostly join out of some protest against reddit admins being too ""uninvolved"". After countless of outcries that reddit admins are ""too involved"" (banning shitty subreddits, ""muh freedoms"", etc). I don't really get it. Is reddit's mod tools being lackluster really a reason to ""protest""?  I'm always skeptical on the internet when it seems like people are getting too excited about ""being part of a movement"" without having to leave their chairs.

I'll admit that the admins probably don't give mods enough tools and communication (unless you're a mod of the supposed Reddit CabalTM or whatever). It certainly is a thankless job. And I imagine it practically is an unpaid job for mods of defaults and other large subs.  But regular non-mod redditors, generally, aren't exactly the thankful types either. This is just how it is in any online community. People either love, hate, or are indifferent to mods. Usually the latter two, often the middle. How many times have we seen the pitchforks go up against mods, often for perceived injustices?  People come to this site for one thing: content. I do it, too, and I'm a mod. I'm hoping the actively protesting mods keep this short just to make a point. That they can do this. That's fair, I think.   But if they think their actions are going to bring back Victoria or make admins address their grievances, get real.  Any longer than a day or two of ""striking"" and we'll start seeing the average redditor starting to reach for those pitchforks and begin pointing them in our direction once again."

TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,KarmaNeutrino,2,Fri Jul 3 04:17:38 2015 UTC,"As a mod of a smaller sub of just 7000 subscribers, we feel that going dark will impact nothing - it is the bigger subs of tens of thousands or more going private that will really have any effect. Furthermore, as stated elsewhere, it will only hurt our userbase as, if they see that we have gone private, they might switch their attentions elsewhere."

But, as they say, a snowflake never feels responsible for an avalance, or whatever it is.  I've said it before, but protests work like this. Short term, the people lose. There is no denying that. Tomorrow and the next day, if reddit is still mostly black, it'll suck for us because we can't go to our usual communities and do whatever we normally do. Long term, we win. Either the change we want will have happened, or we will have realized that reddit was actually a place we wanted to go and be a part of."

Is shutting down most of reddit really worth it to send a message? AFAIK, people are doing this because they want reddit to go back to its older better way, but that's impossible if all the major subs are dead, and some of the obscure ones as well (I don't really see how obscure privatization is helping)."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,appropriate-username,-2,Fri Jul 3 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"WTF was so great about victoria why can't the mods talk to celebs themselves?  This to me reads like the mods whining that they aren't being treated as special enough by the admins. I, for one, am completely in support for as little private communication between mods and admins as possible (preferably completely none). Public communication is perfectly fine and there needs to be more of it but private talks is how the general community gets screwed. I also agree that modtools are certainly not exactly the best but  1) get more mods  2)stop censoring all the things, let people talk. Removing pages of comments, wtf?  2)i) if you got as many mods as you can and you aren't just censoring everyone and things are still falling through the cracks, then you can go tell the admins that their tools are inadequate to obey the site rules and then I don't see why they wouldn't leave you alone--that is a very legitimate complaint imo, as long as you have actually tried to get more mods.  Also, the power of the mods to completely ""delete"" or make inaccessible all of the work of all the subscribers in a given subreddit, where people can't even look at the stuff they themselves posted to a sub, is complete BS imo and should be in some way curtailed and what is happening now is a clear indication of that."
TheoryOfReddit,3by4t5,xu85,-1,Sat Jul 4 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"Isn't this just white knighting on a mass scale? Young blonde white woman gets sacked, leagues of virtue signalling moderators jump to her defence. How dare Reddit sack a female. Don't they know about workplace sexism and oppression and stuff?    This is totally overblown and created by a tiny minority of users that are spending far too much time on the website and as such are having massively undue influence in discourse and the direction/flow of the website at large."
TheoryOfReddit,3bxrxj,bothanspy1337,27,Fri Jul 3 01:04:47 2015 UTC,"This thread explains it rather well but I'll also paste what I wrote earlier. It comes down to the fact that this isn't a one time incident.  When a majority of the people that run your site rely on a third party extension something is clearly wrong. I am not making this up btw. At this moment /r/toolbox has around 1000 (one thousand) people active on the subreddit, this is a result of toolbox installations checking our wiki for messages (the blue ones we send out when we have something to say). In total we have around 6000 active installations between firefox, chrome and opera.   Why are these numbers relevant? Well, /r/defaultmods has somewhere between 800-900 approved submitters (mods without modmail rights don't have access), /r/modtalk around 1700 approved contributors and /r/modclub around 3000 subscribers.  This means that the subreddits that attract active and engaged mods (disregarding overlap) don't even account for all our users.   You'd think that I would be proud of those numbers and in a way I am since we worked hard for it. But that last bit is also the problem, we have worked our asses of since someone had to do it.   Another great example of how much reddit cares about their assets is reddit companion. Which at the time of writing has around 154,302 installations, is utterly broken and hasn't been updated since February 21, 2013, the most ridiculous thing? It isn't hard to fix people tried to do the work for reddit since it is open source but they simply have been ignoring those pull requests since 2013. Which is silly since those pull request effectively do fix companion, resulting in a perfectly working version.   And honestly, I get that they might not have resources for a silly extension. But the fact that they keep it around on the chrome store while it is utterly broken and only recently removed it from the reddit footer baffles me.  I think I messaged them about them about a year ago, it took them another year to actually update the footer with apps & tools they are (still) working on."
TheoryOfReddit,3bxrxj,creesch,3,Fri Jul 3 01:11:51 2015 UTC,I made reddit companion safari compatible and submitted a pull request ages ago. Spoke with maintainer and they never got around to doing anything with it. Sad really.
TheoryOfReddit,3bxrxj,Richman777,3,Fri Jul 3 03:37:27 2015 UTC,"I mod a small community, so I don't need crazy tools to manage the sub (yet and thank god). But I still have the Toolbox, primarily because of one oddity: vanilla reddit has no mod queue notification. So I would go days or even weeks without checking the queue. Then I'd remember to check it and, omgwtf, there are comments and submissions that have been sitting there needing approval.  Toolbox is to the mod as RES is to the non-mod. Vastly expands and improves upon the reddit experience in many, many ways.  Given the large amount of users of both, it's amazing that neither's features have really been incorporated into the reddit."

What do the admins actually do?   Like, do they make new products that I've just never seen? Improve the backend code to determine who sees what posts? Make tools for moderators to handle communities? It's not like game development where there's new content that comes out and is clearly visible. We hear about the admin overlords when shit goes wrong (/r/wow blackout tripped an intervention, whenever theres a drama event they'll appear) but never hear or see them otherwise.  Moderators have a very visible role, as do (did?) people like Victoria- but other admins seem almost invisible."
TheoryOfReddit,3bxrxj,aldernon,3,Fri Jul 3 06:05:06 2015 UTC,"They are the people sitting at reddit HQ and what they do depends on their job titles. Some of them do sales (advertisements), some of them are indeed developers doing all sorts of stuff (just not a lot of mod tools), then there are community managers who basically are supermoderators that look into all sorts of stuff mods (Who are volunteers) can't or won't and there are of course also managers.  It is basically like many other companies and some of them you will barely see due to the nature of their role. But some of them you should actually see a whole lot more of but not always do."

TheoryOfReddit,3bxrxj,nosewings,7,Fri Jul 3 11:59:17 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a chaotic way to handle it - protest is by design disruptive. This is how any sort of protest or civil disobedience operates. In this case, mods want more control over their communities, but their interaction with the site administrators is limited at best. By taking the entire communities offline, they drag users into it; users want their content back, and the mods direct them: ""The admins are not listening to our grievances.""       I agree that as a result of its disruptiveness, these methods should only be used in the extreme cases, but if you believe the story the mods of these subreddits are telling, the lack of dialogue between administrators and moderators has been going on for years. I think this may have been initially by design - reddit admins were loathe to change site UI/UX for years. Mods may have simply been caught up in this design ethos. Now, as reddit grows more rapidly, this ethos may no longer suit mods, and they feel that change for the better is coming too slow."

I agree what happened isn't fair, but it's not the absolute worst thing to ever happen on this site.  It's at worst a mild inconvenience to the mods and anyone else who had stuff like AMAs lined up.   Now if the admins went batshit and started filtering content left and right and ruined a bunch of subs, I would be more on board because that does affect everyone.

Some would argue this already happens, it's just really low-key and shady so it's hard to track. The recent high-profile /r/fatpeoplehate fiasco was an example of the admins killing a community that could be considered an embarrassment to the site and drive away advertisers, much like /r/jailbait was a couple years ago. Arbitrary shadowbanning is another example, as is the progressive insulation of the admins. The reddit staff used to be highly involved in the community a few years back, but recently they've been disconnecting more and more as Reddit Inc gets shadier. Many, many things have been slowly moving reddit away from a ""free speech platform"" and more toward a ""social media monetizing platform"", it's just been extremely subtle for the most part."

And this is all intentional to get people not to vote.   This is the reason why I think this country needs national voting regulations for national elections. I don't want them screwing up another one, which is bound to happen if nothing changes. They are using one of the key principles this country was founded on for their own political advantage and it is disgusting."

I don't think the teachers should teach anything about anyone.  Just provide a time management structure and plan what activities to do.  Although the reason I didn't vote for 10 years when I could have, is that I didn't want to cast the 'wrong' vote and be counter-productive.  I think that is not really a problem.  Even if they vote wrong the first time, at least they got involved and started the learning/participation process going."

Have you ever seen imgur's upvotes -> views?   They're completely transparent about up/downvotes and views. It's an incredibly low ratio (i.e. sometimes up to thousands of views per upvote.)  example from an image hosted on imgur that was posted on reddit (imgur links to reddit and a lot of redditors will view but not vote on the imgur content):  http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3bexur/inconsiderate_parker/  4760 upvotes on reddit -> 2,604,867 views total.   547 upvote: view ratio."

You're right in that reddits userbase is far too small to directly influence an election, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if it has played a big role in getting Bernie Sanders' name out into the public conciousness. The value of reddit is in its viral influence, not the users' capacity to vote themselves."

I commute to work via the train every day, and get my news from a variety of different newspapers that people leave on their seats when they get off. I read everything from the international New York Times to the local Chronical; and don't feel an especial need to get my news from Reddit.

Reddit is a giant echo chamber of young liberals and libertarians that tend to all want the same candidate before even entertaining debate.  Plus the Reddit demographic doesn't even vote.  For someone like Bernie Sanders to win, he needs to get support from the demographics that don't even go on the Internet, like seniors."

I don't really entertain the notion that reddit can seriously influence politics at this point, I agree that it's too much of a circlejerk and full of armchair activists, just pointing out a couple of weaknesses of your argument."

But he was not a serious contender in either election, so I don't think it matters much.  Reddit responded pretty much the same way during both campaigns.  And Reddit is bigger now, but much of that growth has been international users and teenagers, two groups that don't matter in the elections."
TheoryOfReddit,3bfx84,Werv,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:32:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  While I would argue Reddit did have an influence, it is just so much smaller than MSM or Radio.   Facebook or twitter on the other hand, could have a significant impact.  And honestly, as much as people hate political posts on Facebook, there is some substance to people sharing viewpoints, in which many independent/undecided may see.

Based on the level of the arguments used in /r/politics I would be surprised if many people change their views. The level of sophistication isn't terribly high.  It's also important to remember that redditors who post, comment or vote in /new are not a representative sample of the user base. Just because a lot of stuff is posted in favor of Sanders and voted up does not mean that the user base necessarily supports the vocal minority's views."

Yeah, I know it sounds crazy but Reddit isn't the liberal bastion like was back during Obama's first term. With conservative influenced movements like Gamegate, during election year we will stuff hitting the front page about how Hilary pushed for a law to ban violent video games.  Statically young people don't come out to vote; but would the college aged gamergate crowd come out to vote if there was a wide spread paranoia that their video games will be taken away/censored by a female authority figure?

The second effect is that having more life experience lends weight to a comment, so someone who says they're older than the stereotypical 20-something redditor or ""I've been working in this field for 20 years"" or ""I've been married 15 years"" might get more upvotes when talking about a relevant subject."

Basically, history is a complicated subject like any other, but like any other subject, it is necessarily taught at a relatively superficial level to high schoolers and non-history university majors. Because most people never get a full understanding of the full nuance in history, they are drawn to quick, easy and simple answers to historical questions."

Anyone expressing a socialist perspective, however naive or obnoxious, gets upvoted and praised while anyone expressing a free market or classical liberal perspective, however humble or polite, gets downvoted to hell and back and ridiculed.  I don't know where it comes from, because I don't think it's representative of the rest of the world. Perhaps Reddit started out leaning slightly to the left, and through both groupthink and the upvote/downvote feedback mechanism, it just kept snowballing.  If you're aren't the kind of person who is susceptible to groupthink or propaganda, you feel rather alone on Reddit."

I mean, there was a front page post on /r/wtf about how a paintball-type arena had Arabic designs. The comments were about how politically incorrect it would be if it was American, except it WAS actually designed by Americans, and there are several just like it in the U.S.   The level of ignorance, compounded by an ironic sense of superiority, is uncomfortable to see."
TheoryOfReddit,3ax6lv,smpx,6,Wed Jun 24 18:59:25 2015 UTC,Well another thing is just that low effort content is a lot easier to digest and upvote. I think that's just the nature of how it works. Does that necessarily reflect on maturity levels?

TheoryOfReddit,3ax6lv,basilect,16,Thu Jul 2 12:41:47 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been here for nearly 9 years, and seen a whole lot of informal surveys—first pre-subreddit with ""upvote your age!"" and later moving into specific subreddits with google docs surveys and then strawpolls—the average age in these surveys has definitely declined. And this is going from ""whole site"" (back in the day) to specific subreddits that would by-and-large cater to an older audience than the defaults. So one would have to assume the age in funny/pics/wtf is even younger still.  Now, the decline hasn't been that much. We are talking mid-20s to early 20s, here (although some specific subreddits push that right to around 20, or even 19). But the hypothesis that reddit actually getting older, well, I guess it's possible within the past year or two, but for most of reddit's lifespan it's been getting younger.  If anyone wants to try to gather some data, a simple google query of ""upvote your age"" reddit 2010 returned a bunch of results. Presumably you could do a few variations of that, plus different years, and maybe put together a rough sketch of results."
TheoryOfReddit,3ax6lv,adremeaux,6,Wed Jun 24 14:46:49 2015 UTC,Average age in 2011 was 26-31. Average age now is 18-25.  Reddit has moved down a whole age bracket.

TheoryOfReddit,3ax6lv,thisisnewt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think this could be because reddit is quickly rising in popularity and hasn't had time to plateau yet. Older age groups have seen growth, but the site is seeing massive growth in the younger age group which is why there's the skew to younger age groups.  I think as reddit plateaus you'll start seeing average age rebound and the current users should stay.  Also I think another interesting thing is how you find reddit. I think gaming subreddits probably led to a lot of young people finding reddit. /r/leagueoflegends and /r/hearthstone are massively superior to their forums."

It lets busy people stay connected in an effortless fashion, so that was more a case of old age finding the site, rather than the site finding old age.   As for the comparison with FARK or wimp.com, I think reddit is far more entrenched than any other link aggregator site has ever been. After a decade of farks, ebaum's worlds, metafilter's, etc. , reddit has been perched high at the top since 2010, with no obvious direct competition in sight. For example, often cited alternative voat.com, as an entire site, is roughly equivalent to a medium sized special interest subreddit."

People seem to be making a point of rejecting the actual CP in one subreddit, and arguing that they were very diligent about removing those links, and should have had a warning rather than immediate no-warning removal of the subreddit (or whatever it's called there).  Is there really a lack of legitimate negative stuff to point to, so that you have to misrepresent them to make a point?  I feel like it clouds the waters when people do this kind of mud-flinging misrepresentation of the other side--it really starts to discredit the side flinging the misleading mud."

It seems like currently some vehement Redditors(Shitredditsays) are doing everything in this power to crash the site. It's unfair really.  i think I am going to leave reddit not because of the ""safe space"" approach by the admins but because of the constant circlejerking by pretty much every sub. Even anti-circlejerk subs like /r/circlejerk, /r/subredditcancer, and /r/shitpost are all just massive groups stroking eachothers egos. There are subs not like this. I think places like /r/woahdude, /r/unexpected, /r/askhistorians, /r/machineporn, /r/perfectloops, /r/scenesfromahat and /r/shittyaskscience are alright most of the time.

I hate to use the terrorism analogy, but it actually kinda works here. When you take people who have deviant thoughts or beliefs, and give them a support network that repeatedly says ""this is perfectly healthy"", you're only encouraging more drastic behaviors. You think most conservative muslims start out wanting to strap on a suicide vest? I bet group-think sure plays a part in it.  Shit, even 4chan cracked down on this stuff a decade ago. Just let that sink in for a second: There are people on reddit arguing to keep a thing that 4chan thought was too fucked up from the beginning.

You are allowed to have opinions about people that they don't like. You are not allowed to threaten them directly.

No. Any required set up is counter to the premise of Reddit. It needs to entertain, engage, and not annoy people on first glance. That's how it builds the trust that leads users to actually give it any time. If it ever had an advertising overlay or work required before showing links, they would be in a very quick death-spiral.  They might be able to get some of what you're talking about with implicit user-creation: rather than pop up an account-creation UI when someone tries to customize their logged out view, just let them customize and silently create an account for them. Their comments would be attributed to an arbitrary username like newb-65355. Later, they could either set their password and username, or they could log-in-and-merge with some existing account."

My examples are anecdotal of course, but in the past year both /r/aquariums and /r/totalwar did some polling, the former in comments, the latter actually had a form to fill out.  The audience showed to be far younger than I imagined, ranging from 16-25 for the most part. I'm in my early 30s now and that age group was deep in the minority. There are always a few outliers, couple of people in their 40s and 50s, but it was mostly children/young adults.  Another informal age grouping I saw happened only last week on r/patriots. People were asked what they remembered about Tom Brady first coming in mid-game as a backup QB to fill in for the then injured Drew Bledsoe in September 2001. Most respondents indicated they were only 3-8-years-old that year, I was 19, one of the oldest by far, and only 3 or 4 other people were my age or older.  So even far away from /r/all this site seems to be getting younger or staying young. I'm not really sure if older individuals stop using the site as often, don't respond to polls or if younger people have simply swarmed here en masse, tilting the numbers in their favor."
TheoryOfReddit,3ax6lv,Jiecut,5,Thu Jul 2 06:43:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly because the younger age groups have grown a lot faster. Reddit is still in a massive adoption phase and haven't really penetrated like facebook. While your age group is deep in the minority, your age group has also seen growth, just not as much as younger groups. And I think it makes sense as those people will adopt reddit easier."
TheoryOfReddit,3ax6lv,Dempsey64,7,Thu Jun 25 14:57:46 2015 UTC,"Hard to say what will happen in the future, but there was definitely a steep decline in the average age a few years ago. I suspect it's gone up again a bit due to the increasing awareness of reddit's existence in popular media. But I'd say it will remain pretty young overall, since the lowest common denominator content that fills the defaults appeals to young people."
TheoryOfReddit,3awu51,gee_raffe,12,Wed Jun 24 03:31:29 2015 UTC,"Like a zone where comments that didn't contribute to the conversation got deleted or something? (Maybe this is a bad idea though)   Like r/askscience or r/askhistorians?  Heavily modded subs aren't a problem when done well.  The issue you're going to have talking about things that aren't empirically measurable or can be proven through research is that the sub will always be at the mercy of the mods.  And that means there will always be controversies and people will piss and moan about the power tripping mods.  They'll complain on your hypothetical utopian sub, or they'll complain on a separate sub and won't 'organize' down vote brigades but won't stop their members too much from downvoting on their own.  Reddit/the internet in general is actually pretty shitty for serious debate because people just dive into another sub or forum that's just an echo chamber for whatever they want to talk about.  They'll just complain how they're being oppressed by whatever group they feel like is insulting them this month and everyone will agree and things get worse instead of better.  Another issue is that social research has shown that people don't change their minds often.   The goal was to test whether facts, science, emotions, or stories could make people change their minds.  The result was dramatic: a whole lot of nothing. None of the interventions worked. The first leaflet—focussed on a lack of evidence connecting vaccines and autism—seemed to reduce misperceptions about the link, but it did nothing to affect intentions to vaccinate. It even decreased intent among parents who held the most negative attitudes toward vaccines, a phenomenon known as the backfire effect. The other two interventions fared even worse: the images of sick children increased the belief that vaccines cause autism, while the dramatic narrative somehow managed to increase beliefs about the dangers of vaccines. “It’s depressing,” Nyhan said. “We were definitely depressed,” he repeated, after a pause."

I see this in AMAs and askafeminist etc.   But I could see the biggest issues out of the ones you mentioned being: -determining the grey line between a very opinionated comment from a comment that's just not productive and attacking with no initiative to communicate.  -explaining to people that they CAN disagree AND understand each other at the same time and that this is the goal of said subreddit.  Ugh... At least I can still dream about it."
TheoryOfReddit,3awu51,twentyone_21,2,Wed Jun 24 04:37:41 2015 UTC,Are you wanting to start a community that you can do this in? Are you asking if there are ones that exist? Or are you asking if there is a possibility of a subreddit devoted to discussion and mutual understanding?

TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,Fibonacci35813,197,Mon Jun 22 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"Reddit routinely upvotes cogent SOUNDING and long winded comments, bonus karma if you've got bullet points. It's been an issue for a while and an online form of ""tyranny of the majority""-- that what most people agree becomes defacto truth until being throughly debunked (one example that comes to mind is the  BackBlaze blog analysis a while back on HDD reliability, the ensuing rebuttal, and how long after the fact people still try to assert that it's valid.)  It's a lot worse in the less moderated subs, but arrogance and incomplete or hotly debated explanations aren't rare in the moderated/science focused subreddits.   Another issue is that whoever comments FIRST with something long and cogent sounding will receive a torrent of upvotes unless it is refuted early enough for the submission or comment to still be high enough ranked for the rebuttal to make it as the next highest comment."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,cuteman,86,Mon Jun 22 21:55:50 2015 UTC,"I think the last issue you mention is pretty significant. More and more often I discover fantastic, well-written, informative comments with only one or two upvotes buried deep in a thread because they weren't made within the first hour or two. If an early poster sounds like they know what they are talking about, they'll get upvotes simply because of their authoritative writing style.  Every now and then I see a post on a subject that I'm actually an authority on in RL and some of the things that get highly upvoted are way off base or just plain wrong, but whoever's posted sounds like they know what they are talking about. Bonus points if it seems to agree with ""the reddit circlejerk"". I've pretty much stopped going to reddit for any scientific or technical discussion because of this."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,mirth23,30,Mon Jun 22 22:10:35 2015 UTC,Another aspect is tone and style of the author. I've seen two comments say essentially the same thing while one gets upvoted to 2-3k and the other is low or negative despite originating at around the same time.   Reddit can be extremely fickle on a comment by comment basis as well as having the structurally influenced phenomena I mentioned in my comments above.

In the lifespan of the thread--especially in the time it takes for a popular comment to drown out new comments--there may not be time for a more knowledgable person to find and effectively refute the popular comment; but in any other format, the timescale isn't so compressed and doesn't work so effectively against informed rebuttal.

TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,cuteman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:12:52 2015 UTC,"As an aside, what was the refutation on the backblaze thing?   Their methodology, procurement and implementation practices were all novice grade pretending to be commercial tier scientific analysis.   Basically it led to people boycotting Seagate because of reliability and some people chiming in with personal anecdotes about failure but in reality, it was two primary Seagate models that had well above average failures: 1.5Tb and 3.0Tb.   What you didn't hear unless you read back through their blog posts was that, specifically, the 1.5/3.0Tb were purchased during the Thailand floods. Where did they get them? They paid individual people to buy External hard drives from Costco. Then they pulled the drives from the external enclosures (thousands of drives using unknowable levels of care to remove the internal drives from the enclosures, an action that voids the warranty for good reason). Next they inserted the internal pulled drives into their own 2-4U chassis, I forget if they were the Gen 1 or 2 chassises but they were rated for higher temperature and hest variance inside one enclosure as an entire Google data center.   Additionally questionable variables include running consumer grade drives in enterprise demand environments as well as no acknowledgement of work load, purchase date or vendor (they averaged them all together, another aspect that negative impacted Seagate specifically as they were some of the oldest drives).   Ultimately, the analysis looked scientific and professional but was deeply flawed making their conclusions suspect at best (those Seagate drive models were 400% higher than the average failure rate), which was then averaged into Seagates alleged overall reliability.   Backblaze at the time had ~30k active units at the time, which sounds like a lot until you realize Google, Microsoft and Amazon all have 10m+ active hdd units in their population.   Lastly, ALL of the top 10 global hdd consumers use both WD and Seagate, meaning if failure rates were as high as backblaze suggested they'd be replacing nearly 1/5 of their drives every 6-18 months.   Basically, the Internet amateur armchair techies ate it up and didn't attempt any critical thinking themselves. Then it was debunked. Repeatedly. But because of how quickly widespread the article became (none of the top hdd consumers publish reliability reports, the only thing even close is from Google in 2007 which is entirely obsolete) people ate it up and it became defacto truth. The article still pops up from time to time because backblaze is the still the top article despite being invalid."

People in general are really fucking stupid, but the upvote/downvote system exemplifies this better than any other system that has ever been shown in history. It's more important to say what people want to hear, as opposed to something that they don't want to hear because, let's be real, only a very tiny minority will actually upvote a post on its individual merits. It's why literally every thread you see on the front page will have 400 lines of drawn out, stupid puns and they all get like a thousand upvotes a piece.     Just to further show this, I want to show an example from the /r/leagueoflegends community. shutters Basically, a while back a guy made a fake account claiming to be a leaker and released all kinds of upcoming information. The entire thread was just ""THE PROPHET DANK MEMES HAHA"" except for one person, who called bull shit and messaged the guy. The guy responded back with this.

If anyone didn't know about Watson and is curious (about the racist stuff), the wiki section is informative, and here are a couple of the funnier execerpts IMO:   On the issue of obesity, Watson has also been quoted as saying, 2000: ""Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them.""[82]  While speaking at a conference in 2000, Watson had suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger libidos.[82][83] His lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects' sex drive.

TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,VeryLittle,20,Mon Jun 22 23:05:53 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm the original author of that comment on askscience that you referred to. I'd like to respond to this piece in particular:   I'm not saying that particular comment is not correct, but I, nor virtually any other redditor, has anyway of knowing how factually accurate it is. Indeed, there are a few dissenting opinions in the comments. And yet, most people would read it, see it has a lot of upvotes, and accept it as 'truth.'   I do my best to never hide behind any assumed authority (or flair), but I'd like to point out that askscience does its best to only make flaired contributors out of those with graduate degrees/training in the field.   Additionally, this was a speculative question. There is no serious scientific work or peer reviewed literature on this topic. Sadly, the best answer that could be expected would be the intuition of someone with training in the field. The fact that I didn't notice another physics panelist complaining in the comments should be a good sign - they certainly would have had the opportunity.   Also, even experts can make mistakes, which is why I've always done my best to include links to other sources and to wolframalpha to show work- if you'd like to check my comment history you'll find that my posts are abundant with that sort of thing. That post was a rare exception.   There are many people in the comments who caught mistakes early in the submission of the post. I originally was missing a factor of 3 with the calculation of the TNT equivalent, and I was off by 3 orders of magnitude with the mass of the second black hole (which is horribly embarassing!). And it only takes one person to catch one mistake; each of those were identified very quickly, and I rechecked the math and edited it for accuracy, so I'd like to believe I have done my due diligence.    PhD, I'd come across questions that I knew the answer to but what I would find was that top answers often were missing important information, moderators, or caveats, if they weren't completely wrong   Your comment history tells me you are completing a PhD in psychology. That's wonderful - you are exactly the kind of person askscience needs. When you see something blatantly incorrect, contact the moderators an alert them to it and explain why (if it's not obvious) - they are all scientists and it will be much quicker to get incorrect comments removed. Also, consider becoming a panelist - it's super easy."

This should help a lot with the problem the OP is describing."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,DaveBowman,11,Tue Jun 23 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"Groups of people make their own reality. It has always been like that. Imagine the typical ""group of normals vs. the outcast individual"" situation.  The normative discourse exhibited by a group of like-minded people is always subjective to the group, i.e. there is really no objective ""normal"", it just may locally appear so if the group in question is large enough and covers a large enough territory.  Long story short, I think the main motivator is to be part of something greater, to be able to have a truth to believe in. This sounds pretty desperate, but a lot of people who hang out on reddit all day, well, they must be pretty desperate (no offense here, just trying to collect facts EDIT: I don't know this for a fact but it's not the most pivotal point of my post anyway).  So what easier way is there to be part of a truth and to be part of shaping it than clicking that tiny upvote arrow?  This isn't limited to text posts, either, it's also relevant for images or something in between text and images like e.g. memes in /r/AdviceAnimals. The latter is an excellent example, btw. Not of all memes posted it could be said that they convey a universal truth, and many of the upvoters will know that. So why do they upvote it anyway? Because they would like truth to be the way that the meme states it is. I guess the intrinsic motivator is that some meme, for example, will make their life easier if it was true. So let's make it true, right? (And here we are again at being desparate, in some shape or form)  It's crowdsourced reality. It's like TV, but on crack. TV produces content for which there was a lot of R&D to find out whether viewers will like it. The broadcasting schedule is fixed, but you can still vote with your remote control. Yet, the whole process is pretty asynchronous. On reddit, you have direct control right at your fingertips.  EDIT: Lots of typos and a few non sequiturs. It's very late here already."

What motivates a redditor to upvote a comment that 'sounds' correct, but that they have no real knowledge on the true veracity?

TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,The_Town_,17,Mon Jun 22 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"Well, speaking as an absolute plebeian when it comes to Science, my philosophy with upvoting comments like that is simply because I assume they're right and I figure my upvote helps put the ""correct"" answer at the top.  Of course, I can see how this backfires if the comment is wrong."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,beimpermissible,16,Mon Jun 22 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your responding to this post.  And I'm wondering, too, if you see that not only does your strategy backfire if you're wrong, but it also backfires if you happen to be right.  What I mean is this:  As a self-described ""absolute plebeian when it comes to Science,"" you sort of by definition have no idea whether a comment is correct or not.  So, you have no idea if your upvote is helping correct or incorrect assertions rise to the top.  And you have no real idea how often you have guessed correctly when upvoting.  So, the general strategy is a bad strategy in the sense that, for all practical purposes, it's a strategy you have no real way of assessing as you go along.  That is to say, you not only don't know whether a comment is correct or not, but you also don't know from one comment to the next whether you have been upvoting correct or incorrect comments previously.  So, you don't know whether the aspects of a comment that move you to upvote it should also move you to upvote it.  And yet, you continue to upvote the comments you assume are correct.  Assuming that your sense of which comments are correct has--at the very least--significant biases for style, tone, etc.--what this means is that, over time, your self-reinforcing pattern of upvoting comments you think sounds correct will, in fact, encourage you also to upvote ever more comments that, rather than being correct, merely correspond well to your biases.  Without a way to check your own accuracy over time, this is virtually certain.  In other words, the strategy of upvoting things that sound right when you don't really know is a bad strategy, liable to backfire increasingly frequently over time even when some of the choices it motivates happen to be correct.  I hope it's clear, by the way, that I'm not saying that to be a dick.  To the contrary, I think it's really worth considering."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,The_Town_,3,Mon Jun 22 23:48:31 2015 UTC,"you sort of by definition have no idea whether a comment is correct or not.   Basically, yes. Short of what they teach in high school and your basic science courses, I have no idea.  Don't worry, I totally agree with what you're saying. I'm a huge history and politics guy, so I am much more knowledgeable in those fields than Science.  It can lead to a huge problem with bias and such, but my rationalization, whenever I thought about this problem, was always, ""Better the comment that might provoke someone to think, right or wrong, being at the top than the one-liner joke response.""  I hadn't explored this problem to the extent you did, but I definitely will pay more attention to that now."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,Moxy-The_Blogical,4,Tue Jun 23 00:14:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I like to read threads about things that I don't know anything about to learn. If I tried to fact check something I know nothing about, I may end up in a worse situation (ha ha). My hopes are people who are regulars in the sub will comment with factual information, and if it sounds logical, I up vote thinking I am helping.  However, what is the percentage of Redditors that are educated enough to know that not everything on the Internet is true?  In some subs, I assume concentration."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,The_Town_,2,Tue Jun 23 15:42:15 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.

I can appreciate the desire to see the other side of the coin/other perspectives.  This is done to an annoying extent on Reddit, IMHO. It seems like people on here really want comments to be factually correct or else they wouldn't be so adamant against anecdotes and generalizations. I get the feeling OP sees this too by the way s/he ""qualifies"" this post by acknowledging any generalizations.  That's what I call the Reddit equivalent of being ""PC"". In sum, I assert the phenomenon of these kinds of comments being so highly up voted as Reddit's overall preference for the voice of dissent. It certainly feels that way. I know many of the downs I've received are because I couldn't source my statements, which implies Reddit values the truth when op's study indicates otherwise. Or maybe the just value sarcasm and applaud the devils advocates in each thread."

I assert the phenomenon of these kinds of comments being so highly up voted as Reddit's overall preference for the voice of dissent.   Yeah, Reddit's second-opinion bias is huge, especially if said second-opinion is something the majority of the users in any given subreddit agree with.    What's worse is that while commentors - including those dominating the conversation - have the ability to argue and explain their points as much as they want, the author of the original post - be it a news article, blog post, opinion piece or whatever - oftentimes doesn't get that chance.  Nuance and explanations are something that active commentors get to have, but oftentimes the people who posed their original arguments don't get that in return, further skewing the conversation.  Not always the case, but often enough that it's a problem, especially on larger subs."
TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,str1cken,3,Tue Jun 23 02:07:02 2015 UTC,"I recently saw a long comment in r/askreddit saying all kinds of inane and untrue things.

I had a lot of firsthand experience with the people he was talking about, said so, and offered to provide proof.  He was upvoted into about net one thousand, and my challenge and offer of proof was downvoted into the negatives and out of sight fairly quickly.  This is certainly an unintended consequence of the voting system; users can and do upvote lies they agree with while downvoting uncomfortable truths.   ... Although, in the history of human knowledge, we've certainly seen a good amount of parallels, not just on social media (posting and reposting a catchy 'truthy' image macro or video full of falsehoods and partial truths while the rebuttal doesn't see nearly the same traction) but pre-electricity (Galileo)."

But the problem with that is that people who are experienced in a field can still be entirely wrong.  Though I think it'd happen far less often than now, it could still lead to incorrect answers being upvoted to shreds, under the assumption that someone knowledgeable in a field will always be right.

Many threads there have more deleted comments than voted ones as a result, but what floats to the top tends to be pretty solid. There are enough very knowlegeable participants there that bad or partially correct answers get picked apart pretty rapidly too. Of course, that is what historians are trailed to do, specifically, so it's probably not a surprise. When I see a top comment with a lot of votes and specific endorsements/additions from quality flaired users I generally feel I can trust its accuracy.  Not so in most other /ask subs. Strict moderation and a strong source requirement make a difference. So, of course, is having an amount of traffic that is reasonably possible to deal with that directly."

The problem with /r/askscience is the wider range of fields involved though.  As broad as history might be, it's still just one field with historians mostly speaking a common language so to speak, and I think that's why policing it is significantly easier. You can even have e.g. two physicists who are unable to verify each other's claims on the spot (just like with history), so try to moderate all claims when pretty much anything goes in that sub as long as it's ""science"" somehow.

And the thing it is, it ranges from the factually concrete issues to the analogous and ambiguous sort of things like perspectives, culture, and stereotypes.  One such instance, I remember noticing early 2014. It had just snowed quite heavily around where I live (in an area of the US that is known mainly for being hot and humid, sometimes going a full year without a single snow in the winter) and somebody had uploaded an imugr album of photos of how my city deals with snow. There were pictures of accidents, wrecks, and in one case even a car was on fire.  Well, many in the thread mocked the State in which this occurred in, claiming the drivers here were incredibly careless and that it's impossible for accidents to happen like in just plain snowy weather. The sentiment reverberated throughout the thread, but what so many missed is that when it snows here, it isn't like up north where the snow is moved off the roads immediately. By the time any snow ploughs had made it to the area, it was nearly nightfall. What happened was, that the snow began to melt in the early morning and noontime, then froze back over into just a sheet of ice in the afternoon. This happens nearly everytime it snows here. This is why all of our schools close on snowdays and many businesses roll up the sidewalks...it's dangerous to drive on the icy roads. Snow tires isn't a thing down here and we are much less equipped to deal with these sort of situations because we so rarely ever need to.  It's this fundamental lack of understanding of certain things that Reddit doesn't seem to be aware of in these threads where comments are propelled to the top of the thread without much of a discerning glance. I'm aware that most people are ignorant about cultural aspects of areas of the world that do not involve them...that's simply natural. However, Reddit doesn't acknowledge that this ignorance is innate and does little to combat it.  After seeing a few threads like this and even the ones that are just plain factually incorrect as you say in your OP, it makes me wonder just how much stuff reaches the front page that is actually true. Even within our own community, I see drama and forum politics get spread around with rumors and hearsay, when the origin of such rumors is not at all what the repeated narrative entails."

While a large point of ""quality"" is ""factually correct"" in the context of a science board, that particular context, or at least its importance, is an outlier in most others, and one that's often a poor return-on-investment to focus on.  To criticize Reddit for its way of sacrificing factuality to popular opinion is like criticizing a jackhammer that scrambles eggs poorly because it sacrifices your cookware to forcefulness. The forcefulness is not a bug, it's the purpose of the device. You might use it to scramble the living piss out of an egg, but complaints that it's hitting too hard are well-dismissed with ""You're using the wrong tool for the job.""  To someone running a science sub, Reddit has the advantage that it promotes quality conversations. It can get a lot of people talking about science. Bonus! Since it's talk-focused and not fact-focused, though, that comes with the disadvantage that it's primarily made to get a lot of people talking, with no stops on the fact that slick enough bullshit can flow faster than hard knowledge.   To answer the questions: If you're going to try to glean facts from a peer-to-peer discussion forum, you've got to remember to do so in the context of a peer-to-peer discussion forum. Treat it like Wikipedia without the reliability.  Perhaps /r/askscience could do a better job of expressing that (not saying they don't already-- I frankly don't know), but OTOH, I doubt many people are reading /r/askscience for information that absolutely needs to be... well, anything remotely close to correct, really. If it's some throwaway factoid that's not going to matter to the reader one way or the other, then who cares? If they're actually going to rely on the information for anything more than a chuckle, or if they care for their own reasons, than they should be smart enough to find something to confirm or deny it."

Your typical redditor can't seem to distinguish between an utterly damning rebuttal or a caveat (based on the subsequent number of upvotes/downvotes an OP will get) and also can't distinguish between a scientifically sound rebuttal and an argument from personal incredulity.

I notice that for the largest submissions /r/askscience usually has only 1 main comment thread, and a bunch of different sub-sections of different types of answers.

TheoryOfReddit,3araxu,CupBeEmpty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"I think the issue here is that Redditors are somewhat divided into two groups: those who read and upvote submissions (let's call them ""post lurkers"") and those who read and upvote comments (""comment lurkers""). I would place myself in the second group, and I'd imagine most of this sub would do the same, since meta-analysis of a website kind of depends on being interested in how commenters think and what comments get upvoted. I'll admit I'm guilty of what you've described--even though I secretly look down on those who blindly upvote submissions without checking their veracity (see: /r/todayilearned), I realize I'm a hypocrite because I assume the most upvoted rebuttal must be correct. I'll at least try to explain where my mentality comes from - maybe other people like me go through the same thought processes.  Post lurkers and comment lurkers both function as crowd-sourced sieves and selectors for certain types of content, and although the content itself might overlap, the motivations behind the two groups are often different, leading to the kind of dissonance where a highly upvoted submission in TIL will remain at a high ranking despite the top comment refuting it. The post lurkers of course greatly outnumber the comment lurkers--think of the 90–9–1 principle--meaning the upvotes from the ""ignorant"" (in this case meaning they didn't read the refutation in the comments) will outweigh the downvotes from those who read the submission, click the comments, read the refutation, and then decide to downvote. There are too many steps involved to contribute to that extent for most lurkers. The comment lurkers are those willing to ""go the extra mile"" when it comes to processing information; they consider themselves more skeptical than average because they want to verify that a submission isn't just the ""tyranny of the majority"". They assume the comments and those who bother to upvote them are all the collective work of people like them, the more skeptical Redditors. Of course that isn't always true, because everyone's seen shitty, ignorant comments in good and bad subs. Yet the comment lurker feels, as a whole, commenters are a more reliable bunch, and those who choose to read and upvote those comments are at least better than those who blindly upvote the submissions on the front page. It's the tyranny of a majority that hasn't gotten too big for its own good.  I keep using TIL as the unspoken example because it's the best sub where you can have two opposing arguments receive crowd support, and I think it best highlights how those mentalities can clash. The top submission in TIL at the time of my writing this is a submission about how 15 cargo ships pollute more than all the world's cars. The unspoken idea behind the submission, the one that leads post lurkers to upvote it, is that if we improve the technology behind cargo ships rather than cars, we'll make a much more significant impact on environmental efforts. I think this idea is so appealing to Reddit because it's never a solution you hear about; it allows a Redditor to feel like they're one of the few who's smart enough to know what the real problem is and where efforts should really be placed. And to think all those idiots in the news are talking about hybrid cars and electric charging stations! However, the third-most upvoted comment (and the chain that follows it) totally refutes that unspoken idea because it explains how cargo ships are the most efficient way to transport that cargo. There are also people replying on other comment chains (including the top reply to the top comment) that explain why fuel alternatives for such massive ships like nuclear power aren't feasible.  The comment lurkers aren't the ones doing this counter-research, nor are they maritime experts capable of refuting any points the OP brought up, but what are they supposed to think when all they see are two sides to an issue and one is limited to 300 characters? The guy with the Wikipedia link is going to win in the minds of those who believe they're skeptical because they've been taught that those who don't cite their sources didn't do any research themselves. It doesn't matter whether the comment lurkers click the links that a refutation includes - I've seen links in both TIL posts and refutation comments where nothing in the link actually supports the argument being made. They just exist to make the submitter look like an expert or skeptic. Another important aspect to consider: as the popularity of TIL increases and there's more competition to get your post noticed, one has a greater incentive to use flashy, clickbait-y titles to get karma. This doesn't always mean there's blatant misinformation, but it could at least be presented in a way that's disingenuous. Commenters and comment lurkers don't point this out often, but I'm sure most of them notice it. Thus they begin viewing the post not as a set-in-stone fact or even as a sincere argument - it's merely an attempt to gain karma by any means necessary, like some kind of advertisement that bends the rules to sell a pseudo-fact. This only further fuels the skeptical mindset. Unfortunately this doesn't push the masses towards legitimate research - it just leads them to search for refutations from those who appear to have done research on their own.  TL;DR - This is what happens when the second-option bias goes meta."

Originally the top commentor said the 5mm black hole would have a mass of Jupiter.    It's really hard for the layperson to fact check.

TheoryOfReddit,3acag1,heterosis,32,Thu Jun 18 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"Well, one major flaw in your investigation is failing to take into account that redditors are not just from the U.S.  Thus, it makes it more difficult to accurately plot this data."
TheoryOfReddit,3acag1,owleaf,5,Fri Jun 19 00:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did note that in the title and the chart, but I should have addressed it as a bullet in the post as well.  I really don't see much of any other option for doing this sort of comparison.  Reddit is majority USA, but the precise make up of the non-USA parts aren't published (afaik).  Even if they were, I would need to find the stats for those countries and hope that they count using the same criteria, which is unlikely.  Then do a weighted average or something to pull it together.  UK has pretty robust stats, Australia not so much, I haven't tried looking for other countries.  Then there is the language issue.  If I speak Farsi and have Anxiety, then /r/anxiety isn't doing me any good.  So yes, I agree this is a limitation of the analysis, but I don't see a way to overcome even with additional effort.  I would also note that not all Reddit accounts are for adults."
TheoryOfReddit,3acag1,GingerPow,2,Fri Jun 19 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"According to Alexa, the US has 52.5% of the userbase of reddit, then India with 9%, then Canada, UK and Australia with 4.7%, 4.6% and 2.5%. This makes up 73.3% of the users, so of the remaining 26.7%, I'd expect a decent amount of the remainder to be from Germany, the Nordic countries, Russia, China and Mexico.

I suppose in a sense most people would be going to these types of subreddit for support, whether that be via aid or need. I'm not entirely certainly if I'm communicating effectively, so let me phrase what I see as a mock title - ""Brother's depression getting worse, can anyone give advice?"" I've seen at least one in the past week from a bipolar subreddit (of course there are two for that illness) asking the community whether they should speak with their SO's parents, given they felt they had reason to suspect BPD.  As to the proportions involved, I couldn't tell you offhand. Shit like this bugs me, so if some sort of remotely accurate method pops into my head I'll make sure to PM you.  EDIT: As this worthy of putting out there but not bugging you directly over if you haven't read this, the only ""feasible"" solution I could think of would be to use a system like mTurk.

Self Harm is a symptom, not a separately recognized condition (afaik).  Your OCD links point out a couple of important points (1) it can often be confusing exactly what condition we're talking about (e.g. OCD vs. OCPD) and it may be helpful to set up subs that are more broad not force the distinction (2) there are a lot of subs for some of these conditions.  I found a number of anxiety/panic subs, and I'm sure I didn't see them all.  The naming conventions can make them hard to find.  My approach was to just count the relevant sub with the largest count, but for some of these they may be more additive.  As far as using a main account vs. a sub account, I don't see why that would make a difference unless you're subbed to the same place in more than one account I'm still counting one person, one time."

The content is primarily composed of images, most of them rather humorous. You could probably also include /r/WTF in this category. Media fan content and discussions. In terms of larger subs, this would include places like /r/music, /r/movies, and /r/television. It would also include subs geared toward a particular media genre or a particular show, movie, or band. Subs like /r/BreakingBad, /r/gallifrey, and /r/HomestarRunner would also fall into this category.

Along with movies, books, and TV, sports are basically a form of entertainment. Subs geared toward actually playing a sport, rather than being a spectator, would be classified with the ""Hobby and Career"" subs.  I do think regional subs should be their own category, though. Also ""Classifieds."" Someone else mentioned these, but I overlooked them."
TheoryOfReddit,3a6862,photonasty,5,Wed Jun 17 22:58:06 2015 UTC,"This is a very good spectrum of categorizations, thanks!   It almost seems like each of these general themes are akin to television networks, and the communities are analogous to channels?"
TheoryOfReddit,3a6862,photonasty,2,Wed Jun 17 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. With TV, you have kind of ""general"" channels and networks, analogous to the big default subs. There are also highly niche cable networks for almost everything.  I do wish there were a better way to search or browse a directory of subreddits, based on categories. I actually think ""tags"" would work better than using singular categories. You could browse subs and filter by one or more tag, which could be attached to subreddits at the moderators' discretion.   Tags could be like:   music media movies discussion humor stories advice careers hobbies art history ask finances   I could come up with a pretty huge list, actually. For example, a sub like /r/LetsTalkMusic (in-depth music discussions) could be tagged with ""media,"" ""music,"" and ""discussion."" /r/CrappyDesign could be ""design,"" ""humor,"" ""images."" Mods could attach any number of relevant tags to their sub, helping people find it. If you filtered by both ""media"" and ""discussion,"" for example, you might come up with subs like /r/LetsTalkMusic and /r/TrueFilm.   I have no idea if any of that would work, but there are so many subreddits out there. It might also help Reddit to attract and retain new users who might be more interested in specific niche communities than in the content on the large defaults."
TheoryOfReddit,3a6862,NUCLEAR_HERO,2,Wed Jun 17 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"I like the tags idea, but it seems like the television network idea works pretty well too:  i.e. a user could subscribe to a network (much like a cable package) and get a series of default subs, and add more on top of that  e.g.    A ""Music"" network which could be like MTV A ""Funny"" network which could be like comedy central (/r/funny, /r/imgoingtohellforthis) A ""News"" network which could be like CNN (maybe news networks would need multiple ones) A ""Gaming"" network that could be like G3?   What could be a good idea, hypothetically, is if posts were tagged in the way you describe, but communities were grouped together similar to television networks, broadcasting."
TheoryOfReddit,3a6862,photonasty,2,Wed Jun 17 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"we already have multireddits. Perhaps these could be some pre-made multireddits accessible from the front page?   You could fill out a questionaire or something to better tune them. for the music it would ask what genres you like, for funny it would ask how your sense of humor is (memes? dirty/racist jokes? standup vids?)"
TheoryOfReddit,3a6862,Lampwick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:37:34 2015 UTC,"That's also a good idea. The ""packages"" could also consist both of subs that it subscribes you to, and other, more niche subs that are recommended to you. For example, signing up for ""music"" could come with /r/music, /r/listentothis, and /r/LetsTalk Music, but also give you a list of recommendations for various niche interests-- /r/electronicmusic, /r/metal, /r/hiphopheads, etc. ""Television"" could get you /r/television and a couple of related discussion subs (which probably exist), and then recommend subs for specific shows like /r/BetterCallSaul, /r/gameofthrones, /r/TheSimpsons, etc. It would not only provide users with the defaults, but provide useful suggestions for smaller subreddits that might interest them."
TheoryOfReddit,3a6862,jfb1337,2,Wed Jun 17 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"You could browse subs and filter by one or more tag, which could be attached to subreddits at the moderators' discretion.   Might also be interesting to have user-applied tags, and a sort of ""slider"" to set on the search interface to screen put user tags by their relative weights vs other tags...  That might be asking a bit much, though. It's one of those ideas that sounds easy, but when you start thinking about implementation it gets harder."

Heres my swing at it. Theres 3 major categories and lots and lots of smaller ones.   There are Theme subs. (Funny, Wtf, gone wild, Mildly interesting, whoadude, ect) that run almost entirely on content generated by outside sources or users towards a specific theme. Most often in the form of gifs, videos, image macros, whatever.   There are Fandom subs (The walking dead, league of legends, harry potter, DnD, gaming ect) that focus heavily on discussion as well as some videos, images, and user generated content that centralize around a specific person place or thing that the readers all share an enjoyment for.   There are informative subs (TIL, ELi5, ask historians ect) where users look to learn from other posters, be it a specific scientific topic, or random movie fact.  There are some more sub categories that are super niche like ones centered around debate, subs centered around organizing events and people, subs that are just content dumps, but they are less numerous and often more diverse than alike.

Victoria helps them sound more natural but sometimes it comes off even worse (as in the case of the recent Hilary Duff AMA).   I'd take into account number of questions answered, type of questions answered and the best AMAs tend to be the ones where subsequent questions or comments in the chain get replies from OP. Engagement also goes through the roof when the subject doesn't necessarily schedule it and keeps interacting. Keep in mind an AMA usually only goes for a couple of hours but is most visible for 12-24 hours meaning most observers who try to participate after 4-6 hours are SOL. But some AMAs go on for quite a while when they realize how effect a platform it can be, Snoop Dogg's comes to mind for one. I think Arnold's had a similar result.

The admins already had to say that wasn't the reason because they couldn't explain why other subs weren't banned for similar behavior.  I mean, for some of those, the claim is that FPH users brigaded their own sub. The fact it was necessary to reach so far to put together a list that wasn't valid to begin with tells me a lot more than the list itself."

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,yaix,-7,Sun Jun 14 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, legal free speech. Reddit has been banning users or sub's with illegal content, but never for saying their opinions."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,TheWindeyMan,25,Sun Jun 14 12:27:44 2015 UTC,"IIRC creepshots and jailbait were technically legal (no nudity), and people have been shadow banned for allegedly ""legal"" posts. Also harassment is illegal and vote manipulation is against the Reddit ToS, so if FPH were doing both then that's 2 reasons for banning that Reddit has always had."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,TheWindeyMan,-1,Sun Jun 14 10:37:30 2015 UTC,"Reddit advertised itself as a free speech platform for years. When they banned violentacrez' subreddits, in fact, it was made explicitly clear that it was an exception to their free speech policy. It was made so explicitly clear that it actually pissed a bunch of people off.  Where have you and the people upvoting you been? Seriously."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,Dared00,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:48:22 2015 UTC,"Where have you and the people upvoting you been? Seriously.   Well, we've spent the last few years watching Reddit occasionally ban subreddits to be honest. It's not like all the subscribers were IP banned at the same time, if the previous users want to create a new sub and either moderate it properly or create a private sub then Reddit isn't stopping them.  If anything the reason given for FPH's removal is more legitimate than the reasons for previous sub removals, as brigading / vote manipulation / harassment has a much bigger negative impact on other users of the site than things like r/jailbait which only created a negative perception of Reddit in the media."

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,rnto,-12,Sun Jun 14 14:52:48 2015 UTC,After the post visibility comes factor of how the crowd percive that post. This event shows most redditors don't like banning FPH.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,agentlame,12,Sun Jun 14 02:15:03 2015 UTC,"Most people don't go on /r/all, so all it shows is that there's more people on /r/all opposed to the ban than supporting it. I went on all to see the damage and didn't really bother to downvote stuff because what's the point, people will get bored and stop doing it in a couple days. All this really shows is that there's maybe 10-15k people vehemently opposed to the ban as compared to the 100 million plus visitors on this site every month."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,rnto,-3,Tue Jun 16 02:17:37 2015 UTC,"You get strange perception on 'damage'. If FPH post hurt you that's not the problem of the reddit, it's your personal problem.

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,agentlame,8,Sun Jun 14 11:32:19 2015 UTC,How are you defining 'most redditors'?  Because I think the fact that the vote brigading in the /new queue is dying after only a few days shows most redditors don't care.    Even the morning after the announcement my front page had exactly one post about FPH.  The rest of reddit just rolled on.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,rnto,-2,Sun Jun 14 14:14:15 2015 UTC,There are some numbers behind top posts btw. When post comes to /r/all top it comes to judgment of hundreds of thousend people. Top posts get +2000k score. If FPH posts were really disguisted by community it's can not be possible even for 150k voting brigade to handle. btw I doubt there are this many active voters at FPH.

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,rnto,0,Sun Jun 14 15:01:25 2015 UTC,Ohh. No it's yours. Just forgor about second part. It's ok to people to handle things on their personal way. One-two-three days and those who dont care just carry on. Those who care switched to other sources. We should see latter on total reddit traffic drop.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,agentlame,3,Sun Jun 14 21:26:43 2015 UTC,"One-two-three days and those who dont care just carry on.    Which seems to be everyone.  That's my point.  reddit hasn't changed at all because most redditors don't care.     Those who care switched to other sources.    Exactly.     We should see latter on total reddit traffic drop.   No, we really won't.  20k people missing from reddit is 100% unnoticeable.  What is noticeable is voat gaining that tiny fraction of users.  To them, that number is huge.  To reddit it means nothing.   Most users don't care and never will."

(Joking)  It's not about 20k or 150k (or idk how many there are at voting brigades of FPH which generating some traffic now btw). It's about users with strange interests like gays or some fetish or killing people or who knows. It's a signal for them to avoid reddit as the place where their interest can be banned. I think there will be a noticable decline   soon."

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,remzem,10,Mon Jun 15 01:22:34 2015 UTC,Yes. That's the point.  This event does not show what most redditors think about the banning. It only shows what the voters think. Not even that. It shows what the most common voters in /new think.

That way it's not reddit users against the sub bans, it's fph users."

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,jhc1415,8,Sun Jun 14 18:55:56 2015 UTC,"A sizeable minority of a subreddit with a 150K subscribers probably numbers in the thousands.  Even if it's only hundreds making the submissions and creating all those new subreddits, there's likely thousands of users willing to sit in r/all/new and vote for a few hours.  It's pretty clear to me that the administrators were wholly unprepared to deal with the tantrum that followed the anti-harassment announcement. They knew that the FPH crowd habitually engaged in harassment, it's why they made the decision for the bans but somehow they're completely unprepared to handle the backlash and minimize the resultant disruption. To me this comes off as inexcusably unprofessional."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,Why_so_saltie,25,Sun Jun 14 21:33:37 2015 UTC,I would not underestimate the extent to which various chans are influencing this situation. Reddit has always been brigadeable.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,jhc1415,27,Sat Jun 13 20:11:06 2015 UTC,That single subreddit had 150k+ users. I believe it was one of the ten biggest.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,biznatch11,42,Sun Jun 14 13:22:38 2015 UTC,Top ten most active I thought.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,jhc1415,18,Sat Jun 13 19:49:38 2015 UTC,That sounds about right. It made it to /r/all fairly often.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,biznatch11,24,Sun Jun 14 03:29:50 2015 UTC,"It was just over 200th in size but the 11th most active at the time it was shut down.  It had 150,000 members but was more active than some with several million. In other words, it had a very dedicated following."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,aperson,25,Sun Jun 14 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"I find that pretty disturbing. Looking at the list of most active subreddits, that means people are more passionate about making fun of fat people than movies or sports or politics."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,jhc1415,16,Sun Jun 14 04:21:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair most of the top are default subs, you get subscribed even if you don't really care about the topic. Also FPH was still fairly new, maybe the novelty would have eventually worn off."

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,ERIFNOMI,5,Sun Jun 14 05:21:53 2015 UTC,You're right. According to this it would be top 200. I don't know why I thought it would be higher up.

TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,alien122,3,Sun Jun 14 05:25:15 2015 UTC,Because it was one of the most active.  Number of subscribers is not the best measure of activity.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,GiantSquidd,4,Sun Jun 14 03:53:40 2015 UTC,Because /r/all has always been garbage and they've always been there.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,Xelif,19,Sun Jun 14 04:10:12 2015 UTC,The majority of reddit users do not visit r/all.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,barrelrollmais,12,Sun Jun 14 17:22:11 2015 UTC,I could probably count on one hand how many times I've gone to /r/all instead of my front page in the five years I've been here. There's just too much stupid on reddit so it's nice to not see all the lowest common denominator bullshit that the Facebook people upvote.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,snarkiwi,5,Sun Jun 14 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"Related question: I wonder how many accounts are needed to outright ""break"" reddit - upvote agenda-driven posts unnaturally so that they dominate /r/all, the default front page, whatever?  I doubt anyone but the admins has a good idea of exactly how many people were/are involved in the /r/all rioting, but the Pareto principle usually works:  FPH had ~150k subscribers. Pareto principle states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes, so roughly 80% of activity in FPH likely came from roughly 30k accounts, 20% of subscribers.  Take that 30k pool and apply the Pareto principle again, and you get 6k dedicated outrage-warriors contributing 80% of the brigade, and 24k non-dedicated former FPH subscribers contributing 20% of the brigade - occasionally voting on stuff, but not parked on /r/all/rising for hours on end.  Clearly this is a bit of wild guesswork, but the Pareto principle is one of those magic things that usually works unless there's some specific reason why it doesn't work, so I figure 6k high-activity + 24k low-activity is probably a reasonable ballpark figure.  Since /r/all has been a cesspool for several days now, clearly the outrage-warriors have more than enough voting accounts to ""break"" reddit (or at least /r/all, which, as has been sagely pointed out, is not reddit for most users).  We know that there are technically sophisticated social media propaganda operations out there. China rather openly has the ""50 Cent Party"" (五毛党 wumaodong) network of national and local paid Internet commentators; Russia has a similar operation; the US probably does, and I'm sure other nations do as well, or will in the future. On top of that, I would be shocked if there weren't private for-profit services with similar resources."
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,rickdg,0,Sun Jun 14 02:42:52 2015 UTC,TIL of the pareto principle. What an awesome thing that is. This is an excellent thing to keep in mind.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,ChiefKickingAss,12,Sun Jun 14 16:33:40 2015 UTC,There was a post urging users to camp out on new and downvote all non-fph content. It's probably archived somewhere on SRD.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,Sansa_Culotte_,2,Sun Jun 14 19:03:10 2015 UTC,The average redditor also upvoted a lot of FHP once it reached r/all.
TheoryOfReddit,39qgwl,ABadManComes,-1,Sun Jun 14 21:19:07 2015 UTC,I believe the outrage extended beyond fph subscribers. i never subscribed or visited the sub and was very upset.

Further furthermore, when I was an avid drama hunter. I used to read in particularly ThePurplePill. Anytime there was an idea or post contrary to BP they'd crosspost it in BP, make fun of the user, and often times brigade (which was amazing because PP had downvotes turned off at the time).

I use it in situations where I know I'll never want to see that particular submission ever again. That's 1) when a submission offends me and 2) when a submission won't get off my front page. I check reddit throughout the day and sometimes everything I saw on reddit previously will get switched out with new stuff except for one link. I might've seen it at 8 AM Thursday and now it's 12 AM Saturday and it's still there.

If it's something I'd normally be involved with, then I follow the rules based on appropriateness and how much it contributes to that specific sub. The specific exception is if something makes me say ""holy shit"" and mean it? Upvote, we could always use more solid content on the front page. I don't downvote on /r/all, unless I'm already subbed to the specific sub, because of shadowban/brigade concerns.   I could be alone in this, although I doubt it, but I tend to try to keep the amount of upvoting I do a bit heavier than the downvoting as a general rule. If something seriously doesn't fit or belong, it gets a downvote. If I'm just not interested? Meh, it'll take it's course, the stuff I'm boosting up will probably overpower it in the long run. I'd rather not actively cost someone votes because it's just something I don't care about, I feel like only people who are actively shitposting deserve that.  A good example was all of that massive drama that just blew up across /r/all a few days ago. If it was in a default I was in or a sub I actively follow? You bet I nuked it, it probably didn't belong there. I didn't touch absolutely anything else."
TheoryOfReddit,39ol6h,iamaneviltaco,2,Sun Jun 14 01:07:10 2015 UTC,"I don't visit r/all/new very often.  When I do I have my own set of rules that probably a lot of you won't like.  Most things I don't vote on at all.  Even the weird porn I'll leave alone.  I have no interest in many things here, but I respect that others do and leave them alone.    However if I find something hateful, stupid, or truly distasteful, I use the downvote liberally.  And honestly that's what I'm looking to do on the rare occasion I browse all/new.    A lot of what I downvote is self-styled gender activism.  So much of it hits the front page and I have simply gotten sick of it.  There are things I will upvote on r/all/new.  Since I try not to vote on the basis of a title I won't upvote an article unless I've read it.  If I've already read it and found it interesting I'll upvote it.  Sometimes I find things that look like they're worth reading.  If they don't disappoint I'll upvote.  And photos.  If I like a photo I'll upvote it unless it was posted to r/pics.  I vote in that new queue regularly."

According to #3+4, I should be downvoting pretty much everything on the front page 24/7. However, if they were posted in the correct subreddit, do they technically deserve an upvote?    no   Like other users have added I'd vote as if I was a member of each community. The front page of Reddit is an entirely different beast, and I feel that the best reddit has to offer are its niche subreddits. So, as you browse your front page or /r/all you ought to vote as if you want to see more of that content in that particular subreddit or not, even if it does technically fit best in that subreddit.    I find the hardest voting decisions are when I'm browsing through my subreddits and I come across a submission of like an image macro or a stupid one liner that is fucking hilarious. On one hand, I don't want my subreddits to turn into meme-manors. On the other hand, I want to see more hilarious content and reward OP for his moment of brilliance."

For the logged-out users, and those that stick with the defaults, the content on /r/all is exactly what they're used to seeing, and voting there might feel more casual. It's the people like us, who spend more time managing what they want to see, who might find that voting on /r/all feels a little more biased."

TheoryOfReddit,39kjqs,Biomedmilkman,2,Fri Jun 12 20:15:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   In future I hope to focus in on a couple of our findings and see if they will hold true with digital experiments or data scraping, rather than using self-reports. I also want to explore how some of the factors we have identified (prosociality, empathy, norm-following..) might be studied in online contexts other than voting, and what implications this may have for the evolution of the web.   I think that research such as ours could give advertisers an indication of the informational preferences of people, and how these preferences can vary across different demographic groups and behavioural tendencies. Perhaps a company might use this to create more influential advertising campaigns that play to people's preferences and elicit sales. People may also unknowingly get influenced into sharing appealing promotional materials with their social network. Another possibility is that advertisers could become overly confident in using the research to predict what their audience will prefer, leading to overzealous marketing campaigns that could offend some people...   ..this is a tough question though. There has been some very interesting and insightful research motivated by the field of marketing :)"

Bots don't care how you vote their comments, but people obviously do.  It's interesting to see scores get to -30 and then the guy who says ""guys, it's a bot"" also get heavily dowvoted for pointing it out.  Don't get in Reddit's way when they're trying to make a bot feel electric remorse for its comments.  Go through any bot's posting history and it's virtually guaranteed that if you see a massively downvoted comment, it's in some thread about someone dying, getting cancer, cat getting run over by a car, etc."

If you want to make a club and go to a room and chat with your buddies about how much you hate fat people, I have no problem. I think it's morally wrong but I don't think your morals should be regulated.   If that club then starts sending out letters and making phone calls to fat people and harassing them, that's a problem. The club should be shut down because it's having a negative impact on wider society.  You do not have the freedom to directly harass somebody. Say what you like in the clubhouse, but when you take it to their doorstep, that's not cool.  Secondly, so many of the arguments against banning it are pointless too. People listing ""worse"" subreddits as if that affects the individual decision to ban this one.   In my opinion there are too many people on this site who think the freedom to not be arrested for your views is the same as the freedom to directly harass people online on a private website.  I hope we can have a calm and rational discussion about this in these comments."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,armedrobbery,79,Thu Jun 11 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"The actual reason they got banned should be enough for everybody.  When Imgur.com admins began to remove images submitted by FPHers that were clearly taken in private contexts without the victims' permission, FPHers got all pissy and entitled.    Then imgur.com kept FPH harassment from reaching imgur front pages.  so what does FPH do? The mods, with pretty much universal approval, find identifying information, including private email addresses, legal names, photos and the like, of the imgur admins and put pieces of these dox in the sidebar, with accompanying sidebar text and multiple thread submissions calling for outright harassment and further doxxing of these people.  They personally witch-hunted and doxxed people. That is what they were banned for. Rules which existed since before Yishan the pseudo-libertarian former daddy figure of reddit shitheels, and not really anything to do with Pao or any other recent changes in policy statements.  FPH couldn't even be bothered to call it ""investigative journaly"" the way /r/mensrights did.  They were proud of harassment, are proud of harssment, to a ridiculous level.  Some of them were spamming /r/videos and other places before any of this even happened.  They interfere with reddit operation by constantly performing subterfuge.  Quite frankly they had a ban coming for a long time.  Now that they're interfering with reddit operation openly it's only proven that they don't deserve to be here. Or anywhere for that matter."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,Aerik,18,Thu Jun 11 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"There are more reasons they got banned:  The sub is banned but some people still manned to capture just how much they were breaking the subs rules:  If you look at this post you can see they took the pictures of another redactor from sewing and reuploaded it and made a whole post abusing the person  They did this so frequently, there are other examples documented there on that subreddit which show what went on. The annoying thing is that now that there sub is banned and the evidence is mostly wiped, they are all trying to claim they never brigaded or harassed people.  They would do this and some of them would follow links back to the OP and abuse them.  So many of their posts were targeted at individuals and other redditors and so many times they put links up basically as a call to arms to brigade. It was really frequent when they harassed other users to the point some from MUA and skincareaddiction were afraid to upload pictures of themselves knowing where they'd end up.  The mods encouraged this and joined in. This is the most obvious and indisputable deserving of a ban I've ever seen."

TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,Dracomega,5,Fri Jun 12 10:29:00 2015 UTC,"That's a flawed analogy though, because the 'other worse subreddits' have not only been around for longer, but the admins have known about them for far longer too.    Whether it's reasonable or not, people are complaining about what they see as a cop walking past houses where they can see people being murdered, and then stopping at a house being burgled and arresting the burglar.    Also they are that burglar getting arrested, but their obvious bias doesn't affect the validity of their argument, as we all know."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,stormrunner911,5,Thu Jun 11 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree. A fairer analogy would be a cop showing up to a crime scene where both a murderer and burglar are and choosing the burglar to arrest while leaving the murderer alone. Reddit admins don't suffer from the same real world limitations that cops do in the sense that it is just as easy for them to ban a ""murderer"" as it is for them to ban a ""burglar"". The perceived inconsistency arises from that premise."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,Sansa_Culotte_,5,Thu Jun 11 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"In this case, they do have similar limitations. The reason why the fair-minded people of reddit are up in arms is because they believe ""Chairman Pao"" is taking away their right of free speech. However, the admins did not ban /r/fatpeoplehate because of their beliefs, but for their actions. While /r/coontown, the murderer in this situation, has more offensive ideas, there is no proof of brigading or personal harassment. So if the admins were to ban /r/coontown as well, they would not have a legitimate reason (unfortunately)."

TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,Sansa_Culotte_,2,Fri Jun 12 10:30:30 2015 UTC,"I think a better analogy is arresting the person who is doing only 5mph over the limit, but doing it recklessly and in a way that endangers people, while ignoring the person  who is DUI, because they are doing it slowly and carefully enough that they are a hazard.

The reason people point this out is because it reveals that the admins are inconsistent (or a more cynical person may believe it reveals they're lying). They aren't against subreddits that harass because if they were, /r/ShitRedditSays would've been banned a long time ago. In the banwave they've also banned subreddits like /r/neogafinaction, which reveals their SJW agenda.  Harassment is the buzzword admins are going to use to bring sweeping bad changes in.

If reddit admins lack the resources to police millions of individuals   They were clearly receiving reports. I'd wager real money that those reports had accounts mentioned in them.

The idea that the FPH mods changing their minds and deleting the sub wouldn't make people angry is completely baseless too.

To most people it's fairly intuitive that when a community develops, becomes large, and then has their platform taken from them by people who don't approve of the things they say they're going to be upset.  If you prevent them from building the community in the first place, yes, obviously they won't be so upset, but it isn't because ""you assume reddit is omnipotent,"" it's because they aren't losing a community they valued.  They aren't losing their in-jokes and special phrases and sense of approval and identity that communities bring.  Even, evidently, communities dedicated to being super pissed that overweight people exist.  Honestly, the post reads to me a bit like someone trying to quickly communicate the details of a dream before it fades from memory. :P"
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,lvysaur,3,Thu Jun 11 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"My problem with outright banning a subreddit is that it's an attempt to hold an entire community of individuals responsible for the actions of (probably) a minority. You can't say that 'the subreddit' participated in harassment or cyberbullying, because the vast majority of users, visitors, lurkers, on that subreddit almost definitely did no such thing. Just because a mod puts someone's personal information in the sidebar doesn't automatically make me, as a reader of that subreddit, complicit in its use, for good or for ill.  The admins have created a whack-a-mole problem now, because whatever they decide to push down is just going to pop up again, and again, in slightly modified forms until it becomes something the admins have to either begrudgingly tolerate or deliberately change the rules (again) to exclude.  I don't think this issue has anything to do with politics or power dynamics or the deeply-rooted psychological preferences of average redditors. This isn't The Matrix and we are not all just part of a system. I think the issue is average redditors like me feeling slighted when an admin claims to know my motives for viewing and enjoying one type of content over another. It's as if merely subscribing to and reading the content of /r/FPH automatically means I'm the sort of troublemaker that they're trying to get rid of by banning it. Reddit is a privately-owned company and they do have a right to regulate people's speech. That said, it seems timid to me that instead of making the argument to their shareholders and the media that hosting a 'community' is not the same thing as condoning the content or actions of that 'community', they choose instead to stomp on their own users to try to sanitize their broader image. The idea that 'we want people to feel safe' is laudable, but laughable. Nobody is ever 'safe' on the internet, and especially not because some particular subreddit exists or doesn't exist. I think the controversy of this move comes almost entirely from the bullshit press-release-ready reasoning behind it.  I would have much rather heard 'we're banning subreddit x because we want to and we can. If you don't like it feel free to leave.' It's the attempt to dupe users with this whole 'it's for your own good' story that creates the negative reaction. We recognize borderline subreddits when we see them, and NOBODY is surprised when they eventually get shut down. 'Sorry guys, you knew this would happen eventually.' That's all that needs to be said. A few people will get shitty about it, and the rest of us are just fine."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,za3keaxi,7,Fri Jun 12 03:21:01 2015 UTC,"The big issue I have with this is that ""cyber-bullying"" has no real definition.  If you take fatpeoplehate as an example, the rule they apparently broke was ""harassment"". What they actually did was showcase publicly available information - this is not harassment. They did not attempt to directly or indirectly contact the subjects of their ridicule. They did not harass anyone.  By the slippery justification of ""harassment"" the management used to ban the offending subreddits, thousands of people and communities could be accused of harassment. Xpost a comment and the user disapproves? You are harassing that user. And the real kicker is that communities that actually did harass people - such as shitredditsays doxxing people - are completely ignored. This one fact is the end-all proof of the admin's hypocrisy and the reason everyone is so pissed off.  If you disagree please tell me why instead of downvoting and moving on, cheers."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,itsjh,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:51:12 2015 UTC,"While the mods didn't directly say ""go harass these people"", they pretty much put targets over their heads. For the same reason, doxing against the rules- it doesn't directly hurt you to have your information public, but what comes of having your information public can definitely hurt you.  And lets be honest- the mods knew exactly what they were doing. Every time a comment is linked to on FPH or a picture is ripped from one subreddit and posted there, the subject gets a shitload of harassment. FPH mods have been in contact with the admins before, so they can't claim ignorance."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,DaEvil1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have read any of the actual content/proof of FPH harassment. Read other replies on this thread or in other threads on the topic of all of the FPH infractions. It isn't as lightweight as you are being made to believe. And repeating the propaganda is irresponsible.   Here's a link to another thread, but there is plenty of good stuff right here in the above comments: https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/39c0n3/cmv_reddit_was_wrong_to_ban_rfatpeoplehate_but/cs27yt4?context=3  The argument that there are plenty of other communities that should be banned is dumb.

TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,itsjh,-1,Fri Jun 12 04:30:08 2015 UTC,"Of course a few select users harassed people. That will happen with any community, especially one dedicated to a negative attitude towards a group of people. However, the mods in charge of fph did not encourage it. In fact, I remember them specifically forbidding it to preserve the subreddit. If entire communities can be banned for the actions of a few idiots, shitredditsays should have been banned ten times over.  And I don't agree that this is a good step to take. I agree that reddit is for profit and the owners can do whatever they like with their own website. Just don't expect people to react well when you judge spinning them hypocritical lies to be more effective than telling them the truth."

TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,itsjh,3,Fri Jun 12 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"I would personally argue that through their actions (adding the sidebar image) along with what they've shown from the modmail, the mods showed that they'd actively go out of their way to bully a person they knew was already suicidal from their previous actions. Allowing members to make the posts they make is one thing. But when the mods know the person is suicidal and likely paying attention to the subreddit, and then go out of their way to make an official change and an official post like that, I'd say that sends the message that it's ok to bully and harass a person for the rest of the community potentially towards the point to where they will take their own life."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,za3keaxi,3,Fri Jun 12 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"Do you know what hypocritical means? It means that you believe reddit admins themselves are actively harassing people while penalizing others for doing the same. That is nonsense.  And finally, 2 of the 3 mods of FPH were engaged in harassing conduct.  You honestly just don't have your facts straight. Do some reading. I linked directly to the incidents where veteran users provide unbiased analysis and show how much worse the FPH stuff was than SRS. You are just repeating propaganda, still."
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,Nikolasv,-2,Fri Jun 12 19:07:24 2015 UTC,I am well aware of the meanining of hypocrisy and how it applies to the admins cracking down on some communities and ignoring others they favour for the exact same behaviour.  They did not encourage harassment. I am repeating this because it is a fact. Calling me out on repeating it means nothing.
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,pier4r,3,Fri Jun 12 15:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not hypocrisy. That's inconsistent application of rules, a.k.a. a double standard. But you have yet to produce any evidence showing a strong pattern of direct harassment of individuals in another subreddit that's not been banned. And if you produce such evidence, we have every reason to believe that those subreddits or specific bad actors will also be banned. This was merely a first step toward banning harassing subreddits. More may follow.  What's the actual problem with what they did? Do you take issue with it or you're just whining that it wasn't a single, simultaneous comprehensive action? This stuff takes time. There is a process. But Reddit is clearly better now for having extracted these hateful morons. I'm sure they will learn from it for the future. Now, get over it or move along to voat.co, the refuge for pedophiles that want to jerk off to dead girls' corpses and harass their parents. I'm sure it's a fun place for everyone!"
TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,psdtwk,2,Fri Jun 12 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"The people complaining about this most are apathetic lulzkids and trolls who look at Reddit and life in general as something meant to entertain themselves. Life and other people only have a utility for them if they can amuse themselves, other people are just jokes for them or obstacles to making jokes. They often whine about anything remotely ethical and decent as being the sole domain of what they call sjw - social justice warriors who they invoke as some ever present mythical force(since they play so many video games they have invented a video game like set of enemies to oppose that don't really exist). The people complaining the most tend to be connected all the time and quite anti-social and disruptive in online communities while they are too cowardly to be disruptive in real life. They have no interest in free speech either, they just hide behind lofty principles since stating what they are really about -- entertaining themselves at the expense of others would never earn them any sympathy.   Fatpeoplehate was never a sub where productive discussion occurred. Nothing is missed by it being gone for non lulzkids and trolls, who are the sole groups lamenting its passing."

I am entirely in favor the FPH ban, let me make that clear. This post is not meant to serve as a defense of those who are defending FPH or its actions against imgur staff and other individuals. Surely what FPH did was not only in violation of site rules but also common decency. What I'm attempting to do is analyze is a root cause behind Reddit's reaction to the banning, because the massive wave of anger and hatred that's spewed out onto the front page recently certainly seems like something that warrants a bit of a critical eye. It seems like history is repeating itself, so I wanted to find a way to separate the anger from the ostensible cause and find common ground between past outrages. Reddit does have certain mentalities that are shared by a significant enough share of the userbase that it influences what the rest see, and if we try to understand that mentality and how it's able to spread with such effectiveness, we'll better understand what we're ""up against"" - assuming you want to make it out to be a war rather than a massive temper tantrum.  If we want to get into how the hell a sub like /r/EllenPao_IsA_Cunt manages to resonate with so many FPHers, that's a mental breakdown (both meanings) for another post, one I'll try to get to in the future."

TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,shawa666,2,Thu Jun 11 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"Just going to repeat what I said elsewhere   The problem is transparency. There could many be reasons that these subreddits have been banned: because its to kerb and clean the general community, or to prevent DDoSing, or potentially people bullying or getting information harassing individuals, or support from SJW or normies/other social (media) circles. But very clearly the main reason is that reddit is a profit organisation that gains money from subscriptions, ad revenue, and unique/new traffic. The whole debacle with /r/fatpeoplehate gaining traction has likely shown on their statistics/analytics as significantly reducing income. Which is fair and a good enough reason to ban a subreddit arbitrary or otherwise, just wish they'd be more honest about it. And yeah I do believe they want a generally less-vitriolic, grounded, more empathetic, slightly more objective, and/or above-average intellect community. It's why we're all here instead of 4chan, 9gag, Facebook, tumblr, or worse yet Youtube. Might as well try to keep it that way; we make the front page of the internet; but the web is fickle and that is subject to change.   In response to someone who said ""fuck values"" as a perceived attitude of reddit mods, and made similarly exampled arguments.   I didn't condone it, was just stating what likely happened based on observation. Obviously I'm all for personal freedoms and no censorship; but removing /r/fatpeoplehate[1] temporarily doesn't stop people from expressing how they feel on the subject matter. I disagree on how they(reddit) handled it, but at least they handled it. It's not like they cannot reverse or change what they did. If ran a business like let's say like an all you can buffet where you pay one fee and eat all you want. The business works fine until a band of people who'll overeat on purpose goes regularly until the business stops making money. They'll have to change their business model or put limit or their ""all you can eat"" or ban those people all together. It may seem like they're stepping on their freedoms, but reddit is not a public place; it is owned, it is for-profit. Without that profit; there would be no reddit. How can you pay for server space, moderating, marketing, web-development without money? Anyways take that buffet analogy anyway you want it. Whether the fat people being the over-eaters or /r/fatpeoplehate[2] subscribers being the over-eaters. I'm personally quite neutral on the subject matter. All I care about is the structural integrity of reddit(financially and content) and that people can still have freedom of expression; the status quo of the internet. So no ""fuck values"". But no ""fuck bias and pitchfork"". Seems like you're taking it personally, otherwise how would this affect you and why would you care?"

TheoryOfReddit,39flm6,MaDaFaKaS,8,Fri Jun 12 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"No. For a number of reasons that are obvious with even a moment's reflection. A few, but hardly all:  A) the moderators do not encourage harrassment or toxicity, and employ tactics explicitly designed to prevent such (use of np being the main one, ""don't touch the poop,"" and ""don't piss in the popcorn,"" also)  B) SRD doesn't exist to target any particular group of people, but to highlight wherever any two groups or individuals are at each other's throats. They don't create the toxicity, they just observe and comment like a Greek chorus.  C) Both criticize the ideas expressed, and not the redditors' immutable or inflexible characteristics. There's a huge gulf between telling someone off because they're a virulent racist and telling someone off because they have the audacity to be larger than you'd prefer.  D) Neither takes their activities off reddit, or even attempt to obtain or publish any kind of personally identifiable information.  E) Even if what you said were true (and it's very, very much not), the admin's actions here still aren't hypocritical. Are they only allowed to act if they can fix the whole problem all at once? Why aren't they permitted to act piecemeal? And larger than that, ""Why me and not him?!"" didn't even work in Kindergarten."

The problem is that, so as to not take absolutely ridiculous amounts of time generating comments pages, the comment tree generator has a limit on how many comments it'll look at. So, it'll pull out a bunch of candidate comments and show or collapse them, but if the comment you're wanting to ensure gets seen doesn't make it into that candidate pool, too bad - the code never knows anything about it other than its id.  The easiest solution to that, I think, would be to keep a record of all distinguished/etc. comments in a thread and consult that, but that's another piece of data we have to retrieve every time we're building the tree, and the vast majority of the time it'll be empty, and the vast majority of the time it isn't empty it won't be needed."

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,PenPenGuin,103,Thu Jun 11 04:55:51 2015 UTC,"I believe parts of modding Reddit can be compared to modding Reddit's much smaller, but older siblings - bulletin boards. If you were fortunate/unfortunate enough to mod a bb that got even semi-popular, lets say tens of thousands of users, the growing pains that Reddit is going through are probably at least somewhat familiar. The discussion of how to ""grow the community"" often gets mixed up with ""how to police the community,"" and suddenly you start trying to act as some sort of parental unit to a bunch of people who probably don't want you to do that. If you keep attempting to police the populace, the veterans wax poetically about the days when they could talk about anything, and the newbies are wondering why everything is so PG-13 and has no substance. Keep going and you eventually lose your community to the next big thing.      The usual solution is to create a subsection of the forum that's the ""no holds barred"" area. Generally speaking, sitewide rules are enforced (such as Reddit's ""no personal information,"" and ""no brigading"" type rules), but NSFW content and discussions are to be assumed.      People have assumed that the main reason FPH got removed was because it was so public and obvious. Instead of white knighting the situation, personally I think the better solution would have been to limit what shows up in /r/all. If users decide they do want to see that type of content, set up something along the lines of an /r/allplusnsfw. Basically, a list that's still ""public,"" but requires you to actually do at least a little footwork to see. A very simplistic solution, but one that I think would have gone over better and created much less work than the solution that was implemented."

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,pramirez184,19,Thu Jun 11 05:23:09 2015 UTC,I would modify this solution so that all subreddits that are harassing or no holds barred simply do not go into /r/all.
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,i_slobber_buckets,43,Thu Jun 11 11:52:31 2015 UTC,"I actually really like this solution. A structural problem with reddit is that the most hateful people are the most passionate, and are able to push their content to the top because neutral people don't vote.  Of course, posters on reddit, especially the more toxic elements, believe they have a right to be seen, and a right to be popular. I remember when r/atheism freaked out because they got removed from the defaults and there were so many less people getting to see their memes. Personally I don't think those people should be catered to"

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,parlor_tricks,22,Thu Jun 11 18:36:17 2015 UTC,"The reason it was banned was because of personal attacks on specific other individuals.  ""A few days ago imgur decided it would be a good idea to block /r/fatpeoplehate images from reaching their frontpage. /r/fatpeoplehate did not like this. They got details of the imgur staff and put them in the sidebar for the users to attack imgur staff with. Reddit responded by banning /r/fatpeoplehate for encouraging attacks on individuals, as well as a bunch of other subreddits for the same, I presume those subreddits had some spurious links to the same drama in some way.  This has NOTHING to do with reddit censoring content, offensive material, or just disliking those subreddits. They just enforced the rules they already have in place - Don't attack individuals. This was not a subjective situation, the moderators of /r/fatpeoplehate broke reddit's rules and they paid with their subreddit and accounts for it."""
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,mki401,15,Thu Jun 11 13:23:42 2015 UTC,Isn't this incorrect and the reason for the ban being attacks on imgur staff being encouraged and launched by fatpeoplehate?

There's one post in the top 25 that isn't about fat people, and only a handful in 26-50.    It reminds me of when moot removed the /news/ board on 4chan because it was a cesspit of racists and bigots, and he had to reinstate it a month or so later because all the posters there just spread out to the rest of the boards shitting them up. There was a noticeable drop in post quality on 4chan when they tried something like this, I can't see how reddit will fare better.    Oh, and would you look at that."

A line has been drawn in the sand, but both sides are going to be sitting as close to that line as possible, and unlike the fappening both sides are claiming the moral highground."

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,rwbj,29,Wed Jun 10 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"twitter and facebook are full of unseemly content. harassment. and hate speech and still get prominent advertisers.   Its hard to compare the sites, as they all function very differently.  Hate content on Twitter is just buried by the sheer volume of content there, and nothing hits critical mass, but don't for a second think that Twitter doesn't deal with hate-speech directly and severely.  Plenty of accounts are banned on Twitter.  Facebook does not seek to have one person's comments reach the entire world, they get to resonate within their own spheres of influence and only corrupt those around them.  Only at Reddit do you have the permanence that Facebook gives you, along with the public nature of twitter.  Only in the mix of forums and content can such things have the anonymity, the time to incubate and the potential size to become truly nasty with regularity.  Not saying that Facebook/Twitter don't have those problems, but again, both sites will remove offensive content."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,PhillipCarey,6,Wed Jun 10 21:29:48 2015 UTC,"Except Twitter began to raise the issue of internet harassment (or something similar) last month or recently. I don't recall what they did or what changes they are planning, but there was definitely some sort of news announcement about them perceiving a user/community problem and wanting to deal with it somehow. I'd look it up again."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,assumes,9,Wed Jun 10 21:48:41 2015 UTC,"The reason Reddit is useless for advertisers is that there's minimal targeting. Users voluntarily entrust Facebook with enormous amounts of personal information. On Reddit you can create a decent profile of the most active posters based on what they've said, but for the other 99% they have next to nothing, and untargeted advertising is pretty much useless. You get terrible conversation rates and it can actually hurt your brand image if you start to be associated with mass messaging which might be perceived as spam.  As radical as this sounds I expect Reddit's next step will be to start trying to entice users into giving them more information to them through some sort of ""enhanced offerings."" For instance one way to do this would be having a tiered user system. Bronze might be the current normal accounts as they introduce ""verified"" silver accounts which have enhanced offerings. These accounts might be required to comment on certain subs and they could also introduce a coercive upgrade force by doing things like restricting bronze accounts to 'x' comments/subs per day to avoid ""spam"" and ""harassment."" And how do you get a silver account? Simple. It's free! You just need to enter an code sent to you by SMS. Now suddenly reddit has your area code (and in turn your demographic on top of geographic data), phone number, etc."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,Quouar,23,Wed Jun 10 21:54:19 2015 UTC,"Facebook has WAY, WAY less hate speech because there is less anonymity. Scroll to the bottom of any reddit post and you will find people being hateful."

SRS and other meta or criticism subs, spanning a vast range of topics from shitpost hubs like KiA and MRA to widely beloved subs like BadHistory and BadLinguistics (and even arguably this one!), do not exist solely to harass, insult, and hate on people; they exist to criticize and correct things that people write.  Criticizing ideas and writings is clearly not against reddit policy, will not be against reddit policy, and was not the issue discussed today. Granted, the admins have done a terrible job of messaging this, whether through poor planning or poor implementation - perhaps they have explained it quite well, in replies buried under a deluge of petulant downvotes, never to see the light of day. (Reddit is, ironically, a bad platform for talking about reddit.)  And before we delve into the inevitable whataboutism, remember that personal insults aren't banned - harassment is. I can call you a shitwaffle. I can't create a sub called /r/AresIsAShitwaffle and invite others to talk at length about how much of a shitwaffle you are; I can't repeatedly message you to drive home the point that I believe you are a shitwaffle; I can't follow you around and downvote all of your posts for being shitwaffley.  I honestly and truly have no fucking clue why this policy is at all controversial.  I suspect that today's events are merely the usual angsty riot against any admin/moderator policy change, and it'll settle down pretty quickly.

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,justdweezil,3,Thu Jun 11 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"Does it draw in the cruel people or does it make people more cruel?  There's so much derision here and much of it goes to the world outside the community. Like that little boy that had a split second freak out when he didn't get a game ball.  Thanks to reddit, and whoever did the little clip he's got thousands of people saying he's a shit. A little boy.   If a camera on everyone on reddit at all times would they behave with perfect probity every second? Starting at the age of 7 or how old that kid was? What psychological purpose do these things serve? Reddit is a little peek into the dark hearts of humanity.  And then there are these amazing, unbelievable kindnesses! And creative brilliance and side splitting humor. It keeps you coming back and then once again you get splashed with some unlucky son of a bitch's guts and then you come back for more because you are hooked.   They're running a for profit company drawing in millions of people while mining the two extremes of human nature. Can you change humanity? No. So you probably can't change reddit---the derision machine is here and they can tinker all they want--but they seem to have no idea how big the job would really be.   Tl; dr: They're just avoiding legal liability."

In this case, the behavior is elective banning of subreddits, but witch hunts are another area where that's happened around here--people judging based on how they felt about the victim, rather than judging the behavior independent of who specific recipients were and how likable they were."

It's about letting them have their own little section. If it was your favorite subreddit, you'd be livid, too.  For the rest of us, reddit's basically said it's going to start arbitrarily deleting subreddits. This is a major shift in subreddit deletion & banning policies, and it comes at a time when the CEO and the admins are under scrutiny for close ties to certain subreddit managers and for abusing their powers to push an agenda.  Look, I may not actually care about FPH, but I care about a lot of subreddits that I'd rather get to stick around. If they can delete FPH, they can delete anything, at any time, for any reason, and the users have zero recourse.  Why is the default position that it's okay to just delete stuff? Because you don't like it? How'd you feel if someone deleted your stuff and then said, ""sorry, that guy over there didn't like it!"". That's a dumb way to go around deleting things."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,tones2013,4,Thu Jun 11 01:37:13 2015 UTC,"The issue is that they were going outside their own subreddit and harassing people in other subreddits, both in brigading, abusive PMs, and on occasion, extra-reddit social media.  The mods did nor discipline or ban users that were shown to engage in this abusive behavior.  I rarely step outside my non default subreddits and I was seeing this happening.  An overweight person on a small gaming sub shows off something he/she made.  Brigades by fatpeoplehate, inbox full of abuse, etc.  Someone on makeup addiction shows off new eyeshadow design. Inbox with abuse from someone from fatpeoplehate.  The issue is that there was rampant harassment by fatpeoplehate to people in unrelated subreddits.   Why should the rest of reddit have to deal with harassment by these entitled 13 year olds?  Their right to free speech does not entitle them to harass other people without consequence."

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,Thuraash,106,Thu Jun 11 07:23:18 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I just realized what this is all about. Seriously, people are getting all self-righteous about their unchecked right to free speech and sharpening their pitchforks because they can't post on fucking /r/fatpeoplehate anymore?   Give me a damn break, this entire post is hopelessly one sided and basically intended to fuel the Ellen Pao witch hunt bonfire. I for one welcome our new CEO. Apparently I've been on reddit for eight years now, and I'd say that compared to the reddit I knew eight years back, /r/fatpeoplehate is much more offensive to the original core values of the community than these actions by Pao.   The original reddit community was actually very respectful and welcoming to people of all kinds. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't quite Narnia but it was nothing like the current circlejerk of hate that seems to define much of reddit nowadays. If these admin actions scare a large number of the more juvenile and hateful users to some alternative site then hell yeah! If they could couple that kind of social shift with some actual effective ways to address the fluff problem then I might have to eat my shoe because I have long maintained that reddit's slow descent to the craptastic was inevitable.   Even this post wouldn't have gotten much traction on ToR a few years back. As I said it's hopelessly one-sided, it's basically just calling for a witchhunt. Did OP try to present a balanced perspective at all, or even really even attempt to stimulate an insightful discussion here? I think not.  *Not trying to self-promote but for perspective here's a post I made here where I tried to take a somewhat more balanced perspective, when this issue started brewing three weeks back."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,FrankManic,44,Thu Jun 11 12:02:52 2015 UTC,"+1 on all counts. The people moping about how this steps us away from the glory of Olde Reddit seem to either have no memory, or no knowledge of what Reddit was like before. It was an intellectually oriented, welcoming forum for insightful, sophisticated discussion. High quality and informative posts got upvoted; garbage and chaff got buried.   Garbage subreddits like /r/fatpeoplehate and the shitlord activists' other tentacles just weren't even on the radar. I can't imagine what we would have thought back then, but the reception would not have been warm."

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,viborg,4,Thu Jun 11 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"We're taking about different eras, though. Jailbait wasn't a huge deal back in 2008 when I made the jump from Digg. The site was basically 2013-era Hacker News, with lots of postings about tech and scientific developments, lots of business and startup discussion, quite a bit of PC gaming stuff (but again, mostly focused on the business/development side), a little (high-quality) chatter about movies, TV shows, and books, that sort of thing. Memes generally had to be pretty clever pretty clever to get upvoted, too. Generally, I think we can summarize it by saying it was a smarter site.   I think JB only made a splash around 2011/2012, but it's possible that I just wasn't paying attention."

The thing is you may be not one of them, but most original users and thus also the most ""nerdy"" / most ""interactive"" users come from a 14yos 4chan culture background where the principle of free speech is not only the most important thing ever, but also people are way to ""pussy"" nowadays in their opinion and need to harden the fuck up so they are doing them a service.

He has long since moved on from reddit, and mostly seems to view us an experiment in what a website dominated by ""fluff"" looks like, these days. Then again I personally got in about a year after the site started so maybe others here can offer a more valid primary source for that first year.   I don't agree with your point of view but I think you offer an interesting perspective, upvoted. That's what I do like about reddit, the diversity of voices represented here. As long as you can express your views civilly and respectfully, you're welcome here from my point of view.

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,HiiiPowerd,6,Wed Jun 10 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"The Reddit definition of harassment seems a bit wider then the one I'd expect in the real world though. If I'm reading their explanation correctly then I am potentially guilty of harassment if I constantly demean someone. It's not even clear if the person (or persons) I'm demeaning ever need to know about it for it to be harassment. In fact, taking it further - does the target even need to be a real person?   This seems a bit different to what I'd expect from harassment in other contexts."

If you have to question if you would get banned, chances are what you are doing isn't so nice. Reddit has no obligation to allow people to direct hate at others. Hate is not a good thing.  Here's a broad definition of criminal harassment I found:  ""States vary in how they define criminal harassment. Generally, criminal harassment entails intentionally targeting someone else with behavior that is meant to alarm, annoy, torment or terrorize them."""

Yes I do have the freedom to do anything. Even impinge on others freedoms, but since we love in a somewhat civil place when I exert my freedom beyond reasonable boundaries, like harming others, then the power structure steps in and limits my freedoms, and rightly so!    Freedom to action does not mean freedom from consequence.   Now to our relevant topic, calling some one names because their body is drastically different from yelling fire in a crowded theatre. In fact pretty much anything said on the Internet should generally be allowed, unless you are making a direct to threat ""I will kill this person tomorrow at x time "" .   If you wsnt to say fucked up shit. Do it, others don't have to read. If you want to spew vitriol against whatever group. Do it, you don't have to read. In fact I want them to. When they do and others agree you know have how some work to do in the real world to fix ignorance. No body talks about real topics or says their real opinion. So we don't actually know very much about people and their true beliefs. But when they can on this site and others. We can start to gauge how much of a problem we have as humans.   Jersey Shore is not the problem. It's the people watching it. Because wherever there can be an expression of something, the laws of novelty say it will happen.

Reddit has always had a horrible group of users that do vile things, harass people in real life and make moderating and building communities really hard.  I for one an very happy that some of these people are being finally put on notice.  They've had free run of reddit and it's time they moved on to shit up other forums like voat.

And of course, the objective is monetization. There is an underlying political dilemma. The admins walk a fine line: sanitization of a community in the service of ads and business interests, versus improving the quality of content in service of everyone who stands to benefit from reddit. And this line exists because the community is communities are the content. Despite the inarticulate, hypocritical comments in that thread appealing to ""free speach"", there remains in essence a fundamental conflict between liberal principles and how technology can both empower and curtail it, even simultaneously.

This is a business decision where Reddit is simply saying they are more interested in keeping the place friendly for new users than comfortable for old users. When people treat the specifics of the censorship I feel like they miss the bigger picture.   /r/creepshots wasn't about hatred and it was eliminated for the exact same reasons. If /r/pettytheft or /r/drunkfratsluts becomes the biggest subreddit on here, they'll delete that too. They're protecting the image of their brand and some people are just pissed because they thought no censorship was a part of that image.  Disliking something is completely understandable and justified but needing it forcibly removed for everyone because you don't like it is where outrage stems."

I guess what I'm saying is, it's not something I see as a new-user vs old-user conflict.  I don't like anything resembling censorship either, but it's entirely within a right of a private company to shut down a forum for a self-professed hate group, and I don't really disagree with their decision to do so."

Whether you tell your friends you use the site is only a secondary cause of concern. The first concern is that you're visiting regularly and engaging in the comments.   I guess what I'm saying is, it's not something I see as a new-user vs old-user conflict.   To clarify, it would be an existing-user versus prospective-user problem, not an old-user versus new-user problem. Think of it like Digg. They change their interface in an effort to entice new users and in doing that bothered their existing users enough to leave. Had they not changed, Digg might be a different place today.  If Reddit felt it was going to lose more users by doing this than it could gain in the future, it would have left the subs alone. I think they're right in this case, as they were with /r/creepshots but I can empathize with the outrage on a philosophical level.   it's entirely within a right of a private company to shut down a forum   Legally, of course they can do what they want.

Whether you tell your friends you use the site is only a secondary cause of concern. The first concern is that you're visiting regularly and engaging in the comments.   I suppose.  I mean, if I were running reddit, I hope I'd shoot for just-higher-than-almost-unbearable.  I think they actually mean well (more or less) and probably have a lot of censorship-vs-image debates internally that we've not privy to.  I feel that's likely why some of these decisions appear to come ""out of the blue"".   To clarify, it would be an existing-user versus prospective-user problem, not an old-user versus new-user problem. Think of it like Digg. They change their interface in an effort to entice new users and in doing that bothered their existing users enough to leave. Had they not changed, Digg might be a different place today. If Reddit felt it was going to lose more users by doing this than it could gain in the future, it would have left the subs alone. I think they're right in this case, as they were with /r/creepshots but I can empathize with the outrage on a philosophical level.   Again, we might actually be on the same page, but just to elaborate - I don't think it's even entirely about new or prospective users.  I just saw these links in another thread:   Thread 1: An open letter to all the fat fats who may be lurking here...    Thread 2: Drama in /r/progresspics when OP's pictures get crossposted to /r/fatpeoplehate.     Thread 3: /r/fatpeoplehate is mentioned in a video by youtuber Boogie2988. Brigade happens on a comment he made in the the sub yesterday about his face.    Thread 4: Big girl on r/unexpected is compared to a planet. Comments are apparently gatecrashed by redditors from r/fatpeoplehate .    Thread 5: Redditor from /r/sewing posts pictures of herself wearing her new dress. Someone cross-posted those pictures to FPH and a drama wave happen.    Thread 6: This is a thread where a FPH user celebrates his co-worker's death    7: /r/fitshionvsfatshion: an entire sub dedicated to bullying how fat people dress and showing how it ""should be done""    Thread 8: Here's a post where a FPH user posts a dead woman's photos to mock them    9: Here's a sub they made to make fun of fat people at weddings    10: Two users met over GTAV, one of them was fat! This led to /r/FPH brigading the sub.    Thread 11: FPH brigades /r/suicidewatch and tells a suicidal redditor to kill himself.     At a glance, I'd say it was all pretty definitively not healthy for existing or prospective users.   Legally, of course they can do what they want. I don't think anyone is arguing that point.   Well, not in this subreddit.  But if you're seen /r/LegalAdvice or /r/FreeSpeech today... ;)"
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,drswnemo,4,Thu Jun 11 00:12:20 2015 UTC,"The community management side of reddit has been poorly handled for a long time. The people who dealt directly with the community were not the people who seemed to be making policy decisions, and there were never enough community managers to answer user mails in a timely manner, if at all. Yishan caused a big shakeup in the reddit workplace. His insistence that all reddit employees be in the same office caused a lot of great people to leave the company, including veteran community manager cupcake1713. Then he left too, and reddit scrambled to find a new direction and a new CEO. (And a new head of community management).   Do we know this came from him? He was a spokesperson for the decision, and he said it was his, but imagine if it came from higher up from the people with a financial stake in Reddit.   The question is, what users? Who really is the reddit userbase? This whole time I've been talking as if it is the commenters. But most redditors lurk. The commenters were quite unhappy with the blog post, despite kn0thing saying he was acting on behalf of what usesr want. Is it the lurkers, (who make up the majority of the userbase anyway) he was pleasing? Is the dissent on reddit artificial because most people visiting the site don't read it, let alone participate in it?   I don't think you should spend 100% of your time catering to lurkers, because they are fickle, but I do think their views are worth considering. Once finances start to get involved (something I never have to worry about as a moderator), it makes even more sense. Losing users means losing advertising money.    Everything I've ever seen on fat people hate was hate directed at specific people. If there is even a threshold after which you can be blamed for being fat (i.e., standing in line at a fast food restaurant), FPH didn't meet it.  Just to make sure I'm not out of line here, I checked Archive.org.  http://web.archive.org/web/20150109113734/http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate  Here's a sample of what was submitted there, shifted through Rot-13:  Url, lbh sng shpx yhexref. Rire jbaqre jul lbh ner fb qrcerffrq?    Snggl pna'g uheqyr  uggc://vzthe.pbz/IJX3vrH  The second link is a concrete rebuttal to this idea that hate-apologists have: that they only make fun of people for making poor life choices, and none of the content on FPH was against exercising. (Similar to that ancient Reddit copypasta about doing 100 pushups.)    What's amazing about Reddit is that every announcement they make, good or bad, always comes across as out-of-touch and decided without evidence. Do they really have survey data or emails from lurkers that say FPH had to go? Couldn't they quote from them?  In other recent events, The Button fizzled out. Does anyone at Reddit have a plan? For any part of the site?  They could've thrown a recaptcha and a survey at every logged-in Reddit user, and had some good data for saying even registered users don't like FPH."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,Fletch71011,13,Thu Jun 11 03:49:58 2015 UTC,Most users don't care.
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,greytor,9,Thu Jun 11 04:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, these people think they're starting a mass exodus from reddit because they can brigade a bunch of threads to the top of r/all. But that isn't that hard to do. They still represent a tiny fraction of the userbase."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,__shoe__,3,Thu Jun 11 04:53:10 2015 UTC,Seriously. There will forever be a tiny fraction of redditors that continue to talk about this and act like the overall reddit culture and community is more important than it is. Meanwhile all of the subreddits that are based on more meaningful connections continue to provide value.
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,Jungle_Soraka,33,Thu Jun 11 05:25:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess the reason that it was banned was the relative size and visibility of the subs. I don't have the exact numbers, but it's probable that the reason /r/fatpeoplehate got banned was because it was getting too big for a hateful sub. While coontown and rapingwomen are equally, if not much more hateful than fatpeoplehate, I doubt that they have as large a subscriberbase or general knowledge from the rest of the Reddit public. I can't really think of a hateful sub that targeted a particular group that was larger than fatpeoplehate, so I doubt it was cherrypicked, but rather just the largest of the hateful subs.  Also, while I do not by any means agree with the people on SRS, they're not exactly a hateful sub; they're largely satire, and the ones who aren't are basically poking fun at what people on reddit say in general, rather than inciting hatred against a particular group. Sure, they might stand for the SJW movement, but they're not against a specific group, per se, other than people who don't agree with them. If SRS could be classified as a hateful sub, then by extension, so could /r/panichistory, /r/badhistory, /r/badpolitics, and so on.  On the actual matter, I think it's fine. Of course the majority of the people are going to whinge about their freeze peaches and the SJW-totalitarian cabal that Ellen Pao is part of trying to bring down the top minds of reddit, but in all honesty, I really don't think this is bad for reddit, nor is it ""the day that reddit started to decline"", as so momentously told by some commentor on /r/announcements. It's ridiculous to think that proper moderation to remove hateful subs is part of some larger conspiracy to suppress non-SJW views.  It's true that Yishan Wong said ""We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it."" The thing is, he's not part of reddit anymore, and the time that he said that was long ago, when reddit wasn't as large as it is now. It's perfectly reasonable to adapt as you grow, and reddit has grown considerably. To appeal to a larger audience, moderating and removing hateful subs is just what's going to happen when a website like reddit gets this large.  The cries of doom, censorship, and purging are ridiculous. Reddit still stands for free speech, much like the 1st amendment of the American constitution guarantees free speech for Americans. However, as America grew, we eventually adopted hate-speech laws and obscenity laws, much like how reddit's going to have to limit hateful content and subs. Is it active, malicious curbing of free speech? No. Is it purging? No. Is it censorship? I mean, by the strictest definition of censorship, sure, but then so is removing blatantly racist/hateful comments, or spam, or bots, and obviously most subreddits do that, just to keep up a generally positive atmosphere.  I mean, it's been in the reddit tos.   Do Not Incite Harm: You agree not to encourage harm against people.   And that's really what fatpeoplehate did. Of course, people are going to complain, and the conspiracists will continue to cry out their proclamations that Pao is part of some SJW cult and is trying to bring down the last bastion of freeze peach that is reddit, but I think reasonable people will see this as the reasonable moderation of a community as it grows.  TL;DR: Please stop panicking, removing a hateful sub to promote less hate isn't the end of the world."

I don't have the exact numbers, but it's probable that the reason /r/fatpeoplehate[1] got banned was because it was getting too big for a hateful sub.   The issue with that is that the obvious retaliation was going to be these posters creating new subs and taking over the front page. /r/all is filled with about 90% posts about FPH on the top 100. They control the entire top 25. Truly cutting the head off the hydra."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,staiano,14,Thu Jun 11 03:12:51 2015 UTC,"but it curbs the centralization of FPH and makes it more difficult for a new user of reddit or hater of fat people to find their echochamber.  it might not stop the amount of FPH users in total, but it can help prevent more growth  Edit: I made this comment before I had knowledge of the admins banning almost all reactionary FPH subs after the /r/announcement post"
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,drswnemo,10,Wed Jun 10 23:23:44 2015 UTC,"That, and we're only a few hours after the event happened. People will get bored and move on or, down the road, hide in the weeds and occasionally make edgy references to FPH in the already obnoxious defaults. The defense for r/jailbait was the same: Violentacrez kept all the pervs in one place so the admins didn't have to hunt them down. He and his subs are gone and while, yes, some similarly shady subs still exist, I don't think there's been a massive dissemination of pervs into the rest of reddit.   Another thing to consider is: What if, instead of fatpeoplehate, coontown was the super active sub hitting the frontpage all the time? If the admins banned it, would people be saying that we are only causing the racists to disperse into the wild, where, prior, they had a nice place to themselves and never bothered anyone else? (Also, I don't think a sub like coontown would ever get that large, anyway.) I guess it's possible, but I doubt it. The thing of it is, reddit does have a problem, in my opinion, with racists hiding in places like r/videos comments after a police shooting. But reddit does not have a sub the size of FPH dedicated to running around reddit and the internet in general saying bad things about minorities. I would rather neither FPH or coontown exist, but, in this situation, FPH seems the worse of the two. Moderator action could, conceivably, prevent r/videos' racism. But only the admins can solve the FPH problem.   If the situation was reversed, where coontown was banned and FPH still remained, I think the outrage (and weird hangwringing) would be far less. This is an issue of subreddit size and lack of stigma to harassing overweight people/anyone who dares call the bullies out.  It's sort of funny that people are throwing racist subs under the bus like, ""No, please, let us keep FPH, take away coontown instead!"""

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,Cruxius,10,Thu Jun 11 07:02:26 2015 UTC,"After seeing some admin replies in that thread, it would seem they aren't just banning a hateful subreddit for being hateful, it also has to be a hotbed of TOS violations. (And why the hell wouldn't they say something along those lines in the original post? Would have saved so much confusion). The banned subreddits definitely fit that bill. I believe the whole post was prompted by FPH organizing a giant raid on another site. It wasn't just that it was too big and visible, it kept brigading and harassing. If FPH had been merely distasteful, they might have left it alone"
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,Flower_Fairy,18,Wed Jun 10 22:36:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen a vast range of responses and speculation across the site as to why the admins have done this.  I haven't seen much speculation that the admins are being very direct and honest about why they've done this:   We're talking about men and women whose lives are being affected and worry for their safety every day, because people from a certain community on reddit have decided to actually threaten them, online and off, every day. When you've had to talk to as many victims of it as we have, you'd understand that a brigade from one subreddit to another is miles away from the harassment we don't want being generated on our site.   I'm appealing to Occam's razor. The admins are banning subreddits that are breeding grounds for harassment cases on par with shouting 'fire' in a movie theatre.   It's not ""harassment"" in a SJW sense, it's ""harrassment"" in a 'you can call the police for this' sense.  A significant subsection of reddit's userbase, which I like to call FSWs (free speech warriors), has leaped to the conclusion that this is a SJW takeover and is a policy centered around the former definition of harassment. The only evidence I've seen indicates that the admin policy only pertains to the latter definition.  I predict the threats to abandon the site for an alternative are hollow for the most part. The userbase will continue to grow and the site will maintain its reputation for being a space conducive to diverse, high-minded thought and opinion. As well as a place to look at stupid cat pictures, or whatever it is the majority of the traffic here gets out of it.  EDIT: The 'Occam's razor; mods told us why' theory on the subreddit bans also explains why other hateful subreddits are left untouched. Apparently they aren't linked to an overwhelming amount of legally significant harassment.  EDIT2: Someone has downvoted this post. Please explain your downvote if you choose to do so.  EDIT3: I'll correct myself, there's actually plenty of discussion across reddit acknowledging the reasons the admins gave."

Either way, the controversy isn't going to last. You're talking about a max of a few hundred thousand people in a site with millions of unique users. It just isn't going to matter much in the long run.   Not to mention the fact that the real consistent user base probably isn't experiencing much of this drama anyway. On my own front page, for instance, there isn't a mention of this. I had to get halfway down page 2 even to find this post."

That argument falls short since they also banned four very small subreddits, though the argument could be made that they banned those to make it look like the entire point of the exercise wasn't solely to ban /r/fph."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,bradygilg,23,Thu Jun 11 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"My guess is that one of the things that tipped things over the edge and made then realise they needed to revise subreddit policy was this recent post on /r/asktransgender. In addition /r/fatpeoplehate had already reached the point where it was drawing significant backlash outside the containment of the site.  I completely disagree that the admins are out of touch. This was a much needed change and will undoubtedly do a lot of good for the community of reddit, and being aware of what needs to be done to improve reddit is exactly what being in touch with the site should mean imo. I see this as an improvement over the way events were handled a few years ago when toxic elements of the site (jailbait) were not removed before they caused media controversy. In my view the admins are more in touch than they have ever been and potentially avoided another crisis with this move. You can argue whether this was motivated by selfish concerns to do with money or concern for the community, but it's largely irrelevant since it serves both.  I also find it very unlikely they don't understand why this was unpopular. I'm sure they anticipated the backlash of several hundred people wondering where their subreddit had gone. There will always be cries that the SJWs/SRS have control and no doubt many far right subs will use this example as proof of that to push their agenda. However the fact that both SRS and /r/coontown both still exist despite being politically polar opposites provides some reassurance that the banned subreddits were selected without political bias on the basis of being directly abusive."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,FSMLovesYou,10,Thu Jun 11 01:35:56 2015 UTC,"When stopscopiesme claimed the admins were out of touch, his or her frame of reference seemed to be the community i.e. the community at large does not want this type of moderation on their site whereas you seem to be arguing that this type of moderation is more ""in-touch"" with those outside of reddit (see your example of /r/jailbait's handling in response to outside pressures).  This disconnect is where you both are talking past each other.  You're arguing that this decision is good in regards to the fact that is removed unsavory or upsetting elements from the community, making it more palatable to a wider audience.  However, as I believe stopscopiesme is arguing, the objection to this move doesn't hinge on the merits of the case, per se, but rather the method by which /r/fatpeoplehate was removed.  It's removal by moderators is antithetical to what many redditors believe is the core mechanic of reddit's content-selection mechanism: voting.  Since the reason given for /r/fatpeoplehate's removal is solely its content, many self-deterministic redditors see this as heavy-handed moderation."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,dwmfives,2,Thu Jun 11 03:36:46 2015 UTC,"I tried to address the whole ""frame of reference"" thing at the bottom of my post. They are specifically out of touch with the commenter-type userbase. I can't know for sure what the lurkers want, because they don't talk"
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,hiyou102,3,Thu Jun 11 03:45:53 2015 UTC,"I was talking in terms of what I think seems likely to be best for the community (regardless of whether that conforms to wider society), as it's extremely difficult to talk about what the community wants. There's currently 20,000 comments on the annoncement thread. Even if they were all negative and all different people, yesterday reddit had 3,690,000 users logged in. Even bearing in mind that some will be more involved with the community than others, it would be absurd to draw conclusions from such a small (albeit very vocal) minority.  In addition, reddit has no obligation to be democratic and never has been. I think it's very well established by now that subreddit self-moderation alone only works while subreddits are very active in relation to their subscriber count (which generally only happens in quite small subreddits). Voting works fairly well as content sorting mechanism, but not as a selection mechanism. Unless there are moderators to remove content that doesn't meet the goal of the subreddit, every subreddit over a certain size becomes heavily biased towards low-effort, easy to digest junk content.  For example /r/Atheism used to be nothing but image macros, quotes set to images and similar while it was mostly unmoderated. For a long time it was widely considered a joke of a subreddit and an embarrassment. A couple of years ago it started being moderated more strictly causing massively controversy, huge community outcry and an exodus to /r/atheismrebooted (now dead). However I doubt anyone could claim that the current state of the sub isn't an improvement on how it was when it was unmoderated, thanks largely to the hard work of the mods. It's a common theme on reddit that anything perceived as ""heavy-handed moderation"" creates a massive outcry when it's suggested or announced, despite the fact that when it's going on in the background it's generally completely unnoticed and everything works much better and more smoothly.  Whether or not the removal of elements like /r/jailbait and /r/fatpeoplehate are for the best of the community in addition to ""making it more palatable to a wider audience"" is in part going to come down to how you think people should behave, it could be quite a long discussion. Speaking broadly though I don't see how they contribute anything of value, and I see a lot of potential for harm through encouraging abuse and disrespect for consent. Those are contrary to one of the persistent core values of reddit: Remember the human."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,V2Blast,4,Thu Jun 11 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"In your first paragraph, you touched on the voting paradox seen pretty often in elections where a plurality of vocal and active voters hold a disproportionate amount of sway in the outcome.  Most see this as patently absurd, as you obviously do, but there's something to be said about the relationship between how often and energetically one participates and how important their vote is (i.e. if one can't be bothered to participate in decision making, should their vote be valued as much as those who do?).  I'm not sure why you frame it as ""an obligation"" to be one way or another when the whole point of this discussion is determining what kind of reddit its users want it to be.  Some users want it to be more democratic and others want it to be more authoritarian.  You've then go on to make some good points about why you thing stricter moderation would benefit the site, but I'm not sure why you choose to do this since that discussion is one I haven't tried to and, frankly, don't want to get into.  In your last paragraph, you then go on to reiterate some of your points from your first comment which are, in summary, that the recent removals were nothing of value lost.

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,supergauntlet,3,Thu Jun 11 13:53:56 2015 UTC,"Censorship is an interesting topic. Everybody practices it, whether they'd like to admit it or not. Communists (of which I am one) actively censor anti-revolutionary and reactionary though. And why shouldn't they, when the stakes are so high in the framework of their world view? Capitalists do it to. You will rarely see a business leader who is accepting of meaningful organization by workers with the purpose of enacting meaningful change for their own benefit. Governments do it so often that it's hardly worth mentioning.   The right to say something isn't equivalent to the right to be heard. Even if you're not directly being censored, the act of ignoring an opinion is still censorship. So, that quote ""I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"" is really pretty funny. The kinds of people who usually quote that are libertarians and conservatives of other persuasions. They're the first to censor the voices of communists, immigrants, workers, and minorities. They may not ban them outright, but there's no attention payed to them beyond the bat of the Pinkertons and the ridicule of forum trolls.  Social Justice Warriors do the same. They do not tolerate certain conservative lines of thought, and they certainly do not tolerate racists and bigots. Technically, the speech is allowed, but it is still censored.  And then communists. We recognize that no speech is free. Modern freedom of speech is dependent largely on the ability to be heard. Freedom of speech applies almost exclusively to those who are wealthy enough to own the means of speech: the press, the websites, media of every variety. Freedom of speech is owned by the few. People are free to talk, but the overwhelming power of corporate media censors their voice all too easily. You see it happen to conservative militias and the Occupy Wallstreet movement alike, and everything in between and beyond. Ellen Pao is no different.  So, as always comrades, the question is not about whether or not we have freedom.  The question is: freedom for who, to do what?"

Said extremist Right element makes statements which said extremist Left element thinks should be banned/deleted/censored/otherwise never allowed to see the light of day, because in the Left's own mind, a person is not responsible for their own emotions.  I'm probably what you would call a ""pissbaby,"" whatever that means.  I don't like the easily identifiable, Hitler-related form of fascism at all; but I honestly can't see how people like you are a whole lot better.  I also get the feeling that Hitler would probably smile at someone like you with approval; because in the end, his only real goal was the complete annihilation of any form of individual autonomy.  He explicitly stated that any ability on the part of anyone to make decisions which deviated from those made by the state, should be completely eliminated.  One of the greatest ironies I've noticed when comparing Reddit with 4chan, is that people who openly self-identify as neo-Nazis, are less likely to ever call for the removal of any form of expression, than people like yourself.  In the end, that has caused me to think very seriously, about just who the real fascists are."

This site has pretty much gone ""mainstream"" among visitors. At the same time we have big splinter groups of angry nerds. People who used to browse 4chan. People who fought for their right to say ""nigga"" since they were 14 and discovered that they may not fit in in real life, but online other people who seemed intelligent agreed with their ""entirely logical"" arguments. Arguing semantics and having the feeling of being ""in"" on ""not obvious information"" to the ""mainstream"" becomes their favorite thing.  These splinter groups comment way more compared to the ""new users"" who are mostly lurkers probably. Now every ""normal"" person who is not used to internet culture obviously finds it disgusting and abnormal to run around and casually call people ""Niggas"" and ""faggots"". For nettizens it's part of the culture. It's part of the stuff they identify with, that they fight for freedom of speech, for their right to not be silenced by the world, because they want to be able to talk about how unfair the world is. They think of absurd arguments why it's a slippery slope (""who judges if it's offensives"", when somebody calls somebody a ""nigga"" that's generally not the big thing that needs to be decided on).   In the recent years many many more people than they used to have become ""in touch"" with the Internet. The normal people are flooding in, and that's exactly what most people want. I'm embarrassed to call myself part of this site where disgusting filth like redpillers run around.   The admins can't go right out there and just do it, get rid of all the bs though. They are causing a big enough riot by getting rid of all the shit step by step. And it's playing it safe, they don't want ""do a  dig"". Sooner or later it's all gonna be gone though and the kids and uneducated will move on to ""greener pastures"" unknown to the ""casuals"".  edit: some spellin mistakes"

TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,Lilusa,3,Wed Jun 10 21:48:57 2015 UTC,"I first created a reddit account in May 2006. Since that time few days have passed when I did not scroll through at least the first 10 pages of the front page and write at least a comment or two.  In the time I've lurked at and commented on reddit I've seen a lot of changes, most of them for the better. We now have subreddits (and a lot of them!) and personalised front pages. We can save comments. There are useful bots everywhere.  The community used to be pretty tiny. (I'd see the same brilliant users commenting in all the big subs.) Reddit used to be almost underground. Now it's in the mainstream. It has a huge number of members and a lot of traffic.  Virtually the whole time I've been on reddit, redditors have been complaining that reddit isn't what it used to be, that the Golden Age is over, and that the future is bleak. Until the last week, I maintained an optimistic outlook and took these nostalgic and often seemingly apocalyptic sentiments with a grain of salt.  But now, for the first time, I think that it is true. There were forewarnings, now clear in 20/20 hindsight (for example, in the treatment of /u/violentacrez and in the fappening incident), that reddit was indeed fundamentally changing, and for the worse. The things that have happened in recent times would have been inconceivable on the reddit I joined so many years ago.  Reddit's managers have the prerogative to run their business as they wish; but, if they continue as they currently are, they will lose their user-activity. They will make 4chan appealing.  Reddit stands at a crossroads. It can continue down its current path and become an irrelevant, expensive, failing business unit of Conde Naste, or it can somehow try to rescue itself. What that would entail I do not know, but reddit has a cancer that must be excised, and with wide margins."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,RunDNA,2,Wed Jun 10 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"I think that banning /r/fatpeoplehate and the like but not SRS, coontown etc was a bad idea because without banning any of them they can tell people they're ""facilitating free speech"" or something but now they have to answer to why other harassment subs exist."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,dirething,8,Thu Jun 11 10:41:47 2015 UTC,"coontown and SRS stay in their own little bubbles generally.  Neither sub had the size of fph, and fph was the only one to attack people off site (they had posts attacking imgur mods).    Also, equating SRS and coontown is hilariously stupid."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,brzcory,6,Thu Jun 11 01:40:20 2015 UTC,"SRS is a bummer, but I just haven't seen them engaged in organized hate. They aren't pming users to tell them how disgusting they are, and how they should be killed or their families should be killed. They may make some critical comments, mean even, but not depersonalizing. They aren't actively seeking to portray any group or individual as less than human, and I think that's an important distinction to between them and FPH.   I was subscribed for a little while, but I realized that everything I saw there made me feel a little outraged and a little disgusted. Reddit is already this incredible tool for combing the internet and finding content, and then SRS picks through that to find the worst of the worst to look at it and talk about it. I have no problem with that being a thing, it's just not my thing."
TheoryOfReddit,39ch1c,calf,2,Thu Jun 11 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"I can understand that.

TheoryOfReddit,39dif6,OtakuOlga,43,Thu Jun 11 02:08:30 2015 UTC,"This is one of the biggest days in Reddit history, not just one subreddit. It is about the shift in policy Reddit has taken as indicated by the announcement post. It should be discussed here. For example /r/fatpeoplehate3 was banned for 'ban evasion' which I posted about here but got banned for. This will probably mean that any sub mimicking fatpeoplehate in the future will continue to be banned. Has this rule been used before? It draws doubt into the justification for the banning of the original ban of /r/fatpeople hate due to it targeting and harrassing individuals, which is why other hateful subs such as /r/coontown allegedly didn't get banned.  /u/Sporkicide on such other subs:   We haven’t banned it because that subreddit hasn’t had the recent ongoing issues with harassment, either on-site or off-site. That’s the main difference between the subreddits that were banned and those that are being mentioned in the comments - they might be hateful or distasteful, but were not actively engaging in organized harassment of individuals. /r/shitredditsays does come up a lot in regard to brigading, although it’s usually not the only subreddit involved. We’re working on developing better solutions for the brigading problem.   https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs23hqk?context=2  /u/ekjp:    We're banning behavior, not ideas. While we don't agree with the content of the subreddit, we don't have reports of it harassing individuals.   https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs21aj4?context=3  What do you think? Should 'Fat people hate' be given another chance? What will the effects of this be? I have a feeling this is going to be as close to a war we are going to get on Reddit. Maybe people will go to another forum, unite there and launch hate-filled attacks here? The possible ramifications of this are huge."
TheoryOfReddit,39dif6,Ad__Hominem,52,Thu Jun 11 01:11:09 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not a new game changing action. They do this whenever stuff gets banned. Don't you remember when /r/niggers was banned? They started playing whack-a-mole with /r/niggers reincarnation subs until the community was trounced. The thing was /r/niggers was too small to be able to hijack subs and take over /r/all.  Do you think  the /r/niggers users just disappeared? No. They kept getting banned and their attempts at rebooting banned because they were evading a ban and not reforming the behaviour that got them banned.  If the /r/fatpeoplehate users reformed and didn't make a new sub and immediately put up a picture of the imgur employees in the header then maybe they wouldn't get banned so quickly. I mean that is stupidity, that is flaunting that they are evading the ban. In addition to calling for vote manipulation and raiding subs like /r/punchablefaces which has basically been taken over and  the raiding of /r/pics and the ongoing harassment of Ellen Pao in the form of subs called /r/ellenpaosucks e.t.c and /r/EllenIsKillingReddit  The /r/niggers users don't brigade nearly as much and settled in other subreddits like /r/polistan, /r/whiterights, /r/whitebeauty.. Whatever and so on and other chimpire subreddits.  The key is to restart the community and keep it low profile and reform the behaviour. The admins know that they can't get rid of these people. But they will keep ban hammering them until they stop this activity.  The way they are calling for a ""revolution"", vote manipulation and for people to ""ruin the site"" is begging to be banned.  Yes the issue is that /r/fatpeoplehate was containment and now these guys are more enraged and passionate in brigading but at the same time the reason the sub was banned was because they were already way over the top with their brigading.  These people definitely aren't all going to leave. What is going to happen is eventually a /r/fatpeoplehate substitute will be created, the people who manage to calm down won't be banned and the /r/fatpeoplehate substitute that is toned down and isn't harassing or brigading will have to have strict rule enforcement by the moderators. That will ensure the admins don't whack it. At the moment all the reincarnations are reoffending.  And that will be that.  This will go exactly the way of /r/niggers. They stated they want to get rid of the behaviour and this is the way. Nuke them to shit until the only thing left is a reformed community. And that is why /r/cutefemalecorpses and /r/spacedicks and whatever and so forth are reprehensible but not banned. Because they are not harassing and massively brigading. When fatpeoplehate reforms as a new community that no longer does this, it will be the exact timeline of /r/niggers and the admins will let it be.  There is a reason /r/fatlogic and /r/fatpeoplestories are not being banned, they are not blatantly and repeatedly making a concerted effort to break important rules for Reddit. It will create a containment sub that actually contains and isn't shitting all over reddit. At that point the admins will leave it alone as there will be no incentive to keep banning, it will be mission accomplished. They've done this before and it works in the long run."

I absolutely think that kind of thing (revenge-porn, even when it's not done with explicit malice) should be illegal, but I don't think it was at the time and I don't recall them using that as their justification.  In fact, looking through the blog announcements at the time, some of the text is highly ironic in the context of the new ""safer"" reddit...  http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html   ...we consider ourselves not just a company running a website where one can post links and discuss them, but the government of a new type of community. The role and responsibility of a government differs from that of a private corporation, in that it exercises restraint in the usage of its powers...  We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you - the user - has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so. When you know something is right, you should choose to do it. But as much as possible, we will not force you to do it.  You choose what to post. You choose what to read. You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce. We will try not to interfere - not because we don’t care, but because we care that you make your choices between right and wrong.  Virtuous behavior is only virtuous if it is not arrived at by compulsion. This is a central idea of the community we are trying to create.   This was only 9 months ago."

TheoryOfReddit,39dif6,MarshallBanana,2,Thu Jun 11 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"The DeCSS code was not as openly illegal as the Fappening pictures.  DeCSS was a legal grey area in which a corporation was attempting to censor people for pointing out a feature in their legally-owned products. The code itself might have been illegally obtained, but spreading it wasn't illegal, because it was simply a piece of code in a program you already owned.  In the Fappening, those pictures could only be obtained by committing a crime. Apple doesn't store nude pictures of Jennifer Lawrence in your phone."

We're talking addresses, IP's, names, phone numbers and bank accounts.   Like reddit is definitely not a single entity. The idea of letting a community decide 100% what they want is suicide almost. Look what happened with /r/jailbait? When you google reddit the first reference is to /r/jailbait.  Seriously reddit not free to do what they want and are willing to say   Well we didn't have any hand in it   Bull shit it happened on your site and on your watch. If they don't actively police the idiots on this site we'd be in a much worse state. The admins handled the FatPeopleHate drama should have been handled better by them. They knew SRS was going to be brought up and of course people didn't get the response they wanted. I don't honestly believe SRS has as much of an impact compared to Subreddit Drama who are larger and more ""main stream"" now. Whatever SRS did in the past I sincerely doubt they have as big of an impact as people say. It's becoming the ""cop-out"" response for a lot of people  and while I hate that they don't enforce NP...NP is the biggest fucking joke.  reddit needs to put their foot down when the site does stupid shit. This could be them preemptively stopping FPH from finding someone in that photo and harassing them to the point of suicide."
TheoryOfReddit,39e6ob,picflute,2,Thu Jun 11 06:52:28 2015 UTC,"Right but consensus here was limited to whether a sub should exist. While the Boston bombing, doxxing, power moderators and the lol threats are all valid examples of community consensus gone awry, they additionally violate some sort of IRL law and can be susceptible to legal action. Whether that is handled correctly or not isn't of Reddit's concern at the moment, but evidently their decision to limit certain subs existence might address that.   Are you agreeing with me then, that Reddit as a company has the authority to do whatever it pleases? On some level the concerned redditors have a point, but it isn't as though this is the government who can routinely self-check it's conduct. As a company my understanding is that reddit can pretty much make its own management decisions.   I think the problem is that in choosing to mimic a democratic environment people are now concerned when their behavior is being curtailed. But users on this site aren't really guaranteed anything."
TheoryOfReddit,394ko2,groceryheist,33,Tue Jun 9 05:29:19 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced (but have no proof) that in the default and larger subs, people actually go through /new/ just after they've posted something themselves and downvote the competition to give themselves a head start too.  This is based purely on my own experience of having posted, say, a two minute video to /r/videos only for it to be in negative votes five seconds later ie. people voting without viewing.  It would be hard to 'catch' but it would be interesting, following a major news event to see if there is competition between major news websites to get their article the one that ends up at the top and with the most discussion/clicks by upvoting their own/downvoting others'."

TheoryOfReddit,394ko2,SloppySynapses,2,Tue Jun 9 18:10:23 2015 UTC,"Fuzzing doesn't really kick in when you have a score of only 1. It happens in defaults mostly, InUrFrdge is correct. I see it when I go through the unmoderated queue. On one defaults with a high frequency of posts there sometimes is one post with 1 or 2 upvotes among 4 or 5 with a score of 0. It's on /r/Futurology and it's not just people looking for karma but also people trying to get traffic to their site. It's often a first indicator of SEO spamming and many times our suspicions have turned out to be true. Looking at none defaults with a high frequency of posts but where people aren't out to reap karma or page views (like /r/NoStupidQuestions) only irrelevant posts and trolling seem to get downvoted."

That's a pretty bold statement to make without saying anything about why you believe that. I disagree. Mods are responsible for their communities. Moderators need tools to not only grow their communities, but manage them as well.   giving mods better access to administrators with the singular job of ferreting out this kind of assholery in my opinion might be.   I think reddit is too large for that. That would require hiring people on to deal with that kind of stuff and even though they already have communities managers, they do very little 'managing' in my opinion. They're basically mythical ghosts you hear about from 3rd hand reports and are reasonably sure they don't exist.  Reddit outsourced the job of curating content to moderators. It's free labor. They'd be better off outsourcing community management to the moderators as well, since mods are already doing that. They're doing it with both hands tied behind their backs, but that doesn't change the fact that they still have to do it."

That would require hiring people on to deal with that kind of stuff and even though they already have communities managers, they do very little 'managing' in my opinion. They're basically mythical ghosts you hear about from 3rd hand reports and are reasonably sure they don't exist.   That's exactly what reddit needs to do. And we're not really talking about curating here (unless we're talking about two different things here). We're merely talking about janitorial work still, protecting reddit from spam and obvious malicious manipulation. It's not giving subreddits a direction by enforcing what is posted and what is talked about in the comments (which is what I'd call curation), it's only enabling those things to happen organically.  But even throwing community managers at it won't solve the problem entirely. Sooner or later reddit needs better tools to manage brigading, vote manipulation and spam more effectively. But given that there are only three (official) community managers currently hiring more people is a good start."

Whenever you ask people to choose what they are interested in or other similar choices, people suddenly have big insecurities. They start to wonder what they will miss if they only choose a couple of things. They wonder how they will get it back. They wonder what exactly these choices mean.  This is why a lot of sites have language like ""you can always change this later"" to help ease your insecurities.   Another thing is familiarity. People who lurk logged out and then sign in still want the same reddit. They most likely made an account to comment on something. If you take them from what they know and what they were using when they decided to sign up and change it, all they are going to do is become confused, frustrated, and log out to get the experience they were enjoying previously.   Anyways, I would not be surprised if this is implemented soon.  While reddit in the last few months has taken leaps and bounds to web 2.0, it's userbase still prefers things simple. Those fucking animations on reddit mobile. The fucking welcome message you get when you make a new account now. The fucking newsletter and A/B tested language.

For every ""Ban all the vile subs"", there's a ""No more censorship"" response.  Tough line to walk as an admin.  Any action you take is going to piss off a huge percentage of the site.  This is evident in any /r/blog post from the last 6 months.  For me, I'd like to see all public votes and karma hidden from the site.  I've been running a Stylish script for about 6 months that does this, and I find the site is much better this way.  It's a lot easier to ignore the bias of jumping on the bandwagon and letting votes inform me of which comments are ""good"".  I have to actually read them and decide for myself.  What a concept.  Removing public votes would reduce ""gamification"" and that may turn some people off.  That's okay.  If somebody is posting just to increment their internet points, then it's probably not high-quality content anyway.  But that's just me.

While upvotes are great validation of your content, and it's very satisfying to watch something you've made top the charts of a subreddit... capping upvotes would have no reason to piss off creators.     First, the community's value of your content is derived precisely from those individual scores and rankings of what you make rather than some overarching counter on your account page. There is no point in using the context-lacking overall number to gauge OC because there will always be people like GallowBoob who have 10000x your score without ever creating a single thing.  And second, related to the latter half of the first point: the people with tons of karma who would get 'pissed off' by such a rule are almost never content creators in their own right, instead submitting OC from across the web that they have discovered (or, more cynically, reposting old successful content and spamming whatever they find on the front of imgur)."

There are definitely people that put the points themselves on too high of a pedestal, only going for low effort/high karma reward type comments/submissions. But you have to remember behind every 'internet point' there's a real person. It can be a nice little confirmation that there is indeed an audience, and it's always nice to think someone liked something you posted. Both of those can be just as much of a motivator for good contributions as the abstract internet point accumulation can be for bad.  I really like how most other social media makes it really clear that actual people are behind these likes/upvotes/etc. On reddit, they're often just called some variation of ""imaginary internet points"" but on Facebook, Quora, etc. you have a list of (user)names backing each one up, showing their actual value. I think having to attach your name to something also makes people more selective with their upvotes.  Don't get me wrong, there'd still be issues with people karmawhoring for no other point than to karmawhore, but I think it would make an overall positive difference to humanize the vote system more."

It's based on good intentions, I know, but it encourages and supports awful, destructive behaviors on the site whether it means to or not. It is one of the worst rules on the site, and they need to find a better way to deal with it that accepts the modern reality of how most redditors operate, especially the communities that live and thrive outside the default ghettos. Many people don't even post links. Would you have them post 10 kittens to /r/aww for every actual article of their own they want to share? Is that what we want the site to be?

TheoryOfReddit,38ud10,jaxspider,46,Sun Jun 7 05:45:04 2015 UTC,"I'd get rid of shadowbanning. Its an immature, obsolete and ineffective method of culling spammers. Now it only shadowbans people who don't know reddit's reddiquette. Then mods have to tell the user to contact an admin. The reason shadowbanning doesn't work is because spammers just make or buy hundreds / thousands of user accounts daily. Its become a game of attrition between the admins and spammers. As much as I don't want it myself, we need a harder method to make a username. And to prevent the creation of a new username from the same IP address for atleast 24 hours if not longer. Stop, the ability for one redditor to ban a user over all the subreddits that one particular redditor mods. Its reckless and is unaccountable currently. Presently the admins, instead of fixing this problem, just disabled the ban message users get when banned from 200~400 subreddits for no reason. Centerize all the admin related subreddits. There are just too many. Each with its own purpose but no hub to keep track of all that information. Too many times I miss something because its post in one sub, but not even mentioned in another.  Get rid of /r/pics, /r/videos, /r/gifs, /r/funny. These first generation subreddits have served their purpose well. And now they need to be laid down to rest along with /r/reddit. These subreddits have no theme except the format in which you view their content. These are the subreddits 99% trash posts show up in. These are the subreddits that are ruining reddit as a whole. This is a long stretch so I put it second last. I'd promote HTML5 over gifs. Too many reddits browse on the toilet / on their smart phone. If reddit pushed HTML5 think of the millions of redditors who's saved gigs of bandwidth. Not only would we save users tons of money but we'd advance a primitive format. That'd be a win-win in my book. The following idea could be considered blasphemous so sit down before you read it. So here goes, I'd remove the numbers from the karma score completely. I'd keep the up/down vote. But make it impossible to see how much karma score one already has, made from making a post, got from writing a comment etc etc. Just remove the number system completely. Instead of numbers, I'd put in a percentage or ""quality score"".   Basically switch from a numeric system where people post to make the most karma, to seeing if people who viewed your content liked it or hated it overall. And then average everything you've said and posted for one overall percentage quality score. So instead of users spamming shit posts, they'd strive to find quality posts that users would like as a majority. We know that if your posts gets around 2000~5000 upvotes it will hit the front page. Even though it could have 1000~3000 downvotes. Now with my method, that wouldn't matter. You'd need to get your posts with the highest percentage to reach the frontpage. Basically... only posts with 90+% upvoted posts."

Remember when reddit randomly removed them about a year ago, and everyone was screaming about how terrible an idea it was? Knowing whether your post has a score of 1 because only 1 person upvoted it, versus it having 1001 upvotes and 1000 down votes is really fucking important, especially for smaller subs. Reddit really fucked that one up.  I'd also create the ability to distinguish bots and humans... And take away the ability of bots to vote or submit content. All they can do is read, and reply to comments."

Right here is the exception to the rule that the meta subs are worthless cesspits. Return vote counts, ideally make them accurate. Publish concrete rules for what's allowable and what's not, none of this wishy-washy values nonsense.    These rules would be subject to community input every so often. Massively unpopular rules will be dropped. This includes concrete criterion for what gets you site banned  Clarify the rules on vote brigading Shadowbans go back to their original purpose of being for spammers and spammers only.   The count of these bans is public, and the identities of the banned accounts will be published after a sufficient amount of time has passed (months/years)  Institute a sitewide transparency program   Site bans are now publicly recorded (Who's banned, who enacted it, when, and why) Each subreddit has a public modlog Anonymous moderator accounts (an account used by someone for the sole purpose of moderating a subreddit) are no longer allowed New one account per human per lifetime rule   Throwaway accounts are allowed but must be explicitly flagged as such, use an auto generated numeric/GUID name, and such accounts are heavily restricted in certain ways by default (posts automatically filtered so they must be approved, votes don't count). Users can toggle an option to hide posts by these users by default. Bot accounts must be explicitly flagged as such, users can toggle an option to hide all bot comments by default  CSS tricks that tamper with the voting buttons are no longer allowed. This includes hiding, reversing, or otherwise impeding the ability to vote on a post A new tab in user preferences is provided that shows you top referrer tags for your userpage and posts within modded subreddits. These stats include whether a vote was made, allowing for more easy detection of brigading behavior. (I.e. people referred by /r/somereddit influenced the score by X)  Being banned from a subreddit means you can no longer vote on its contents Institute an opt-in feature where subreddits can force a comment to be left with downvotes Upvotes/downvotes become more like mod points on slashdot - basically there are pre-selected reasons you can click for votes (Upvote? Insightful/funny/etc, downvote, troll/incorrect/disagree/etc). You can filter by these (maybe you want to see things that were upvoted for being insightful, but not for being funny) Subreddits gain more direct control over the post weighting algorithm (how much negative weight is applied to old posts, etc) The RES tagging feature becomes a sitewide thing provided by Reddit itself Reaffirm the site's commitment to free speech Built in PGP verification for private messages Threshold (number of points below which you don't see comments) is turned off by default for new users and non logged in users.    Hidden posts tie into the upvote/downvote system changes mentioned above - by default, hide posts that are modded down for spam and off topic, but not for disagreement  Stop pretending that downvotes are not for disagreement - they're used more for disagreement than for any other purpose. Vote buttons are no longer usable, at all, from userpages. Userpages can be customized in a limited way (perhaps using markdown or similar) One user cannot moderate more than a (low) set number of subreddits Default subreddits are subject to special rules that others are not:   All mod decisions can be appealed and appeals must be handled forthrightly. Appeals can be made to the admins if someone feels that this is not happening. Meta posts are not allowed (top level links/selfposts - comments are fine) A mod of a default subreddit may not mod any other subreddit Mods are chosen democratically (kind of like how Stack Exchange does it), and can be recalled democratically if the community feels they're behaving badly The community of a default sub can vote to make the sub not default, if they feel that it degrades the community If the owners of a sub do not wish to come under these special rules, they can opt out of becoming a default  Democratic userbase splits become a thing.    Any user can propose a ""split"" vote inside a subreddit. This is an exception to the ""no meta"" rule, and such a post cannot be deleted or tampered with by moderators. A user can vote up or down a ""split"" poll post. If a supermajority of a subreddit's user base votes the post up vs down, a new subreddit is created as a clone of the existing one (down to the CSS), the guy who started the vote becomes the first moderator, and users that voted the post up are automatically unsubscribed from the original subreddit and subscribed to the new one.  This allows people who disagree with the way a non-default subreddit is being operated to make a clean break.  To prevent flooding, a split post cannot be made more than once a month.    The theme I'm going for here is basically ""Transparency is essential, community is essential, openness is the default mode of operation"""

This would (of course) even include making that karma requirement so implausibly high that no one can ever downvote. If that's how you want to run your sub, sall good by me. Add a step to user registration: Choosing one or more subscription sets. You want cool pictures? Sure, get the subscription set for images. it includes /r/pics, /r/earthporn, /r/oldschoolcool, and a few others. You want news? get the subscription set for news and current events. It includes /r/news, /r/worldnews, /r/politics, and more. Get about 10 or so different categories.

TheoryOfReddit,38ud10,GodOfAtheism,2,Sun Jun 7 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"I would rename the whole SFW ""Porn"" network with a more suitable name which isn't awkward to explain to non-reddit people I would encourage the mods not to censor content but to put some kind of flair next to posts and comments which they think is dull explaining why they think so. This would apply especially for things that respect the rules but that disappoint the mods concerning the content's quality. Some subreddits already do that with the ""Misleading Title"" flair and that's great, this should generalized. I would take into account the nature of the content a link points to for the ranking algorithm. For example, pictures are consumed way faster that long articles and thus win more karma by unit of time. For this reason, if you subscribe to 2 subreddits with the same popularity and traffic, one which links to images, the other which links to articles, you will end up with more images than articles on your front page."
TheoryOfReddit,38ud10,beargolden,2,Sun Jun 7 02:16:35 2015 UTC,"I will be the first to admit that I don't know a whole lot of anything about web development so I can't really say much about how reddit itself is run in terms of coding and such.   With that being said, the changes I would institute would be more about conduct rules than anything else. The big focus would be reducing the trolling that has become all too common just about everywhere on the internet. It is worth noting however that I would not do this without community involvement.   Here are the steps I would take.  1.) I would open up a discussion on a variety of subreddits (including meta ones like /r/TheoryOfReddit) where the goal would be to determine what trolling actually is and how to codify rules around that definition. This may also involve some surveys but it may not be really needed.  2.) Once the definition of trolling can be agreed upon, I would organize perhaps twenty or thirty ""task forces"" consisting of carefully selected (based on prior behavior on reddit, some sort of vote in certain subreddits, and perhaps a interview process) users. These ""task forces"" would be made available to subreddit moderators who wish to make use of their services.   When a subreddit moderator decides to make use of a ""task force"", they would come in and observe quietly.   3.) When a user account is identified as being nothing more than a troll account, that specific username would be banned from that specific subreddit forever. On top of that, the user would also lose the ability to create alternate accounts for perhaps six months. This would prevent them from just coming back with different usernames over and over again.  These task forces would be constantly evaluated and there would be a feedback system in place if users feel that task force members are abusing their power. A evaluation process would then begin (probably without the user's knowledge) to see if these accusations are actually true and if so, that person would be removed from the ""task force"" permanently.  Now, I don't know if someone can be permanently banned from reddit entirely. It's difficult when a user can just create a account with another email address or something but perhaps the goal is really to just make trolling entirely not worth the trouble. Bans would keep happening until the user just gives up (one can only really muster the will to make so many email addresses or whatever).  The other thing I would do is set up a report function that will automatically hide (but not entirely remove) a post if a (moderator set) amount of reports are made against it. This would help quickly hide troll account posts quickly so that they don't get the satisfaction that they desire. A moderator could then take a look at the post and determine if it is actually breaking the rules or if it is a abuse of the report function.  To be clear, this is really about troll accounts. We have all seen a ton of them and they are really not helping anything. I don't really even think that one can find a compelling reason to call them ""protected speech"" since they are not really part of any conversation. Removing them (or at least taking a active position against them) will only improve the flow of discourse on reddit and generally improve the ""neighborhood"" (as it were)."
TheoryOfReddit,38ud10,LeonardoDeQuirm,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'd probably restrain the power of the moderators to ease the hearts of those on /r/undelete. The greatest 'threat' of Reddit right now is www.voat.co, with users apparently primarily moving there either because of censorship and, which is my second change, quality. Currently there is a natural drive towards meme-like posts which estranges users in mostly the larger subs towards either for example TrueSubreddits which have strict rules or to voat.   To keep these few leavers here, but far more importantly because I value quality myself, I'd allow for people vote based on categories that allow for different versions of a thread for different users. This would mean having the ability for users to upvote and by double-clicking select the reason why they upvoted (quality, funny etc.) after which the thread can be sorted through this categories."

Also keep in mind that empathy isn't really biologically likely in that age group. The prefrontal cortex isn't developed yet, and you're seeing the loud opinions of people who aren't capable of seeing the world outside of their own experience, and not capable of understanding that they aren't capable.

The default front page is, I assume, the basis on which most new users decide to regularly browse reddit and create an account, so what's on the front page serves as a filtering mechanism for who joins the site. For example, I imagine that a lot of religious people were put off of reddit when /r/atheism was a default, so reddit has an absurdly high percentage of users that are atheists - I feel like the number of religious users has grown since /r/atheism was taken off the default list, which would further reinforce my point but I don't know if it's true. The submissions and comment sections of a lot of default subreddits have been full of at least slightly racist/sexist/etc content for a while. This content filters out some users, those bothered by racism and sexism, and allows people with similar but more extreme views to feel comfortable and join. As the number of people with toxic views grows, the toxicity rises closer and closer to the top of subreddits and comment sections while opposing views are downvoted out of sight. This reinforces the filtering mechanism and users grow more and more toxic until you have reddit as it is now - full of people that appear bothered by the idea of social justice."

TheoryOfReddit,38tc94,bobcat,3,Fri Jun 12 10:43:51 2015 UTC,I think the problem is that MRA and anti-SJW types totally dismiss an entire ideology. It comes down to that you can't even believe a set of things are true or they downvote you no questions asked. It isn't a discussion to them because they fundamentally disbelieve in the existence of sexism.

I'm not making this comment to debate just to explain why some do rejected SJW ideology as a whole.  The disagreement is less whether there is sexism and more what sexism is (for example is part of the wage gap due to women's in general avoiding hazardous work, caring more about work life balance over ambition and how much of the general differences in various things are due to the prevelance of biological traits between the sexes, or is it due to systematic oppression and socialization if so to what degree ), add in the often well intentioned pro censorship sentiment of many SJWs,  and how that goes against the principle of freedom of speech as a positive unto itself, this will cause some people to see it as fundamentally a negative.   Second MRAs do mostly believe sexism exists, and it encompasses a wide variety of things from extreme MRAs to people who think that things like custody battles are unfair to men too often. A person could easily hold both feminist and MRA beliefs by pointing out there are specific things each group is disadvantaged in.  The problem with the down votes is people see voting as not rewarding quality but instead rewarding anyone who shares their moral world view. I'll up vote an SJW comment that I couldn't disagree with more if it has thought put into it."

TheoryOfReddit,38tc94,rosecenter,2,Sun Jun 7 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"MRA, feminism and SJW has also changed massively in the past 10-15 years to where I barely recognize it. 10 years ago I lurked on feminist, SJW and libertarian sites, and there was common cause between the various sorts of activists.   We were all into individual rights. The right to be treated as equal regardless of our gender, sexuality or race. Open borders and free trade. As well as the right to bear arms and smoke pot. MRAs were also different, they were mostly into the PUA thing and meeting foreign women.   That was what SJW was originally about. It was an extension of liberalism / libertarianism and democracy and giving a voice to those previously unheard."

I do sincerely try to engage with other people; a few times on reddit I've made people reconsider their opinions and it's extremely satisfying.  I will never be able to satisfy the above to you, so let us leave it at that.  What's surprising to me, and what prompted this thread, is the sheer level of vitriol and apparent frequency these comments have reached on reddit.  Ideas need armies, and the level of organization behind MRA ideology on this site has reached a certain tipping point where (the following is hyperbole) it feels like everything that to the left of ""women should be kept barefoot and pregnant"" is shouted down."
TheoryOfReddit,38tc94,NotJIm99,3,Mon Jun 8 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"Point, and I'm going to preface this by saying I don't self-identify as an MRA: MRA ideology =/= anti-feminism. There's a huge degree of overlap, don't get me wrong, but at its base MRA is a logical concept. Some parts of society are screwed up and biased, and it's totally cool to fight for equality where that's concerned too. Might just be the egalitarian in me, but I feel like it's probably a great idea to fight injustice in all of it's forms. Even when it effects the majority. That's what justice is, it's not selective. To quote the old trope: It's blind.  The shit you're seeing isn't MRA ideology, it's anti-feminism. There's nothing inherent in the basic idea of men's rights that disagrees whatsoever with also being a feminist. There are, however, a lot of people who feel like the only way to get these rights is by attacking other people.  I'm sure I don't have to point out how this isn't a trait exclusive to the men's rights movement.  I guess the tl;dr here is that I'm very proud of my Norse heritage. I'm not, however, a racist. There's a degree of difference between being proud of/fighting for who you are, and using that identity to preach hate or attack other people."

Much of the backlash (typical of reddit) is US-centric, revolving around popular cases and laws that apply only in the US. Try reading up on the Duluth Model where, in domestic disturbance cases, the police are required to arrest at least one person. That one person is a man in the overwhelming majority of cases. Check out the statistics on domestic violence. Men are the victim about as often as women, but there are almost no studies on it, no shelters for men, no resources for them, and the courts don't treat them with the same seriousness, to say nothing of the court of public opinion. Look up the whole #notallmen and #yesallmen drama, where people argued on twitter and elsewhere that treating all men like convicted rapists was justified because a few of them are. Plug some keywords out of any sentence up there and get a cursory understanding and you'll probably understand pretty quick.

They're arguments, not necessarily fact. The lower pay one is especially ridiculous, it's already illegal to discriminate based on gender. What are people who say that actually seeking? When Obama says it he wants more female voters, which usually happen to be Democrats. When Hillary says it, it's the same thing. When people who say they experience it personally say it, what are they looking for? A law that says it should be equal? We already have that. A law that says they should be paid more across the board?   Furthermore if women were systematically paid less, why wouldn't companies hire only women if they're paid at such a discount to men and similarly qualified while being the same for productivity?    So, I'm just not threatened by the other side?   It sounds like you haven't been impacted by it. Which is how I felt. Until a friend of mine in college was falsely accused of sexual assault by a deeply troubled woman. And the academic activists bought it! The university dismissed him, despite the police opening an investigation into the woman who made the complain for fraud and never even arresting him for a crime.   I started observing more and more situations like that and lapses in justice. Brian Banks. UVA. Emma the matress girl. Duke. Hofstra.

I'm quite interested in how memes spread, and the manner in which this one has succeeded is interesting.   Why are you reducing it to a meme? There are plenty of valid arguments.   You can't minimize and brush aside what people are saying and then genuinely assert that you are curious why people hold certain beliefs.

The optimistic view would be the comparison (of some views) to life: existence that is defined / enhanced by the people that exist within the ""experiment."" The pessimistic view would be that Reddit can take something and run it to the ground, revive it, and then beat the horse dead again.  E.g. factions, inter-faction ""wars,"" the ""religions.""  The simplistic view: people can take a seemingly two choice system (push or not push) and expand it in to so much more. Societal view: People group together with those most similar to them (pushers, flairs, etc.) and potentially shun / judge those that are different.  Arguably the data from here would be interesting to study from a sociological perspective.     Was there even a goal to the experiment?   Most likely to create something so, perhaps, mundane (a countdown timer that resets when you push it) and see what Reddit makes of it.  What the admins expected from the Reddit population, no idea.  Nor am I sure what their estimate for an ""end-time"" was when they started the experiment.  Was 2 months way longer than dreamed? Shorter? Or did any early tests within the admin office extrapolate that this would be the expected end date?"
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,soccernamlak,123,Sat Jun 6 00:50:45 2015 UTC,Reddit proved to its advertisers that it has a lot of active unique users capable of maintaining this cycle of presses for two months
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,Linmark,60,Sat Jun 6 03:57:54 2015 UTC,"Very true. It also shows, one of the most cynical populations of internet users are more than willing to invest a ridiculous amount of time and energy into a marketing construct when they feel like they are personally, subjectively incentivized to participate. The button will probably go down in history as one of the more exemplary viral media campaigns of this generation of web natives."
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,vmcreative,28,Sat Jun 6 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"Ehh I don't know. Were they really marketing anything if it was just pressing a button? I can't see Reddit users making a big deal out of the button if it had made someone money. People were willing to create so much out of it because it was so inane. If it had been some bullshit like ""click the Doritos™ button"" I can pretty much guarantee it wouldn't have been nearly as popular. You have to keep in mind how much the active user base hates any and all types of marketing."
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,reconrose,9,Sat Jun 6 07:15:47 2015 UTC,"It was marketing in the sense that any memetic entity is marketing - it generated a continued social engagement by virtue of it's presence. It wasn't necessarily a capitalist marketing project, as it wasn't intended to generate revenue, however the effects of the experiment had a social impact and incentivized a continued engagement within the target demographic, so in that way it was very successful marketing."
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,vmcreative,12,Sat Jun 6 07:45:18 2015 UTC,"""Any memetic entity is marketing?"" Like: the Star Wars kid was ""marketing?"" Good Guy Greg is marketing? The word ""chillaxin"" is marketing?   No.   Marketing must convey a message selected by the marketer to the audience. If the marketer has no message or has no choice in the message then marketing is not happening. The person who invented the word chillaxin could not use that to convey any targeted message (""the county fair is the best place for relaxing"") so it is not marketing."
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,Smallpaul,13,Sat Jun 6 09:05:01 2015 UTC,"You could argue that YouTube hosting Star Wars Kid, or Charlie Bit My Finger was some of the best marketing it ever got.

TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,snoharm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:08:55 2015 UTC,"Any of those examples had the potential to have started as a marketing project, however they aren't obviously for the reason you describe. My point was more that memes have a semi-autonomous agency of social propagation that allow for them to be very effective marketing tools, when intentionally produced for that reason.  The Button wasn't an example of direct marketing in the sense that it was saying ""buy X"" like the example of the county fair, however I think the case could be made that it still occupies the same intentionality. Keep in mind that it was purposefully launched on April 1st, a day when major websites traditionally feature distinctive jokes that get extensively shared around the blog sphere, and that it was featured prominently on the front page via sidebar link for the period of that day. While it doesn't seem like the project carries any specific message, It did manage to engage its target demographic highly effectively, to the point that many within that group were motivated to take time to develop meaning for the project themselves. The word ""Religion"" was even thrown around in regards to it. I agree that it might be unconventional to think of marketing as having social agency outside of capitalist production, however given recent post-modern developments in language and communication I don't think it's that far fetched to look at it as a naturally adopted extension of the social lexicon."
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,vmcreative,2,Sat Jun 6 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah but what he means in that reddit has a disdain for anything that is marketing in the classical sense. Like he said, the button was hugely popular, but if you did the button ""hosted by Doritos"" then it would have been much less popular because redditors hate the idea of being sold to. Hell, if the button ended by showing everyone a link to a movie trailer people would have been rioting in the streets.  Ironically they often are sold to and fall for it hook, line and sinker. You just can't be too upfront about it and the product has to be something reddit somewhat likes."

Funny how engrossed redditors are by these things though. Proof that they'll be fascinated and entertain themselves with absolutely zero content.. Just.. Watching a number blip around.   Makes you wonder why we bother with ""content""  at all anymore. It's clearly not necessary."
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,Linmark,33,Sat Jun 6 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"The content was the culture, so to speak. People invented content around a shared subjective experience. Everyone had the option either to press or not press, which in turn gave them something to take a side on. This was compounded with further divisions of choice about when to press, and ultimately WHY to press. While the button itself was essentially contentless, it provided a perfect catalyst for discussion, and the rest followed organically."

I stayed up late so that I'd have less chance of colliding with someone else's press.  Sure enough, though, someone pressed milliseconds before me, and I got 60s. Tragic at the time. I shut off my computer and immediately left my apartment. I never do anything like that. To put this in perspective, I haven't shut off my computer since then. I always leave it on. I was so fucking livid. I know it sounds terribly dumb and whatever, but I'm being honest.  The massive amount of time I put into it caused me to feel that much more disappointed when it didn't go my way. You are lucky to have pressed so early and invested so little time into it. Even talking about it is sort of pissing me off. Anyway, I think the button was like anything else:  However much time you waited to press equaled the amount of satisfaction or disappointment you received when you pressed."
TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,appropriate-username,2,Sat Jun 6 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"If I could give my 1s to you, I would.  I waited weeks and weeks, and the press was worth it. And I'm not sure why. I don't need the flair, I don't think of it as some achievement, I just knew I wanted to press at 1s from the beginning and I feel like I won when I did. It's like a game, useless and meaningless and a was a lot of fun to play.  I guess that's my takeaway from this comment. Appreciate the game, and try remember the fun you had while playing it instead of the disappointment at the end.  Think of it like this: If there wasn't the risk of a 60s push, it wouldn't have been worth pushing at all."

TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,IdioticPhilosopher,21,Sat Jun 6 11:03:03 2015 UTC,"So, I think that the button was actually a really neat (un?)intentional experiment in memetics. If we assume that when somebody found out about it, they'd click it, then the activity chart for the button being pressed would model the virulence of the button as a meme. Most popular at first, then petering off logarithmically (if we just judge from the first time the button gets down to a given second count).  The ironic twist is that the button's hype was surrounding its lack of hype, so to speak (most charts emphasize when the count gets low, rather than when it gets high). If you were allowed to press the button more than once, we'd have a model for daily, or seasonal activity.  What would probably be impossible, but highly interesting if it weren't, would be if the button only worked the last time you pressed it, but you could press it multiple times. It's not possible because that'd be an undecideable problem for the button to solve, but if it were decideable, then we would be able to use the button to model the death of a meme.  Reminds me of 'the game' you lose by thinking of it."

TheoryOfReddit,38qpn1,Itchy_Koala,13,Sat Jun 6 02:45:06 2015 UTC,"Since no one has responded to your actual question:  The button was being kept alive by a network of donated accounts, run by an automated server. Anytime the button reached zero, the server used one of the donated accounts to click. This network had on the order of 1000 accounts at its disposal. Organic clicks were still coming in, but during downtime users could get 0s flair and maximize the button's lifespan by donating their accounts.  The button ended because the network tried to click with an account that was created after April 1, which means it is ineligible to press. There is a theory that this account may have been deliberately donated by a rival group that sought to end the button as quickly as possible.

TheoryOfReddit,38qfrd,vestigial,9,Fri Jun 5 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on what kind of content you're searching for. Search engines excel when you have a question in mind and you want to know the answer. For me, there's no alternative that's even remotely close to being able to google specific coding questions when I run into a bug.  But where Reddit really shines, is figuring out what questions you should be asking about a particular topic. When I was trying to learn about budgeting, I found the personal finance sub to be so much more helpful than just googling ""learn to budget"". The sidebar links are often a great compilation of info across a variety of sites, and are (likely) not just paid advertisements. After that, being able to immerse yourself in a community of expert and non-experts really helps learning in immersion and learning how other people approach the same problem you are having. So it's much more helpful in being able to learning how to solve similar problems in the future."
TheoryOfReddit,38qfrd,chiliap2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:27:44 2015 UTC,"Is it fair to generalize from coding? That language is extremely specific. Human languages are more ambiguous -- it may be impossible to ask a question in clear enough terms, even if you can formulate it quite clearly to another person. The further you get from product numbers and industry-specific terms (overclocking, for example), the less robust a search will be.   For instance, I think ""introduction to small business budgeting"" is a very human-understandable search term, but you had trouble finding a good primer and had to take yourself to reddit, which was the jackpot. That indicates a search engine failure to my mind.  The way I see things developing, we're going to be moving to more centralized, user-curated information over the increasingly inaccurate, potentially corrupt, and infinitely gamed webcrawling algorithms.   Reddit is really well positioned here, because the other centralized user-created information is usually on regular forums. A lot of them are very difficult to search. I was on one today and it only allowed a search of about thirty different terms (compiled daily). Reddit searching is easy -- largely because it offers a flexible search engine, but also because I can drastically limit the search to the specific area I'm looking for. Subreddits allow me to get around some of the ambiguity of language.   On top of that, every individual forum requires its own log-in, and they seem behind on logging in through gmail or facebook, so to ask a question is a tedious process for a forum I'm likely to never visit again. I have one reddit login, and I'm usually already logged in, and if I have a few posts going, responses all arrive to the same inbox.   ETA: It is very cool how we all learn together. Conversations are as important as information."

I have written [essays] about a variety of topics and there is usually a exponential relation between time and amount of topical search results when it comes to searching for things.

I give up quickly, especially when search engines don't respect "" "" and give me their own interpretations of the words I'm actually using. It's hard to refine a search when I can't narrow things down to exactly one word or exactly one phrase. +""this exact phrase"" does not do it. So I can't fine tune anything -- I can replace words and since google has already related them, I don't get new results."

A scam poster cant prevent downvotes, execution by moderators, can't (really) eliminate critical comments; it also has to compete with everything else on a similar subject... good on reddit.   I don't feel confident in my ability to distinguish between bullshit and legit info; if I don't know a lot about a subject, I can't possibly know. I can trust the majority of commenters on a subject, and there are likely to be at least a few. Reddit is made for discussion. At the very least, I'll be grounded in understanding a point of contention. An article from Forbes is not meant to invite discussion and as such I'm much less able to gauge its quality.

TheoryOfReddit,38hy7o,MittRomneysCampaign,22,Thu Jun 4 09:45:57 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're more interested in arguing as a form of intellectual exercise rather than engaging in a discussion: listening to another's viewpoint and earnestly reassessing your opinion. Neither way of engagement is more valid but you have to  recognize why you're arguing before you can decide which medium is most conducive to it.  The internet is great for flexing your intellect, practicing your reasoning and logic skills, and finding similarly educated people to challenge your beliefs. For a discussion that seeks to find an objective truth like ""democratic v. republican voting patterns on oil subsidies,"" ""the effects of GMO crops on the environment,"" or ""the economic impact of raising the minimum wage"" the internet probably is the best forum to coherently lay out and defend your argument; but the problem is most people aren't swayed by facts alone. Emotional appeals are an essential part of rhetoric and emotional appeals are probably achieved, more easily, face-to-face. You can turn your nose up at this fact and decide the only arguments worth engaging in are those based on pure reason but you won't win hearts and minds that way.   The question here would be, if you took two people with opposing views on a fact-based argument would they come to a reasonable understanding, more easily, over a cup of coffee or the internet? And of course, the answer is: it depends. It depends, entirely, on the dispositions of the people. It seems you would rather have the argument over the internet instead of in-person but for others, the opposite is true. I think it's completely defensible that you would rather discuss things online but you make some gross oversimplifications in the process:   discussions in-person tend to be really trivial, because very few people are okay with being confrontational in real life, and most people would rather discuss agreeable things like the weather or what you had for breakfast or what your plans are for the evening.   This is an anecdotal straw man as well as somewhat ethnocentric. Many people are raised in cultures and families that are comfortable engaging in theological discussions with strangers over dinner, while others wouldn't discuss politics with their closest friends. There's a huge spectrum here and it's not one way or the other. There's no generalization you can make about what people like to discuss across all cultures. If you want to have in-depth talks, in-person, you can; but if you approach people with the prejudice that everyone just wants to talk about the weather, you're only serving your own hypothesis.  It's a lot quicker and easier to find people online that are willing to engage you in substantial discussions but that same engagement is also available in-person. More to the point: yeah, the internet is fine for arguing and people that discredit online discourse don't know what they're talking about; but you don't need to discredit real life debate by creating a dichotomy between it and online debate. What works for you isn't going to work for everybody."
TheoryOfReddit,38hy7o,LoLieh,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:30:50 2015 UTC,"When you talk about emotions being a major decider in arguments: this isn't negative or at all saying that people are emotional. Often an argument that was properly conducted, researched etc will boil down to multiple ""truths"" that to make a ""decision"" you would have to value one or more of these ""truths"" above the others. Sometimes you would have to choose between a combination of ""truths."" If you were to plug these into some computer: you couldn't be given an answer because it is inherently subjective and ""emotional.""    Each persons' emotions are the deciding factor and these are determined by predisposition and previous experience [among others].   Often a properly conducted in-person argument boils down to these ""truths"" and the verdict is reached because if a group of people regularly hangs out/are related to each other, they would be more likely to prioritize the same ""truths."" Sometimes this is not the case, but it [rarely] escalates beyond that because people [rarely] want to lose their friends over some intellectual argument.  This also ties in to the ""lol u r a fag"" argument that op made when he said:   most people tend to revert to ""u r a fag"" levels of disagreement pretty quickly.   This is because the argument has been properly conducted and the issues have been boiled down but nobody is budging because they all prioritize the different truths. Insults are the only recourse because you can't appeal to his/her life experiences because you don't know him/her.  this ties in to Reddit where the dominant viewpoint is ""decided"" by majority via upvote/downvote then people puppet it because they read it online."
TheoryOfReddit,38hy7o,pm_if_u_r_calipygian,-1,Sat Jun 6 05:35:31 2015 UTC,"arguing as a form of intellectual exercise rather than engaging in a discussion: listening to another's viewpoint and earnestly reassessing your opinion   I don't think these are different things.  ""Intellectual exercises"" constitute a lot of potential thought processes. All arguments/discussions that seriously examine beliefs will be intellectual exercises, whether on the internet or not, and their role in exercising your intellect won't take away from your ability to listen to another's viewpoint or reassess your view.  In fact, I don't know how reassessing your view could be anything but an intellectual exercise, unless you mean ""exercise"" to mean something like ""practice"", but practice for what I don't know.   Emotional appeals are an essential part of rhetoric and emotional appeals are probably achieved, more easily, face-to-face. You can turn your nose up at this fact and decide the only arguments worth engaging in are those based on pure reason but you won't win hearts and minds that way.   You're the second person to say this, and I responded to this elsewhere, so let me ask a different question:  Why is this an especially great reason to prioritize in-person discussion? It seems to suggest I should want people accepting my conclusions and not the reasons for those conclusions.   Many people are raised in cultures and families that are comfortable engaging in theological discussions with strangers over dinner   I was probably being Anglocentric here.  I am comfortable having these discussions with my friends over dinner, as are most people I associate with, but the dominant culture is definitely not this, nor is it in any English-speaking country I know of. I wish it were not the case, but whatever.  With that said, the criticism I am exposed to of the internet is typically Anglocentric as well, so I would presume most of the people making this criticism are people also in these cultures.   ore to the point: yeah, the internet is fine for arguing and people that discredit online discourse don't know what they're talking about; but you don't need to discredit real life debate by creating a dichotomy between it and online debate. What works for you isn't going to work for everybody.   Sure, but I was speaking in terms of information-evaluation, or at least I was originally. The information seems mechanically superior in that respect. It's incredibly awkward to fact-check someone during a real-time conversation, for example. I've done it, but it looks obnoxious anyway."

TheoryOfReddit,38hy7o,ArchangelleDovakin,11,Thu Jun 4 10:10:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that you really know how discussions in meatspace are held...

Not everyone is that way, anyway, so it's not inevitable that a person needs to be emotionally assuaged before they accept a position -- it's just really easy to get people to accept positions if you can make them feel good. I'd rather attack someone's need to be emotionally lubricated at the root than accept that they're going to be this way.  Otherwise, that is like saying:   Gravity exists   And accepting this conclusion because I convinced you to love me.  I mean, it really doesn't matter if you accept the conclusion ""gravity exists"" if you don't understand what this entails, why it's important, and so on. The reasoning is the actual substance of the belief, so if you skip the reasoning and get someone to accept the conclusion with emotional appeals, then they haven't actually learned anything anyway.  If this is a reason why I should prefer in-person discussions to the internet, then I definitely prefer internet discussions, because the medium indirectly encourages people to put their emotions to the side due to the inherent difficulty in expressing your feelings over a textual platform."

So being cognizant of, and attentive to, your audience's emotional reactions is key to convincing them you're right.   that is like saying:   Gravity exists   And accepting this conclusion because I convinced you to love me.   That's not how that works. It's less about how the person feels about you than it is about how they feel about the specific issue at hand.

I don't think it's something I should be concerned about though if it means I have to sidestep the reasons for a position or assuage someone with some kind of delusion. Emotions play a key role in decision making processes for people, but not universally, and not at every level of cognition. Obviously, you can be trained out of it to a great degree. You'd have to go that route if you want a comprehensive understanding of a conclusion unless you didn't already have emotional objections.   It's less about how the person feels about you than it is about how they feel about the specific issue at hand. The emotional decision to accept a position precedes the rational decision.   Okay, let's try something else.  I pay you $1,000,000 to say that gravity exists. You do. You definitely feel good about saying gravity exists.

So, if you get people to accept conclusions by using emotional appeals without fundamentally changing their reasoning for those conclusions, then they haven't actually changed anything about the way they think, they've just superficially changed the things they say they think, but not actually the substance of what they think.  e.g. if I get a parrot to say ""2+2=4"", this parrot doesn't actually know what '2' or '4' are, it's just learned to say what I say because it feels good when it says what I say."

It's novelty gives it a bigger base.  My personal view is that it's far less about racism than most people assume and more about the unique and novel humour that is couched in ""urban speak"" - something that the vast majority of redditors never really have been previously exposed to outside of lazy racist caricature in the past.  BlackPeopleTwitter is funnier more because of the unique (to redditors) way something is being looked at, as opposed to the actual content or the fact that it's related to black people.    Novelty is a factor in comedy and /r/blackpeopletwitter is something of a new paradigm of speech/writing for most of the audience here.

TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,justcool393,4,Thu Jun 4 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"It's basically the typical low quality shit that Reddit usually gets pissed off at for being the type of garbage pulled off of Facebook. However, now the content is under the guise of black people twitter (hardly any of that shit is from black people).   So now people can post that common denominator shit that appeals to a wide audience, but not get called out for posting stuff Reddit considers crap.   It really is a reflection of this site as it grows and becomes more popular."
TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,duffmanhb,83,Thu Jun 4 06:28:36 2015 UTC,"There are two reasons in my opinion.  First, in my experiences (I'm half black,and grew up in small town Idaho) almost no one will actually identify themselves as racist. Reddit users aren't racist in the sense that they would say something to a black individual on the street, or even to an individual calling themselves black on the internet. When an event like Baltimore happens, however, they use it as a justification for their more subtle prejudice and stereotyping towards 'black nature' or 'the black community.'  Second, laughing at something and having prejudice towards it can be a very thin line. I don't particularly enjoy racist rednecks, but i can laugh at jokes like this (the particular meme was pretty lame, but you get the point). You can look at /r/BlackPeopleTwitter as laughing at how silly those black people are, or you can look at it as celebrating how funny the black community can be.  I think it's funny in the latter sense, but not everyone may look at it that way. Also, like others said, a lot of the posts aren't even really related to race."
TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,TM1323,4,Wed Jun 3 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"When an event like Baltimore happens, however, they use it as a justification for their more subtle prejudice and stereotyping towards 'black nature' or 'the black community.'   Just a really honest question here... If I think inner-city black culture is absolutely horrible and (literally) destroying lives, would you call me a racist?"
TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,jmottram08,55,Wed Jun 3 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"I mean you can claim that the ""culture"" is responsible for the cycle of violence but then what's responsible for the ""culture""?  If you think that it's anything along the lines of ""black people are responsible for the culture"" then yes, you are racist. The issue here is that black folk aren't any different from white folk therefore cannot be responsible for a more violent culture inherently - there must be an external pressure (from the outside) to create something that's like that.  Or possibly all people are horrible and money just lets us live farther away from each other. I don't know. I do know that other part is really racist, though."
TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,calrebsofgix,2,Wed Jun 3 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"If you think that it's anything along the lines of ""black people are responsible for the culture"" then yes, you are racist.    So are white people not responsible for their culture as well?"
TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,jmottram08,11,Thu Jun 4 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"For the most part, yes. Our cultures are shaped by outside forces. We can attempt to take control of them (and often do. See: MLK, Malcolm X, Ghandi, etc.) but for the most part we're more shaped by it than we shape it."
TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,calrebsofgix,0,Thu Jun 4 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"Late, but some people view black and white culture as opposites in a way. White culture is a thing, black people for a while, maybe even now, disliked white culture since they were enslaved/treated badly, so they start to value things that we don't because we don't value them. And vice versa, just one way some look at it."
TheoryOfReddit,38e87y,sockgorilla,-1,Thu Jun 4 06:27:13 2015 UTC,"Well, two points.  One is that if black people aren't responsible for black culture, why are white people responsible for white culture?  Second is that if black culture was a move away from white culture, fine... but the results are apparent.  Its like a child not doing what his parents say, just to exert control. Even if that mean making life harder on himself, or hurting himself.  IF what you say is true, at some point black culture needs to stop and realize that many parts of white culture are good."

The other commenter nailed it. It depends on where you think ""inner-city black culture"" originates. If you think it's just ""how those people behave when you leave them alone without a strong white presence to keep them in check"", then congratulations, you're a racist in my book, because you're functionally saying that the plight of these communities is deserved and self-inflicted. If you realize that the culture you're criticizing is a lashing-out at a pattern of centuries of racist oppression and white supremacy, then no, I wouldn't call you a racist, but if you understood that you would probably have phrased your initial sentiment differently.

Most of it is just (attempted) comedy in an exaggerated black vernacular.  Some of the posts, if read in the right mood are actually quite funny. You can view the whole thing as a huge exercise in hate speech if you want but I doubt that's true - at least not of the original content that's being posted. Some of the posts remind me of the older generation of American comedians who would put on an exaggerated Yiddish accent when talking about their neighbourhood or mothers/fathers. Taken out of context it is offensive - laughing at someone's funny accent but that's missing the point a bit.  Obviously the majority of the stuff that's posted there is dreadful, but that's true of almost all of Reddit."

I'm a mid-20s white female. That sub is just oddly funny, in a very low-brow kind of way.  Some of the humor is racial, or related to being African American, but not all of it. I've actually noticed that a lot of the humor is relevant to being in high school. My personal inside joke with myself, in my head (because I'm like that), is basically ""lol, more like /r/BlackHighSchoolTwitter."" There are a lot of jokes about things like moms not understanding computers, or trying to get away with skipping classes, or trying to look cool in front of your friends when you get in trouble with your parents. There are also a fair number of jokes about people's behavior on social media, like girls posing half-naked on Instagram for attention. I think that the ""high school"" aspect of it might be part of why it has a broader appeal than one might otherwise expect. There are a lot of teenagers on Reddit, and even for those of us who have long since moved on from high school and its problems, we still went through that at some point."

I subscribed to small-medium sized communities that I contribute to often and because they're not main subs, they don't get to that critical mass of bigotry/racism/sexism/whatever.  /r/Podcasts has been an insanely cool resource for me as I run two shows and it's set me up with a LONG list of other podcast hosts that want to be guests on my show. It's a positive atmosphere if you follow the rules and people are willing to give you tips and advice if it doesn't look like you're just trying to promote yourself.  /r/moviescirclejerk is a satire sub and you'd expect that to be a bunch of assholes just making fun of people. Again, it's very light-hearted and tongue in cheek, and they're not afraid to call out /r/movies on all their shit, especially how they seem to believe women can't act and aren't funny and aren't useful in a movie unless they're super hot and get naked.  If a subreddit is full of bigotry and that kind of stuff, I'll unsubscribe from it. I'm still subscribed to /r/movies because I've taken a step back from it looked in and it's interesting to see that there are still people out there in the world that believe such horrible shit sometimes. I don't know anyone in the real world who would say the kinds of things I see at the bottom of a comment thread, but I guess that's the point of anonymity.  I guess what I'm saying is that your browsing experience will be much different if you leave the main subs. Reddit leaves it's content up to the mods so if mods crack down on bullshit, it goes away.

I mean that seriously, not sarcastically, because what you are ultimately asking is whether your morality is affected by using mode X to communicate when others use mode X for immoral means.  My answer is that no, you should not feel ethically conflicted about using any mode of communication that is also used for immoral means for that reason alone. I say for that reason alone because, if otherwise, I would have to feel ethically conflicted about my use of speech itself, of walking itself, of eating itself, of doing anything itself, since anything an agent does can ultimately be used to commit a wrong.  Now, if you felt that there were reasons in addition to this initial reason, then perhaps you would be right to feel ethically conflicted. For example, I should not feel ethically conflicted about eating only because some people (knowingly or otherwise) use eating to drive the suffering of animals, but I should feel ethically conflicted about eating meat because of this reason in addition to the reason of driving the suffering of animals."

And I've also been a member of reddit for a very long time and watch its decline.   But a couple of ethical reasons to stay on reddit (1) I am exposed to people who fundamentally disagree with me and that is good for keeping me non-dogmatic and (2) I think it is better if more reality-based non-rageaholic non-haters stay on reddit. It worries me where it's going to go otherwise.

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,pointfree,241,Tue Jun 2 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"No you aren't. I've been writing polemics against them for ages, and it's unfortunate so many people think it is an official reddit feature without realizing it is a series of tricks using reddit's Nepalese language extension.  I could go on a huge rant, but I'll limit my disdain to two points:  A. The official reddit rules regarding np situations are absurdly obscure, and NEED to be clarified. Nowhere on the site-side rules is anything akin to voting/commenting in linked threads banned, aside from the incredibly vague dictum 'no vote manipulation', which seems to be explained as buying votes or asking friends to vote. It's only far down in the FAQ that there is another (vague) note on it:   A ""vote ring"" is a group of people who agree to vote on certain things together, either a specific submission, a user, a domain, or anything like that.   Have those in a sub like SubredditDrama technically 'agreed' to vote a certain way? Hard to say.  B. More practically speaking: np paranoia has reached a point at which it no longer even serves its purpose on many subs. Originally np was effective because it was non-intrusive and you could easily go to a linked thread, vote on stuff, and return to browsing without ever noticing you had been in np mode. Now, most major subs have CSS that throws huge warnings you are in np. Hell, some have it so that the scores and usernames of all comments are hidden while in np, making it virtually impossible to glean any meaningful information about the thread you are viewing without switching out of np mode. It's like throwing a huge sign up to brigaders saying 'HEY, YOU'RE IN NP, DON'T FORGET TO SWITCH OUT!'"
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,SyndicateSamantharoo,11,Tue Jun 2 13:03:17 2015 UTC,"AutoMod can't follow links and tell how old the post at the other end of them, so most subs do a fire-and-forget method."

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,TheAppleFreak,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:39:31 2015 UTC,"It was more about the not knowing how old a destination post is, though I digress."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,TheAppleFreak,3,Wed Jun 3 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"The no official rules thing is really frustrating.  I think the Pornhub account (Katie I think) got the account shadow banned for voting in NP.  I don't really vote much anyway, so it's never been a big deal but people get really pissed off about the idea of not being able to.  It seems like they want a way to prevent mass voting from other subs but don't want to code a proper solution that's too convoluted to put other users off from bothering."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,EtherBoo,29,Wed Jun 3 04:40:52 2015 UTC,"Something I'm always worried about is what would count as me being part of a brigade enough to get me banned.  I'm subbed to ~500 subs for the sake of being able to keep track of all the ones that interest me.  But, I'm hardly consistently active in all of those; hell I primarily lurk in even the ones I go to daily.  Every now and then I'll be in one sub, get linked to another that I already go to, or maybe haven't been to in six months, but it's not that active, etc.  What counts as me brigading?  What if my 2 most frequented, /r/DotA2 and /r/Games, link to each other and I find the link before I access that thread from the main subreddit?  What if, for whatever reason, I unsubscribe from /r/Games but keep frequenting it?  What if an /r/Funny post links to an /r/BearsWithBeaks post; a subreddit I've been subscribed to for years but gone to maybe once?  I can trust my own judgment, but Reddit is too big for ""just have good judgment and you won't be banned"" to work at this point.  I don't think anything I do is an issue; god knows there are people that mod as many subreddits as I'm subscribed to.  But who knows?  Vague shit like NP rules is way too subjective for such a big website with so many people running it."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,SteveWoods,20,Wed Jun 3 02:54:45 2015 UTC,I can agree with this in that I fear that I'll be (shadow)banned for unintentional vote manipulation.

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,DublinBen,7,Wed Jun 3 04:21:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but I don't always remember how I got to a thread, and I sometimes have dozens of reddit tabs open.  Also, voting is pretty much an automatic thing for me, I do it without much conscious thought except for considering whether the comment adds to the discussion or not."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,TexasDex,2,Tue Jun 2 17:57:43 2015 UTC,I don't always remember how I got to a thread   Hence why the np link prefix is so useful.  It is a reminder to follow the rules by not participating in a discussion you have been linked to elsewhere.
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,DublinBen,7,Tue Jun 2 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, until I click on another subreddit or my messages link and the NP url stays there, and two clicks later I realize I can't vote on something for no good reason.  And yes, I know RES has a fix for that.  RES also slows my browser down so badly that I had to disable it."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,TexasDex,6,Wed Jun 3 03:11:48 2015 UTC,"How is this not subjective?   If you do click on an NP link and want to comment, please learn about the community first. Respect that you are an outsider coming into an established community. Many communities offer an introduction, and have rules and guidelines. Read these before attempting to participate.  If you frequently follow links and vote, or if you frequently post links without using the np prefix, you may find yourself banned or shadowbanned by moderators or the admins. The admins are the last line of defense, so please use NP links to help enforce good behaviour.   ""If you frequently.""  ""You may find yourself banned."" How is that not subjective?  What is frequently?  The first part even gives guidelines for how to interact if you don't do it too much.    And, that's still not addressing the point of my post that you're responding to.  Admins can track activity.  What if /r/Games  or /r/SubredditDrama link me to an /r/DotA2 thread before I visit /r/DotA2 that morning?  If I go to that thread, am I allowed to participate since I'm not an outside, but rather a part of the established /r/Dota2 community?  Or is that still going to risk me getting banned?  Do I have to go click my /r/Dota2 link at the top of my tab, then go find the thread?  Or am I still potentially considered an invader at this point because I was initially linked to the post by another subreddit?    Sure, I could just never ever go anywhere near posting in or voting in a thread I've ever been linked to from elsewhere and be safe, but that's not the point of this thread.  The point is that NP rules are unclear enough that I don't even know if I could technically be banned for any of the above scenario or not."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,SteveWoods,48,Wed Jun 3 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"Btw, there's actually no language using np (Nepali is ne); the software just accepts any two character combination.

Because there is no other way to explain this. Literally the only two times I've broken my np non-voting I got prompt shadowbans. The logical conclusion is that the admins take this very seriously, so no need to give them a reason to ban.  Still really silly, *oh noes someone's precious fake internet points are being slowly chipped away* (you can't even sink anyone's karma because the mega-downvoted posts tend to not affect your overall karma, I've noticed this a while ago with my posts)"

Like /u/un_internaute, I have voted and interacted to my heart's content on linked threads across several accounts and several years. Never once have I received a shadowban.  Yet I have heard many stories of people like you who are immediately banned for dropping a single vote in a meta thread.  If I had to guess, I'd say the admins watch specific controversial subs like aforementioned /r/SubredditDrama and carpet-ban anyone detected to participate in a big thread, whereas smaller metas like /r/BadLinguistics go unnoticed."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,SyndicateSamantharoo,20,Tue Jun 2 13:59:07 2015 UTC,the admins watch specific controversial subs like aforementioned /r/SubredditDrama and carpet-ban anyone detected to participate in a big thread   Bingo.

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,warzero,11,Wed Jun 3 05:50:15 2015 UTC,"Weird part is, my IRL friends vote on NP links on their accounts all the time without consequences.   The theory I've seen is that it doesn't matter if you vote on a linked thread whether it's linked via np. or not. The admins can obviously see if you came to a thread via a link from another thread. They don't need np. for that.  What seems to matter is if someone complains about a thread being brigaded, then they look at it. And probably manually run a script to see if there was significant brigading and then hand out shadowbans. Unless it's /r/bestof who seem immune from the consequences of massive brigading.  So it's entirely possible to vote on linked threads and not get banned if someone doesn't happen to whine to the admins about brigading."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,CI5,6,Wed Jun 3 13:25:20 2015 UTC,"Unless it's /r/bestof who seem immune from the consequences of massive brigading.   Like you said, someone has to complain first. I don't see that happening in this case."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Infamously_Unknown,12,Wed Jun 3 01:03:34 2015 UTC,People complain all the time about /r/bestof. They can decimate subs small and large. They upvote the linked comment and then often massively downvote anyone who happens to disagree with the linked comment.   Here's just one documented example from the first hit on a search I made.  It's no secret that they get a pass that places like SRD would never ever get. I don't know why because as usual the admins will never clarify these things.

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Infamously_Unknown,2,Tue Jun 2 22:03:28 2015 UTC,You most likely voted through mobile because of the differences in how mobile and desktop versions deal with np.

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Aemilius_Paulus,3,Tue Jun 2 22:33:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like confirmation bias to me. Bans almost certainly came from something else.
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,adremeaux,14,Tue Jun 2 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"Not confirmation bias... I messaged the admins. The bans came from me voting in NP threads, one from SRD, one from another sub. They told me why I was banned. I begged to be unbanned and I was. Twice. Pretty generous if you ask me.   I cited the fact that I am very active on /r/hardwareswap and I have received and handed out plenty of gold, I know it all sounds silly, but I had to make a case for myself and it worked. It would be pretty disastrous for me to lose my primary reddit account, I buy so much on /r/hardwareswap and rely on my rep there."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Aemilius_Paulus,3,Tue Jun 2 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"Can you show us their message that said you were banned because you voted in np? Your account is not very old and you don't post very much, it should be easily findable in your private messages inbox."

I don't see why you don't believe me, I don't really have a reason to lie. In fact, I can't even sub to SRD anymore. Mods disabled my ability to sub to a sub.

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,jckgat,2,Tue Jun 2 19:36:43 2015 UTC,"Nothing, ideally. The whole point of using np. is that votes don't get counted and users who vote won't get banned for brigade behaviour.   If you vote in a ""should have been np"" link, and the automated system sees a pattern it identifies as brigading, all or some involved accounts could be banned. If the offence was unintentional and minor, you can probably get the account back and working on appeal, but there's no guarantee.   Edit: seems this is incorrect, see airmandan's reply to me, np. is intended to disable relevant buttons via CSS, if you do vote and participate through either np or non-np links you're similarly at risk."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Anomander,5,Tue Jun 2 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing about the ""no participation"" CSS prevents the votes from being counted.  It only hides the voting arrows.  If it fails to do so, for instance if the user has custom CSS turned off, the vote will absolutely count."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,airmandan,3,Tue Jun 2 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe we need some examples to help clear this up.   /r/gameofthrones has two versions of their css.   There is:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones  and   http://dk.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/  The ""dk"" is a url the mods used that just adjusts the CSS to put it into a ""dark mode"" with a different color scheme.   You can use any letter combination to do whatever kind of CSS you want.   It has been universally agreed by the community that ""np"" would be used to mean no participation. Meaning that the mods can use the np url to change their CSS to get rid of vote buttons or comment boxes or whatever they want. But it is a purely visual thing and it is entirely up to the mods whether or not to implement it. So if they did not use the CSS to remove the buttons, then they still work as normal. This is also why you can still use RES shortcuts with the A and Z keys to vote as well regardless of whether or not it is np."

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Amablue,4,Tue Jun 2 23:17:57 2015 UTC,"The official reddit rules regarding np situations are absurdly obscure, and NEED to be clarified.    Simple: there are no such rules.  Brigading is against the rules, but that's irrespective of whether the subreddit that's the victim of the brigading uses NoParticipation CSS or not."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Epistaxis,6,Wed Jun 3 02:22:37 2015 UTC,"You might as well link the whole FAQ(It isn't hidden by the way, its linked to directly from the rules page) which makes it quite clear that attempting to manipulate votes on a comment/post is a bannable offence:   Besides spam, the other big no-no is to try to manipulate voting by any means: manual, mechanical, or otherwise. We're not going to post an exhaustive list of forbidden tactics (lest we give people ideas), but some major ones are:   Don't use shill or multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software to increase votes for submissions Don't ask other users to vote on certain posts, either on reddit itself or anywhere else (through Twitter, Facebook, IM programs, IRC, etc.) Don't be part of a ""voting clique"" or ""vote ring""   A voting clique is a group of people who send links to their submissions around via message, IM, or any other means, with the expectation of ""you guys vote for my stuff and I'll vote for yours."" A ""vote ring"" is a group of people who agree to vote on certain things together, either a specific submission, a user, a domain, or anything like that. Upvote each submission or content for the value of the information in it, a variety of things that you think are interesting and will benefit the community.  Cheating or attempting to manipulate voting will result in your account being banned. Don't do it.   Taking part in a community that goes around voting on certain posts that are shared by other users can get you banned. Its right there in the faq.  Now as far as commenting on linked threads goes, that is not mentioned in the rules at all. I have heard that you can receive a shadowban for commenting on linked threads without voting, but that activity is not mentioned in the rules at all."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Algee,18,Wed Jun 3 00:00:52 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this interpretation. If someone in the course of a conversation links to another sub or another discussion in a different thread, why would me visiting it be considered punishable collusion?

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,ZotohZhaan,4,Tue Jun 2 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"Whether or not you agree with the interpretation of the rules doesn't matter though; all that matters is how the people enforcing the rule interpret it.   If you don't like it, you're arguing with the wrong people.   Admin think they're clear enough, and have no problems or reservations enforcing the rule to include meta-activity that might've been innocuous in intent. Disagreeing with the rule isn't going to make you immune to it.    why would me visiting it be considered punishable collusion?   Because if ten, twenty, of maybe a hundred people all do the same thing in a sub with an active user-base of 50, whether or not that was the intent, a whole bunch of outsiders turned up and drowned out ""native"" votes and comments.  It's just as damaging when unintentional as when intentional, so Admin DGAF and set the robot to ""vindictive""."

There's nothing in the faq that you quoted about this."

All I did is tell you what ""is known"" as best as I know it about shadowbanning as it relates to what admins call ""brigading"" - you can do with it what you like, and no matter how much you disagree and argue, the end results are still the same.  If you want to ideologically disbelieve in anything that doesn't mesh with how you'd like reddit to be, fine.  Its your account at ""risk"" and no skin off my back if you're SB'd and gotta start over.  I don't feel like I've any need to prove anything, especially when you're very clearly put no effort into understanding learning about those systems yourself.    The admins are banning people for ""brigading"".  The np. system is from the userbase, and an attempt to allow meta subs to exist while protecting users from Admin.  Admin doesn't have rules related to np at all, that I know of.  But if you follow a non-np link to another reddit ""location"" and a bunch of other people do and then some of you also participate by commenting or voting, the group that participated might be banned for ""brigading"" even that was not anyone's individual intent.  Following the link, np or not, is not a problem.  Participating through the rabbit-hole is.  np. is designed to slightly break submissions and votes made from a np. page so that users cannot unintentionally put themselves at risk of an SB for brigading.    It's not 100%, it's kinda inconsistent, involving a lot of missed cases and a few false positives as well, and a lot of people who were not acting maliciously or intending to behave as part of a brigade have been banned for brigade behaviour.   There isn't complete information, and there probably won't be; Admin are deliberately cagey about how those systems work because they don't want anyone working out how to circumvent them."

Sure, once you accrue a bit of karma you can tank a large hit, but karma score is tied directly into how frequently you can post. If a large sub downvotes, say, a dozen of your comments by a couple hundred and you don't have twenty thousand comment karma or so, you'll suddenly find yourself slapped with ten minutes between being able to post anything, regardless of subreddit.  It's subreddit-specific, too, so if a large sub decided to give me minus a hundred karma on a comment in /r/UpliftingNews (currently +87 from there), I'd get the full weight of that restriction while in the subreddit. Essentially, that limits me to one comment per post, and hoping that people don't try to have a back-and-forth with me.  Obviously on a sub like AskReddit, getting hit by a fuckton of negative karma isn't going to affect me, because 100k minus a few hundred is still 100k, but that's especially why smaller subs can feel the hit even harder."

They often remind me (combined with RES or the subreddit's own CSS) not to vote in other communities if I follow a link through to them. I never continue redditing from a np link since I use tabbed browsing so it does its job without inhibiting my normal redditing. I think many people don't want to mess with the voting in other communities but just forget (at least I do) so it definitely helps in that sense.

Many subreddits have rules they want followed to try to create a healthy discussion environment.  People who arrive from a bestof link or similar rarely read those rules.  Sometimes the key rules aren't even written on the sidebar -- just norms that regular users pick up.  And when a larger subreddit links to a smaller one, the arrivees can swamp the actual conversation.  I recently posted in a CMV thread that I found via bestof.  The np reminded me that I was in an unfamiliar place -- I probably would have forgotten otherwise.  I took the time to read their sidebar before posting.  And all went well.  NP isn't a serious barrier.  It's a reminder.  It's a reminder exactly when it's needed that you're in a new community and should learn some norms.  On net, it seems like a good thing."

Nearly three years later, NoParticipation remains a messy kludge that only stops people using certain devices/apps who don't go (very slightly) out of their way to knowingly break the rules. Everyone on both sides of the debate agrees the it's badly flawed. But this is the best anyone has managed to slap together using only CSS.     I for one have always liked how the interactions between subreddits disrupted confirmation bias.   That's great that you think your opinions are welcome everywhere you go, but it's really up to the community you're visiting to decide how it wants to welcome you. Yes, insularity does mean that you'll get confirmation bias in a place like /r/ainbow, where a disproportionately low number of subscribers are willing to express the opinion that same-sex marriages should not be recognized by government, but maybe subscribers to /r/ainbow simply aren't interested in having that debate with you, even if you're clearly right and they're wrong. Please consider that self-segregating by interests is the whole point of having subreddits. If you think a subreddit is too full of people who don't want to have the same discussions you want to have, then just unsubscribe from it and go join another or start your own.   And even if both the visitors and the subscribers are already in agreement about everything, it tends to change the party a lot when you bring five million friends to the door with you. Even /r/bestof, which ought to be the most benign of all the meta-subreddits, just has so many subscribers that it only takes a small fraction of them to downvote people who disagreed with the bestof'd comment into negative karma so they can't post anymore, and harass them with mean replies, until they delete their reddit accounts altogether - this used to happen before the moderators took responsibility for reducing the (unintentional) brigading.  I'm curious to hear more about Wikipedia though."
TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Epistaxis,8,Tue Jun 2 15:03:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know... when they ""disrupt the confirmation bias"" that may be satisfying for you if you disagree with the subs bias, but after about ten minutes the entire comment section is going to be dominated by posts about ""feminist SJW scum brigading the glorious truth-sub"" or whatever it may be, and I think that sucks.  Most subreddits don't appreciate being overflown with people who don't share the preconceived opinions there anyways. Some subs (such as for example /r/polandball) even hate being mentioned at all.  Some subs also use np-links because it is a sub for observing the funny shitstorms that sometimes erupt on reddit, and participating would just spoil it."

TheoryOfReddit,387ikg,Epistaxis,2,Tue Jun 2 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"I thought it made sense for certain subreddits who aim to observe other parts of reddit without changing it. If a subreddit suspects that a racist post with 10 upvotes will be popular, then they might link to it and watch what happens. If they don't encourage non-participation, then people from the subreddit might downvote it, which fights the racism, but it also hides the proof that the racist post otherwise would have been well-received.  Another example is /r/bitcoin and /r/buttcoin. If a crazy ranting post was made in /r/bitcoin and wasn't upvoted much then it wouldn't really matter, it's just one person ranting. If it was highly upvoted though, then it represents the /r/bitcoin community. If /r/buttcoin links a post and comes and downvotes it then it no longer becomes significant, but if they just observe then their criticisms become more evidently justified."

Redditors hate seeing that little green M because they think that green M infringes on their rights.    If you ask people not to vote, they will go out of their way to vote.

Over at /r/PCMasterRace, we've banned linking outright, and my AutoMod link filter has been pretty effective at removing that stuff automatically.

TheoryOfReddit,388gs7,ArchangelleDovakin,7,Tue Jun 2 16:53:44 2015 UTC,That's what happens when you take away subreddit rules. Funny how both Deimorz and buckeye talked about it (conspiracy!!!)  With no rules every subreddit just reverts to a topic specific version of /r/funny and/r/AdviceAnimals
TheoryOfReddit,388gs7,Deimorz,13,Tue Jun 2 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"It's something I've said a lot, but it's mostly due to biases in the way the hot algorithm works. reddit's design can be summed up as ""whatever gets the highest score the fastest is the best"". This means that everything will always be biased towards submissions and comments that are:   Quick to view (images, memes, gifs, one-liners) Simple to understand (not subtle or requiring any thought or in-depth knowledge) Non-controversial (things that are funny, or viewpoints that most people already agree with)   The things that satisfy these conditions best are often the very opposite of what many people consider ""high-quality content"", so the site's entire design is fighting against trying to get that type of content from it. The root of the issue is that reddit doesn't rank things by quality, it ranks them by popularity, and the difference between these two things becomes more and more apparent the larger a subreddit gets. You can push back against it a bit by banning or kind of artificially ""handicapping"" those types of content (by doing things like making people put images inside self-posts so they're harder to view), but in general the things that end up satisfying those biases best will tend to dominate the subreddit regardless."

TheoryOfReddit,388gs7,relic2279,2,Tue Jun 2 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"Really well thought-out post. Love it. One thing I want to address which you didn't seem to bring up is available knowledge.   If you let the community dictate your subreddit's rules or policies, you're letting a group who doesn't have all the available information or necessary experience call the shots. You know who does? Moderators. They are working behind the scenes every single day dealing with the day-to-day rigmarole, and many have been doing this for years. They're intimately knowledgeable about the community and subreddit, and have a very unique background. Some mods have built their subreddit up from scratch through sheer hard work and will. These people know what's best for their communities because they're the ones who spent years building those communities.  The general public does not have the relevant information nor the behind-the-scenes experience so they're forming their opinions out of ignorance. It's kind of like me having a say in the U.S's foreign policy. Sure, I'm slightly familiar with U.S foreign policy and am college educated, but to think I know as much (or better) than the Secretary of State or other people who actually do that for a living is ludicrous. They have much more relevant knowledge and experience at their fingertips because they're in the thick of things every single day.  Nowhere is this lack of knowledge is more obvious to me is when adding new moderators. Sometimes new mods will ask why such and such rule exists because it may not make sense to them, or seems excessive. You try to explain it to them and they kind of agree with you but sometimes you can tell they might not agree or are doubtful but don't want to seem rude since they're new and don't want to get into a debate. A few months in and that changes dramatically; you'll see those same mods arguing the finer points of that rule in modmail to users, and explaining why it exists better than even you could. They finally grasped why that rule is there and now agree with it. However if they had remained a regular user, they still would have thought the rule senseless.  The general public or community doesn't get to have that experience. They will never know why many of your rules exist and won't get to experience first hand the consequences of not having those rules or policies. This is why I personally believe that subreddit policies shouldn't be completely dictated by ""what the community wants"". That doesn't mean you shouldn't consider what they want, quite the opposite. You should consider what the community wants and then add your own relevant knowledge and experience to make the best decision for your subreddit. Sometimes this means acquiescing to the community, and sometimes it means going against the communities wishes. You have to do what you and your mod team think is best to keep the subreddit quality high."

TheoryOfReddit,37wmxi,ModsAreKillingReddit,10,Sun May 31 03:05:31 2015 UTC,I've seen most of those threads already. Perhaps I should have expanded a bit on my question the first time: why do you give enough of a shit to devote your life to this?
TheoryOfReddit,37wmxi,ArchangelleDovakin,0,Sun May 31 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, I'm tired of giving and not getting shit back so I said fuck it.  I'll show you just how patient I've been with you fuckers and give you all a lesson in demeaning torment.  The administration has become absurdly incompetent.  Remember the salary negotiation change?  Turns out they haven't even had to deal with competing offers yet because so few people want to work for this cancerous shithole.  I've spent far too much time and taken way too much shit as it is, so I'm having fun on the way out.  If reddit isn't going to be a free expression space that needs to be known so that people who value freedom know they need to GTFO.  Which ironically makes the horrendously stupid harassment policy a form of harassment under its own definition."
TheoryOfReddit,37wmxi,ModsAreKillingReddit,5,Sun May 31 03:22:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I'm asking this, but: did you know that reddit isn't actually all that important, and that the people like you who abuse the privilege of free expression here are the reason reddit as a company feels like they have to enforce stricter policies in order to grow their business?"
TheoryOfReddit,37wmxi,ArchangelleDovakin,0,Sun May 31 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree, do you remember /r/OperationGrabAss and the heyday of /r/OccupyWallStreet ?  That was IMO the peak of reddit as a community platform and it's all been downhill since then."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,Edoexplosivepawn,96,Sat May 30 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"The -100 cap happened about nine months ago.  In theory, positive karma comes from making the site a better place, and thus is a reward. Negative karma comes from making the site a worse place, and thus shouldn't be a reward. When obscene amounts of negative karma became something to be proud of, it went away."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,Halaku,10,Sat May 30 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"Though having lifetime karma does alter incentives.  The forum where users interact and share because they want to will perform differently than the one where they interact and share for points (where you get karma whoring, circle-jerking, and a strong disincentive to speak up against the hivemind)."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,Sutartsore,5,Sat May 30 13:27:26 2015 UTC,"I have quite a lot of karma, but I am not here to collect it. I just like to discuss and see people discussing the cool things I find online."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,brainburger,7,Sat May 30 13:58:15 2015 UTC,"I am not here to collect it   Then maybe not you, and maybe not exclusively for points, but knowing a permanent rating boost will be made to their account will influence many people's decisions of what/how/where to comment."

TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,itty53,12,Sat May 30 20:39:01 2015 UTC,There are too many people. Every top comment in popular threads would be maxed.
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,Aurabolt,8,Sat May 30 04:49:13 2015 UTC,"Alternatively: let Reddit internally still count all the upvotes, and use that to rank the actual comments, yet still only show us ""100"" and only give a 100 upvotes to the commenter?"
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,Yggval,11,Sat May 30 09:08:48 2015 UTC,"But then you run into this problem:  Submission: TIL that this thing happened - shown to have 100 points  Top comment: actually, here is the reason the submission is wrong - shown to have 100 points  Reply to top comment: actually, if you go through these links I've given, you can see why OP's title is correct - shown to have 100 points   In factual debates, people use upvotes to show which is the correct statement. That's why you'll see a comment at 62 points saying something, and the 278 point reply is refuting it. If we can't see thie difference between comments, we won't know why people have upvoted."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,UnholyDemigod,6,Sat May 30 13:46:33 2015 UTC,Upvotes are a terrible way to decide factuality and your comment kind of swings me towards liking the cap idea
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,grumpenprole,5,Sat May 30 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Just because your profile karma stops at -100, it doesn't stop people from still downvoting you.  In the same way, stopping your profile's ticker at 100 wouldn't stop your comments from getting upvoted."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,Sutartsore,3,Sat May 30 13:17:00 2015 UTC,"I see no problem with this, personally."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,Nth-Degree,9,Sat May 30 07:06:09 2015 UTC,"It would be great if a high positive comment score were an indication of someone who makes a positive contribution. But it doesn't. It's easy to farm karma from subreddits who are strongly focused on being 'for' or 'against' something, because karma is given when the like-minded agree with you.   And some people have built a cult of personality around their karma score, which is weird. So they play to their audience to build the numbers and people strive to be like them to get their coveted invite to subreddits like /r/centuryclub.   The -100 cap probably discouraged some low effort trolling, but it was based on a flawed assumption that all trolls were only trolling to get negative karma. A real troll just wants to stir the pot and get a reaction. They don't care about karma.   Capping negative karma at -100 just made it easier for real trolls to operate because you can't spot them as easily. There are examples curated by meta subreddits like /r/worstof where a ""wrong"" opinion being highlighted can have the chronically offended downvoting someone's post history for days as it makes the rounds. Those people aren't trolls, they're just on the wrong side of popular opinion. But I do realize that some people can't tell the difference.   I think that capping positive karma at 100 could increase quality a lot more than capping at -100 did. I'd be willing to bet a lot of people are invested in building a positive score through whatever means necessary would go away. And it would make reddit more inclusive since many subs limit ability to contribute based on comment score. Lowering the threshold allows more freedom of expression, which is what the admins want to foster."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,ReBurnInator,1 point,Sat May 30 12:50:31 2015 UTC,"Well I mean individual comments still have scores that go beyond -100, the only thing that is capped is your karma score that you can see from someone's profile. So you can still spot a downvote troll in an individual comment thread. Plus if you have been active for a while you are going to accumulate a decent amount of karma, so someone who isn't a troll is going to very rarely reach the -100 limit.  I agree that karma isn't a great indicator of the quality of a comment and many times people get obsessed with their karma score, which results in the website as a whole being negatively affected. But overall the admins want to encourage people to post content, which a karma score encourages."
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,sleepy55,1 point,Sat May 30 15:11:05 2015 UTC,"And some people have built a cult of personality around their karma score, which is weird. So they play to their audience to build the numbers and people strive to be like them to get their coveted invite to subreddits like /r/centuryclub[1] .   I don't really see how this is a problem. Reddit is about submitting content/commenting/creating communities, if people want to do that by sharing things that reddit likes (let's me honest, the defaults are basically facebook) then let them? They aren't doing any harm to you by finding like minded people. Though some of them are weird."

TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,clickstation,17,Sat May 30 10:46:39 2015 UTC,Karma is obtained by posting good content   Karma is obtained by posting popular content that agrees with the currently prevailing opinions on reddit.   Its a straight up quantification of how much you conform.
TheoryOfReddit,37siyc,jmottram08,2,Sat May 30 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the only way one can have a popular opinion is by ""conforming""....

(Though, of course, you phrased it as a question, so you don't necessarily agree with it too :p)   It is a possibility, I guess.   There's also the possibility that actual contribution would also decrease, because, come on, those take even more effort than short jokes and insider references."

Here's an example:  Big Discussion Subreddits  Small Discussion Subreddits  Every subreddit will always have at least one post on any widget, so even a widget that has /r/pics and /r/photography will display one or two /r/photography posts. You can have up to ten posts on a widget, so 4-5 subreddits per widget is ideal, imo.  Best part is this: I haven't seen the front page, or even /r/all, in the past two years, unless I've wanted to.

Given how reddit operates there isn't another way that doesn't involve multiple profiles which I would consider tddious.
TheoryOfReddit,37t7zw,ethicaldilemna,4,Sat May 30 06:35:57 2015 UTC,You could roll all your niche sub's into a multi. I don't know how well it works though. I just unsub from anything I'm not particularly interested in.

TheoryOfReddit,37renp,erktheerk,10,Fri May 29 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"Where has this divide come from between mods and users?   First of all, the divide comes from the fact that mods and users sees things from a different perspective.  Mods have access to the modqueue, removed content, modmail, internal discussions etc while regular users obviously do not. This gives them a different perspective as to the state of the subreddit. I have a feeling that if users could see what the mods see, many of them would be more sympathetic or even supportive of the mods.  Secondly, the divide also comes from a general lack of dialogue between users and moderators.  The mods aren't entirely to blame for this: some mods have had bad experiences when trying to establish dialogue with users (although it was mostly because they tried having a dialogue after shit hit the fan). But basically, for most subreddits, there is a lack of open discussion about the state of the subreddit. I think most subreddits would benefit from the mods soliciting more user feedback (in a thread, not through modmail) and/or having a regular ""state of the subreddit"" discussion.  Mods also don't do enough to explain their actions. Ideally, the rationale for every rule and every removal should be explained, but mods often don't do this either because they feel that they are not obligated to (""we can run the subreddit as we see fit and don't owe anyone an explanation"") or because they feel that it is painfully obvious from their perspective and so does not need to be explained.  But to the users, this can make it seem as if the mods are acting unreasonably or even corrupt. After all, people tend to fill in their own blanks when there's no explanation given,. This is how we end up with all those crazy conspiracy theories about the mods."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,theKingMan,1 point,Sat May 30 06:52:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your post, but I think you're dismissing one big factor in the divide. The power gap. When the users want to do something one way, but the mods want to do it another way, the mods always win.   A good example of this was recently seen in /r/pcmasterrace. There was a near unanimous consensus that the banner should be changed, but the mods refused to change it. I think users understand fine that sometimes mods are going to remove stuff for the greater good of the sub for reasons that they may not understand. What is a lot more hard to swallow though, is when the community has reached a consensus on something that seems fairly simple to change, but the people in power choose not to change it."

TheoryOfReddit,37renp,hansjens47,3,Fri May 29 20:59:54 2015 UTC,Wow. That's interesting news. I was only using AskReddit as an example because out of all the defaults I have scanned so far it is the biggest in terms of post history. I guess this is a better representation of a mod free week than I thought based on traffic...  Though... I need to scan LeagueOfLegends and narrow down the amount of users posting compared to askreddit. I think that plays a role. If power users stick to the intention of the sub it'll stay that way longer as opposed to a default seen by everyone.
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,jhc1415,18,Fri May 29 21:11:45 2015 UTC,Can you really just let the upvotes decide with 2/3 of a million users and hope the integrity of the sub is maintained?   No.   This is the policy /r/funny and /r/pics have had forever. Their rules are very vague and they both have horrible content regularly reach the front page and stay there.
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,coscorrodrift,5,Sat May 30 03:02:16 2015 UTC,Horrible in what sense? Do you know of any notorious examples?
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,jhc1415,0,Sat May 30 11:59:32 2015 UTC,Go to /r/summerreddit or /r/shitposts. They have a huge collection of them.  Or go to /r/funny and honestly tell me how many of those posts make you laugh.
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,UnholyDemigod,19,Sat May 30 15:42:41 2015 UTC,"What would happen if a subreddit like leagueoflegends continues to go unmoderated?   It will devolve. Badly. The only reason it remains visibly fine (I haven't ventured into /new, nor will I) is because people are actually using their votes to moderate simply to spite the mods. To show them that they can go a week without moderating. Even though the fact that the admins have had to step in twice - the first on a post that was submitted minutes after the announcement was made - proves that you need moderating. If no mods was the norm, the sub would be terrible because the users would to be trying to prove anything.    What would happen if you scaled it up? Say Askreddit did a week?   As an /r/AskReddit mod...terrifying. In a normal week there are already thousands of actions. If we let people have free reign? Unbearable.    Where has this divide come from between mods and users?   This is really going to draw ire from the general userbase, but the fact that the mods are mature, and the users are not. Now yes, there are exceptions. This subreddit proves that there are a large number of users who have the maturity for meaningful discussion and the ability and desire to see the maintaining of rules. /r/leagueoflegends is not that place. The average user age is 16. Compare a normal 16 year old to someone who is volunteering to enforce rules, and you'll see the divide quite easily.    Can you really just let the upvotes decide with 2/3 of a million users and hope the integrity of the sub is maintained?   Not for very long. /r/atheism tried it. Look what happened there."

The average user age is 16. Compare a normal 16 year old to someone who is volunteering to enforce rules, and you'll see the divide quite easily.   The divide, in my view, is not so much ""mature"" vs ""not mature"" but rather ""casual"" vs ""serious"". There are two types of redditors: the ""casual"" redditor who comes to reddit to chill and hang out, and the ""serious"" redditor who comes for ""quality"" content and meaningful discussion. There are some redditors who use reddit for both purposes, but the two groups are mostly mutually exclusive.  Among users, the former group outnumber the latter by far (in most large subreddits), but among mods, the opposite is true. So it's not that the mods are mature and the users are not, it just that they are looking to get different things out of their reddit experience. The majority of reddit users aren't looking for ""quality"" or ""meaningful discussion"", they see reddit as an online lounge and being on reddit as the online equivalent of chilling with friends.  And just as you're probably not going to insist on ""quality"" when you're having a casual conversation with your friend in real life, they don't care about ""quality"" either. In fact, some of them think it's silly that the mods keep using that word. But of course most mods care a lot about quality: it's probably why they became mods in the first place. Hence the divide."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,UnholyDemigod,2,Sat May 30 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"That is a fair point, but there are a lot of cases where it's quite clear that a 'serious' user is also an immature one."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,cantCme,6,Sat May 30 08:09:10 2015 UTC,I still don't understand why users think the mods owe them something. Everyone knows the top mod has control and all the users can do is go elsewhere. Why are they trying to force the mods to do something and when they don't comply (probably because they know it won't work) keep complaining instead of creating a new sub or move. It can be done.   Is it a small (very) vocal minority thing?
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,poptart2nd,7,Sat May 30 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"instead of creating a new sub or move. It can be done.   no, it really can't. the only instance I can think of when it was successful was the migration from /r/marijuana to /r/trees over 5 years ago. the transition from /r/lgbt to /r/ainbow (after the former became part of the SRS ""fempire"") enjoyed success at first until the mods just started to censor everything. This is the biggest problem with a mass migration: the mods can just instantly remove any ""this sub's mods are terrible, come here instead"" posts. In a perfect world, i'd agree with you, but there's no place for users to organize a mass protest like that beyond just complaining to the current mods."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,Mattyoungbull,5,Sat May 30 02:27:50 2015 UTC,I think /r/gaming to /r/games was a pretty successful migration until /r/games became too popular.
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,poptart2nd,3,Sat May 30 09:46:06 2015 UTC,"That's not really a migration, though; they fill different niches. In either case, it occurred because the mods of /r/gaming were complicit in the formation of /r/games, directing people over there if they wanted higher quality discussion."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,TheHardTruth,3,Sat May 30 10:27:18 2015 UTC,"no, it really can't.    Yes, it can. There is evidence of it happening as you yourself have provided. The pertinent fact you're leaving out is that /r/Trees didn't surpass /r/Marijuana overnight. It took years.   And that's the problem. People want a new community to spring up and supplant the old one and have a million subscribers overnight. It doesn't work that way, it shouldn't work that way. /r/LeagueofLegends didn't get their 700k subscribers overnight, why should the new competitor get that? It took years of hard work for them to build their subreddit and a competitor would have to work, at minimum, equally hard.   But the problem is, the complainers don't want to wait a couple years for a new competing community to build itself up."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,theKingMan,2,Sat May 30 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"This doesn't apply to default subreddits though, because they get new subscribers automatically as well as front page visibility. So there's really no way to ""compete"" with a default sub, unless you lobby the admins to remove it from the defaults. But even then, the now-former default still has a huge advantage in terms of number of subscribers."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,poptart2nd,2,Sat May 30 07:43:50 2015 UTC,"Even if they did wait a few years for a new community, controversies only last a few days or weeks at most. Beyond that, people will grumble and accept the controversy as the new reality. Despite not liking it, most people will continue with the main sub because the community is much more active than the smaller, better sub.   Just look at Facebook for an excellent example. Every time they come out with a new layout, people all complain, but no one ever jumps ship because no other website is active enough to entice users, even if the website is ""better"" than Facebook."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,jhc1415,4,Sat May 30 10:36:32 2015 UTC,/r/cubs had a pretty successful transition to /r/CHICubs a few months ago after some mod drama. They got support from all the sister Chicago sports subs along with /r/baseball so I don't think it was that hard.
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,poptart2nd,1 point,Sat May 30 03:12:15 2015 UTC,Sports subs I think would have an easier time with this because they can always go to /r/baseball or /r/sports to air their grievances.
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,syzlack,1 point,Sat May 30 10:30:46 2015 UTC,"Team related subreddits are generally a sub community of the sport they play. /r/baseball had a mod post telling people to use /r/CHICubs and they link to CHICubs as their 'official' cubs discussion subreddit. And /r/CHICubs is still not nearly as big as /r/Cubs (although I'm guessing many of these subscribers are inactive. Cubs seems to have more upvotes on bigger threads, CHICubs seems to have more discussion)  http://redditmetrics.com/r/Cubs#compare=chicubs"

TheoryOfReddit,37renp,jhc1415,2,Sat May 30 04:14:59 2015 UTC,"4k in just two months. That kind of growth is pretty impressive.   And I don't think numbers are everything. It's the quality of the content and users that really matters. Just compare each of their game day threads from today. /r/cubs was a ghost town while /r/chicubs had hundreds of comments. The users that have moved are clearly the most active.   That's really all that matters and what makes a good, healthy subreddit.   I agree that moving a big subreddit like LoL is more difficult, but it is still easily doable if you put enough effort into it and have good communication."
TheoryOfReddit,37renp,Werner__Herzog,2,Sat May 30 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"They did create a new sub: /r/RiotFreeLoL. The problem is it's full of complains about the lol mods and has the worst, most toxic users so the mods over there already have the same problems."

It'd be /r/leagueofmeme's+gaming   What would happen if you scaled it up? Say Askreddit did a week?   Wouldn't be surprised if the admins said no. But that doesn't have any real weight unless defaults have special rules.   Where has this divide come from between mods and users?   From an E-Sports Journalist who seriously can't control his temper and lashes at anyone who criticizes him and launches a twitter brigade on comments he disagrees with.   Can you really just let the upvotes decide with 2/3 of a million users and hope the integrity of the sub is maintained?   No. Because upvotes/downvotes are part of the reason why we're in this predicament.  Here's what lead to this mod free week   Let the up/down votes decide the front page   Ok.

TheoryOfReddit,37qcum,armedrobbery,1 point,Fri May 29 23:40:17 2015 UTC,"See, that would make sense, but people have replied with this line to various downvoted comments I've made in the past, and nearly all of them have reversed the trend and recovered, usually ending up with a positive score.   Obviously it also has to do with how convincing the counter-argument against downvotes is as well though. Some comments aren't going to be saved regardless of anyone claiming that the downvotes the post receives are unwarranted. But even in those cases I suspect the ferocity of the downvoting is lessened.  Reddit is a very hiveminded place. When presented with so much new information about topics you haven't really considered before, the easiest thing for people to do is borrow someone else's opinion on it, and vote accordingly."
TheoryOfReddit,37qcum,teh_hasay,41,Sat May 30 08:34:30 2015 UTC,"I think its because it calls attention to the downvoted post. often times I wont notice the score of a comment unless specifically mentioned.  And when you see something downvoted that clearly shouldnt be, you upvote."
TheoryOfReddit,37qcum,rpjesus,7,Fri May 29 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"The first person to see a comment is often times the OP. I normally see this when the comment in question disagrees with OP or tries to debunk the link. In which case, it is most often times OP being a prick to save his submission."
TheoryOfReddit,37qcum,FelixR1991,-7,Fri May 29 20:48:05 2015 UTC,So are you accusing this OP of vote manipulation? Reddit automatically puts your vote on a comment when it is submitted. I'm not sure what else an OP could do.

I always downvote that, even if it's a perfectly acceptable comment or I have no clue why they wrote that. It's almost reflexive. I don't downvote often either.  Maybe that's just me, and I can't even put my finger on exactly why I do that. This doesn't work in the reverse though - I am not more likely (at least consciously) to upvote if I see a comment about 'i don't know why you are being downvoted.'"

If you look at the date/time of the parent comment and the ""I don't know why this is being downvoted..."" reply, they're usually within minutes of each other. Not enough time was given or considered before somebody got offended that someone dared disagree with the comment being made.  You rarely see this comment being made to posts that have been up for several hours. It's people monitoring a thread trying to game the system because it often works. Which is stupid, and that's why I downvote them.  P.S. I also downvote those comments that are edited with ""why all the downvotes?!?"". It's the same principle: often the edit occurs very shortly after it was made and before enough people had a chance to see it.

Two: because libertarians are a minority, even on Reddit. Liberals and conservatives don't feel pressured to join /r/liberal or /r/conservative (or /r/Democrats or /r/Republicans, etc. etc. etc.) because their views are widely represented and they don't need that kind of reinforcement: the rest of Reddit is their forum.  Libertarians need a special forum because their views are often handled critically elsewhere. Yes, Reddit as a whole is more libertarian than the usual political map, but libertarians as a whole still have a ton of ideological baggage which doesn't fly in most places on Reddit.  Liberals and conservatives can discuss things pretty much anywhere on reddit generally. Libertarians tend to get shouted down."
TheoryOfReddit,37q4nw,adminbeast,14,Fri May 29 15:04:54 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Same reason /r/paleo has so many members but there isn't even an /r/fatassamerican.
TheoryOfReddit,37q4nw,gunch,6,Fri May 29 19:56:35 2015 UTC,I think you have given the most logical reasoning behind this.

Republicans and conservatives can have libertarian views, but it's way different from being a Libertarian in general.  For example, I'm a huge proponent of a free market and Capitalism, but those views get shot down on pretty much most of Reddit. On /r/libertarian, even though I may not subscribe to the libertarian agenda on other issues, I'd feel more comfortable sharing my very pro-free market views there than elsewhere.  tl;dr Here's my personal experience to confirm the theory presented."

Three general options come to mind for me, each with its own problems:   Amend the constitution. It has a built-in mechanism for doing that, as it was intended to be changed when needed. That process is intentionally difficult, as making lots of changes to the most fundamental law of a country is dangerous to its stability. Problem: it's hard; it takes a long time, and attempts at amendments usually fail. Ignore the constitution. There's plenty of precedent for governments or people working for governments ignoring the law and operating as they saw fit for extended periods of time. Problem: most of those precedents were horrible places to live unless you were the dictator or one of his cronies. Use creative interpretations of the constitution to get around it, sometimes. This is what actually happens most of the time in the US. This is essentially a watered down version of ignoring the law, tempered by checks and balances. It's a little unpredictable, and has brought us things like the Federal war on drugs, which is arguably a miserable failure.

I do not believe a majority of the constitution's authors shared that view.  That said, I don't disagree with you in principle. I'd like to see a time limit put on all laws. If nothing else, it would give lawmakers something useful to do instead of just piling new laws on top of the old ones.

When buildings were burning, Crassus and his purposely-trained crew would show up, and Crassus would offer to purchase the presumably doomed property and perhaps neighboring endangered properties from their owners for speculatively low sums; if the purchase offer was accepted, Crassus would then use his army of some 500 slaves which he purchased due to their knowledge of architecture and building to put the fire out, sometimes before too much damage had been done: otherwise Crassus would use his crews to rebuild.

There was starting to be some backlash against Ron Paul posts that were too specific to supporters and had no appeal to a general audience about the time user-created subreddits came out in beta. /r/ronpaul was one of the first, but posts about him remained popular on /r/reddit.com.  By 2012, mainstream left-leaning politics was the norm on reddit as a whole. /r/reddit.com as a front page was gone, but it would have been quite unusual for an article supporting Ron Paul, Gary Johnson or any other libertarian candidate to make it to the top of /r/politics."

Because there's a conflict of interest when McDonalds owns /r/McDonalds. /o/ would signify that you're getting the corporate line. Brands should be prohibited from having any moderators in a /r/ subreddit.  Participating in a subreddit is fine as long as they acknowledge they are employees for the brand in question, either by flair or a signature / disclosure in each post.    Most of Reddit and most younger people in general don't give a fuck about journalistic standards, or ethics in a broad sense.

I know someone who works at a game company and PR people and employees check their subs for their games and company regularly. I think that is a good business practice, but as a consumer, I would like to know when posts and responses come from an official channel, or even an official ""I work there,"" as the company would allow.   It also opens up a forum for people praise/voice concerns/bitch directly at the company if they so choose, instead of going to Twitter and maybe getting a response or in the non-official sub and it not be heard.   It could have the potential for both the companies and consumers to have a real and accountable conversation about products.

Also, reddit would have to enforce some sort of guideline on who has the rights to official subreddits. Should /o/Nissan go to the computer shop that currently owns nissan.com or should it go to the multi-national vehicle company? There are thousands of similar disputes over domain names that enter the legal system so if reddit has some sort of official endorsement program they'll need to be prepared to handle these issues.

It's like doing an experiment on your children and telling them that you're testing them to see if giving them candy makes them hyperactive because that's a bad thing. So you give your children candy and then they purposefully go out of their way to behave because they (obviously) don't want you to stop giving them more candy.   If you want accurate results, you can't tell anyone at all that you're doing a mod-free week. Just stay mum about the whole thing and remove blatant spam or anything else that breaks reddit's sidewide rules (witchhunting, personal info/doxxing, etc). Then see how long until your users notice and start complaining. My guess is it won't be very long.  More than that, these kinds of things shouldn't be done to ""prove"" anything to anyone. A few subreddits have done the whole no-mod thing before and the only thing it proved is that reddit has a very, very short memory. :P A month or two after the event, very few will remember or care about your no-mod week.

TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,Handuer,1 point,Thu May 28 17:56:03 2015 UTC,"Would any subreddit be willing to do this though?   Yeah, actually I think some may try it out. From my experience in dealing with other mods and some of the private mod subreddits, it's an idea that gets tossed around a lot which is why subreddits try it from time to time.    If your argument is that it won't work and you also will refute any proof that suggests it would work   I do admit it would be hard for me to change my mind on the subject. But that's because the evidence is so strongly in favor of my opinion. It's practically overwhelming. Not that you're entirely wrong either; I think self-moderation can work quite well in smaller or niche communities. However, once a community reaches a certain tipping point or popularity threshold, it needs strict moderation to retain any semblance of quality and to remain on topic. The quality of the content and community is almost exclusively connected to the amount of moderation taking place.  There are some variables at play though. The community in /r/physics, for example, may require less moderation than a general interest community like /r/Pics. That is largely due to the demographic and make up of said communities.  I should note that we did sort of try a no-mod month in /r/Videos once. It wasn't a purposeful attempt however, it was largely due to neglect. We had our bots going removing spam and such, but we (the mods) just weren't active at the time. It was sort of a perfect storm where everyone was busy with real life stuff and not really devoting any attention to the sub. The subreddit took a severe turn for the worse. It was so bad that we were getting modmails from the admins once a week (sometimes every other day) about cleaning things up. Finally, in the end, they were practically begging for us to add more mods. That's when we added 20+ more mods onto the team. It was something we should had taken care of long before reaching that point and I apologize to the admins for the headaches our lack of attention caused."

Just stay mum about the whole thing and remove blatant spam or anything else that breaks reddit's sidewide rules (witchhunting, personal info/doxxing, etc). Then see how long until your users notice and start complaining.   Given how slipshod, slow and arbitrary reddit moderation tends to be in many cases, I'm not convinced that this is in any way different from how things already work in most of the large subs (and quite a few of the smaller ones as well)."

TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,GothicFuck,0,Thu May 28 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"Sure, but at the end of the day, the mods are responsible for the community. This isn't like usenet where moderation is informal at best and comments can't generally be disappeared. Reddit is a much more controllable platform.  Popularity increases noise, sure. That's not in question. If the mods aren't keeping a good enough handle on it, though, that's on them. Just saying ""too many people, can't do anything with it"" is just abdicating responsibility.  My entire point is the reason the defaults suck is not just because they're popular, but because the people running the defaults do a poor job of handling it, with policy, with procedure, with everything. Part of it is just sheer manpower. Consider something like /r/technology - ~5.1M subscribed, and 15 humans running it (and two bots). That works out to ~340,000 people per person, and that's assuming that all of the mods there are dedicated exclusively to that sub.  Do you think you, personally, could handle the demands of managing a community of 340K people?"
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,vertexoflife,1 point,Thu May 28 15:30:06 2015 UTC,"...  Theres a lot which is wrong in your argument, which is compounded by the fact that it sounds better because you do get some things right.  Firstly - its an unpaid constant volunteer position.   Secondly - post the team size crossing 7-8 active people, organization becomes hard, and then fails almost entierly as the team scales.   Second sub 1 - This means that for an effective mod team to exist, by your criteria (sufficient manpower to manage a community) you need a layer of management. In other words, you very quickly reach a stage that you need paid workers to actually manage a sub if you scale the man power.  Third - Its drudge work, its only being handled by people because the first, second and third waves of mods care enough about their reddits to try (in general - many mods are not nice).  Under these constraints, its not possible to manage a default subreddit or any forum once it grows beyond a certain size.  Side point - power on a forum also favors people who have time."
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,TheEnigmaBlade,0,Thu May 28 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"Firstly - its an unpaid constant volunteer position.   This only limits the amount of people that would do the job, not how effectively they do it.

This means that for an effective mod team to exist, by your criteria (sufficient manpower to manage a community) you need a layer of management. In other words, you very quickly reach a stage that you need paid workers to actually manage a sub if you scale the man power.   What? No, not at all. You need a layer of management (or consensus, rather than a top-down hierarchy), yes, but there's absolutely no reason that has to be a paid position. Again, I'm not sure where you come up with this conclusion that the only people who can manage a community are those that receive dollars to do so.

There was some sketchy activity over at /r/technology which prompted users to create /r/tech. Which is great, except for the fact that when you google reddit tech, it takes you to the /r/technology sub. People would simply steal content from /r/tech and post it on /r/technology for more karma. Once a sub has gained traction, its impossible for a competitor to arise, except for a handful of isolated incidents.

TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,rosecenter,18,Thu May 28 20:46:21 2015 UTC,I think one needs to differentiate between strict moderation in order to build up and shape a sub and bottom-of-the-barrel type moderation in order to keep the scum out.  /r/science is a popular example of a large sub that employs heavy moderation and is an entirely different sub than it would be without moderation as evidenced by the hundreds of deleted comments. So moderation is obviously necessary if that's the goal. /r/askhistorians is even more extreme and dense with value because of it.  On the other hand if the sub is just meant to be an open form for a community then the communal moderation of downvotes is almost sufficient.
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,ArchangelleDovakin,3,Thu May 28 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"Right, and the issues are different.if we went mod free in /r/askhistorians or /r/history it would be pretty fast that contrafactual history would show up.

Instead there are a few different purposes:   To give us a break to work on other subreddit-related projects. We had a rules rework project that was getting stalled, a new CSS theme that got shelved until I could get around to finishing it, and an aggressive search for new mods. To give us (specifically the mods) a better idea of the content the community deems upvote-worthy. Sure, image posts get upvoted more, but there are other content types that also deserve some mod attention. To force education of reddit, its rules, and how to be a productive redditor. Probably the best thing to come out of this week, at least so far, is the push for users to look at and vote in new. We had to aggressively moderate posts before because the users were doing jack shit. And then they complained about it! Ha! Joke's on them, they're now doing what we wanted them to do. Somewhat related to point 3, but to cut down on the stupid factionalism that's developed in the subreddit in the past year or two. The behavior of more radical anti-mod faction is only hurting the subreddit even though they think their actions are just. Doxxing the mods doesn't encourage us leaving and new mods taking our place, nor do death threats and constant SJW accusations.   Do I think it's been a success so far? Mostly. Many misinformed meta posts have been made in the past few days, but I've been happy to see a majority of users correcting them in the comments.  The only aspect of this experiment left is to see if the downvote army (somewhat derived from the anti-mod faction) will last until the end of the week and especially after the week ends."
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,Richie-Rich,10,Thu May 28 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's possible to determine what proportion of submission votes are conducted in /r/~/new/ rather than any of the other subreddit tabs. Graphing this over time, I would not be surprised to see rapid decay."
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,CupBeEmpty,3,Wed May 27 23:37:03 2015 UTC,"Based on the meta posts, it currently it seems the majority of the users consider the experiment a ""success"" and prefer the subreddit without moderation. Assuming the status quo stays until the end of the week, do you think factionalism will increase as people use the experiment to justify that they don't need no mods?"
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,CupBeEmpty,2,Thu May 28 12:03:18 2015 UTC,"Well, going back and reading what I wrote, it seems I explained the fourth point wrong. We're after increasing inter-community discussion about the rules rather than mods v. community discussion (decreasing factionalism) as well as consistent downvoting of mods regardless of what a mod says. It's more of a stretch, but it's the least important point of the mod-free week. We're trying to fix it in other ways."
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,Epistaxis,2,Thu May 28 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"I think it also makes a difference to some people (maybe not the staunchly antimod types) when the community is asked to submit or nominate moderators rather than just appointing people at random. This gives the modteam the opportunity to say what the moderators will be doing, the tone of the community, and even take feedback from the community at large. Of course, I'm being optimistic that it doesn't turn into a shitshow.   There's often times where I've seen a modlist grow and none of those people were ever active members at all, they were just friends of other moderators. Personally, I don't think moderating reddit would be a good use of my time but I can see where people would feel like an ""in-crowd"" develops. It could lead to changes a subreddit to be basically a little kingdom based on what a few people want. Plus even if its just ""we needed another janitor"" it can be perceived as non-transparent.  I don't play LoL nor have I visited but I'd say in a situation like that, having a moderation team made up of people who are prominent in the subreddit and are openly named, not just added one day, makes a huge difference in reducing the traction of the most vocal anti-moderation people."
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,TheReasonableCamel,2,Thu May 28 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about how the experiment is going to end. More specifically I don't see how point 4 is going to pan out in the short to medium term.   If the mods take a break, everything looks okay, and then come back, how will that lower anti-mod sentiment? It seems like users will just be more upset with the mods than ever. Honestly, average users didn't really have to take sides on the moderation issue before. This event seems to force users to choose a faction more than ever. In this respect, I think point 4 may end up overshadowing all other successes and turn this event into a colossal failure. But hopefully you guys have some grand plan to end this in a positive way."

TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,asshole_for_a_reason,7,Thu May 28 18:30:22 2015 UTC,I had a feeling it was a game sub. I would find it much more surprising if a news subreddit or sports subreddit like /r/nba or /r/nfl went unmoderated and things went smoothly.
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,Gusfoo,13,Thu May 28 03:02:09 2015 UTC,"/r/LoL wasn't a quality sub to begin with, and regularly hosted a lot of really acerbic arguments and content free shitposts."

In other words: it's a sub filled mostly with immature boys."
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,Sansa_Culotte_,3,Wed May 27 21:41:51 2015 UTC,Honestly I just did not want to start a witchunt/war. I'm interested in the general idea not the specific sub.
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,chalkchick0,11,Wed May 27 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just did not want to start a witchunt/war. I'm interested in the general idea not the specific sub.   I know some of the mods here have similiar concerns, but it's hard to have a discussion on theory when you aren't allowed to cite examples to back up your arguments.  Anyway, I think every subreddit should have ""mod-free week"". If it's a failure, then ""mod-free week"" can really boost the popularity of the mods or at least convince the userbase that moderation is a necessary evil.  And if it's a success, it demonstrates that community self-moderation generally works (of course some degree of mod intervention will always be necessary, even if it's only in exceptional circumstances). This means that it's the fastest way to solve ""mod drama"" and should be considered especially in subs where the mods are unpopular with the userbase.  I know some subreddits have actually considered the idea (or even a mod-free day just for April Fool's), but haven't gone through with it because they're worried about the aftermath (it might get messy and then they'll have to clean it up)."
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,chalkchick0,2,Wed May 27 23:11:29 2015 UTC,Yep. Agreed completely. I would love to see this become a thing on other subs as well.
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,lokigodofchaos,4,Thu May 28 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"It seems like the mods were trying to prevent the subreddit from turning into a 'default' like /r/gaming or something (which is an absolute dump in my opinion). However, I do think their level of arbitration was too high.   What does this experiment say about the off repeated like that mods are necessary to keep subs from going downhill?   It's only been a few days, this says little about the direction the sub will take if it goes without mods for longer. I personally agree that some degree of moderation is necessary, and that if the mods decide to retire after the week is over (highly unlikely), then eventually the subreddit will turn into a meme factory like /r/gaming.  The most noticable effect of the mods being gone, however, is in the comments section. Every other post's top comment has a reply to the effect of ""MAJOR ______ SPOILERS BELOW DON'T CLICK!!1!!one!"" because there are no mods to delete the posts. Regardless of the need for mods to arbitrate the type of content in their sub, I do think they need to at least police the comment section"
TheoryOfReddit,37iftp,lokigodofchaos,3,Thu May 28 01:51:27 2015 UTC,"A sub that I mod (which has a ton of rules) has a Facebook version of our sub. We aren't affiliated with it in any way and it is essentially unmoderated. If you compare the quality of stuff posted there and stuff posted in our sub, there is a night and day difference. They have low quality posts and most decent stuff is stolen from reddit or worse, stolen from 9gag, which took it from reddit.  I believe in fascist moderation."

TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,Hedonopoly,119,Wed May 27 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"Lived in Minnesota for 22 years.  It is a liberal and technological state, more so than other mid west states that might have an ""identity crisis"". Minneapolis is home to a ton of tech jobs and is one of the more liberal cities in the country. Because of this you get a lot of Minnesotans on reddits.  People are proud of their state, Minneapolis is like a clean, cheap and less crowded version of Brooklyn.   There isn't a lot to be shameful of in Minnesota. South Dakota and North Dakota have much lower city populations.  Most Minnesotans live in the Twin Cities area so they have very similar experiences, not like NYC where someone living in Midtown has a very different experience than someone in red hook.  I think the state is unique because of the liberal and technological culture it is in a unique position that it is one of few places that has an abundance of outdoor life. So even though many live in urban or suburban areas there is very easy access to lakes, fishing, camping, hiking and all sorts of outdoors activities. Probably more or at least equal than anywhere else with a similar population.  I actually went through the NFL sub reddits and the minnesota vikings have a very large following, probably top 10, and I think a lot of it has to do with what I mentioned. Technical and liberal culture with a strong identity and in a unique position."

TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,DeadDoug,29,Wed May 27 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"I'm from Minnesota and I, for a reason not totally clear to me, completely freak out with joy every time I see something about my state on Reddit or Imgur. I'm not even that patriotic as an American but goddamnit I love Minnesota. Anyway, here's my theory: Minnesota isn't featured in very many movies or tv shows and when it is, it's usually a hysterically inaccurate portrayal (like in Drop Dead Gorgeous--I'm not hating though, I love that movie). So we get really excited when we hear our state name on widespread media (as long as it's not about something stupid or embarrassing). Second, most Minnesotans are born there, raised there, live there, and die there. We love Minnesota. I know TONS of people who have lived in other states after high school and have returned to Minnesota just because nowhere else seems quite as good. I currently live in Iowa while my fiancé finishes school and I cannot wait to move back to MN when he's done next year. And finally, I think Minnesotans have a lot to be proud of but it doesn't come up much. So when someone online mentions the state, Minnesotans come crawling out of the woodwork and release their bottled-up pride like crazy. Edit: Spelling"

TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,MaddestMoxxi,18,Wed May 27 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"I've never lived in Minnesota, but having lived in both Ohio and Kentucky I might be able to venture some guesses.  First off, Minnesota has one large urban area - the Twin Cities. Not so in Ohio, which has multiple midsize cities that all seem to have a certain casual contempt toward each other. Cincinnati: ""Oh, this is the good part of Ohio - now [ insert Cleveland / Toledo / Dayton / Youngstown], what a shithole. Columbus is OK, but really flat and kind of boring."" Columbus: ""Oh, this is the good part of Ohio, everywhere else sucks."" etc.    In Kentucky you have the rivalry between Lexington and Louisville, where Louisville wishes it were as good at college basketball as Lexington is, and Lexington wishes it were as good as Louisville at everything else (I kid, I kid).  Basically what I'm getting at is that in those other states, identity is more formed on the city level, while in Minnesota, since the Twin Cities is the only large urban area, its identity becomes the state identity. You'll notice that the Minnesota Twins / Vikings aren't called the Minneapolis / St. Paul Twins / Vikings. So to a certain extent the Minnesota Karma Train has to be understood as really being the Minneapolis / St. Paul Karma Train.  My second point is a bit more speculative, not having lived in Minnesota - it may be more culturally homogenous and liberal across the urban/rural divide compared to Kentucky and Ohio, where the divide is very sharp. Ohio has fairly liberal cities surrounded by vast expanses of farmland dotted with HELL IS REAL signs and formerly the late Touchdown Jesus (RIP). It's an election battleground state for a reason. In Kentucky, Lexington is a quite liberal oversize college town whose current mayor has been elected twice despite being openly gay, while rural Kentucky keeps voting in Mitch McConnell, and the eastern part of the state is one of the poorest regions in the nation.  So those are my best guesses on the matter. Culturally homogenous and one major city, which is quite liberal. Liberals from Kentucky and Ohio might be proud of their cities, but not generally their states. Minnesota on the other hand..."
TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,TRK27,7,Tue May 26 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"I was born in Minneapolis and raised in St. Paul and can say that the vicinity prevents any real contempt. Opposed to other states that have several large urban areas, MN only has one, just as you stated. So while cities in other states compete, Minneapolis and St. Paul have a certain synergy that people need to embrace if they want to fully appreciate everything that both cities have to offer. Minneapolis is one of the most progressive and technologically advanced cities in the U.S. while St. Paul is more historic and and somewhat quieter. No one would deny that Minneapolis has a more active nightlife. Sure it's fun to stumble down West 7th or Summit when you're drunk. But Minneapolis having the U of M, a more active nightlife just comes with the territory. It has a lot more venues for concerts and other shows. The only real venues in St. Paul are The Excel and The Orpheum. St. Paul on the other hand has the best food hands down, and as a city overall, I would put it up against any U.S. city in terms of food. Lots of generational, family owned restaurants like Cosetta's and DeGiddio's. Glockenspiel has the best German food I've ever had. It seems St. Paul is more family oriented as well, having the science museum and whatnot. So while other cities may have districts for entertainment, shopping and food, MPLS and STP play off each other for that. It's not so much a rivalry but a geographical system of checks and balances. There's a local saying, ""You date Minneapolis but you marry St. Paul"". So even people who prefer one city to the other won't talk to harshly about the city next to them, because no matter how much they love MPLS or STP, they'll have to go to the other at some point."
TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,DasApostle,13,Sun Jul 5 11:03:38 2015 UTC,"There is a pretty strong rivalry between Minneapolis and St. Paul though. It is friendly for the most part though and very few people from either city would call the other a ""shit hole.""  Also, the outer burbs of Minnesota are extremely conservative. This is Michelle Bachman territory.  The outsiders take on it is interesting."
TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,ifeellazy,13,Mon Jul 6 15:38:18 2015 UTC,I think the two cities being directly next to each other doesn't allow for a true rivalry like the others he mentioned. It's like having a rivalry with your twin as opposed to an asshole at school that you hate.

I have found that myself and other Minnesotans have a very keen interest in the way our state is perceived. People from New Jersey don't really defend NJ, people from the south will often defend the south, but many will not believe it or offer strong counterpoints - as well as the fact that many people on Reddit live there or have visited, it's possible not a ton of people who don't live in Minnesota know enough about it to refute the Karma Train. Minnesotans defend Minnesota. We take pride in our ability to survive the winters and I think we convince ourselves that it must all be worth it, Minnesota must be special that we would put ourselves through the hardships. Whenever something that puts our state in a bad light comes up I am pained greatly. We want to be more than flyover country, and personally, I think we are. We're a medical and technological hub of at least some significance, we have a well educated and healthy population, we're something like the 13th largest metro area in the US. Not huge, but nothing to scoff at."

I'm legitimately excited when I find other Minnesotans outside of Minnesota and usually they are excited to see me. Then we will talk exactly like I would in Minnesota. It's even been mentioned by professors, cashiers, restaurant owners, students that I run into from Minnesota. It creates an instant bond with a person.  Unlike many states that don't seem to have quite the same bond instantly. I've seen people look at me in a perplexed way when I say things like 'Oh you'll love this person they're also from some place in Indiana' . I guess if you stay in Minnesota there is just enough amount of shared commonality and interests to stay or want to admit you are from Minnesota to create this bond. It's like you have something in common with that person and it feels safer to be yourself around them.

In other cities, most people ignore you and don't really engage in discussions with strangers unless something goes wrong, but in Minnesota it is not uncommon at all for people to engage in casual chit-chat or offer a warm compliment out of the blue with no expectation of anything in return.

This fascinates me. Why? Because I'm from the Pacific Northwest and when I moved to the East Coast I felt exactly the same thing (lived in CT, DC, VA for several years). People there were either cold or just down right nasty to strangers. Then I moved to Minnesota about 20 years ago and yes, it's better-- but it's nothing like the warmth and friendliness you find in the PNW or the Intermountain West.  I've found Minnesotans are very closed off; they will be marginally polite (""Minnesota nice"") but they aren't very interested in meeting new people or even having a conversation on the street.  By contrast, drop me in Missoula, Boise, or Spokane and it's like a homecoming to go to the grocery store or gas station."

TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,niftyjack,14,Wed May 27 01:31:40 2015 UTC,"I think the Minnesota Nice thing comes down to two things: Reservedness and politeness.  There's an old joke up north where my parents grew up, ""Did you hear about the swede who loved his wife so much he almost told her?"" A lot of people in this state have that background and that kind of culture. Very reserved. You don't show your emotions much.  On the other side of it, you don't want to cause a fight or anything. So if someone pisses you off (cuts you off in traffic, says something you don't like about their clothes, etc) you'll just smile and act like there's nothing wrong with it all the while thinking ""fuckin' asshole."" Then when they leave, you'll turn to your friend and say ""I can't believe that dick.""  So, I think that the minnesota nice thing just comes from reservedness and a general desire to avoid ""getting into it"" with strangers."

When I visited NOLA, I had a 45 minute conversation with a woman working at a jewelry store and told her that we don't do that kind of thing up here because people are closed off to strangers and are nice only as needed. Just an example. Maybe it's just me and my lack of interest in discussing the weather all the time. The directness of east cost folk is more in line with my personality type.

We have a similar attitude, climate and culture with a few notable differences.  First, there are more Germans that settled here than any other ethnicity, the Swedes and Norwegians are just louder about their backgrounds.  Next, we were basically founded on grain mills, and the intersection of several important rivers.  The best kept ""secret"" of Minnesota is we drew a crazy line (our shape is distinct) around as much fresh water as we could.  Being in the middle of the continent we are perhaps the safest place on the planet.  Early in our history we sent troops to the Civil War (that we easily could have avoided) and basically won the battle of Gettysburg (important battle) by being cannon fodder.  As time goes by Minnesotans placed a HUGE emphasis on Education and founded the University of Minnesota even before we officially became a state.  This institution as a public research facility worked on things like enriching uranium, open heart surgery, creating new species of apples and creation of the GOPHER protocol for the nascent Internet.  In addition to all of this is an built-in ""modesty"" that tends to cause Minnesotans to sit back instead of naturally trumpeting our successes.  As you have seen though, this is changing in the age of the Internet.  We have welcomed all kinds of immigrant refugee groups (including the largest population of Somalis) because we know people can succeed here fairly easily.  There are still problems, the pervasive culture having had such success does not deal with those who do not conform and seek it out through the approved methods.  Notably, our black populations are still small and have VERY different outcomes.  Having grown up in more mixed neighborhoods in Minneapolis I did not really understand this until I moved away and lived in Chicago for awhile.  Overall the Twin Cities are fraternal twins, St. Paul mostly being a suburb where we keep the state capital building and the politicians (I am biased of course but it IS smaller).  However, as has been noted elsewhere this is where the largest population in the state lives.  Because of that, we have worked pretty hard to preserve our natural landscapes and waterways to decent effect.  So that is why I say it is populated with Elves.  We have beautiful cities, with amazing technology (Medtronic = medical device company that recently created a powder that can be used for bone grafts instead of taking a hunk of bone from elsewhere = magic anywhere else), tons and tons of trees, rivers and lakes, tons of people who value all of this and fight to protect it but are a little snooty at the same time.

On the one hand, there's simple randomness, the influence of which is probably worth emphasizing when it comes to memes or viral trends, even though it's somewhat of an unsatisfying explanation. On the other hand, I'd guess that Minnesota (or rather, the Twin Cities metro area) manages to be just the right size for this sort of thing. It's populous enough for there to be enough Minnesotans on Reddit to create a significant response to the karma train.

The average Minnesotan state park seems to only have a mile of trail, which goes around a lake and nothing else. If you've never been hiking in Appalachia or the Rockies, I'm sure that seems normal, but trust me when I see a hike with scenery is different from a casual stroll around a lake.    The parks are all far away, too. If you leave after work to go camping on a Friday in the fall, it'll probably be dark by the time you get there. The best stuff is all north of Duluth, but that's equivalent in terms if distance to an Ohioan talking about how great the parks are in West Virginia-the distances are about the same. And the weather is boss-level unpredictable. I've gone on trips where the low was 20 degrees colder than predicted.    I'm sure it's OK if you like fishing and nothing else,   Minnesota is also painfully isolated compared to Ohio. Where I grew up, there was something like 50 million people within six hours drive, whereas in mn, it might be 8 or 9.     I love a lot about the state, especially the bike trails and the sunny winter, but those are my issues."
TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,ThatIrishChEg,8,Sat Jul 4 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"As a native Minnesotan who grew up hiking and camping here, I am scratching my head here. Which state parks are you visiting that only have a mile of trail around a lake?  William O'Brian has 16 miles of nature trails; Afton has 20 miles; Fort Snelling has 18; Lake Maria has 14.  And all of those are easily within an hour's drive of the cities. Heck, the Minnesota Valley Trail is something like 20 miles of hiking trail between Chaska and Belle Plaine, beautiful, and literally a half hour's drive from downtown Minneapolis.  (This post brought to you by Explore MN Tourism Board and Powdermilk Biscuits. Heavens they're tasty. Also by a native Minnesotan who doesn't like fishing but still finds plenty to do outdoors!)"
TheoryOfReddit,37c9b2,Midwestbridgebum,0,Tue May 26 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"I was exaggerating for sure but I've been to Interstate a lot and that claims four miles but it never feels that way. I've also been to Nerstrand Big Woods and all the parks you mention. Most of the trail systems seem to just follow a body of water instead of interesting terrain and similarly lack a networked architecture that let you easily compose loops. Without terrain, it's more of a ""walk"" than a ""hike."" That's probably more semantic than anything else, but I define a ""hiking trail"" as something you really couldn't access any other way. I've never had an MN trail kick my butt---it's all just a ""walk in the woods"" instead of exercise. Bodies of water are pretty, but they all look the same after a while.    Jay Cooke up north along with the Superior Hiking Trail are both alright/pretty good. I'm kind of hoping someday to have the economic opportunity to move to Duluth.   I guess we all grow to love where we're from. I grew up in a very hilly state with thousands of miles of trails, so I'm just spoiled. MN may not be objectively that bad (It's one of the flattest states in the US, http://news.ku.edu/2014/02/06/research-if-you-think-kansas-flattest-us-state-youre-plain-wrong, but it does have good parts), but I can't help but compare it to home.   MN really missed a golden opportunity by not reserving a chunk of the southeastern portion of the state for a grand park with thousands of acres. They have Frontenac, which is one of my favorites for sure, but they really could have used something on the order of Wayne National Forest (in Ohio) to really preserve the value of the hilliest/deciduous-est portion of the state and make it accessible to all Minnesotans. I'm aware of the agricultural value of the land but I still wish some large portion had been reserved.   On the flip side, though, MN's biking situation is first rate and I miss that a great deal when I leave the state. That's the bonus to being so darn flat."

TheoryOfReddit,37e2t8,grozzle,6,Wed May 27 09:45:30 2015 UTC,"Also the fact that much of what is stated is wrong, or at least only applies to academically-minded subs like askhistorians (though I guess I am actually supporting OP by saying it was downvoted for being wrong...?)  For instance,    Reductive (oversimplification) arguments, sweeping generalizations, obv. logical fallacies, grandiose claims, immaturity (that isn't funny or clever), too much idealism, and overuse of superlatives    Are frequently and consistently upvoted in the defaults."
TheoryOfReddit,37e2t8,SyndicateSamantharoo,3,Wed May 27 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"It's just a simple fact that most people just aren't trained in logic, philosophy, rhetoric, or debate.  They wouldn't recognize an ad hominem if it jumped up and bit them in the ass.  As an anecdote, I had a professor of English who taught her classes that ad hominem arguments synonymous with insults (they're not).  She also claimed that straw man arguments are ""brainless"" like the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz (I'd have appreciated the mnemonic if it were accurate).  In fact, an obvious straw man would be easy to dismiss by all onlookers.  The really clever straw man argument which twists a subtle distinction is the far more infuriating (and effective) sort because others who aren't invested in the argument rarely appreciate subtlety.  Calling out the straw man for what it is can be quickly dismissed with ""you're being pedantic"" which garners more support from onlookers (people have a culturally-ingrained reflexive dislike of pedantry).  If you recognize that there's no further point in arguing with them and tell them so, they crown themselves victor of the argument.  If you don't tell them so, others will crown them victor (upvotes) because they ""sure told that guy.""  Political arguments particularly suck because some very clever politicians have devised tons of these sorts of very subtle straw men and publish those deceits.  Then unclever can then use them as memes to ""win"" arguments with them.  Whole groups of people are trained to steer arguments specifically in directions where they can be struck with canned material like that.  It is a bit like mechanical advantage in physics, but used in rhetoric instead.  /rant"

I'll even be generous and pretend that the ""panning for gold"" analogy is really true, and that we really do learn things from mindlessly vetting a lot of information.    We still grow accustomed to that rate of education, and our attention spans shrink to accomodate that.    Meanwhile, most real world educational skills are not acquired anywhere near as fast as the knowledge obtained from reddit posts, even the educational ones.    Learning how to do physics, or calculus, or circuit design, etc., take a LOT of thought, over a LONG interval of time, with very LITTLE reward until the end.    The dopamine hit you get from learning random shit on reddit needs very little effort (just a click and some light reading) to occur.  And with the huge amount of option on reddit, this can happen dozens of times an hour, depending on your rate of use.    And because of the sheer amount of things clicked and read, you'll be less likely to retain any given thing, and most of the things learned will be ultimately very useless.    I'm very glad that my parents limited my computer use back in high school, and didn't allow me to have one in my room.  If they did, I'd be fucked right now."

These skills of being able to analyze information extremely fast and make new connections based on the information that we've mindlessly consumed are uncharted and as of today unrecognized.  I'm just here to point out that something is happening, our brains are becoming different as a result of our increasing use of the internet, and some symptoms are very obvious.

You come away with more knowledge than you did before, faster. That's not a bad thing, don't frame it as one. ""addiction to information"", what? We want perspective, that's what information gives us. Or at least, most of reddit says they want the apparent perspective knowledge gives us, but don't actually give a fuck- they just want to lord it over others.  The problem you're probably trying to get at here is that people on reddit have this really bad habit of trying to compartmentalize shit into ""right"" or ""wrong"", eschewing context that can determine such a thing, because 'scientifically', it shouldn't need context to be right or wrong!!!1 but that isn't true, though the weird logic people seem to cling to insists that it must be!  you have people who use really warped logic to argue points and then it's impossible to have a discussion with them, because while having condensed versions of information isn't necessarily bad, not having the context they need to be understood, is.   I see arguments daily of people insisting that truth must be truth and stand alone without any sort of supporting context or metatextual information. Let me demonstrate what I mean: If you see one child crying, and the other child has two scoops of ice cream, you're going to think that the second child's either stolen or hogged that ice cream for themselves. That is an evident truth reddit would argue, and I've seen analogies TO this everywhere- the second kid is the problem and there's NO context that exists that'll make him not the villain!  but what if the first kid has ice cream every single day, before the second kid arrives, only to be shortsided and not given any? Every single day, until the second kid arrives first, gets two scoops- which isn't even close to what they second kid deserves having been cut out so many times- and the first kid, a spoiled brat, is crying because he wanted ice cream. Would you demand the second kid be responsible to share his ice cream this time? No of course not, that isn't fair, and we know this because now we have context. If you don't have 5 sources to ""prove"" this context, you're shit out of luck, and they won't believe you. Even if they walked by the first kid every day, they need a source NOW or it's fake. That's how it is. They have to be spoon-fed this context to understand the need for it or even acknowledge that it might be important.  Once reddit understands there is a grey area that exists, and that everything isn't a Bill Nye experiment with a YES or NO result, maybe we can actually have conversations on this site and accept the interpretations of others as valid. But the clinging to an ""absolute truth"" that you either have or don't, is fucking up everyone on this fucking site and it drives me bonkers because discussion, argument, or debate is IMPOSSIBLE."

Since stream-of-consciousness is so close to the process here's an example:   Check /u/amadameus and my inbox, looking for activity or reactions. Nothing remarkable. Review comments for spelling errors if they're gaining attention. Check my ""watch these users"" list for anything intriguing. Nothing.  Somebody's funny pet? I can see it from the icon. Move on. Meanings of the word ""nuke"" in the 1800's before nuclear bombs? Cool. Worth reading. Ooops, wait, looks like it's a lot of OCR errors. Some new battery design promises higher performance than ever. Yawn. This is nothing we haven't heard before, I'll get excited once we see it get past QC control and hit mass production. Interesting fabrication approach though. What makes a game ""made for girls"" exactly? Hmm, interesting - lots of long detailed posts in the comments. Keep that tab up for later reading. Oooh, here's some cool abstract math. Read long enough to get my brain around the concept, confirm the top comment is correct, then move on. HTC reduces orders for their M9 components as sales slump. Poor HTC, I love these guys but they just can't seem to catch a break. Note to self: check the price drop on M8 models, I'm in the market for a new phone. Hoarder's messy car? Yeesh. Move on. Stopping crime with paint-filled water balloons at the checkout. Cool. File that under ""Japan is weirdly awesome"" for later. Should math be based on Cantor's set theory or Russel's type theory? Really cool (but long) discussions in here! Note to self: finish reading Engines of Logic already, you're slacking. Oooh, a commenter highly recommended this very dense paper on dependent data types in Epigram! Save for later reading. Also, what is Epigram? Solar power melting steel! Freakin' cool. Note to self: you still haven't started on that solar heater for next winter. Don't forget about long-term goals.   Et cetera.

While I can't recall the last 10 posts because most of them aren't noteworthy, a lot of my knowledge from the past year, whether it's about history, movies, games (hobbies), business, productivity, entrepreneurship (work), starts with reddit posts.   Basically, reddit distills information for you and when you find something interesting you go deeper.   It's a very efficient system."

I mean of course we do, there is no point to sitting 6 hours every day just sifting through this, we're not even cataloging any of it, just browsing.  But let me ask you this, have you noticed that you make other connections really fast? When for example someone tells you a story, with something exciting about to happens, something shocking perhaps, only for you to ruin it with the question that feels completely obvious to you?  I suspect you have, considering your 3 years of reddit under your belt.  I agree, the information itself is about 99.5% spam, useless - barely entertaining at most, 0.5% though is great stuff, something that you've learned, something you've really enjoying, something that made you change your life.  The 0.5% might seem like the interesting part, but is it really? We're processing human society as it functions on a daily basis, we discuss their motives, we discuss possibilities and we discuss different viewpoints, when we actually care enough to checkout and comment in the comments section.  It's dawning on me that the other 99.5% of information that we're seeing daily without even up- or down-voting it makes as acute at something.  Memory as you're trying to test here has nothing to do with it. Even worse I'm afraid, our memory is gone to shit. I mean do you even know more than three phone numbers? Email addresses? How about domain names? Those are easier though. It seems that google is completely rewired our brain to avoid of storing useless information, what for? As long as you remember the context or some details you're probably good to go.  Perhaps we're becoming acute at distinguishing things, and talking to a giant supercomputer spread across the entire planet, learning its syntax, its language, it's powers and limitations.  Learning has nothing to do with memorizing, it's pointless, although they've thought us the opposite for almost two decades since our birth with useless tests that tests only memory, not any other cognitive ability."

I can't answer your question without looking in my history, or commented history, or upvoted history. My point is that we're no longer storing that kind of information, the individual posts are meaningless to the information addict, as I've tried to describe above.  The meaningful posts are as rare as meaningful moments in life, and we tend to cherish them. So you ask me of my posts, but what of the last ten days of a non-redditor? What of the last 10 movies that your parents have seen? How many will the remember in detail? 2-3?  There are those who pride themselves with their ability to memorize and remember facts and details, I on the other hand enjoy the increasing ability to make connections where other are oblivious to them. Where once we stored memories in our brains, now it's being repurposed, used for something else.

TheoryOfReddit,36wwr6,MittRomneysCampaign,118,Fri May 22 20:07:04 2015 UTC,"(Disclaimer: I'm a mod of TIL and Videos)   There are several kinds of vote manipulation you should be aware of:    I'd say a lot of your points are spot on, some are pretty close and others miss the mark slightly. Most of the more active/tenured mods whom I've worked with/interacted with over the years are definitely aware of these points. We (moderators) don't really like to discuss these things in public (or even in our private subreddits amongst each other) due to the fact that less people with that kind of knowledge means a more secure system. Security through obscurity so they say. :) As per the aforementioned reason, I'm not going to get into it but I did want to touch on a couple things;  One thing I did want to say was that your 'vote nudging' does help, but I believe it's less important than your submission makes out, and depends heavily on the subreddit. I've seen posts get 10 upvotes within 10 minutes crash an burn an hour or two later, and conversely, I've seen posts get hit hard with a handful of downvotes in the beginning still make the front page. I still think content and [title] presentation is king. A good (by good I mean ""unique and interesting"") submission in TIL is going to make the front page regardless of any nudging. I've studied their new queue there for years and I can't really think of any exceptions or rare cases where a great post languished in mediocrity.   And that brings me to the next point; I think in quickly digested content, meme, and 'funny pictures' type subreddits, nudging may have more of an effect because of some of the variables you describe. Those subreddits are also incredibly busy so there's tons of content and thus, tons of competition. Where there is a lot of competition, every little bit helps. Nudging may give a submission the edge it needs in an ocean of crap.   In more content driven subreddits, like videos and TIL, the content itself is more important than early visibility (though again, I'm sure nudging helps). I believe it's because people tend to dig deeper into the subreddit looking for that good content, and less of it is getting submitted on a per hour basis. It may be also part of the reason why you had trouble breaking /r/videos.  The sad thing is if the mods had proper tools, say even just generic referrer information for a particular submission, we (mods) could start to combat this problem.   For very large subreddits (200k+) you could not be more wrong.   I wouldn't go that far. One thing I think you've failed to take into account is the moderators themselves. They make the rules for the sub and can enforce them as they see fit. They're the wildcard that can screw with a marketer's plans. They may remove the submission in question for breaking a rule or they may even recognize it as spam, marketing jazz or SEO clickbait. The longer you mod (a large & busy subreddit), the easier and easier it gets to spot the suspicious submissions. Not just suspicious submissions but spotting suspicious voting behavior - it becomes second nature. You become a human spam-filter algorithm. :P"
TheoryOfReddit,36wwr6,relic2279,49,Sat May 23 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"Awesome reply. I love detailed replies like that. (Well, I'd have to, or I'd be a huge hypocrite.)  I didn't take into account active moderation mostly because... I've seen so little of it, lol. Unless you're talking about moderation that filters out stuff that's unrelated to the subreddit's focus -- I've seen that stuff.  TIL is an interesting case because the good content has better distinguishing markers over bad content, whereas there's so many different criteria at play in subreddits like /r/pics or /r/videos, and the mods at TIL have done a great job of filtering out 'easy' content. I suspect a similar phenomenon would happen on /r/gonewild or some variant -- I could post someone who is really hot and they'd do well no matter what because men have commonly shared preferences concerning appearance."

TheoryOfReddit,36wwr6,GamerGateFan,11,Sat May 23 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far. One thing I think you've failed to take into account is the moderators themselves. They make the rules for the sub and can enforce them as they see fit. They're the wildcard that can screw with a marketer's plans.   Or lately with a lot of modmail leaks and drama spilling out, you see it go the opposite direction. Like the League of Legends moderators having NDA agreements with companies, skincareaddiction having a rouge mod that would promote things, and a lot of alumni mods kicked out of reddit for selling their influence. Gawker and subsidiaries which used to be banned in many subreddit had higher ups repeatably request to be unbanned from subreddits, as revealed in the modtalk leaks.  So another manipulation for subreddits would be the mod insider who abuses their removal powers, for example to remove(even if temporary) as many new submissions they can get away with for an hour except the one they want to promote, removing competitor's submissions and the submissions that make the company they are aligned with look bad, ensuring there sponsored content is approved in the subreddit, etc."

Once you know your demographic you can cater the title towards them. It's pretty simply marketing stuff.  Content has to be easily digested to get upvotes, that's why if you have a good title you'll be fine, and if you have easily digestible content you'll be even more fine.

A common grammatical error I see a lot of people on the internet make is ""that"" vs. ""who"", i.e. ""people who..."" should be used instead of ""people that."" But I never correct this because it does not impinge on their conclusion at all; I know exactly what they mean, and it's just linguistic fashion.  But if someone was reaching hard and wanted to discredit a writer, they could say this to a writer who makes that mistake: ""Wow, you don't even know how to use basic grammar. Are you sure you're a writer?""  I mean, obviously a lot more goes into writing than grammar; that's maybe 5% of it, and that particular mistake is a really insignificant mistake, and unlike some areas of math (where you have to learn algebra before calculus) grammar isn't sequential -- you don't have to know ""people that"" vs. ""people who"" before you can, say, learn what comma splices are.  Most people aren't going to think ""wait, does this really make him a bad writer?"" though, so it works."

Not only that, but with generic referrer information, moderators could start to work on promoting their subreddits off-site. They can do that now I guess, but without the relevant information, they're less effective.   A second tool that would help would be something which allows us to see vote data (on a 'per submission' basis). The admins may bristle at the thought, believing it might be abused, but if someone's going to abuse their powers as a mod, they're going to do it with or without that vote data. With more information, their co-mods would probably notice something was up and act as a check/balance. If anything, it may actually curb abuse and not promote it.

Originally, Alexis and Steve and I think maybe a few others created a variety of alts to post and vote on content to create the impression of activity. This mattered because users would not (and will not) post anywhere that they thought would leave their opinions or contributions with few views; no one wants to shout into an empty room. Essentially, they astroturfed themselves, but this led to organic activity from other users and they could stop contributing once that activity remained constant."

The admins have always even gone out of their way to make sure they let everyone know their own announcement and blog posts aren't artificially stuck up at the top of reddit (they let it get there organically). I believe they really are serious about vote manipulation and having things happen organically.   If you use wayback machine and look at reddit's first year, the top post of the day here has a whopping 24 points.

That said, I would guess many 4chan users are actually part time redditors as well, so cross over does happen, and with that, occasionally organized raids. /tv/'s raid on the Tom Hardy AMA is a pretty notorious example, but it's also exceptional.

This viewpoint could not be more erroneous, but vote manipulation exploits people who think this way. People use upvotes as an ""I agree"" button -- they do, and they will continue to, and no amount of telling them to do differently will change this until you actively micromanage voting privileges, and people who vote this way also tend to read votes this way. People are influenced by content they see, and are very lazy readers. As such, when they are only exposed to a few viewpoints, they'll just go with whatever they know. In conjunction with (3), people don't tend to read the whole discussion, so a completely crushing counterargument could be at +1 or +2 forever. Asch conformity experiment.

So, takeaways:   I won my bet with Ryan Don't work in marketing unless it's a truly exceptional firm or you want to hate your life. If you do in fact want to hate your life, you could get a better return on your self-hatred by doing investment banking. There are several kinds of vote manipulation you should be aware of: forced frontpaging, vote nudging, reverse-nudging and visibility manipulation. The initial votecount (the first 5-10 votes) of submissions matters a lot You might think that voting means organic content is going to rise to the top. This is probably true for subreddits that have <50k subscribers. For very large subreddits (200k+) you could not be more wrong. Comment manipulation happens everywhere, and probably happens even more often in controversial subreddits. No matter how much you say ""don't downvote this way"", people always will Most redditors are extremely influenced by votecounts and do not think for themselves.    I think this is a rather good summary of what you've written. Excellent post overall. Do you think there's any way, the Reddit community could be reformed, so that stuff like this doesn't happen?"
TheoryOfReddit,36wwr6,casebash,23,Fri May 22 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"The same Ryan I mention here is someone with whom I tried to form a startup to correct this problem. This was back in 2012-2013.  Reddit is currently neutral about content quality (all votes are equal) and that's why it's easy to game, so an easy way to stop vote manipulation is to just force the content you submit to be good and/or make votes unequal. But maximizing for quality content and making votes unequal both have problems. The lesser problem is that you have to define 'quality'. Even though reddit can be hilarious, if jokes are more visible than insightful discussion (and they will be, because it doesn't take as long to process/vote on them) then insightful discussion will be buried and no one will have an incentive to do it. But, people will always make jokes anyway, because laughter is pleasing on a base level. So, we defined 'quality' as information-density, i.e. how much insight/solid argumentation/detail does a post have, figuring that we'll have humor no matter what but have to fight to keep the thoughtful stuff.  But after you maximize for quality, you have to keep out non-quality, and therein lies the bigger issue. This is by design a form of elitism, and elitism is rarely as profitable as populism. Romance outsells conceptual fiction; Time magazine outsells the New Yorker. But at least those models have some way to make money, while a reddit that forces high quality content has dubious ways to be profitable. It's the concept of SomethingAwful but even more esoteric.  Ryan ultimately exited the idea because he thought it was not profitable. He still holds this position and he is right. It's very difficult to monetize eyeballs -- his word for apps/websites that rely strictly on views for valuation. Twitter made people billionaires, but reddit's cofounders walked away with a few million at best. You could attribute this to poor cofounder negotiation and you'd have a point, but even if they had stuck with reddit for years they'd be worth only (about) 50M each, since reddit's 400-500M valuation figure is often regarded as excessive. So, if reddit is not the source of startup wealth, well, it's not like you're going to find it by making an even more selective reddit.  I am bringing this up because I think this actually precedes your question, since your question is about whether it's possible to remedy these problems but it's neutral about whether it'd be profitable, and profitability determines whether a solution will ever be implemented at all. What enables reddit to have so much vote manipulation in the first place is due to its populist design. To eliminate this would require some kind of elitism; the profitability issue is why a high-quality alternative to reddit has not been made, and might not ever be made. The smartest people you've ever met in your life come out of places like Stanford with master's degrees in cognitive psych and computer science ready to get rich from creating a startup nobody has done before. If ""reddit but better"" were something someone thought had real monetary potential, you'd have seen it by now.  To directly answer your question, Ryan and I had several ideas to improve content quality and stop vote manipulation. I've combed through a majority, if not an overwhelming majority of TheoryOfReddit posts above 100 upvotes for any kind of principles we could use to correct manipulation. A few things stand out.  We ran through a lot of manual solutions, like filtering comments for reading level, or having some kind of minimum wordcount, or weighting votes for posts that use certain words that indicate elaboration like ""because"". After running through a few scenarios it became clear that these solutions were either too easy to game or too intensive on the server, and since both of us are aware of how votes on reddit could be manipulated it was easy to see how these systems could be abused once users caught on to the weights/algorithms.  We also looked at older HackerNews posts and saw how there was a kind of content degradation there as well. HackerNews and Stack Exchange take steps to prevent frivolous voting by making users earn the right to downvote. HackerNews in particular requires that you get 500 upvotes before you can downvote someone, so every user has to think about how they are voting. Stack Exchange is even more stringent, and requires that you earn this privilege per discussion area as opposed to sitewide.  So far, Stack Exchange has the best solution. There are two caveats to this: Stack Exchange is only for questions, and questions define the terms of the discussion. If someone presents a proposition (""x is wrong/stupid/illogical"") or shares something (""hey, I saw this!"") it's not the kind of thing suitable for stackexchange. Also, even with Stack Exchange's strengths it can't save certain discussion areas. In absence of a clear methodology or expertise, people will revert to old habits and pick what 'feels' right. This happens inthe more general areas on Stack Exchange, and the commentary becomes a lot like any other discussion forum.  Ultimately, you cannot have some kind of content quality permanence unless you curate who votes in some fashion.  This is done indirectly on most websites by simply creating discussion boards around subject matter that filter out idiots. If you start a message board around Algebraic Topology, well, your ""off topic"" forum is probably going to be a bit more rigorous than usual. But nothing is stopping you from being a bunch of idiots if you all decide to talk about normative ethics or exercise science or cognitive psychology or whatever, and the cycle continues.  I think there is way too much power in giving users simultaneous control of link-curation and comment curation. They are distinct entities and should be treated as such. Right now, if you hate someone on this website you can go and downvote every link they submit along with their comments, and this happens a lot. You can create new accounts and immediately downvote someone's stuff. It's way, way too easy to game.  Note that there's no way you could have porn on this kind of website. You could probably get away with erotica, but straightup porn goes too fast. I love porn, and would even do porn if someone paid me well for it, but this is the sacrifice you make when you're maximizing some kind of content over other things. You cannot do everything well -- reddit is reddit precisely because it does everything decently, but not well, and this system just happens to work very well for porn but not so well for detailed/in-depth content.  So, the solution would be a reddit-like entity where:   Some kind of 'curator curator' exists whose job it is to approve who can vote/not vote. Ostensibly, you could just build the whole site around this concept, but we can proceed assuming this is just a quick check to see if someone is not gaming the system. Users have to earn the ability to upvote, and especially the ability to downvote, on a per-subreddit basis, for both links and comments separately New subreddits are made by application -- i.e. someone has to make the case for this subreddit's creation before it's actually approved Links are allowed and so are videos, but straight up pictures are disallowed. This would prohibit very useful places like /r/dataisbeautiful but could be averted by selfposts that provide context to the data, since some subs already do this Links with very few words require captcha entry -- no actual penalty, but enough to make submitters second-guess whether they really want to submit, say, a link to a tweet Subreddits have the ability to separately set permissions on who can submit and who can comment   This would kill two birds with one stone: vote manipulation would be minimal, and content quality would be consistent over time. (Note: while I wrote 'subreddits' here these would likely be called by some other name.) Vote manipulation happens in the first place because the voting is really easy  -- you can create an account and start voting in a matter of seconds. If it was something you had to earn and could have taken away, very few people would be willing to frivolously vote.  There are other tests you could do, such as requiring that initial participants in whatever (commenting, voting, starting a subreddit, whatever it is you want) have to read and understand some kind of body of text before they do. This would weed out people who aren't committed to providing in-depth content.  But, again, all of this presumes this is marketable to investors. It probably wouldn't be. Reddit has a hard enough time being profitable, and you'd have a really hard time pitching something that is reddit but even more elitist to investors, when reddit's dumb popularity is if anything the one thing that saves it in the eyes of advertisers now.  As an aside, answering your question made me remember just how much thought I put into this issue only to come out realizing that there was no good solution. I suppose the crucial lesson here is that sometimes you can devote a ton of thought to something that ends in massive disappointment."
TheoryOfReddit,36wwr6,dvRienzi,9,Fri May 22 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the in-depth response.    Users have to earn the ability to upvote, and especially the ability to downvote, on a per-subreddit basis, for both links and comments separately    I think this alone, if implemented in the current Reddit, would bring immense change for the better. However, I've noticed that whenever any subreddit begins restricting people's ""right to Reddit"", there's always popular backlash (like ""NAZI MODS""). This also includes countless Redditors making poor arguments about free speech, and ""censorship"". But at the same time, the subreddits that have strict mods, or very active moderation (/r/askhistorians, /r/syriancivilwar, etc.) have the highest quality. If you were moderating a subreddit, and wanted to take some of the measures you outlined in the comment above, how would you respond to ""NAZI MOD"" allegations, and how would you keep people from bailing the subreddit?"
TheoryOfReddit,36wwr6,parolang,9,Fri May 22 22:33:04 2015 UTC,"This has been studied in leadership literature, I believe. It's one of the takeaways I got from a very boring leadership class in college.  It's about prior expectation. If you give someone a right or power and then take that right or power away, they will feel cheated and be angry. (Let's say they went from 80 power points to 50 power points.) However, if you start from 0 power points and grant them those same privileges (back to 50 power points) they will like you more for it.  Reddit is probably beyond repair in this respect. Well, no, it's not, but that sort of decision would heavily divide the website, and a lot of people would move to a platform like Voat.   I think it'd be better to start from scratch, because so many existing discussions on reddit are linkable/viewable under the pretext that anyone can vote, so reading older discussions under a new system where someone had to earn voting privileges would be a clusterfuck.  Also, you'd have to make subreddit creation less frivolous, because otherwise, moderators would have an enormous incentive to create new subreddits all the time to give them huge power over users. More incentive than they do already."

Until a definite place to draw that line is found (if that's even possible) this will continue to be an issue.   I'd also like to note the converse: people using the upvote to promote agreeable as opposed to quality content. On the larger subreddits like r/music and r/pics, I'd argue that this is an even worse problem because it leads to do much stale and trite content being prominent. Redditors also have a responsibility to not upvote content that they may really like but isn't quality."
TheoryOfReddit,36rb4r,closesandfar,10,Thu May 21 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"As much as we can argue about this or that opinion of the hive mind, it has to be acknowledged that some opinions are worse than others.  The opinion, for example, that vaccinations cause autism or other sicknesses is measurably damaging to society as a whole.  Those opinions deserve to be suppressed on a platform like reddit.  Whether or not the hive mind can be trusted to be the authority on which opinions are worse than others is highly debatable, but adding upvote and downvote buttons to your forum was bound to create this result.  Your opinions relative to the hive mind are quantifiable and that quantity is the balance of the votes it garners."

That's why a lot of subreddits like /r/badlinguistics and /r/badhistory exist, for academics to laugh at the kind of falsehoods that get upvoted.

TheoryOfReddit,36rb4r,UniversalSnip,13,Wed Jun 3 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"Many years ago I suggested a two-dimensional comment feedback system: up- or down-voting to indicate agreement/lols, and a plus/minus toggle to indicate value added to the discussion. I think the most damaging part of a binary (okay, three-value) feedback system is that there is no way for one user to concretely indicate disagreement with another without also punishing that other user for offering his/her opinion. It also doesn't allow me to acknowledge an opinion which differs from mine as being a valid perspective, worth sharing, without making it seem to other users like I am in complete agreement with that opinion.  I know I can use words to tease out the nuances of my reaction, but comments like 'I was entertained but withheld my upvote on principle' or 'I downvoted you but not for the reason most other people downvoted you', or 'I did nothing because while I value your input I don't want you to mistakenly think that I endorse your view', all of these make it a conversation about the mechanics of the conversation, when I would much rather just talk about the topic at hand.  I rarely up- or down-vote anyone anymore, except in the most extreme cases of either brilliant insights or trollish dumbfuckery. For me, this isn't even a question of what is the 'right' way to use a downvote, it's a question of why there are only two ways for me to measurably react to things, which pushes me as a thoughtful user down a third path, which itself can't be distinguished from my not having read anyone's comments at all.  I think the whole reason you get a 'hivemind' effect is because there is only one indicator of positive feedback, and whether a comment made you laugh or made you think or made you stand up and applaud, it all gets completely washed out - your nod looks just like everyone else's nod, and so it looks like we're all nodding at the same things for the same generic, lowest-common-denominator reasons, which in most cases couldn't be further from the truth.  Intelligent discourse on this site needs to get away from merely flipping a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Contrary opinions need to be promoted in order for discussion to thrive, and the widespread use of the down-vote as an 'I disagree' button, in the absence of any alternative, is the single most damaging but correctable thing about this site.  If the admins are looking for us to become BuzzFeed with twitter as our comments section, then we're on the right course. If we want to continue to be a community that breeds and fosters new, sometimes challenging ideas, if we want to continue to be a forum for thoughtful, respectful discussion on difficult or sensitive topics, then we have to change the way people behave, which we can only do by offering them a more constructive alternative to their existing behaviour."

TheoryOfReddit,36rb4r,lolmeansilaughed,22,Fri May 22 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"It seems like reddit needs to at least acknowledge this dichotomy between the two ways people use downvotes. They need to at least try to let newbies know that there's what we'd like and there's what is, and that they (noobs) should keep that in mind as they case the joint, as it were.   I think that's not necessary. The human instinct of like vs dislike, of ""us"" vs ""them,"" of social judgment and cliques, are way way thicker than what's written about what something means.   You can drill, even to a kid, that if someone is mean to you it means they just envy you, but the kid's primal brain kicks in and if they're honest with themselves they know that the other kid is being mean because he's dishing out a social punishment.   The strength of this instinct is why people use downvotes as a ""boo"" in the first place.... And that's also why we don't need any explanation on that."
TheoryOfReddit,36rb4r,grozzle,4,Thu May 21 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"To add to this: reddiquite is laid out as a framework, like the Constitution.

For that deep understanding, the United States has laws, and reddit has ""figuring shit out"".  In spite of reddit's complexity and cliquishness, people keep joining and figuring it out.  It creates some cognitive dissonance in people when you tell them that downvotes are for one thing, when (as /u/clickstation put so well)  people instinctively want to use it for something else.  That's why we see posts like OP's from time to time, with this reddiquite downvote policy backlash.  But it doesn't mean that reddiquite as it exists is wrong or even misleading, it just means that we have to engage our forebrains, and educate our young."

TheoryOfReddit,36rb4r,Measure76,3,Thu May 21 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"There are three issues when it comes to downvotes:  1) Reddiquette says not to downvote out of disagreement, but says nothing about downvoting people who are ""wrong"" or people who are ""jerks/assholes"". Of course in many (if not most) cases they mean exactly the same thing, but this is the loophole that redditors use. Mention something about not using downvotes to indicate disagreement to a redditor and he would probably say something like ""I didn't downvote him because I disagree, I downvoted him because he's wrong/an asshole"".  2) Promoting the ""correct"" usage of downvotes can potentially be interpreted as ""complaining about downvotes"", which is itself a violation of reddiquette. This means that it is against reddiquette to use downvotes to indicate disagreement, but no way to enforce it, since calling people out on it will probably be seen as a violation of reddiquette in itself.  3) I think that it's actually interesting to see what the community agrees or disagrees with, and so in a sense I would actually prefer that people misuse the upvote/downvote buttons. The problem, to me, is not that people use downvotes to indicate disagreement, but rather that it only takes a score of -5 to hide a comment by default.    I think reddit should abolish the default threshold. If it did so, then downvotes would mean nothing but a number beside a username. Of course, users should still have the option to hide comments below a certain score, but the default should be to show all comments. Changing the default behaviour would of course require that the admins be onboard, but users and mods can at least ensure that every user is aware of the fact that the threshold can be eliminated in the settings."

(Warning: link to an utter failure of an AdviceAnimal by yours truly)  I don't even really have a solution to this per se. I just think we need to at least recognize that this weird rift exists; then we can maybe figure out how to deal with it.  I'm not particularly religious, but when I was a kid my family belonged to a Brethren Christian church. (Think Quakers, but less, I don't know, Amish-y.) One thing that was hardwired into me from back then is the concept of bearing witness: that if there's a problem in front of you, your two and only two choices are to say ""here's a problem, and here's what I choose to do about it"" and ""here's a problem, and I'm choosing to stay out of it this time but I still acknowledge it"". What you CAN'T do is say ""lalalala, nope, no problem here, nope, nuh-uh, no problem!"" And (and this is to head off any ""omigod, whoooo CAAARES"" -comments) this rule applies no matter how small or inconsequential the ""problem"" in question might be.  So I do spend too much time on these things. Reddit, to me, is FULL of these things. I have spent what to your average fifteen-year-old is a pathetic amount of time fighting for civility and empathy on this site.  Because someone has to. Right?  Edit: another weird thing I do is obsessively watch karma scores; this was apparently the comment that sent people matching off to downvote all my recent stuff (the intention of which I'm ironically having trouble reading).

I, on the other hand, am religious, so I'm biased in my responses to problems. As a Mormon, I'm used to people giving me crap and I just put up a smile and deal with it, so that's more or less my response to this problem.  I don't think improper downvoting is something we can ""fix"" (no more than we could, say, realistically eliminate poverty everywhere), so I think the best we can do is set the right example."

TheoryOfReddit,36rb4r,TheEmbernova,-1,Thu May 21 20:27:15 2015 UTC,"Reddit used to be very good until it was not good any more. It stopped being good six months after I joined. Everyone who joined after me is an idiot who ruins it for everyone else. I am the only one who understands the site's true purpose and potential, which has been mercilesely thwarted and squandered by ignorant philistines ever since six months after I joined.  For convenience, feel free to swap out the word ""reddit"" for 4chan, SomethingAwful, World of Warcraft, LiveJournal, Tumblr, UseNet, the name of any given BBS, Club Penguin, New Grounds, etc. etc. etc.  We've heard your song and dance before.

TheoryOfReddit,36rb4r,GiantSquidd,8,Thu May 21 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a cheap cop out to the question and intentional or not, it's thick with irony. Because this doesn't contribute to the conservation. It deserves downvotes.  I don't think OP is a poster who's just complaining about 'the system', I think he's addressing the gap between what moderators can encourage and what moderators can enforce.   Every few months there's a new sub created which sets out to encourage controversial topics to be debated and discussed, while trying to avoid the petty insults back and forth that inevitably come. The point of the sub wouldn't be to encourage one argument or another, but rather explain all sides as best it can.   They routinely are either biased from the start and thus, become an echo chamber people avoid, or can't moderate hard enough to make it work. The one or two moderators spend their time working on CSS instead.  The thing is, OP's problem is solved not by one moderator or one understanding of the downvote reddit-wide, but a team of moderators enforcing any rule the subreddit demands. Subreddits are authoritarian. But you need a big, global, dedicated, experienced team to make it work. That's not easy to put together over night. But it's a fact that's been proven more than once: the only way to get people to follow the rules is to enforce the rules mercilessly."

Digg changed how the site worked on a fundamental level. The moved away from user submitted content entirely in favor of letting the big name publishers submit stuff directly if memory serves. (see here)  Reddit has never made any impactful changes on that scale before. Even the addition of subreddits didn't affect the functionality of the site as much as Digg giving nearly total control to the publishers (instead of the users) did.  People want to complain and bring up digg as an example, but they're not the same; they're apples an oranges comparisons."

TheoryOfReddit,36oqnv,zaron5551,8,Fri May 22 15:28:30 2015 UTC,"I think the most likely explanation and outcome of this apparent desire to crack down on harassment is that reddit wants to have a public face that is more palatable to advertisers and rather than risk driving away the significant portion of the userbase, it's probably small overall but large among the voting/commenting users, that says and does things that are unpalatable they'll merely do their best to hide the dirt."
TheoryOfReddit,36oqnv,elshizzo,7,Fri May 22 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"good post, a lot of interesting points  The fluff principle in my mind has been the biggest problem with reddit for several years now, more specifically the reddit algorithm.  There are ways to deal with it.  In my mind the easiest way would be to let users easily find posts with a high percentage upvote to downvote ratio, but that have a low amount of votes attached to them.  Would give those posts a boost.  Those kind of posts are usually the in-depth thought provoking articles that you rarely see on this site anymore.  As for the voting system on reddit encouraging circlejerks, I think this is true as well.  Although this is a harder issue to deal with.  In my opinion [and here comes an unpopular statement to make on reddit], in certain situations having an upvote only system makes sense.  Not reddit-wide, but imo reddit should let subreddits decide if they want to disable downvotes in comments [and maybe in individual posts as well]."
TheoryOfReddit,36oqnv,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,4,Thu May 21 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the props. I've thought that as well, that reddit might be better off without the downvotes. It is possible to disable downvotes using subreddit style (for example we did it at FFA) but that doesn't prevent users from disabling subreddit style, and it doesn't prevent downvotes from the front page of reddit, etc.  The upvote/downvote system you propose seems a bit complicated to me, but maybe it could work. Basically I think that they could probably tinker with the sorting algorithm in various ways to downplay the fluff principle, it's just never really been a high priority for the admins."
TheoryOfReddit,36oqnv,Yanky_Doodle_Dickwad,12,Thu May 21 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"I feel that reddit is huge swarm of a bazillion different subs. Some appear to be more visible than others. To say that that one sub seems popular is to ignore the vast amount of other subs that are used by the massively vastest amount of users. That one example you give seems prominent because the concept is shocking so it lodges in the memory easier, and consequently gets spoken about more on other subs, mostly in horror. But all that in no way makes that one sub an indication that redditors are ""the type that frequent that sub"". The same thing happens every 9 months or so with the ""shock subs"".    Regarding the vote system, and using it as a form of punishment or dissuasive thing: I am guessing that since upvotes aren´t to be used as a reward for users, then they should equally not be used as punishment.    .. and regarding the whole ""reddit is losing quality"" thing ... and using your post to put my view forward, so i get my view out there the once, I choose to see it like this: - you discover reddit at any given point - a while later, reddit seems to be different to what you first discovered - you lose your taste for reddit, or not.    That pattern works for everybody at any time in reddit evolution. The user themselves is the one who changes the most over time, because they know more and see deeper into reddit. So reddit isn´t at a juncture, all users are, at any given time.    Reddit fail? Myeuh, it'll happen i suppose, but only when the hive decides something else is cooler and that new thing can take over everybody's time more than reddit does. The rate that happens is like a truck full of water going round a bend ... the water slops about but when it goes over a lot it'll go over all the way and quickly. Reddit is very elastic though, and it'll take a lot for a large mass to prefer something else. Maybe our kids will ditch it for something else ... some years down the road ... 5? yaknow ... ""some"".    TL;DR: you're in phase 5 of enlightenment. At phase 8 you reddit more. At phase 12 you reddit less. Ish.  Thanks for reading that, I'll go and sit down over there now."

We already have problems with people doing crappy things for karma, and it's basically worthless. Imagine how much worse the problem would be if karma gave you increased influence over other people's posts. At the very least more people would start using bots or creating multiple accounts to farm karma.    Personally I'm wary of any attempt to make downvoting more difficult, because I think it would only empower the trolls. Right now troll comments are quickly downvoted to oblivion and hidden at the bottom of the thread. Outside hate-based subs like FPH, that's usually true of generally offensive/abusive comments as well.   Remove downvoting, and that awful comment has the same rank as a new comment no one has voted on yet. The bad comment doesn't get sorted and hidden, it stays where people can see it. As more people see it, more and more just can't help themselves and respond to the troll, encouraging their behavior."

If the changes are too disruptive it stands to drive people away.   The data that reddit says it based this decision on actually showed that more than 90% of responders are happy with the website and would recommend it to others. If the admins start making changes and somehow disenfranchise their satisfied members they risk driving them off. Are there enough people who feel ""unsafe"" out there who want to sign up for reddit to replace them?  It's a noble goal to want to make reddit inclusive and safe.

TheoryOfReddit,36hetz,noobit,16,Tue May 19 12:22:03 2015 UTC,"While I think your idea is positive in theory and intention, my feeling is that it is somewhat unneeded and may just be unsuccessful.  In my experience, new subs grow out of conversations within a thread. Something comes up (either a joke, idea, or topic) that doesn't have a home yet, and someone creates the sub then and there. You get your original subscribers from initial interest and albeit chance. Then it's a matter of advertising when appropriate.  That's not to say that a forum to discuss ideas for subs is a terrible idea altogether... but to me, it feels like you're forcing something that is best when it occurs organically.  That said, I wish you luck with this idea!"

Thanks for your input, this is something I hadn't considered.  Though I'd initially respond that the ""someone mentioned it in a thread, it grew from there"" usually has to do with 'joke' subreddits, I have to agree there's still that fair bit of potential for idea/topic subreddits to start from there as well. And while I could once have argued that those subs aren't seen by people who ""weren't there,"" this is no longer the case - between the awesome new ""trending subs"" indicator and the general tendency to help out people who are /r/outoftheloop, there's a relatively fair number of gateways for those 'late to the party' to get on board.  Still, though, I think there's more to it than just that - my initial concept was meant to address those times for which there's a general zeitgeist of some sub needing to exist, but no one central place to post those grievances and start that idea. Look at how long it took /r/xkcd_comic to get activity (and how it was still hard to promote it on /r/xkcd, because of soccer's automoderator censorship) and how with that or other subreddits, there's no  central place to coordinate efforts or discussion on creating new 'branch' subreddits for a topic. (even as I left /r/politics, I had nothing save for my own post on /r/bettereddit to point me towards better alternatives. Surely someone somewhere had discussed how to make a better /r/politics, but there wasn't any way I'd find that talk on /r/politics, and I had no inkling where else to look.)    But even with that, I can't deny the warning your point raises. I think I should ensure /r/substarter doesn't need to be constantly starting up new subreddits as its standard activity - I agree, something like that would feel too much like 'forcing' the traditionally organic creation of new subs. (There will be times where there isn't need for new subs. I don't want the sub to fill up with low-quality or 'joke' subs at that point...) At rest, I suppose it'd be a meta-discussion space allowing discussions about specific subreddits.  (In which case, perhaps I should look into a new name...)"

TheoryOfReddit,36hetz,Algernon_Asimov,2,Tue May 19 12:58:18 2015 UTC,"You read my mind :)  The actual mechanism we're implementing requires, for a given subreddit to get off the ground, a certain number of 'pledged' subscribers forming an initial community. (the exact number is configurable per-campaign - ""small"" niche subreddits can be kickstarted along with ""large"" wide-interest ones)  In its previous iteration, /r/substarter had no such restriction - making it next to useless from a pragmatic standpoint. The posts you'd see there had no investment, no difficulty in getting to the front page of the subreddit - they'd just be whoever submitted there most recently. (It'd be like if kickstarter just donated whatever funds were raised at the end of a campaign, rather than being all-or-nothing - people would see things as less likely to be successful, and wouldn't pledge as easily)  the previous subreddit owner agreed  that the all-or-nothing approach is a good thing to try out - creating some competition and value in the posts that actually make it to the front page should hopefully foster a better class of proposed subreddits.  At the same time, the proposed subreddit is ""locked"" until the minimum number of subscribers is reached. This confines the whole initial community to the campaign thread long enough to discuss their potential community - what it should be, how it should be run, the steps it should take to differentiate itself from other related communities - which is, imo, the crucial (and currently missing) element in starting new communities."

We saw a need for a new subreddit about Star Trek, because we believed in-depth discussions were being drowned out by other content in /r/StarTrek. The creator had the brilliant idea of hand-picking a few regular contributors from the main subreddit, and inviting them to join our new subreddit. We kept it private for a week, and let these hand-picked individuals (plus ourselves, of course) start posting the content we wanted. After that week, we had enough content to get things started, and that's when we unlocked the subreddit and started promoting it.   However, I don't see why you need to create all this structure around this process. And a bot? What does the bot do?  Why not just start the subreddit, and then invite people to join it, just like every successful subreddit and internet forum has done since the dawn of time?"

This isn't something I see people do for their standard subreddit ideas.  Your leader's idea sounds similar, in ways, to my own - the point of getting people together to discuss what kind of subreddit they'd like is to let the eventual leader hand-pick good discussion contributors as leaders and initial content posters for their community (forming an initial moderation team for the subreddit). (Finding a moderation team in line with your own ideas is another effort I see people go about in a backwards way - they ask ""who wants to mod"" and get responses from anyone attracted to the idea of power, rather than having metadiscussions on the purpose and leadership of a subreddit and drawing out those whose hopes/intentions/ideals for their subreddit are insightful enough to make them good moderators).  Since this is the core principle around which reddit supposedly 'works,' it's frustrating seeing people run into logistical issues and us ending up with less than a handful of successful cases. ""if you don't like X, start up a new sub, Y""  only works when it's done right, which is why the cases are countable on one hand."

However, I wonder if you're over-engineering the process, with meta-discussions and a bot. Also, you're assuming that people will even know your process exists.

It's easy to teach someone how to use the ""remove"" and ""distinguish"" buttons. It's not easy to teach someone the culture of a subreddit.   Absolutely, which is the point of mentoring new sub owners and discussion leaders on how to mod - if you know they have the time needed to mod, it's far better to take an experienced member of the community and show them the ropes with moderation than it is to take an experienced moderator and tack them on as a mod of another sub.

Agreed - but we can't make it too easy, can we? ;)   I've got a couple of avenues for attacking this problem in mind.    The potential for realizing subreddit ideas will, I think, serve as a powerful draw for idealists to at least ""give the subreddit a shot."" There are a few subreddits I've thought of where mentions for /r/substarter wouldn't be out of place - for instance, the potential for a moderator mentorship program (pairing successful campaigns with experienced moderators, to tutor new subreddit owners) makes it worth a post in modtalk, and the idea of starting your own subreddit off with an initial community would be worth mention (and a fair bit of attention) in several other subreddits. There are steady sources (subredditads, others' casual mentions) and it's been encouraging hearing positive response to the idea. I feel this will likely be the most robust source, but I could be wrong (plenty of people use adblock). Still, on some level it'll bring in new folks even when other sources have died down - I've found plenty of subs via interesting ads. There's always the most basic strategy - casual name drops. Any initial 'novelty-based' waves can cause some nice influxes, but of course can't be relied on for long. And these can't be forced, but honestly with the recent discussions on the problems with communities there are plenty of opportunities to bring it up (look at how many times you've heard voat be mentioned lately. Any time someone mentions abusive powermods, models for 'bettering the system' get thrown around. Having a working, testable model for people to check out and even use is leagues ahead of other merely-proposed models).   A lot hinges on what ideas people see proposed during the early phase, when they just visit/'pass through' the sub. Which is why I think in the beta testing phase I'll keep a special eye out for campaign ideas which sound promising and invite those to be ""initial launch"" campaigns.  That way, when the actual launching posts are made for the subreddit (which is presumably when any major influxes would happen) there will hopefully be a few popular campaigns up already; seeing a successful campaign or two occur, and demonstrating the system ""works,"" should get things going.  Also, we're thinking of limiting the initial campaign size availabilities to smaller subreddits - seeing a bunch of hopefuls create campaigns for huge subreddits that just take up space on the front page and don't go anywhere won't do us or them any good.    Still, no amount of prep is too much on this front. Nearly everything else can be changed or modified down the road, but you don't get a second chance at a first impression. I'll welcome any advice or further recommended reading on this topic."

The difficulty acts as a filter to weed out lazy or bad mods, the bad ideas, the poor quality, and any other toxicity. There needs to be a few hurdles and it should require hard work. People creating subreddits shouldn't be handed or spoon fed large communities. Let them work for it. That ""work"" also usually equates to more experience and a respect for their communities.   That's actually becoming a larger issue as reddit matures. Large default subreddits adding lots of mods, mods who weren't there in the very beginning and didn't grow with the sub. They may not feel the same connection or sense of ownership. A sense of ownership usually results in empathy and more concern for the community. It gives you a different perspective. That's another benefit to growing a sub over a long period of time versus just being handed a large community.  That said, there are plenty of examples of subreddits successfully branching off and creating spin-offs or direct competitors. I'm in sort of a unique position because I have quite a bit of experience growing subreddits up from scratch into something successful. I was around for TIL's humble beginnings and we worked our butts off to get that subreddit up and running. It took 3 years of slow but steady growth for us to become a default (and this was back when there were only 10 defaults). And once we hit default status, it wasn't smooth sailing; the workload didn't get less, it got worse. The focus was less on growing the subreddit and more on maintaining some semblance of quality and order.   And it wasn't just a one-off occurrence, I've also been a part of /r/eatcheapandhealthy's mod team from the very beginning. The mods there worked incredibly hard (adding lots of content, holding contests, giving away prizes) and slowly grew the sub to its current size with more that 230k subscribers. In a saturated topic like food (there are lots of food subreddits), I think it was quite the achievement for the mod team there. They're a fantastic bunch. :)  I also mod a subreddit that won an admin-held subreddit growth challenge 3 years straight (here). The reason I'm mentioning all of this is not to brag (bragging sickens me), but to show that the system isn't broken. I'm not the brightest crayon in the box and I have no problems 'working it' or helping others work it. Just because nobody is interested in a particular topic or community doesn't mean the system is broken. It might mean that you haven't put in the work, the general population either doesn't share your gripes, the problem isn't as severe as you think it is, or you overestimate the amount of people actually interested in what you're pitching."

One of the things I suppose, then, I should keep in mind - is that I should maintain some difficulties in substarting a subreddit; just that none of them should be logistical difficulties. (The hardship should not be in getting your idea seen or considered, it should be in selling users on your idea, and your capability to lead it and see it through.)  Actually, the system we're developing makes it so that potential subreddit owners have to be a part of the discussion thread, posting their ""vision"" for the proposed subreddit, and that users vote on the vision for the subreddit that they believe in. (If they choose not to participate, whoever ended up leading the discussion would end up the owner.) In this way, the ""hardship"" is selling users on your specific ideas for how to run the subreddit.  What are your thoughts on that, think it's a tough enough hurdle to weed out the riff-raff?

I think your idea is a fine idea, it sounds great to me. :) I think it has a lot of potential if you and any other mods you add are passionate about the project. In my experience, the more passionate you are about your subreddit or project, the more success you'll have. The most successful mods I've worked with have always been the most passionate & active.   I think your biggest hurdle (and this applies to most subreddits) would be promotion. But you really can't promote it without content so I'd work on that. Once you get a rhythm going and the subreddit starts becoming more fleshed out, start promoting the crap out of it. Name drops help, and I'd also look into getting one of those sidebar ads, which I believe are free if it's to promote a subreddit but are up to the admins discretion (further incentive to flesh out the sub, easier for them to give it the rubber stamp).  As for trolls and riff-raff, I don't think that will be much of a concern until the subreddit gets larger, and by then, you'll probably already have some idea how adequately deal with it since you've watched it fester and have become more intimate with the problem."

What happens when a subreddit grows in this manner and then these elements creep in. What mechanism weeds these out at scale?   The strongest asset I wish to build is a community with leaders who know and understand the risks and problems communities face. (There are a few knowledgable individuals I already have in mind. Others I anticipate adding from the metadiscussions themselves).   The point of such would be that the actual problems that communities face are discussed beforehand - making /r/substarter an incubation area, a testing ground, for new kinds of subreddits to be created from and tested quickly.   We can have our bot preset flags on the subreddit (neverdefault. openmodlog. impeachable-mods) and set up a subreddit such that its mods are impeachable from an installed bot that does nothing else, verifiable by open moderation logs - or preset to never be a default, enforced by a bot. But these are just examples - we can allow for that kind of unprecedented testing, provide the first-of-its-kind place for users who have for years believed things to be necessary in 'fixing a core reddit problem' to start implementing those kinds of solutions, or other ones they can dream up.   Competitive subreddits on the same topic is a largely myth and that's where my frustration is.   And that's impossible without some lowering of the barrier to entry for new subreddits, exactly the point of this project.  There's nothing wrong with reddit's solution, in theory - in practice it's always had a high barrier to entry from a user standpoint, a barrier which I've in the past advocated some /r/ideasfortheadmins to try and lower.

Without a solidified field for meta-discussion on a subreddit, there's no way to hold moderators accountable for when the subreddit changes from the 'initial vision' - hell, the 'initial vision' is seldom known by the bulk of users. Nor is there a way to quickly 'branch off' a sub to try and stay true to the initial cause.   The point of creating a discussion place for people to discuss a subreddit's vision (this is the main term I'm pushing as the one to gravitate towards - hell, the post describing the sub is called my 'vision for substarter') is to solidify that into something more concrete than the subreddits we've had have had - and to get communities involved in trying to keep the sub true to its roots.  There's some other experimental stuff I've got simmering away with regards to dealing with the ""huge explosion of subscribers"" issues, but some of those are a bit extreme and unlikely to be used. Still, the point is to move in the direction of creating a place to incubate these ideas at all - at worst, it fails and we learn why."

TheoryOfReddit,36hetz,audentis,1 point,Tue May 19 20:03:06 2015 UTC,"What happens when a subreddit grows in this manner and then these elements creep in. What mechanism weeds these out at scale?   Depends on about a dozen different factors and which element you're referring to. There are examples of mechanisms in place working but they all depend on the problem. Lower mods on the totem pole becoming overzealous? The mods higher up can (and usually will) deal with them. The top mod goes nuts and turns out to be a racist? <poof> /r/Trees is created... It all depends on the situation but I've witnessed the checks and balances myself and know they work.    Maybe this is why many subs have instituted rulesets that vastly change the character of what the sub grew up as. But usually these changes are instituted by the top mod of the sub that has been there since the beginning.   I think ""rules"" are meant to address 2 separate things. Either keeping a subreddit on track and on topic or to improve the quality of the sub by stomping out an unwanted element.  When the top mod(s) enact rules, they usually do it to keep the subreddit in line with their vision of how they want(ed) their subreddit to be. The larger the subreddit, the easier it is to get off-topic and the lowest common denominator reigns supreme. That's when rules need to be put in place - to deal with a subreddit that, for whatever reason, has gotten off topic and/or seeing a decline in quality.   Has a former default ever been beat by a competitor?   I think defaults should be exempt from this discussion since they're hand-picked by the admins. It's not really fair to discuss/compare subreddits that aren't playing the same game.  But for the sake of argument, even if we wanted to compare, how would we do it? What constitutes a competitor? Is /r/ListenToThis a competitor to /r/Music? If so, the competition is close since they're both defaults and both music subreddits. What about /r/LifeProTips? Are they a competitor to /r/YouShouldKnow or /r/HowTo? Not all competitors are as obvious as /r/News and say, /r/News2.   I'd like /r/EatCheapAndHealthy to become a default, it has the subscribers, content, traffic and community (and experienced mods) but there's already a food-related subreddit in the default set. /r/Food is a great subreddit with a great modteam so we have our work cut out for us. Though, you won't find me complaining or crying about it. We'll just have to work harder, facilitate an environment where great content can flourish and prove ourselves as mods.  Though now that I think about it, /r/Technology is no longer a default while /r/gadgets was brought in and replaced it. I think that counts as at least 1? The admins have shown they will remove subs they deem bad or unstable and replace them. This is yet another check/balance.   TIL grew up as a much free-er place than it is now.   That's incredibly misleading, bordering on flat out wrong. Most of our rules existed long before we became a default. Keep in mind we were a non-default sub for over 3 years. Our rules were put in place during that time as the subreddit grew & got popular. When we saw obvious problems we moved to address them. I would argue that it's our rules that allowed good content to flourish and allowed TIL to see the popularity it has. TIL simply wouldn't exist without its rules. They're the foundation of the subreddit. :)  Also keep in mind the quality of a community with 10-20k subscribers and one with 8 million are not going to be the same. In order to to raise the quality of the latter to the former, strict rules and moderation are required."

TheoryOfReddit,36hetz,jaxspider,3,Tue May 19 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"I have an anecdote that might give you a new perspective.     When I first ran into /r/manufacturing it had ~300 subscribers (most of which inactive) but pretty much only spam submissions and no comments or community interaction. I requested to join as moderator and got to work. Now we've grown to 1,996 subscribers at time of writing, comments on the majority of links and practically all spam is held back by Automoderator. Our biggest issue is providing regular content: usually we get one or two links a day, though it has slowed down a bit this week. Altogether I dare say the ""renovation"" is a success, and went through similar steps a new subreddit does.  I did it by focusing on providing content at least once every other day, creating an active front page for the sub from the very start. After doing so for a week or two I reached out to various related subreddits (big and small) if they were willing to link to us in their sidebar. This has been the only ""community hunting"" I've done. Everything else was focused on content. We had a few sources back then that would practically spread out their content over the week so that there was a continuous supply of articles and videos instead of ""spikes"" on one day and nothing on another, and content varied from videos to articles to questions from industry outsiders and insiders.      The reason I'm sharing this anecdote is that I believe good content is much more important for a new subreddit than an initial community.   Therefore perhaps it would be better to try to connect content creators (blog writers, YouTube channels, and so on) to relevant new subreddits. Either by having the creators offer their services, or by having new subreddits explain their needs and having people suggest content sources for them.   A big advantage of this new model is that subscribers of /r/substarter can help new subreddits even if they're not interested in subscribing to the new subs themselves.   Hopefully this helps.

Though while you outline some good points with regards to what can be done with OAuth API access, I've noted user tendency in the past to only readily adopt bots which they can use with a PM rather than looking through whatever access the bot is asking for.  (Then again, we live in the age of the app, maybe people are more conditioned to whiz past auth screens than I think. shrug)  Either way, good work man. Hope to see more from you."
TheoryOfReddit,36i89c,noobit,0,Tue May 19 21:12:22 2015 UTC,I agree and I think that PM bots are usually the way to go.  The really revolutionary thing is that this approach can be used to host a PM bot in a user friendly way (once I get permanent auth sorted out)

Read your comment, though:   What we have above is another example of the beloved Reddit tradition of lying for karma since the truth is too boring to get votes, don't co-participate. The only way for someone to not know their family is Mexican is if they have a developmental disability that does not allow them to have full adult cognition -- in which case it is not a joke. Or if their biological mom and dad wasn't in their life to tell him he was Mexican. Yet in your pathetically constructed lie everyone in town knew his Mexican family and that he was Mexican.   When exposing those who might have lied, it is often better to politely ask questions than to jump to conclusions. You were far, far too certain this guy was lying, and you went on to make broad generalizations about Reddit.  Don't take this the wrong way, but you're in such a rush to expose people you think have lied, I think you're letting it cloud your judgement. I used to be the same way, but a few years back at a graduation ceremony I happened to run into John McCain. He said something that, to this day, sticks with me. ""Bad assumptions are just lies we tell ourselves."""
TheoryOfReddit,367io6,if_it_was_a_snake,2,Sun May 17 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"re: John McCain, because that's a fascinating tangential discussion --  We will never know for sure if this is true, because anyone who voluntarily goes into politics is a biased sample and we can't just force a very average person into a high-level political position, but I have a feeling politicians are not especially more dishonest than an average person. In fact, I'd suspect they're more honest, since they are not allowed to blatantly lie, and because their statements are constantly scrutinized by media and the public. I think the 'dishonesty' of politicians is a perception due to the visibility of their lies, and that if average people were put into the political spotlight, they would lie more.  I also suspect something that can be measured, but I don't know how you'd go about doing this: certain professions stigmatized with lying, such as law, in fact lie less, because their statements are held to higher standards of truth. Rather, we more are more aware when they do lie, because their lies directly affect us. Drug dealers lie a lot about what it is they do for money to people who aren't aware they are drug dealers, but during their actual money-making process they have a disincentive to lie. I would be surprised if the most dishonest profession were not customer service, and it's an extremely common job. When I worked low-level customer service I lied more in one day than I had for months at a time previous to that, so I would be surprised if that was not at the top of the list of dishonest professions."

TheoryOfReddit,367io6,AnxiousReginald,2,Sun May 17 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"So your hypothesis is that lying on reddit is an intrinsically bad thing. Your argument is that there are many instances where people have lied for their own benefit.   Your argument is fine, everyone agrees that people don't tell the truth on reddit. Not everyone agrees that this is bad. You didn't need to address the Mexican/ Brazilian argument in reference to the above poster's comment. It doesn't prove your hypothesis.   You need to look at the points people are making and fight or accept the points in relation to your argument.   Most people have pointed out that some people are trying to legitimately debate on reddit, but some are trying to entertain themselves, or something in between. Based upon this assumption, lying isn't the worst thing that people do, and when it comes to having real conversations with real-world people, eg AMAs, there are as many verification steps taken as possible."

For the sake of solidarity I will say I agree with you wholeheartedly, and I am astounded at how often people defend blatant BS on that grounds. I'm all for people making things up in creative writing subs, but when you bullshit in subs that are at least de jure 'truth', there is a problem. A comment from a very old thread on here that summed it up well; re: why does it matter if a story is true:   Because it creates a sort of ""fiction arms race"".  We operate in an environment where people get rewarded for having the best story. (""Best"" is a sliding scale that varies by purpose: funniest; most interesting; most authoriative; most relatable; etc.) Upvotes, gold, favourable comments, ""Hey you're that guy with the great story"", etc. The good news is that real stories are by-definition more interesting than fiction, right? That veneer of ""it could happen to you!"" makes it personal and piques our attention in a way that fiction simply can't. But when fiction and non-fiction become indistinguishable, there's just no way for the non-fiction to keep up. And people will begin competing for attention on those terms: ""real"" stories will be flushed out in favour of utter fabulism, each story more fantastical -- and fictional -- than the last.  Now, after a certain point, it has to collapse under its own weight: the stories become so obviously fictional that people stop listening or taking them seriously, and the whole thing becomes a laughingstock. With that in mind, this problem is, to some degree, self-correcting.  But even when it self-corrects, it's only going to self-correct as far as necessary in order to regain a veneer of truth. And once it reaches that point, you can be sure it'll start escalating once again..."

An easy way to do that is to make up something other people like.  The upvoters, who know they are being lied to, upvote because they, like you and me and everyone else on the planet, have a capacity to overlook truths (let alone mere suspicions) that stand in the way of their desired vision. Your capacity, like mine, is just lower than most peoples'.  AskReddit is not a forum seeking truth. It is a forum that uses anecdote as a means to 1) entertain (even the [serious] ones fall in the category of info-tainment at best and voyeurism at worst) and 2) validate what you already believe.   Finally, liars who reveal their lies are upvoted because 1) 'lying on the internet' is a meme people like to reaffirm and 2) cleverness is the number one most valued attribute in the internet subculture, and fooling lots of people takes some cleverness (""wow if they fooled me they must be clever!"" - reddit)."

Meyer's claim that people can be taught to accurately identify lies is not supported by any empirical evidence (and runs contrary to current scientific consensus on the topic). Thus the bit you quoted about lying being a ""co-operative act"" is entirely baseless, not to mention nonsensical.   It is sorta ironic that for all your preoccupation with redditers forwarding and baselessly accepting ""lies"" you yourself have forwarded and accepted a ""lie."" Though I doubt that was really the case -- you probably just didn't take the time to check sources. Perhaps this is what other redditers are doing when you accuse them of accepting and rewarding lies? I doubt many people recognize they're being lied to and believe the lie nonetheless. This seems more like the case of people being people and thus having all sorts of biases and prejudice.    to experience the type of behavior that most the rest of the non-reddit internet and society frowns upon.

It's definitely a theory that I agree with- but let's face it, reddit exists for entertainment purposes.  Users frequently toss an up-vote to things that amuse them, regardless of the truth because they're entertained. It doesn't really matter if that entertainment is based in truth or lies- that's why there's a distinction between fiction and non-fiction.  I guess my point is, who cares that lying is prevalent on reddit?  Who cares if a story is fiction or non-fiction?  For that matter, who takes anything on the internet that isn't peer reviewed or from multiple independent sources to be factual anyways?"

TheoryOfReddit,367io6,aldernon,-1,Sun May 17 01:17:07 2015 UTC,"I think if we talk of the purpose of the creators who established Reddit and people paid to run Reddit the purpose is to hopefully make money. No doubt when they created it they were hoping to become famous and make it big and they have.    But what are the results for us, the users? If you have registered and participated on the ground as a poster -- quality discussion is definitely not something that Reddit is good at. For example, why did I have to waste so much time making a bullshit meta-analysis navel gazing post of Reddit behavior as it relates to lying? How come I cannot get what I wanted when I registered at Reddit, to have quality discussions and instead have to invest huge effort into analyzing why such a simple proposition is not possible? If I internalized the karma system as it is, I could only conclude that I am the failure. But when you contextualize the type of posts I cited approving of blatant lies, a different pictures emerges, that the mechanisms of Reddit and its ""me-me-me"" userbase are the likely problems. Reddit has a huge amount of meta-analysis and meta-drama. Reddit is like a game that traps you and sucks in, but quality discussion is definitely very rare because of the Reddit karma whoring, multiple nicknames and other drama games going on and encouraged to further Reddit's lust for pageviews.   The people who run Reddit sadly are more interested in such games that are drawing quality, serious posters away. The quality level is only going get worse and worse, even if for a time they will conclude -- falsely -- that everything is getting better because there are more users wasting more time(and wasting is the operative word with the rife drama, karma games, meta-posts and meta-analysis).   Reddit makes me feel like I am fucking back in high school, and I don't mean that in a good way. It forces me to invest huge effort into analyzing why Reddit, like high school is what is crazy and superficial, and not me."

If you come here for entertainment I suppose it wouldn't bother you, but community was a big part for me when first using reddit. When I joined I thought I was interacting with interesting people from all walks of life, from all around the world. But each time someone fabricates a story or reposts an entertaining item pretending it's theirs, the wool is removed from my eyes a little more and I'm shown that instead I'm interacting with people who have very little life experience: a userbase primarily consisting of computer-bound 20-year old college educated white males that place enough value on imaginary internet points in order to put serious effort in to lying.  I used to look at the top of /r/pics, or read askreddit threads, and think ""Wow, what a diverse community reddit contains, and I get to interact directly with these people"". Nowadays, it's quite clear that was never the case."
TheoryOfReddit,367io6,aldernon,9,Sun May 17 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"Let's step back for a moment and ask ourselves-  How much of that is just the feeling of losing your innocence?   Reddit, like most forums that allow for anonymity and grow popular, simply can't ensure that what the community posts is in any way factual outside of select instances (verified by mods).   I've been using reddit for 4 years, and yes its a great idea that it's a diverse community- but there's no way to know for a fact. All data would be self-reported. There's liars everywhere. I went to High School with a kid who 'worked with Blackwater', and he's now serving 5 years in federal penitentiary for impersonating a federal officer. Some people are compulsive liars, and the ease of access to something like reddit makes it practically a breeding ground for them- easy validation and the more outlandish the story, the more attention they get. On top of that, self-reporting as something outlandish would ruin any data acquisition- but it's something that these power users would assuredly do just for validation.  It's definitely possible to find communities and intelligent discussions on various subreddits. I've unsubscribed from most default subreddits over the years, so I don't even know how bad most of them are now- I was frustrated with them years ago, and I imagine it's only gotten worse. Even most of the subreddits that I'm in now have been watered down to an extent. There's a sweet spot in population where the community can police itself- and it's also a sweet spot in the audience that is attracted before the subreddit is riddled by memes, etc. that water down the discussion.   The premises that I would suggest are thus:   Reddit cannot viably distinguish truth from fiction, barring extreme cases of evidence (picture verification, contacting mods, etc.)  The ease of creating accounts results in a lack of attachment to ones account. Similar to things like Steam, people may have a main account and alt accounts that they mess around with. There's no real punishment for completely fabricating a story unless it goes too viral and you get doxxed, which is when things get super scary. People want attention. Reddit offers an easy way for them to receive that attention- thus, alt accounts et cetera. Not all users- but some. This provides a population that would abuse reddit gleefully.  Recognizing those previous ideas, reddit realistically cannot guarantee truth- outside of the select circumstances, typically AMAs or news reports with various independent sources. Thus, it's better to assume that all posts are for the concept of the post rather than the facts asserted. Sometimes they can be informative and present new ideas- other times, they present amusement or otherwise engage the user.    Those are my thoughts on it at the moment. Interesting concepts though to be sure- but I'm going to go get drunk, hopefully this discussion will continue and there will be more opinions offered."
TheoryOfReddit,367io6,EYESoftheHAWK,1 point,Sun May 17 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"verified by mods   ... has very little to do with actual facticity, given that mods are, taken as a whole, no more or less responsible and well informed than the rest of Reddit."

Sure, the mods definitely might be getting duped though. They also might be deliberately undermining the legitimacy of the subreddit- but I'm going to need to see some evidence before I believe that.

But on reddit I cannot even discuss those things either on subs that appear to be set up explicitly for the purpose of discussing those subjects! To explain would require too much, but like I showed in the original seeding thread, a subreddit appears to be set up for a particular stated purpose, but the hidden purpose matters more. And you cannot learn the dominant hidden purpose and circlejerks without wasting too much time and experiencing much frustration.    Here is the parent nested comment from the askreddit comment I cited above, it has 1094 karma:      Back a few years ago, probably about the time I got this username, there was an AMA by a kid who had some terminal disease and was going to go through with assisted suicide.

Years of philosophy studies taught me that if you look long enough, everything can be construed as a construct of bullshit and lies. Why worry about what is truth when truth is a horribly subjective thing? Live earnestly if that is what you desire and don't stress others motivations.

I was pretty sure discussion forums existed for discussion for the most part -- at least they used to. Seeing the whole world and the internet as only having utility if they lead to entertainment and lulz is not a good mentality and trend for Reddit, the rest of the internet and society. The consequences already aren't good and are only going to get worse.    Long ago public intellectuals like Neil Postman contrasted the changes from the once dominant public print culture to the dominant tv culture that took over when he wrote Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Postman argued that Orwell dystopic vision of the future didn't come to pass but that of Huxley did:     What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions"". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us."

For example modern work is predicated on the premise that for as long as you are at work you are to pretend to appear working at rapt attention at all times you are on the clock. So of course with that fiction regulating modern work as a wage earner at a corporation, of course you are not gonna admit to your boss you goofed off, browsed the net, or took a nap when you thought you could. However, such lies are necessary since you cannot pretend to be the economic machine modern capitalist economic theory wants you to be -- we are humans not abstract capital earning machines. But lying for fucking internet karma? Come on, that is just pathetic on all levels. Again, my proposal which of course will never be adopted is dispense with the karma upvoting and downvoting system. It is exactly what reinforces such negative attention whoring, but Reddit is interested in pageviews and capturing attention, not quality discussion. So that will never, ever happen. Eventually such negative trends will drive more and more quality posters away, till what is left is people who are not capable of proper discourse."

TheoryOfReddit,367qij,whaleye,10,Sun May 17 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"No, that doesn't happen. If you're down voted, you're just screwed. The algorithm is in place so that no matter how many upvotes you get, the actual score of the post can't usually exceed a certain threshold. The limit used to be about 2k,but I believe they've increased it to 4k or 5k. Essentially, they enforce a vote ratio, it used to be 60% but I'm not sure what it is now"
TheoryOfReddit,367qij,HandicapperGeneral,3,Sun May 17 02:38:06 2015 UTC,I usually see non-controversial posts around 85%
TheoryOfReddit,367qij,ZotohZhaan,1 point,Sun May 17 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"As someone who normally gets downvoted to oblivion... (it takes a relatively small number of immediate downvotes to make your post disappear forever.)... so yes... you are screwed.  And apparently even if I'm funny enough for people to upvote me, I have to be funny enough to overcome THE FUZZING."
TheoryOfReddit,367qij,AnthonyCharlesXavier,5,Sun May 17 08:29:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the submissions are ranked based on how new they are in ""time"". Giving an upvote makes reddit treat that post as if it was posted later, i.e. its more ""new"" downvoting has an opposite effect.  This shift an upvote makes exponentially decreases as the post gets more popular. So upvoting a post while its on +5 makes more of a difference than upvoting when its on +5000. This means that even the most popular posts will eventually leave the front page but they get to stay there longer.  Automatic downvotes are usually applied to very popular posts to ensure constant movement and there's also some other mechanism that changes upvotes and downvotes I'm unsure of but it all essentially works to allow the most popular content to be seen while allowing new content to also be seen.  Comments are ranked differently. Based purely on the upvote to downvote ratio I believe.  Edit: interesting article http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2013/01/16/the-mathematics-of-reddit-rankings-or-how-upvotes-are-time-travel/  Also I think the fuzzing mentioned elsewhere helps stop spambots somehow."

If anyone wants to know why, it's because there really wasn't an official name for the up or down arrows so people just used reddit's source code definition which is ""upmod"" and ""downmod"".   So to sum up; I believe that the hive mind of the user base of reddit has not really changed that much.   You're not going back far enough. 6 years isn't that far back as far as culture shift goes. When I joined 8 years ago, reddit had already begun to change. Reddit how I remember it when I first joined, was a mirror reflection of hackernews. The similarities between the content which reaches their front page and the comment sections are practically identical. If you want to know how reddit used to be, go take a look at that site. Then compare it to now. I'd say reddit has changed considerably since those early days."

The first big collapse of Digg into Reddit I remember was the April 2007 AACS key stuff and Imgur was founded by Alan Schaaf in 2009.    SOOO I think your 6 year threshold misses the major changes, and just BARELY covers the Digg v4 collapse of August 25, 2010.  Digg's exodus and Imgur's takeover were the two major cultural changes that shaped the current reddit.

I do think that things have actually improved from it's worst. It could be that subscribing to the ""right"" subs has made the difference. My guess is that the worst behavior has moved to other venues. I think the reddit system/culture is pretty good at filtering. Just look at the YouTube comment ghetto for an idea of how terrible things can be. /aside/ went back and looked at slashdot the other day... It was exactly the same as it was when I left!!!"
TheoryOfReddit,365wvi,AbouBenAdhem,12,Sun May 17 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"The big changes were all within the first year or so, when the site was still small enough that most of the regular users were familiar with each other. At that time users with unpopular opinions still had an uphill battle, but if one of them built a reputation for consistently and thoughtfully explaining their views, they were accepted and even sought out to get their opinions.  That reddit died long before subreddits were introduced; subreddits were an attempt to recapture that small-community sense, but if anything they just accelerated its breakdown. Now if someone finds their opinions are unpopular, they go to a different subreddit instead of trying to discuss them with a hostile audience. And if they do take the time to explain and discuss their views, a few hours later no one remembers who they were.  Once you introduce the idea that a community should divide itself up on the basis of different interests and opinions, those things can no longer be discussed on a community level; they can only be discussed in a venue where lack of confomity is seen as an existential threat to the venue itself."

Once upon a time when I would get orangereds I would have to worry about getting attacked for my views.  I would think, ""awesome, who have I pissed off now"" but in the last few years I've found a lot more pleasant.  Same thing with any mention of church or God.  At one point any mention of organized religion would be met with a flurry of downvotes and accustions of being stupid, a puppet, etc etc.  Now it is met with a much more neutral approach.  People chime in with, ""hey, I did that too"" or ""Back when I went to church I used to do XYZ...""    Reddit is a much better cross section of society now.

TheoryOfReddit,365wvi,Kebble,25,Sat May 16 21:43:34 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but now anything that used to be a circlejerk in the past is just remplaced by a meta-circlejerk of some sorts. In the past you'd have the anti-religion circlejerk, nowadays whenever someone criticizes some aspect of religion he's met with downvotes and ""wow you're edgy"" ""m'lady"" ""nice fedora you've got there"".   It's really just counter-culture switching back and forth with actual-culture, and memes being replaced by other memes and even meta-memes.

Is there a reason to think reddit's gotten better, or that your experience on reddit is better? The subreddit system lets you customize reddit to things you like, or away from things you hate. So when you start visiting reddit, you are shown the defaults, some of which are awful. When you stop viewing those, your experience on reddit improves, even if reddit as a whole is devolving."
TheoryOfReddit,365wvi,js155306,7,Sat May 16 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yep.

More moderate opinions are found less and less because of the number of users which are ready to argue with such an opinion. Until a few years ago, if you posted something moderate you'd get 5 people arguing with you one way and 5 arguing another way. Today, you get 150 people in each direction, so it's better to keep your opinion to yourself than facing 300 angry users (instead of the previous 6). These numbers are not exactly pulled out of my ass, they're approximately the number of millions of reddit users (sure, it's not just the registered ones, but you get the idea).  Also, people tend to focus a lot on heated discussions, so, while there's a good chance your comment will be ignored, there's also a small change that you'll end up with hundreds of replies and on the front page of SRD. The risk is just not worth it.  And then there are users like me who stopped giving a crap a long time ago. I used to enjoy discussion, I still enjoy it a bit, but most of the time when I comment with an argument I am purposefully looking for a heated debate and this increases the polarization.

TheoryOfReddit,365wvi,notatallexpected,3,Sat May 16 22:04:21 2015 UTC,"I think reddit has changed a lot... but pick a point in time.  Reddit was a small predictable community in the early years all about tech/gadgets/programming/science.  I want to say i first started visiting the site in the first 6 months to year... and probably my first 'account' was made just after subreddits started.  The thing was, outside of political rhetoric... you knew everyday you'd browse through the front page getting similar stuff.  There was a guy who used to post pics of trucks everyday (mets something?) and everyday he'd post/you'd see some pic of a 18 wheeler truck and trailer.  It's sort of weird to get nostalgic about it, but it felt like a small town.  Even things like the yatzee guy doing his video game reviews on wed/thurs was a thing for a long time... I don't remember seeing one in years when it used to be a weekly thing.  TED videos used to frontpage all the time - crickets now.  So, reddit has changed a lot imo.  it's a different site altogether.  I'd argue that people thinking a 'redditor' is a thing now is an antiquated idea being you can subscribe to whatever you are interested in and the only default 'reddit - reddit.com' was removed years ago."

Like I said: it complements your efforts when its relevant, but if you're just searching comment threads for opportunities to advertise, then you're gonna get unpopular really quick."
TheoryOfReddit,3631du,Xelif,2,Fri May 15 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yes i suppose that seems relevant. It is going to be hard i must say though because it's not a fan related subreddit in that i'm promoting the answering and asking of questions, not goats."

Attention. Make an effort to watch over your sub; every few hours, check the /r/WhyShouldIBother/new and /r/WhyShouldIBother/comments queues to ensure that new posts and comments are noticed and nurtured. Time. Give it a while to grow. These things take time. The default subreddit /r/WritingPrompts had about 1K subscribers on Oct 30, 2012. It had a million subscribers on Sep 20, 2014."
TheoryOfReddit,3631du,go1dfish,4,Fri May 15 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of the work for getting /r/purpleLounge off the ground. Firstly, you need to be relevant and/or unique. Super niche subreddits are cool, but they take a long time to get a large backing. Sometimes it can be impossible to get a subreddit growing quickly. Next, you need some good CSS. That doesn't mean just change the color of the font and background. This means you need to research on how to use the reddit stylesheet and/or find someone else who does. Be creative and stick to a theme. Finally, get some ads. You're already doing this, so you're on the right track. There's the sub /r/subredditads where you can request free ads.      Let me know if you need any advice on this stuff."

TheoryOfReddit,3631du,unique616,2,Tue May 19 22:19:09 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, the best avenues up to this point have been the ones you touched on (/r/newreddits, subreddit ads) plus things like /r/Subredditoftheday and other 'discovery' subreddits tailored to your needs.

TheoryOfReddit,36511j,glitchegiffer,3,Sat May 16 05:11:24 2015 UTC,A lot of subs are against x-posts and even more so identified x-posts because they view it as a form of 'spam'.  I don't think any of the defaults allow for identified cross posts anymore either.    I doubt reddit would ban you for spamming for using this tactic (unless you were using it to spam your own site(s)) but I do expect many mods would remove these sorts of posts in larger subs.  NSFW reddit may be different I don't pay as much attention to the moderation there.
TheoryOfReddit,36511j,go1dfish,3,Sat May 16 07:02:08 2015 UTC,"until now, I only know of one mod whose removed, a post i made to his/her sub that i know of, his/her reply was not too polite so I choose not to contribute to that sub even though quite a few of my submissions would fit right in that sub. I'm not too certain of other submissions, i don't care for the votes they get up or down, and will go back to a post only to reply to a comment if it warrants a reply. But i do hope if a mod does take down a post they'd let the OP know."

TheoryOfReddit,36511j,felix1429,3,Thu May 21 01:05:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's spamming unless you really do it a lot. I've definitely done it before though.

TheoryOfReddit,35uvic,bulletninja,11,Thu May 14 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"Depends. I was a big contributor very early in the history of /r/indie_rock, along with a handful of other users. Probably 95% of the posts were from a group of 5ish people for the first six months. We kept at it long enough for subscribers to start to pile up and since there were a few new links every day people kept coming back and spreading the word.  I actually think the 'tipping point', as silly as it sounds, was when people realized that there was a decent amount of karma up for grabs. It didn't really attract much people when most links were getting 4 or 5 points, but once things were consistently getting 20-30 upvotes and beyond it seemed like more people were willing to contribute, for what it's worth."

I realize there's a widespread description on reddit of karma as worthless internet points, and that's obviously true, but it's not as though posting a link to a cool article, picture, or video you find to reddit is hard so the reward doesn't have to be that significant. There are problems with the karma system, but I do think it's an important factor in why people post things even if it doesn't have any particular value."
TheoryOfReddit,35uvic,zaron5551,4,Wed May 13 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"Karma is the best indication that you're not, unless you have access to the traffic stats, which is why it's important imo."

How the fuck is that good? I don't want to read what is posted just for karma -- especially if it lacks value.   Value is what matters, not imaginary internet points. What you are saying is like saying what mattered in high school is what fellow immature teenagers thought was cool by mob rule -- things like binge drinking and doing drugs and randomly hooking up at parties because of it. Think of how many people you know who now have kids because of such random hookups, kids that won't have both parents in their lives.    Life is serious business. When you look at it as a popularity game, you tend to lose."

TheoryOfReddit,35uvic,noobit,7,Thu May 14 05:29:17 2015 UTC,"The internet follows the 1% rule (and reddit does too, for the most part). 1 submitter, 9 commentators, 90 lurkers. Right now, you are the 1%. That 1% attracts the other 99% to it.  It's not really about size. It's about what those people are doing. The 1% rule is really more of a guideline; a subreddit takes off when you have lots of submitters and commentators, not at some abstract number. There are subs that are virtually dead at ~1,000 members, and subs that are quite active at ~10. Keep up with posting good, original content, foster good discussion, promote in other subreddits, and eventually the subreddit will grow with time."
TheoryOfReddit,35uvic,alexanderwales,1 point,Wed May 20 06:06:47 2015 UTC,"There are subs that are virtually dead at ~1,000 members   Why do you think these subs don't see more activity? If that number were higher (say 10k) do you think the potential for inactivity would still be there?"
TheoryOfReddit,35uvic,noobit,1 point,Wed May 13 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"If I use the 1% rule as my very simple model, then for every user I add there's a 1% chance they'll be a poster, a 9% chance that they'll be a commentator, and a 90% chance that they'll be a lurker. However, just like flipping a coin, you don't always get an even distribution of heads and tails.  A sub of ~1000 will have (using this model) an average of ~10 posters - the people who put up new content, whether that's original or found. However, there will be some aberrations, because our distribution isn't perfect. Some of those subs will get unlucky on their coin flips, and they'll have ~1000 subs with 0 posters, which gives the commentators nothing to comment on, which in turn gives the lurkers nothing to see. The sub is then effectively dead.  In the opposite example, let's say that we have a sub of 10 people. We roll the dice ten times, and we get lucky and end up with 10 people who spend tons of time finding new content and posting a bunch of comments, making the sub much more active and ""alive"" than the ~1000 user sub with no one posting.  The reason that you see it less often as the sub gets bigger is two-fold. First, the larger the sub, the more likely they are to have some posters. Second, those posters are the ones that drive sub growth, so you wouldn't really expect a sub with no one posting anything in it to hit a large size in the first place. The theoretical tiny sub that's really active would probably gain users, while the theoretical large sub that's mostly dead would probably lose users, until some kind of equilibrium was attained.  And obviously this model of random assignment is flawed; some subs have wildly disproportionate rates of the three basic types of people (and those three basic types are really more of a gradient, and not one that can even directly apply to a single person, who might be a poster in /r/cats, a commentator in /r/gamephysics, and a lurker in /r/askreddit).  tl;dr: A large sub can be dead because no one is posting content to it, while a small sub can be lively because everyone there is active."

Your coordination of /r/hpmor's otherwise-disorganized efforts through the Final Exam was excellent. :)  Hmm - so following the gradient, the larger sub (10k) would be more likely to have the 'posters' and commenters necessary to make the sub ""alive.""   (I'm asking because of my interest in setting good 'preset size options' for my project - probably best to avoid 'starting up' a subreddit with only a thousand people if that subreddit's just a dead town after a while anyways)  If you're not busy, I'd welcome your thoughts or suggestions on that project."
TheoryOfReddit,35uvic,noobit,2,Wed May 20 06:23:23 2015 UTC,"You need that small sliver of people who are going to be doing most of the ""work"". I have no idea how to attract those sorts of people, besides posting good content and fostering good discussion. I think you have a good idea in ""starting a community the right way"", because I think that's where a lot of subreddits just immediately die (with a lack of focus, poor or non-existent moderation, etc.).  I'm pretty optimistic that it can work. My personal belief (which I have yet to find the time to empirically test) is that a subreddit lives and dies by those people doing the work, so making a new sub that will actually have legs is a matter of having enough people doing work (posting and commentating) regardless of how many people are subscribed.  (I should also say that I suspect you want a core of good content when the sub ""launches"" - a full page of posts which are of a high quality and typify what the sub should be about. Easier with some subs than others.)"

It never really took off though and it actually died out a bit over time, so imagine my surprise when I recently checked the count and it has almost 800 subscribers. And yet, 25th post is over 2 months old, 50th one is 5 months old. Pretty much the same it used to, if not worse.  Some subs can't take off regardless of numbers."

A common comment I've seen is people checking into that sub to say that they don't smoke, but just love the community. I want to create a community that acts as, well, 'hyggelig' for people (cozy warm and intimate) without having any other specific purpose. I realize that the name might be off putting because who the hell knows what hyggelig is off the top of their head? But I'm hoping that the obscure name will allow the community to self-define itself as '/r/hyggelig' rather than 'a sub for hyggelig'.  In terms of creating a community, I'm hoping that my posts will act as a template for creating a good emotional environment, and that the guidelines on the side will foster a good environment.  All that being said, I have no idea what I'm doing and these are all pipe dreams. If people show up to the sub and come away feeling happy, I'd be satisfied."

I don't care for any SRS, SJW, anti-SJW or anti-SRS crap. If I'm in a subreddit dedicated to sunflowers, I don't want to see it, hear about it or sniff it. I get that you're passionate about your cause. It's good to have passion for something. Whether it's legalizing weed or fighting racism in reddit comments (totally worth what little time you have left on earth, by the way), not everyone wants to or should care for those causes.

As a couple of asides: Men's rights areas are a lot worse than feminist areas, and if you think this sub is really unbiased and analytical then I suspect you haven't been reading into much of what goes on here.   I actually do read mensrights and while some are angry or will say things that are not politically correct there are moderated attempts to keep things civil and even handed, it's not a one sided slander and as long as you aren't trolling you get to say your piece and argue your position if you feel strongly.   The ""feminist areas"" as you put it will preemptively ban you for merely participating in another subreddit or ban you for not being 100% supportive. That doesn't seem unbiased or analytical to me.   I've been on reddit almost 9 years and registered for 8. I am intimately aware of what goes on in various subreddits. I've watched reddit evolve for better or worse. I will stop short of condemning entire subreddits but certain ones have a predilection against open and free discussion and it aint the mensrights type subs who seek to be inclusive even if you do not agree. The same cannot be said of many others."

Here is a great article by the guy behind Librivox looking for the reasons behind why he couldn't read anymore:   Why can’t we read anymore? Or, can books save us from what digital does to our brains?  ...  Dopamine and digital  It turns out that digital devices and software are finely tuned to train us to pay attention to them, no matter what else we should be doing. The mechanism, borne out by recent neuroscience studies, is something like this:    New information creates a rush of dopamine to the brain, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel good.    The promise of new information compels your brain to seek out that dopamine rush.    With fMRIs, you can see the brain’s pleasure centres light up with activity when new emails arrive.    So, every new email you get gives you a little flood of dopamine. Every little flood of dopamine reinforces your brain’s memory that checking email gives a flood of dopamine. And our brains are programmed to seek out things that will give us little floods of dopamine. Further, these patterns of behaviour start creating neural pathways, so that they become unconscious habits: Work on something important, brain itch, check email, dopamine, refresh, dopamine, check Twitter, dopamine, back to work. Over and over, and each time the habit becomes more ingrained in the actual structures of our brains.    How can books compete? Pleasing ourselves to death    There is a famous study of rats, wired up with electrodes on their brains. When the rats press a lever, a little charge gets released in part of their brain that stimulates dopamine release. A pleasure lever.    Given a choice between food and dopamine, they’ll take the dopamine, often up to the point of exhaustion and starvation. They’ll take the dopamine over sex. Some studies see the rats pressing the dopamine lever 700 times in an hour.    We do the same things with our email. Refresh. Refresh."

Do you think the President--or rather any politician--when writing their speeches (targeted for the 8th grade reading comprehension of the average voter), are worsening their interpersonal skills? I think they are strengthening them by 1) learning a new way to communicate and 2) learning how to communicate in a manner that has the broadest possible comprehension.  I sometimes limit my vocabulary and simplify my grammar to accommodate ESL speakers. I think this is a new communication skill.

Therefore downmodding someone can more easily be understood by all the users here, where on reddit we have many ""factions"" with almost entirely dissimilar life experiences and viewpoints, so a downvote is more likely to be interpreted as a ""fuck you"" than an ""I don't think what you bring to the table is accurate or productive."""

They have to vaguely contribute to the conversation, either by repeating the correct reddit ""in-joke"" or by adding something of actual value (analysis, relevant life experience). Users that don't meet that standard are downvoted and ostracized, and likely won't be inclined to comment further.  So the people who comment are the ones that understand how to pass that litmus test of writing something cogent that fits in with whatever the culture is of the subreddit they are posting to. I think as far as reading and writing are concerned, reddit users may be better than the general population. Not sure about other types of intelligence.  I think it's hard to get an accurate sense of even the commenter group due to the way comments are sorted. There are plenty of dumb comments on popular threads, but most of us well never read them due to the voting system.  It's an interesting question, to be sure."
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,Ninjasantaclause,4,Sun May 10 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, but I think the problem arises when we tend to associate intelligence with wisdom and everything else that is good, and our day to day experiences here is the opposite. People constantly berate each other or engage in mob behaviour, not respecting differing opinions. All something we don't consider intelligent people to do.  So I don't think the complains about redditors being stupid should be taken too literally, instead it's better to view them as expressing frustration in the lack of compassion.  I'm sure this wasn't your intention, but even your post feels to me as coming from place of conceit, as if we are somehow better than your ""average people""."
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,PantherHeel93,4,Sat May 9 11:48:34 2015 UTC,"This thread has become a social experiment now - every commenter is trying hard to live up to the standard that you just set for us.    Here, I'll say it again in 'redditor'-speak:    As you can see from the comments around mine, what you have done here is create a pseudocompetitive atmosphere in this thread all by itself, whereby the 'average redditor' is now slightly afraid to say anything in response to you in case the other commenters find their writing style too basic or unsophisticated. Conversely, those who feel comfortable expressing themselves using a more learned vernacular naturally feel inclined to want to comment in a thread such as this, where this aspect of their online personae is celebrated and indeed elevated beyond that of the common /r/funny rabble."

(Obviously, the comments in /r/AskHistorians are going to be much higher quality than, say, /r/atheism.). Was it your general impression, or did you spend time lurking in /r/AskReddit, for example?  This post reminds me that people besides my very Catholic family don't go on reddit.  I was kind of under the impression that average person=average reddit user.  I guess just proved your point for you, though.  Also, that essay had me grinning.  I've done some pretty shit paper writing of my own, but nothing compared to that."
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,Fibonacci35813,18,Sat May 9 10:00:40 2015 UTC,"Was it your general impression, or did you spend time lurking in /r/AskReddit[3] , for example?   It's a general impression after about eight years of using the website, but I've lurked /r/AskReddit, yes. subreddits weren't even around when I started using this site, there was just a general front page like Hacker News has now.  My account is only a few years old, but prior to this I would make new accounts for every post. That sounds extremely paranoid, but I signed up for reddit not long after an ex-girlfriend had leaked a nude video of me to the community of a video game for which I was well-known enough to have stalkers. I was around when Mr. Splashy Pants was the first notable thing this website did, when /u/911was_an_inside_job was the first novelty account, and so on.   This post is odd because it implies that people besides my very Catholic family don't go on reddit.   Any time I've been in a large, general-population group setting, the people who are on reddit are always the nerds of the group. There are a few people you wouldn't expect, like /r/weightroom obviously will not look like this, but generally, these are people you could pick out of a crowd and say ""yeah, this person probably knows what dogecoin is.""  Your job might distort your perspective. If you work tech support most people will use reddit, but tech support selects for people who are competent at using computers, because otherwise, they would not get paid to help much less competent people with computers."

My explanation is that in the little social status game we're always playing, there is no social status benefit in praising other redditors in general, because it would only raise the commenter's status relative to a group who isn't present in the environment (the website). But there obviously is in disparaging other redditors (so many subreddits are dedicated to it)."
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,relic2279,7,Fri May 8 23:18:35 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this a bit too and have had a few conversations about it.  Two things   1) I think there's good reason to suspect the average Redditor is smarter than the average person  2) this is moderated by the subreddit they frequent.  There's a fair amount of research that looks at things like need for cognition and intelligence and finds relatively high correlations.  Nfc is a measure of whether individuals take pleasure in cognitively elaborating etc.  Given that if one is drawn to things like askscience or even askreddit there's a good chance they are above average in nfc.  On the other hand if one simply frequents advice animals, that effect would he mitigated."
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,Phea1Mike,2,Sat May 9 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"On the other hand if one simply frequents advice animals, that effect would he mitigated.   Actually, not sure about even that. Advice animals is... not necessarily 'smart' jokes, but I laugh sometimes. When I watch Jay Leno I don't laugh period, and I get the jokes -- they're obvious. I mean, other than Seinfeld, who on this list would you classify as 'smart' comedy?"
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,rosecenter,4,Sat May 9 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I meant predominantly.  I will occasionally browse r/all at night and will enjoy the more 'low brow' subreddits but it's not something I do regularly.  We're talking about shades of grey averages, and generalities. Thus, on average those who browse the more cognitively demanding subreddits will typically be higher in nfc and likely higher in intelligence."
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,SomebodyReasonable,4,Sat May 9 05:20:12 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to point out that hypothetically if 9/10 of the subreddits one is subscribed to is 'low brow' and the last one is a fairly populated one with a wide range of topics, then they are likely to spend most of their time on that one, because of the amount of content per thread. For example I'm subscribed to /r/jokes and it takes me ~5s to ""consume"" one post, whereas it might take me 10 minutes to go through a thread like this. So I'd wager lots of the smarter folk are also subbed to more low effort subs, but even one ""smarter"" subreddit is redeeming in this sense if they frequent it."
TheoryOfReddit,35bxkn,shaggorama,2,Sat May 9 08:04:13 2015 UTC,"Even putting the actual posts aside, the comments in those subreddits still tend to be better than most of the posts and comments on my Facebook feed.

I mean: how will you determine a person's intelligence on the basis of a link to Imgur, or an in-joke?

Then when Reddit links to them or they become viral and there's a risk of some degree of negative or just unwanted notoriety they pull them. It actually seems really simple to me, just because something is technically available to the public doesn't mean that it was intended to be that way and it's probably only worth changing when it becomes a problem, like when Reddit links to it."

Great communities, receptive to new or infrequent posters and you get the kind of discussion and response that is hard to categorize in other formats. Some subs are garbage, yeah, but reddit has built up such a HUGE population that you can be here all day and avoid the poison.   Also the format of aggregate content is amazing.

TheoryOfReddit,3590qu,TheNonis,1 point,Sat May 9 22:49:22 2015 UTC,"If you have a restaurant, you are competing against other restaurants in that area.  If you make porn, you are competing against the best porn, because people have that shit saved on their harddrives and have bookmarked URLs of their favorite porn. There is no room for people who are bad at camera angles in porn. A person who doesn't like your restaurant has to physically move to another restaurant. A person who doesn't like your porn just clicks another button.  If you have 300 views, what you see is visible to, probably, your network and a few cliques within that network. You self-select all of these people. If those people think you're funny, you probably hang out with them more. Plus, everyone knows who you are, and they will (probably) try to perceive you in a positive way.  If you have 10,000 views you are decidedly dealing with on-the-internet people who you only kind-of self-selected by subject matter, and no one on the internet knows who you are. Being funny or entertaining or whatever to a large, general audience is way harder than being funny to your circle of friends.  People bomb at comedy clubs because they trust their friends too much. Most people you know probably lie to you, to some degree, and you block this stuff out. A beginner comedian will tell jokes that are funny to their friends, but their friends laugh because they have background information the audience doesn't, or more probably because they're trying to be nice and not realizing that they are instilling a false sense of mastery.  Charisma does not universally transfer over medium, either. People who are charismatic in-person often bomb when they try to be charismatic on the internet, and vice versa. Even Jimmy Fallon has trouble on the internet and his personality made him a millionaire; if you don't believe me, check the dislikes bar on many of his videos.  Few people can juggle written charisma and in-person charisma. It requires an extremely good sense of audience awareness. You can be a good singer, by high school standards, and then audition for American Idol where the judges tell you that you should never sing again.  The internet is like American Idol for everything involving entertainment. You are competing against, essentially, everyone who has ever done the thing you're doing, because people on the internet can get to the best people who have done that thing instantly."

I have a really hard time carrying on a discussion when the person I'm discussing with is seen as better than you because the rest of reddit agrees with them more than you, and it makes them feel more empowered, and you can usually tell in the tone of their comment that they think they're better than you.  You see this some times in /r/subredditdrama, even if the argument for both sides are valid arguments, someone's at +100 and the other's at -50, and when the guy at +100 gives up he can say ""You're just a fucking cum stain"" or something equal to it and still get upvoted because the guy he was arguing with is obviously a retarded hack (/s) for arguing his side which most of reddit doesn't agree with, even if it's a valid position."

TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,lolpancakeslol,2,Mon May 4 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"I especially think voting is bad when combined with the nature of the subreddit system. Most of Reddit in terms of userbase is dominated by potheads, video gamers and other self-obsessed, entertainment obessed people, and most posts are to such subs that cater to that type of person. Reddit went from a techy medium to one dominated by the Twitter/facebook/instagram conformity and vanity crowd all about their lulz. Even niche subs meant to discuss serious subjects thus become dominated by apathy and anti-intellecutalism. Mods would have to work hard to maintain quality discussion because of those structural problems. In practice most mods seem to care more about popularity since it makes them feel like they have some kind of power to be modding a more popular sub, and thus they don't try to facilitate quality discussion."

I can relate to this.    I find that strawmen arguments sound really good to an audience. They have that ""punch factor"" since it's seen like a swift and easy rebuttal (which is probably why politicians love them).   Having to explain that fact makes you sound defensive."
TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,sluggernaut,23,Mon May 11 21:04:02 2015 UTC,"weirdly, reddit's nesting of comments allows for one to easily jump into an exchange between two other people, and start a new exchange off of the original.  My frustration of that when two people are debating and Someone else wants to jump in with some info that would help broaden their discussion, not everyone can see everyone's responses unless they are veining all comments.  There's this expectation that when you jump into a conversation that there are now three people discussing, but instead parallel dialogues form where you dont know what's going on in the parallel conversation.  So after the first few nests, the nesting serves only as a subtle reminder of how long you've been discussing.  Since the space to respond is shrinking, you want to obey and wrap it up, perhaps.  It's much more noticeable on Discus forums where after only 5 or so nests you can't even read eachother's posts because the text goes vertical."
TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,theodorAdorno,11,Fri May 1 13:28:36 2015 UTC,"However, this makes it perfect for two people to have a lengthy debate without the original topic being derailed by a new users coming and talking about something slightly different. The thing that I have the biggest problem with isn't really one that can be solved by any format, as it involves distance between users.  My biggest pet peeve for reddit is when you are having a nice conversation/debate and you have to leave, and when you get back some other user has taken up your mantle and possibly slightly butchered your points."
TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,Griclav,5,Fri May 1 16:34:09 2015 UTC,I think you need to see reddit in a context more like usenet's news groups.

TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,Synes_Godt_Om,1 point,Fri May 1 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"No. Usenet is generally harder to use and rare, so most of the people who use Reddit would never post to usenet. Also usenet doesn't allowing voting, it isn't a popularity contest -- Reddit is."
TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,Nikolasv,1 point,Tue May 5 02:46:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think the facts that usenet is rare or (possibly) hard to use are relevant, my point is that reddit to a large extend is filling the niche that usenet filled. My larger point is that some of reddit's shortcomings could perhaps be improved by learning from usenet. For example the voting works well on a total thread level but in my view often contributes little within a thread. Often it just pushes latecomers to the bottom making it effectively irrelevant to join a thread that already has a substantial number of comments.  Usenet made it easier to have longer individual discussions, still sometimes others would complain, but they could've blocked us if they were sufficiently annoyed.  Features like kill filter had an important effect, which may be better than voting in some scenarios. If you could block based on score below (or abve for that matter) a certain level, or based on other criteria may help improve the experience. Some subs already have that."
TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,Synes_Godt_Om,1 point,Tue May 5 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"It is relevant, because something hard to use culls some of the dumbest possible participants from partaking in that medium and prevents their participation. Voting does not make Reddit better. At a time when a whole generation grew up on attention seeking and conformity via social media, it just gives young people yet another social media like platform to seek popularity and enforce groupthink online. It is unhealthy for society -- but the admins and founders of Reddit don't care about that, they care about increased pageviews and increasing revenues."
TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,Nikolasv,1 point,Tue May 5 15:42:58 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with most of what you say. My point was not to change reddit into usenet and making it hard to use, but that there were certain features of usenet that actually would make reddit easier to use, thus whether usenet was/is easier to use or not is not really relevant to this discussion, what would be relevant would be to discuss what we could learn from usenet (if, as I'm suggesting, we could learn something).  In particular the ability to have a clear overview of all comments in a thread, by headers, marking them read/unread are things we could take from usenet.  I also agree that this may not be what the owners want. It seems that owners of just about any social site thinks lack of overview from their users is how to increase retention. It's a well proven concept in all kinds of commercial subscriptions and most of those sites are effectively subscription based. Come to think of it, that's the term used for subscribing to a  usenet group as well."

TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,LuckMaker,2,Sat May 2 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"Voting is the bigger problem that discourages good exchange. It encourages lying(subs like /r/tifu and /r/askreddit are full mostly of lies), exaggeration and pressure molds most people to not air opinions that they think will lead to downvotes in a given sub, and especially in a given thread in a given sub."
TheoryOfReddit,34ig29,Nikolasv,2,Tue May 5 02:41:26 2015 UTC,"The ""load more comments"" link tends to act as a barrier, beyond which people are typically free to repeatedly downvote a user.  The usual do-gooders who might pass by and feel that someone an otherwise good exchange doesn't deserve the treatment are less likely to see the comments further down beyond that link.

By the top moderators, I mean the first moderators that are found going from the most popular subreddit down. I just checked this past run and it went through (scraped) 4,615 subreddits before finding 20k moderators. So, if you don't moderate any subreddits in the top 4,615 (this number changes of course), then you won't be tracked. Also, all subreddits (all public & non-nsfw) are being tracked because you can get 100 per request. I'd really like to track more moderators, but that 2 second limit makes it difficult. I think I can do more; recently, for a whole round (checking subreddits & moderators), it's been taking a little over 22 hours, so I have about 2 extra hours I could possibly use to track a few more moderators.    If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Thanks!"

TheoryOfReddit,34jnlm,Greypo,1 point,Tue May 5 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what you mean. OP.gg looks really cool; I hadn't heard of it until now. The process that 0bservat0ry goes through is a bit lengthy. First, it goes through the list of subreddits for here, 100 at a time. That gives the subscriber count for each subreddit so that's why 0bservat0ry can keep up with 500k+ subreddits, but not moderator lists (if that page would give moderator lists for each of the 100 subreddits at each request, then that'd be golden and I could keep up with more moderators). After it updates all the subreddits, it moves onto discovering/finding moderators. It does this by going through the list of subreddits (starting at the top, /r/funny) making a request for that subreddit's moderators (essentially getting its page, so it can do that once every 2 seconds). This (listing mods) is not necessarily needed after the first time, but new mods rise up and they must be found. After it has made a list of 20,000 moderators (usually after going through around 4k subreddits), it starts going through that list of moderators and essentially requesting each of their pages to get their list of subreddits moderated, karma, and posts/comments. So for every moderator, that's one request which is 2 seconds so 40k seconds minimum. In order to track/record a moderator, at the very least he/she must be seen in a list of moderators on a subreddit. But since the list of moderators is only gathered for the first 4k or so, there are a lot of moderators that are not found. So while all subreddits can be tracked and their subscriber count logged, their moderators cannot be tracked because that would take an individual request for that subreddit (as opposed to getting the subscriber count in batches of a 100 by requesting http://www.reddit.com/subreddits) and individual requests for each moderator. Sorry for some repeat information. I hope this answers your question."

I think that sub has some interesting stuff most of the time but a lot of it is reposted or just posted because they know it's easy karma This scene from this movie that everyone loves always give me chills! A lot of the stuff there can be interesting if you separate the wheat from the chaff but someone's gotta do it.  I do use upvotes generously when something is newsworthy, worth watching/reading, or an original (or rarely posted) question. I also use downvotes on posts that are extremely low effort and karma-whoring, racist, containing spoilers for a new movie in the title, or untrue. I'm active in the comments, especially when the post is great, and I'm happy when I see OC reach the front page.  I also love to see something reach the front page when it was created by a reddit user. I hate when people automatically downvote because the title mentions ""I made this!"" If you post a video/website I'll click the link. Even if it's at negative karma. If I think it doesn't add anything to the sub, I'll downvote just like I would with any other post. If I like it, I'll upvote you, subscribe to your shit, and probably shoot you a PM that says what I liked about it and what could be improved. Where else are people supposed to promote something other than the website where they spend 80% of their time on the internet?  I guess the idea is that if something you think is stupid gets downvoted every time someone posts it, it won't become a trend.

The toxic posts or the ones that don't meet the criteria and therefore actively dilute the pool should be downvoted, and they would then have a scarlet number to separate them from the pack (which is the goal of a vote-point-based system). But the posts that simply don't amuse you (but otherwise meet the criteria) would be ignored and just sift to the lower part of the stack (without punishing someone because their submission didn't meet your tastes, which are subjective in the first place). But someone who posted a drawing that was liked by an aggregate of at least 13 people is hardly going to make it past the lower stacks anyway, so why further banish them and their karma when their might be an audience who does enjoy it?  I definitely appreciate the insight though. I'm tempted to delve further into the realm of ""famous"" users (or even ""reddit famous"" users), but I'll save it for my tinfoil-hate-Tuesday-tang and tacos-meeting."

The annoying and toxic get thrown together, because I'd like to see them both gone. It usually works, except when Redditors have an immature and ignorant opinion. ;-) Overall, I hope I upvote more than I downvote. As for finding the content, I think you need to find a subreddit that thinks the way you do. Things are mostly buried from a lack of upvotes anyway. I downvote in hopes of making the process faster."

I've seen (and on my most recent self post been a victim of) drive by down votes for fairly innocent questions or posts. Especially when posts are fresh this crushes visibility.   In my case, I got a couple helpful responses, but nowhere near the subreddit average for those types of questions.   I may still be bitter, because I actually needed help with that home brew, and don't feel like I got the volume of response I should have, but  silent downvote trawling happens."
TheoryOfReddit,343mld,HarryPotter5777,10,Tue Apr 28 06:22:41 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, an upvote means ""I want to see more of this"" and a downvote means ""I want to see less of this."" I don't see upvoting something I like as doing the submitter a favor and I don't see downvoting as doing them a disservice. In fact, I don't think about the submitter at all. Posts that break the rules should be removed by the mods; that's not my problem. I don't care if other people like a post that I dislike. If enough people like a post, their upvotes will exceed my downvote. I don't see the logic in not downvoting content that you specifically dislike, because people are going to upvote content they specifically like. In this way, subreddits become tailored to the people who frequent them, and your single vote pushes the tide ever so slightly in your direction.  That being said, I rarely do any of that in practice. In fact, I rarely vote at all. If I like a post more than I usually do, I'll upvote it, but that's a pretty rare occurrence, and I usually only downvote posts that I think are really bad, meaning they're reposts, unoriginal, whoring for karma, or just plain stupid."
TheoryOfReddit,343mld,Mattyoungbull,6,Tue Apr 28 06:52:31 2015 UTC,"This isn't the case, though; people are far more willing to upvote than to downvote. The average comment isn't downvoted, especially if one weeds out the trolls. Just look at the karma of nearly every user - it's positive. That means there's a net effect of more upvotes than downvotes.  If people downvoted ""without a second thought"" but were as frugal with upvotes as you suggest, few people would ever have positive karma.  However, there are different levels of upvoting and downvoting, and this is massively important. If this were not the case, the entirety of reddit's voting system would collapse because there would be a very fine line between what got upvoted between 90% and 10%, so the front page would essentially be a random selection of the quality that the average redditor deems upvote-worthy. By having a wide range of criteria, there's a continuous scale of post quality."
TheoryOfReddit,343mld,Raichu4u,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:09:45 2015 UTC,"Regarding positive/negative karma: I'm pretty sure that negative karma (as far as it impacts a users overall 'score') is capped. I think the number is at 200 or 400 (I can't recall a specific source for this, but I recall seeing it on a thread discussing u/unidanx which wa s questioning how the account could possibly be in the positive when all of his comments were downvoted to oblivion). So, if my comment receives 500 upvotes and and 1000 downvotes, it will show up on the thread as something like -500, however because only the first 200 downvotes impact my user score, my profile would actually be +300."

It was really weird, since he had this idea of downvoting things he specifically didn't like, as relevant as the content was to the subreddit, and much as these posts didn't break the rules.  As far as I've ever considered, upvotes should be for something that you REALLY like, and you should only downvote rulebreaking, offensive, or irrelevant posts.

People seem are willing to discuss in depth, without resorting to petty arguments. Other than that, I find that small communities are the best, usually with fewer than 10,000 subscribers. Such subreddits are much less likely to have internal conflicts, simply because of the lower volume of posts and comments.  If you're still searching yourself, I'd suggest finding something that is relevant to your interests, while still being a bit niche. For example; band subreddits. I'm subscribed to a few, and the general mood always seems to stay positive. Probably because everyone loves the music, so there's not much to argue about.

I think it's mainly males, who see any denial of any type of sexuality as a threat. It's the same mentality that fuels redpillers. The commenter then tossed ""dick pics"" into it. Any discussion of dick pics usually turns into a red pill debate. Dick pic hatred is their canary in the coal mine and is a signal for the troops march in and save male sexuality.

TheoryOfReddit,33tcim,Nikolasv,4,Sat Apr 25 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"That is not a good example given by 250Lespaul as he is misrepresenting what that person stated. A better example of the negative environment of anonymous hordes as expressed by Reddit voting, are from this thread, where comments making stupid jokes were the most upvoted: A dozen Native American actors walked off the set of Adam Sandler's latest film due to offensive stereotypes    For context and if you are unread and uninformed not only were the Native Americans largely wiped out in most their ancestral territories, but a pseudo-science called phrenology was once very popular in imperialist Europe and its white settler colonies like the USA. According to phrenology there was a racial hierarchy of peoples that could be established by the structure and bumps of skulls. So not only did white Americans destroy the Native American way of life, and most the Native American population but for many decades many well to do, educated whites went on scientific expeditions and endeavors to dig up the deceased and vanquished to prove that the wiped out were racially inferior! It doesn't get much more fucked up than that.    Not to mention that movie is just another in a long line of denigrating popular portrayals of Native Americans, think of all the 50's, 60's and earlier Westerns. But for Reddit apparently as expressed by popular vote the offended Indians who have every reason to be grievously offended given their history, are just an opportunity for lulz and to crack jokes:    Many members who regarded the protests as a joke participated not out of feelings of injustice, but because they recognized the Church of Scientology as the perfect source of lulz: humour derived from ""disrupting another's emotional equilibrium,"" or ""a quasi-thermodynamic exchange between the sensitive and the cruel,"" as Mattathias Schwartz puts it. [10] Internet trolls, like those associated with Anonymous, are motivated by the pursuit of lulz, sometimes to the exclusion of everything else. [11] The Scientology protests appealed to them because the Church took their actions seriously and because the media covered the protests, intensifying the drama of the situation. [12]"

What happens often is that people ad-hoc adapt to the internal circlejerk of a given sub, and more specifically a specific vote trend on a specific thread. Often they don't even read the article that the thread is meant to discuss and the top rated comments are mostly jokes or other superficial content that doesn't even have to do with what was meant to be discussed.   As bad as I think the public in general is, especially when giving a mob medium like Reddit, I don't think upvotes and downvotes are really indicative of general views on pedophilia, but more indicative of ad-hoc conformity in this case. Which is perhaps even worse. I would almost respect more the views of a person who actually defends pedophilia, than one who only temporarily does so to conform to an ad-hoc internet mob. But as to the actual person, I would always respect less the pro-pedophile, but I just hate the views of conforming phonies."

You're broadcasting peoples faces and potentially destroying lives before they've even had a trial. Paedophile or not, people have a right to equal treatment under the law and for their judgement to be handed down by a court, not by public opinion. Sentencing someone to community service or jail time doesn't work if an episode has aired showing their name and face and destroying their lives. It operates outside of the justice system, and it's fundamentally unethical. Have you considered blurring faces or otherwise obscuring the identities of those involved in the show? ...   That guy is 100% correct if that is what happens in that show. Even if you are acquitted by solid DNA evidence and eye witnesses in court, you are still de-facto a pedophile for the purposes of public opinion if you appear on that show without a blackface, your name with-held and your voice scrambled. You would likely be fired from your job, you will be forced into low-wage work forever thanks to Google searches of your name, many/all of your friends and family will turn on or abandon you, etc., even after an acquittal just because of ratings.

I don't think national television is actually putting a dent on serious issues like pedophilia by trying to pre-shame a few possible, likely pedophiles or actual pedophiles before trial. I think like Intervention too it is really meant to make viewers feel good and entertained.   Watching television destroys the type of social community that is the best defense against such acts as pedophilia and drug addiction. When I was young in the mid 1980's and around five years old I visited my dad's village outside of Patras, Greece and I loved it there because unlike America even at that young age, I was allowed unrestricted unsupervised movement and freedom. That was because unlike New York of that time, in Greek villages there was still a sense of community, meaning that even as a foreign born Greek-American, I was still in a sense also a child of the village, and my family could count on every village adult to watch over me.

Also the followup likely didn't rate as entertaining or good for drawing viewers in controlled trials, if it did it would probably already be incorporated into the show.   People are less connected than ever, this is from ""Ascent of Humanity"" by Charles Eisenstein.:     http://www.ascentofhumanity.com/chapter5-8.php The rule of law has become a necessity as other forms of social coordination have broken down with the dissolution of community. In olden times, informal social pressures were far more potent than they are today because people depended on their neighbors to meet economic and social needs. The goodwill of the community was extremely important and the consequences of social shunning severe. Today in America there are few real communities to speak of, only neighborhoods, and the opinion of the neighbors matters little. As long as I obey all the laws, who cares what the neighbors think? I am safe from anything they might do. I don't need to buy things from them, I don't need them to watch out for my children, I don't use the things they make, I don't depend on them for recreation. The conversion of social capital into money means that just as with all the rest of life's necessities, we rely on remote strangers for dispute resolution. The local and personal has been replaced by the formal and remote.  http://www.ascentofhumanity.com/chapter5-7.php Here are two ways in which control has made suburbia more dangerous for children. First, by moving life into the privacy of indoors, our neighbors have become strangers and we no longer feel at ease knowing that ""someone will look out for them."" Of course, the anonymity of the contemporary suburb owes itself also to nationwide patterns of mobility, which obliterate the cohesiveness of communities, and to television, which replaces local stories about so-and-so's granddad and the neighbor's uncle down the street with stories beamed in from remote locations about people and events that have nothing to do with the community. Whereas in the past we talked about people we knew, today we talk about characters from TV shows and professional sports teams. Television, originally trumpeted as a means to open us up to a wider world, has had the perverse effect of cutting us off from the people around us. Television is an indoor activity, inherently private and isolating. And when there are no other kids playing outside, and the town is full of strangers, what else is there to do?"

If you don't think this is true head on over to /r/metanarchism the internal policing subreddit of /r/anarchism. It is rife with requests to ban posters even based on posts to unrelated subreddits. Here is a good exposition from years ago about what type of nonsense that sub is about: http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/143dph/massive_mod_changes_happening_in_ranarchism_the/c79j9vm  I notice that alot of people even in this thread are saying that in their experience what the original poster is writing about is not happening. The best rebuttal is what Michael Parenti said about censorship in the American media(the exact quote of which I cannot easily find, this is just paraphrasing). Parenti said that many American journalists say they haven't experienced censorship and it is true, but that is only because they are the type of people who won't ever write what could be censored. Journalists in major media that reach millions like the New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, etc., are very professionalized, highly selected strata, you are just not some random person with random views. They will know what you produce, your views and values before they hire you. Generally people who are against the established order in a totally radical way, who would be the biggest candidates for censorship, actually won't be hired. That is how it works, national newspapers, television, radio, etc., are gatekeepers of access to public discourse and they simply prevent problematic people to the elite's social order from having that access rather than allowing anyone access and then resorting to post facto censorship. The same applies to Reddit, if you don't have views that are controversial or anti-establishment, you won't experience what the OP is talking about."

I'll answer your third question a little bit, but I don't know really much about all of the subreddits.    General Subreddits  Most of these are defaults and attract a lot of views. These often have little moderation and mostly are anything-goes subreddits. These have the most subscribers per moderators usually and I would say that there is no definitive culture to these subreddits.  Opinions stated in one thread that could get you massively downvoted in one thread, theoretically in another thread could get you gilded and upvoted into the thousands.  Images  While a lot of /r/all comes from this nowadays, it really depends on the subreddit itself. A lot of the subreddit's culture is dictated by moderation.  Education  Excluding maybe ELI5 and TIL, these subreddits usually have a lot more strict moderation than other subreddits. The content quality is therefore, I believe a lot higher because threads don't get derailed by off-topic gifs or comments.  These subreddits also seem to have a lot lower subscriber-to-moderator ratio than the other default subreddits.  Location  Some note that the location based subreddits have a more toxic culture than others. I don't know much about this.  Support and Advice  These can be good, and these can be not-as-good.  SuicideWatch and Depression are an interesting case. I can't fully articulate it, but...yeah, it's a good thing.  /r/relationships is always stereotyped (I'm unsure at the validity of it) as the ""break up, hit the gym, lawyer up"" subreddit.  The /r/*advice network of subreddits seems to attract a lot of people who need help.  Meta  I would say that most meta subreddits have usually a negative perspective of things (excluding, in many cases /r/bestof).  For examples, SRS is mostly of the opinion that all of the rest of reddit sucks, SRD looks at people arguing at each other, SRC thinks that reddit is being overrun by SJWs, and half the time if there is a meta-subreddit for it, there is a meta-subreddit mocking it, and possibly a meta subreddit mocking that one (see MetaRedditCancer for SubredditCancer, SRSsucks for ShitRedditSays, AgainstMensRights for MensRights, AMRsucks for AgainstMensRights, and the list goes on).  /r/circlejerk is a strange meta subreddit, being that while it mocks redditors, most of them that post there don't care and enjoy it."

You're basically trying to play join-the-dots with static here.  Subreddits aren't just about lifestyles or interests or hobbies - they're about literally anything that people can use to bond with others over or identify with, and that's such a broad and uncategorisable range of concepts that it's probably meaning less to even try to create an organisational schema for.  If you can come up with a categorisation scheme that encompasses the entire breadth and depth of the human condition then you might have a chance... but short of that you're just drawing random lines on a map and claiming the divisions mean... well... anything.

The posts about other genocides are debating that fact... Seems pretty straightforward to me.  There are also a lot of people that recognize that all of the talk about the Armenian genocide lately has nothing to do with the atrocities committed and everything to do with modern political posturing. Turkey is a nato member and strategic ally to the U.S. so it isn't worth it to us to call the genocide what it is, Russia uses the opportunity to paint the U.S. as deniers of genocide and hypocritical etc.  I think this is also another reason people are pointing out other genocides that haven't been formally recognized.

You say it has been in the media the last few days, I can tell you that hasnt really been the case here (Denmark) - not to any great extend at least.  Reddit normally doesn't shy away from niche subjects are make big claims without knowing much about a given issue, but knowledge on this might be so thin, most people would rather talk of something else.

Answer: overshadowed by both WW's, Armenia became part of the USSR and hence had no freedom of press to release any information about it (I don't know the USSR's view on it), and Turkey's constant denial.  So your first point carries a lot of weight.  But one thing still stands, why didn't the many Armenian expats bring this up and what were historians doing for the last 100 years? Was it so overshadowed that they really had to dig through both WW to find something like that?"

It keeps being presented as an isolated incident - oh those poor armenians!  They are the ONLY ones who are overlooked!  Then I kept learning about other atrocities committed which completely overshadow that one.  I'm not Armenian, I don't really care about this unless it has broader implications, and from my perspective it doesn't have broader implications.  The nation of Turkey isn't denying the deaths occurred, they just aren't recognizing it by the term the Armenians want.  It's not holocaust denial, yet from the titles and posts on reddit you'd think it was.  I hate liars.  If it's posted a few times with a biased spin, fine, whatever.

TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,CanadianMEDIC_,91,Thu Apr 23 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to test this hypothesis, but I'd speculate that this phenomenon has three root causes which are interrelated:   Depression is a thing which happens to young white men. (Not exclusively, or predominantly, but it is a condition known to affect the constituency which makes up the bulk of Reddit's population.) Depression is a thing which happens to cool people, especially to cool edgy lone wolves who live on their own and do their own thing and are timelessly cool and aren't governed by the rules of YOUR SOCIETY etc. This is an archetype with which Reddit is madly in love. (Don Draper [yes, fictional characters count], JD Salinger, Ernest Hemingway, Hunter S. Thompson, Jimi Hendrix, etc. etc.) Depression is a very common thing. If any given Redditor themselves has never been clinically depressed, odds are good that someone close to them has been.   In other words, depression is common enough that people see it as a problem, hip enough that they don't feel ashamed to talk about it, and something which affects redditors as a constituency.  Reddit rarely talks about problems people find embarassing (What never comes up in those ""what's the one most ignored problem"" threads? Erectile dysfunction, menstruation, loose bowels...), and only rarely talks about problems that don't affect redditors directly or of which redditors do not commonly have firsthand experience. (We spend a lot more time talking about depression among middle-class white people than we do talking about childhood poverty, don't we.)"
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,adminbeast,11,Wed Apr 22 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"Surely part of it is that depression magnifies ones' sense of ones' own problems and makes one feel as though other people don't understand them.

TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,alien122,11,Thu Apr 23 21:39:02 2015 UTC,"Jesus christ, this felt like a /r/circlebroke post. Absolutely horrid and so are the comments IMO.    I was actually clinically diagnosed with depression and have posted to many related forums over the years. It is not inherently real, there is no brain chemical defect or imbalance you can point out to with an objective test that shows it exists. However, from my experience of posting to many related forums, those who consume mental health services tend to firmly identify around their diagnosis. I have been frequently attacked on such forums for voicing clearly the dangers of surrogate internet socialization and pointing out that online friends are not real friends like those who you actually meet with daily, they cannot really help you in life and even if they could they probably wouldn't by a much higher percentage. Defacto not being physically present, precludes most social and emotional support that people need in times of crisis and investing too much time forming internet friends, leads you to have less or no real life support. Often people diagnosed with mental disorders tend to be more into surrogate socializing so they tend to have undue influence compared to their population size in many online venues, and I would expect this to be the case on Reddit also. For example if you are super invested in certain obscure IRC channels, you can much more easily through those online networks come to be successful at the Reddit game of controlling and moderating subreddits. I have seen mods who control 100+ subreddits. Who that is satisfied with their life and in a mature headspace would try to collect so much inconsequential internet power? What you are observing is part of the hidden power dynamic and sociology of Reddit. Kleptomaniacs and those with other disorders you mentioned express their problems more through real life stealing, not investing highly in surrogate internet only socializing, anorexics tend to express their disorder through binging on the toilet, not maintaining online social networks to a greater degree than their peers. In my experience of posting to webforums of various stripes since the late 1990's surrogate socializing creates toxic web communities. Reddit seems to have alot of bad surrogate internet socializing going on. To give one example, some offended neckbeard troll actually created a /u/Nikolasv_Bot just to follow me around. That is how much time and effort some people put into Reddit that they would create yet another account(as that is probably not even their second account I would wager) just to follow my posts. Such behavior is common on Reddit, I see all the time discussions or posts prefaced with ""this is a throwaway account."" People with unhealthy life attitudes are so invested in the game of karma they play such games and waste inordinate time and mental anguish over this fake online currency not worth anything. That is how how much people in our society are affected by peer pressure. I am sort of the opposite, if I fit in with the mainstream value systems and popular cliches as they exists now which were anyway created by corporations and governments to support elite interests, I would have to question my ethics, intelligence, gullibility, etc. The people with the most unhealthy mentalities and the least social power, are the people more apt to play such manipulative games with the karma system by leveraging multiple accounts, participating in ultra-niche IRC channels that will form the social networks to increase their imaginary Reddit social power, etc. The son of any billionaire would laugh if they meet a super Reddit neckbeard bragging about how they controlled 200 subs and had 100,000 link karma, since that person has real life social power as expressed in the most dominantly accepted currency, money. But for people who identify around the disorders you described, such useless online games have distorted social meaning since they are more apt to socialize online than in real life.   This guy is complaining about Reddit to seriously. His irony impairment doesn't allow him to see that he probably takes Reddit a little to seriously as well."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,rosecenter,3,Thu Apr 23 18:11:52 2015 UTC,There's nothing comical about depressions.
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,worldcitizencane,2,Thu Apr 23 21:03:16 2015 UTC,"Because Reddit has a very large, young male audience, many of whom are socially inept which they believe causes their depression, and/or self diagnose themselves as depressed. Real depression really sucks, but it's one of those things (like ADD) that people love to say they have even if they've never been to a doctor.   This is a whole 'nother topic, but the amount of redditors who complain about their lack of social interaction / how girls never give them a chance / only like assholes, while simultaneously hiding from the world on their computer all day, is absolutely astounding. It's not exactly this simple, but just putting forth the effort to be in more social settings can largely remedy this issue, or at least build upon their lack of social ability. If you never practice talking to other people / the opposite gender, you're always going to be socially awkward or miserable to be around because that's all you know how to project.   It's less likely you will hear something like heroin addiction than depression because of Reddit's userbase."

TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,Nikolasv,27,Thu Apr 23 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"You really like to be judgemental, dont you? I agree that depression and its causes are often symplified, but you ignore the importance of simplifications for people.    If people like to think of their depression as a chemical imbalance, let them do so! It can alleviate the self blaiming many people have, so it is a good thing.  Karma may not be real social acceptance, but then the same is true for any kind of social prestige. There is no inherent difference between people thinking you are cool offline or online.   Having internet friends may not work for you, but there might be several reasons why it works for other people. Sure, in 99% percent of cases, no anonymous internet friend will lend you money or let you sleep on his couch, however, they are able to give emotional support that ""real"" friends often are not ready to provide.    In total, I think you should get of your high horse. I hate that deriding attitude towards the internet. What gives you the right to determine what real social life is and what not? Online communities can be very helpful to people, and nothing is wrong with them. Period."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,CapitalistMarxist,-11,Fri May 1 08:24:22 2015 UTC,"There are two types of people 1) everyone who judges everyone and 2) those dishonest people who pretend they don't judge others. Of course I judge people just like everyone else. You would think anyone an asshole who didn't judge a multiple time convicted rapist, murderer or child molester, and interacted with them knowingly anyway because they loved the same obscure video game. In this society when you don't promote negative values that corporations or the government already promote anyway you are castigated. No one says get off your high horse to people who turn their nose at people for their lesser material attainment, no one says it to sneakerheads who snicker at the non-fresh sneakers people wear or the gearheads scoffing at slow cars. Also in popular male discourse if you don't grossly objectify women often you will be judged as gay. No one tells them off in a manner similar to get off your high horse.  Even real life friends tend to suck in our time. If I wanted to be pedantic I could capture an image of my cellphone where one of my friends texted me in the middle of the night for $10. And if you knew the guy you would know it would go straight up his nose.  Charles Eisenstein gives a good analysis of the pointless of friendship based on shared consumption of entertainment here: http://www.ascentofhumanity.com/chapter4-2.php Internet friends suck even more since it is a much shallower bond and you cannot actually spend physical time together with them, so in effect you are still just as lonely for all the time invested.   Also chemical imbalance theory is exactly victim blaming as it removes from the domain an analysis of the social system and society that creates so many allegedly chemically imbalanced people. A Marxist psycho-therapist from the UK, David Smail, delves into that here: http://www.davidsmail.info/pubintro.htm His whole analysis is that the entire field of mental health reduces problems to unique defects in the interiority of lone individuals, ignoring the much more larger distal social forces exerted exerted by corporations, the government, schooling, etc. operating on individuals that have much more impact than one's personal power and decision making."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,Nikolasv,9,Thu Apr 23 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"1) Just because other people do it, does not make it alright to do it yourself. 2) From what I can tell, your examples are wrong. I dont have proof, but a redditor that would make fun of somebody poorer than him would get downvoted into oblivion. I am afraid the opposite is true, rich people are often judged negatively, which is just as bad of course.   If you truly have a problem with the examples you listed, then I would suggest you dont engage in it yourself.   Unfortunately, you did not adress the point I was trying to make, that online communities are not inherently useless. I would be genuinely interested in your reply."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,CapitalistMarxist,-7,Wed Apr 22 22:27:15 2015 UTC,"The only thing online communities can offer is quality discussion -- they cannot offer meaningful friendship. The surrogate socializers trying to make online friends sabotage that by ruining discussion quality since their goal is to make friends not intelligently discuss, and by creating a toxic environment full of hidden cliques where serious discussion is less welcome.   And you totally read over my critique of the hypocrisy of pretending to be non-judgmental. A real non-judgmental person would disgust you and society at large, it would result in a hypothetical person totally devoid of all morals and ethics. The discourse and analysis to use for judgment that matters is adapt down or adapt up. Is a judgment demanding people be better people? Adapt up judgment, that gets accusations of horses high. Is a judgment adapt down, like advocating to consume more, be more selfish, be self-centered? Funny enough there are much fewer negative backlashes against such judgments since a massive amount of corporate propaganda called advertising and the entertainment industry advocate that is exactly the person you should be."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,Nikolasv,3,Thu Apr 23 08:24:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I did not adress that point. Here is my take on it. 1) In general, I would discourage judgement of practices and people that do not hurt anybody else. For example, while I find twitter as a medium to be pretty boring, I try not to make generalizing sweep statements about the intelligence and character of the people who do like twitter.  2) In fact, I would advocate not judging anybody, and yes, that includes rapists, thiefs, and criminals. I symphasize with buddhist philosophy, and that just teaches to emphasize with people (might be wrong about the buddhist philosophy here, lol). But that is really off topic.  You just reiterated your opinion, without really backing it up.  Why can online communities not offer friendships? Why can't they offer emotional support? When I was sick from Hyperthyroidism, online communities with people who also had that disease helped a lot, because they made me feel less alone. What is wrong with that?   There are countless recommendations to consume and spend less on the internet and offline, although adds that implicitly tell us to spend more exist also. But in my opinion their efficacy is rather limited."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,CapitalistMarxist,-8,Thu Apr 23 08:38:13 2015 UTC,"It does hurt everyone else. If a given society produces a group so self absorbed that they whine about 140+ character posts that they are not used to on twitter or via text message, everyone suffers. Even on this very discussion I received that treatment: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/33iqd1/on_the_topic_of_mental_illness_has_anybody_else/cqlp8hm  Infact most of the times I get into Reddit disagreements it is due to this cultural clash since my adult personality was shaped before those mediums and I never use twitter. If I see a criticism of one of my posts, and it is under the twitter limit and I click their post history and almost every time entire first page is under or almost under that limit. Further they post mostly to self absorbed, entertainment only subs but also occasionally want to have an opinion on a more serious subjects but are not interested in informing themselves to have a constructive view. So what you get is an unhelpful repeats of popular cliches, everyone also knows like in this case ""don't judge"" when in actuality everyone judges and truly being non-judgmental would result in monstrous views. Further most of those types just hit and run, they are not interested in engaging anyway. I am not saying this exactly describes you, you can actually write paragraphs and engage, but still there is no non-judgment in actual reality and it wouldn't result in any good if it did."

On no other popular online venue have so many people remarked about throwaway accounts publicly(and obviously they are not gonna publicly discuss troll and other accounts).   This is a karma motivated issue most likely, and not doxxing motivated. People freely offer more information on themselves over the internet and to corporations for discounts(memberships to most major retailers that allow them to more perfectly datamine your consumer habits) than any totalitarian government or corporation could dream of obtaining. For example I don't have a Facebook account for that very reason, to avoid vapidness, too much personal info and to not get in real life fights based on Facebook happenings."

TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,GeneralFapper,2,Thu Apr 23 08:27:10 2015 UTC,"On few other online venues is it so absurdly easy to create disposable accounts.

On no other popular online venue have so many people remarked about throwaway accounts publicly(and obviously they are not gonna publicly discuss troll and other accounts).   Does it matter that people make frequent remarks about throwaway accounts? As I discussed above, they're probably only mentioned a lot on reddit because they're not uncommon here and are rather rare elsewhere.  As far as trolls and other accounts, who the heck is ""they"" and why don't you think they'll discuss troll and other accounts? Troll accounts get discussed all the time on reddit. So do throwaways used for ban evasion and other stuff. I don't know where you're subscribed to that troll accounts don't get discussed, or where their discussion is even remotely taboo."

The frequent use of second, third or more accounts by Redditors matters alot. Like I said there are lots of people who have no or little real life social life. A voting system and a ridiculous amount of time on your hands and mutliple accounts gives too much power to people with unhealthy mentalities making the site even more toxic. A quick search and I found these downvote bots: https://redditbot.codeplex.com/ http://www.sadiqk.com/reddit-upvotedownvote-bot/  You don't even need programming skills to cause such mischief and abuse.

I have observed the negative dynamics of internet surrogate socialization before I even touched Reddit as a registered user, the voting system and the various fiefdoms of moderated tyrannies just make it worse.   You have to wonder what the point of a given alleged discussion venue is, when the most common complaint of one of its largest demographics is you aren't writing under the Twitter limit and that you are actually thinking more independently(and they are against that)."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,Nikolasv,6,Thu Apr 23 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"Actually, I wasn't complaining about the length of your post, rather about its hypocrisy, sigh. I don't mind reading or writing long posts from time to time, though I don't take kindly to being told that I don't belong on a subreddit, and then attacked with a list of stereotypes, which you seem to have deduced solely from my average comment length..."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,wtNiles,-1,Thu Apr 23 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"No, you didn't even read my post or understand it. I was highlighting the toxic environment that people seeking to make online friends cause on online discussion forums by collecting moderatorship of too many subs and creating hidden cliques that most people don't want to deal with. For example, here is a guy that mods 188 subs and has 1.2+ million karma. Not everyone is that successful in helping ruining Reddit with IRC based surrogate socialization and probably manipulation with scripts, but it is a good example of what is possible.   If something is widely participated in by society, it deserves serious analysis. Lame anti-intellectualism is too cliche these days, especially amongst a certain age demographic."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,Nikolasv,5,Thu Apr 23 04:46:28 2015 UTC,"Syllables are not thought.   Length is not an immediate qualifier or disqualifier of quality.   I say this as someone that makes low effort posts all the time; it's easy to make a long low effort post stringing together a lot of long words without actually meaning anything, but it's also possible to do the inverse."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,supergauntlet,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:20:25 2015 UTC,"Heh. Yeah, they have a award named after me on one of the derisory subs having to do with people being hard to understand or something, perhaps intellectually pretentious or something. People are incredibly anti-intellectual. To be fair, a lot of intellectualism is really not so great, IMO. Things can be long winded and wordy without really covering much ground. I think what I do covers a lot of ground and is quite necessary. The really telling thing is that all these detractor people invariably do not engage what I say substantively.   When I see a user with nothing but short comments on their userpage, I hightail outta there."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,ravia,5,Thu Apr 23 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're completely wrong in your analysis of online friendships. I have a group of college friends that are spread around the country and for the most part my only interaction with them is over the internet. I know at least 3 of them would let me stay in their home or offer any kind of support for any reason if I needed it. Okay, fine, I met them in real life first so maybe that disqualifies them. I have met at least 2 people online that I have never met physically that I would do whatever I could to help them out, I have shared accounts with them and I talk to them on a regular basis. They would also do the same for me.  Even though I have real life friends, I don't think any differently of my online friends. They are still people that I have communicated with extensively and they are real people, even if I'm not interacting with their physical form."

TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,blacksheep101,4,Thu Apr 23 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"While I make no comment about the amount of empathy that should be shown for each of those issues, I can't accept that anyone could reasonably claim you should have more or equal sympathy for the obese compared to those with depression."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,Cruxius,2,Thu Apr 23 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I'm not entirely sure I agree with op's argument, but I definitely see where he's coming from. Obesity is correlated with depression. They're a viscous cycle together: you get depressed when you realize you are very overweight, which in turn cripples your self esteem and motivation for improvement, leading to a nasty catch-22. Also the social stigma attached to being fat is at least as bad as that attached to depression. The difference is that the depression taboo is slowly eroding, while the stigma attached to obesity is, if anything, growing stronger.   Op's anecdotal evidence of those who have always been fat also brings up a good point: what if you are raised fat? I know plenty of children who are raised on a diet of pure trash, and they have no control over that. Think also about the fact that obesity is strongly tied to poverty, so that is also an angle.   Before you start to bring up any sort of fat acceptance movement as a counter-argument, I will assert that those represent an extremely minute section of the population, and have almost no sway even among most obese people. If you are willing to use these movements to discredit the genuine problems of obese problems, then you should be willing to accept the number of people who refuse treatment of their depression as representative of the general depression populace.   Anyways, like I said, I'm not necessarily agreeing with OP, but I like to play devil's advocate, and I feel like that's something that reddit needs sometimes."
TheoryOfReddit,33iqd1,morpen,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:48:25 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that the increasing stigma against obesity is a good thing, the same as for smoking.    You raise a fair point about the overlap of obesity and depression, but I think it's fair to say that in those cases the focus should be on treating the depression and associated mental issues first. It's also important to keep in mind that for the 90ish percent of people with depression for whom the 'cure' is in the form of lifestyle changes rather than drugs (I'm recognising that for the rest the drugs supplement lifestyle changes, not replace them) the treatment for both depression and obesity are one and the same. Realising you're fat is depressing, but it doesn't make you depressed, though obesity itself and what you have to do to your body can definitely be a significant factor in becoming depressed.    Full disclosure: I've been diagnosed with mild depression and my dad is moderately depressed (he's on a low dosage of antidepressants), so I have a decent understanding of what depression is like and how to deal with it."

DEPRESSION GOES ALONG with every disease or disorder you mentioned. I can't think of one case where someone was just depressed. There's an underlying issue... I believe you have not seen the forest for the trees. Be open minded and don't encourage the stigma.   Edit-my passion for this subject left out a period. Who even cares?"

TheoryOfReddit,33kffw,midgaze,2,Thu Apr 23 09:04:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late comment, but that seems like it puts unfair advantage on the first comments - older comments see more votes. This is why ""top"" is no longer the default sort. In fact, think of bad comments like spam, gore, etc. If I was someone who wanted to post that, all I would have to do is stick on the new queue, waiting for posts, and my comments would stick close to the top, being downvoted all the while, until a moderator eventually removes them."
TheoryOfReddit,33kffw,Yiin,10,Mon May 4 04:32:14 2015 UTC,"I think the ""downvote as a disagree"" problem on reddit is often overstated.   There are lots of comments that essentially amount to ""an opinion I disagree with"" which I'll downvote. The downvote isn't because I disagree it's because the comment doesn't add to the conversation.  Not all opinions are equally worthy of consideration. Many opinions are just plain wrong. It's ridiculous to assume that every thread is an appropriate place to discuss every ignorant opinion that humans can have?  Imagine if every /r/askHistorians thread included a comment from someone sharing their opinion that the world is only 10 years old and all history is an illusion created by an all powerful A.I. This is absurd and contributes nothing to the thread. It would be a shame if this comment wouldn't be downvoted and people wasted their time reading it.   There's a lot of overlap between comments that share an ""unpopular opinion"" and ones that ""don't add to the conversation"". Obviously people who share the opinion will assume it also adds to the conversation and therefore assume that the downvotes are due to disagreement."
TheoryOfReddit,33kffw,kutuzof,2,Thu Apr 23 13:04:01 2015 UTC,"I remember reading so,we here in Rediquette you should EXPLAIN your down votes. It would be very helpful if that were enforced."

They did an episode about buzzfeed, who apparently has a pretty sophisticated research apparatus for just this sort of thing.  Though they didn't really talk about the why they did provide data on the subject.  Articles with titles that are positive get more clicks by in large. Articles that start with positive words like you mentioned also get more clicks. Unless the article is about a negative subject. 4-7 word articles get more click than others.  Negative articles do not get more clicks if the title uses negative effects. Ie ""Ughh!, John Smith really sucks, right guys?"" would get less clicks than ""John Smith really sucks.""  Articles with sincere sounding titles get more clicks. Articles with sarcastic titles get less.  Intrestingly enough, good articles that mention an even number get more clicks, ie ""20 reasons why icecream is good"" would get more than 21 reasons why. Negative articles get more clicks with odd numbers.  Like I said they didn't really a hypothesis, except on the sarcastic thing, which they suggested was people where less likely to share it thinking their social media contacts would think its literal, ie ""Hitler sure was a swell guy!"".

A sub that sticks out in my mind where you will get downvoted to hell if you're aggressive or even hasty is /r/ClashOfClans. If someone says ""No, that idea is stupid,"" you might see ""-100 points"" because that community just doesn't take it.   .  It's just a form of communication that applies to everyone. If I say:  .  ""Seriously OP? You do know that that stupid brain percentage myth has been wrong for like a decade, right? Seriously man, get with the times"" (I edited to not include anything ad hominem to prove my point better)   .  then you might shield yourself from being convinced, whereas a smoother approach can unlock the gate. For example,   .  ""It was said a few years back that some people use their brain more than others (and that if you use more than 13%, you're definitively a genius), but that has been proven wrong various times through dozens of mediums. It sounded like fact for awhile, which is probably where you got it from (remember that film Lucy ? lol), but again, it's been proven wrong for awhile, even with how it seemed somewhat plausible""  .  It just makes it more convincing to someone who started with something that you're trying to prove wrong, or convincing someone that's just ignorant to what's going on. Translated to Reddit, it makes perfect sense why there might be a big difference in comments that are more passive to get more attention, because at the second of your brain triggering that someone is a jerk, you block what they're trying to say from your mind. This blockage is probably why you notice it on /r/politics, OP. Politics by itself is pretty much built on thousands of years of ideologies and root-deep ways of thinking, all of which are built on either our or someone we care much about's opinions on the matters. When you start to talk about something like politics that can get so heated and edgy very quickly that with this key of logical persuasion, it becomes easier and easier to tap in to someone's thoughts and change their mind. On the other side of the coin, when people read things that they disagree with and they see that the commenter is being a dick, people tend to just think ""I know better than that buffoon! He's just a jerk on the internet trying to tell me what to think"" downvote  .  I was in Debate for a couple of years, so this is where I got most of what I said from. If you think a thing I said was misleading, tell me. In case if you're curious (this is a little off subject, but still relevant when talking about arguments), here's a list and explanation of logical faults that basically everyone uses when they try to say something. If you don't actively avoid these things, chances are you stumble upon them.  .  TL;DR - People ward off things that seem to be aggressively trying to convince them in to things. Positive comments help alleviate from petty convincing in to a more natural, thought provoking slew of words. If you thought the last two sentences were somewhat intriguing, read the whole thing for more.  .

""I understand that is a problem for you at the moment and it is actually really easy to solve.""  .  .  For the vast majority of people the primer in the second sentence (""at the moment"") already seeds the expectation that it won't be a problem for long. The even more important portion is changing the semantically expected ""but"" into an ""and"", lifting the whole sentence up to create a positive, non-belittling vibe from the get go.

However, I've been on the internet for over 12 years now, and even when I was 14-15 (closer to the average age of a default sub user?), I was aware of the need to be PC. I'm sure everybody who's made a crude joke in that thread would still tell you that they respect the mentally ill and would never say something like that in person, but the fact that these ideas come to the surface so easily when we're not directly in front of them makes me think that these are exactly the jokes that hold back the progress of bringing mental health to the mainstream.  Edit: I did notice, however, that there was a lack of multi-personality jokes in that thread.

If misinformation in mental health was treated with the same regard for misinformation on a more STEM-focused topic, then the top posts in such threads would be more focused on spreading information rather than cheap laughs (which would still be present, just further down the thread).

TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,not_alot,18,Mon Apr 20 04:06:10 2015 UTC,"I think the concept that is in need of coming to terms with is that this is inevitable. You will find no subject too far for people to make jokes about. From schizophrenia being associated with batshit insanity to Alzheimer's jokes to Alzheimer's jokes, there's no expectation of ""a line"" on reddit.   I have my own personal views. I joke about my own mental issues with friends, and the ones I share with my family together. Humor is a wonderful way to remove the gravity and dread from a shitty situation, like my grandmother's Parkinson's before she died. I personally view trying to make everything PC boring, sterile, and an exercise in redundancy.   Because at the end of the day, whether you don't care about it like in my case, or it matters greatly as it seems to be for you, there is no avoiding what's happening in that thread.  That subreddit is a default subreddit. The implication goes beyond the mean age of the average voter there. When you see a default, it's important to recognize the comment sections as a karma farm for many people. It doesn't matter if the joke hurts or doesn't. Quality content doesn't matter in a place where easily digested content is high in supply and demand. Whether the upvoters legitimately find the jokes funny, or the begrudgingly find it witty (followed with comments about ""going to hell for this""), that type of humor is there to stay.  Nothing, from the fluff-favorite algorithm of Reddit's voting system to the sheer volume of readers with a few minutes to kill facilitate any kind of in depth discussion beyond one liners.  I'm not saying whether these things should be PC or no (I've already put my own views on my sleeve so at least no one calls me a hypocrite), nor is any of this a justification for something that might offend you. But I think it's important to recognize that not only does none of how the default is run facilitate thoughtful comments, there is absolutely no way to guarantee people will even care.

TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,Renato7,4,Mon Apr 20 07:00:37 2015 UTC,"(EDIT TO SUMMARIZE MY POINTS BELOW: /r/floridaman  A wonderful example of how reddit reacts to what was done, not who did it.)   There are different uses for humor which imply different underlying assumptions. When I look for more information on schizophrenia, I don't want to have to wade through 15 different comment threads with 4000 upvotes each, full of immature jokes and ostracizing language. It looks like the community doesn't take the problem seriously, as opposed to the thread about nuclear radiation right above it: http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/335rmv/til_grand_central_station_in_nyc_is_radioactive/   Really don't think you're looking in the right place. Explanation below.   The quality in comments is leaps and bounds better. Would you say that it's just people making jokes, or do you think that the jokes are made to displace the uncomfortable feeling that people tend to get when we bring up mental illness? If the jokes were simply jokes, I'd expect Reddit to upvote the science like they do in any other thread. However, with mental health, that simply isn't the case.   I would say it's neither, as I don't think I can psychoanalyze such a wide subset of people to such an extent. I can only make a hypothesis, and mine is on the types of people a post attracts. I think a good look at the titles and their implications. Looking at it in the most diminutive way possible, the simplest way anyone could take these posts' titles, I think, would be something like this:  BIG POSSIBLE THREAT IN AREA WITH MANY PEOPLE vs ONE NAKED ROCKING PERSON BECOMES TWO NAKED ROCKING PEOPLE  I don't think it has anything to do with what they're uncomfortable with at all, and a simpler explanation is provided just by the titles. One of the responses in the mental illness thread was ""I have a boyfriend"". A considered humorous response to a considered humorous situation. For them, it doesn't seem to matter if it was a schizophrenic, someone on bath salts, or someone working the graveyard shift. The situation illustrated by what the doctor and patient had done was apparent first, before any thought of the struggles of the patient or the wisdom of the doctor. There was no similar immediate, unexpected humor with the nuclear post. The title started and ended at the possible threat, and the the comments immediately dived into explanations.  A good parallel to this perhaps might be how reddit often reacts when there is a funny typo in a post title regardless of what the poster was asking for.  This is the effect of a humorous situation as a first impression on a group of comedy-seekers. It doesn't matter who the actors are to them."
TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,Jest2,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:19:38 2015 UTC,"A fair point. I would still argue that, especially knowing reddit's key demographic, it's not a wild assumption to think that these are upvoted due to the nature of the topic. While the topic does probably lend itself more to joke-making in general, looking at other threads with comparable upvotes makes me think that the topic is seen as more joke-worthy than it should. I'm tired, but I'll continue this tomorrow too, have a good night."
TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,UnholyTeemo,4,Mon Apr 20 07:42:20 2015 UTC,"Sleeping troubles, felt like responding. I still insist that the tone and situation are the comedy targets, not the people suffering.  http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2z1h5y/til_that_during_the_1960s_many_black_civil_rights/  http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2shhfy/til_no_one_born_blind_has_ever_developed/  http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2vfqbe/til_in_2013_the_wall_street_journal_discovered_a/  Here are three different highly upvoted TIL posts from < 100 days ago all dealing with schizophrenics and occasionally other disadvantaged groups.  The main sense one gathers from the comments sections of these posts is one of sympathy and a want for justice and help. The only jokes in the top comments you see have to do with someone else's semantics or spelling (""occasionally homosexual"", again looping back to my point about funny premises bringing funny responses).  I feel like attributing the jokes to some sort of deep-set discomfort is a false attribution. Rather, it's easy to come up with a funny response to a funny topic than it is to come up with a well-researched response to a well-researched topic. No personal attacks or stigma here."
TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,not_alot,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:00:41 2015 UTC,"Its probably a safe bet to assume the majority of people talking about the subject are doing so in a environeutral manner. Unfortunately in general 'culture' does not handle this kind of difference very well, its assumptions and quarter-water jokes all the way down. Then usually the whole subject/topic is ignored because no one wants to be on the other side of that kind of apathy."
TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,GodsOfWarMayCry,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:08:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think that it can be addressed. Look at it this way - in a TIL thread about a gay person, would you expect the top 5-10 threads to be repeating fag jokes? In a thread about a black person, where would you find a nigger joke? The underlying assumption is that the mentally ill are okay to ostracize and joke about, but black and gay people have suffered and those words are hurtful because of the history behind them. I'd argue that those words are probably just as hurtful, if not moreso, to the mentally ill, because of the added stigma it attaches to their current mental struggles."
TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,TheCodexx,2,Mon Apr 20 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"I'd agree, if the jokes were focused on the mental illness.

TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,Aniform,2,Mon Apr 20 14:53:39 2015 UTC,"You grow up seeing and understanding the world based on the very small group you associate with.  You adopt that thinking, that bias, that understanding.  You adopt it until you are faced with it.  For most people, their view of the world is only changed when a compelling argument is made that forces them to logically approach it,  usually it was a book or a movie.  Now along comes Reddit.  You read the jokes, you also see the explanation.  It's there, and it usually moves up.  Someone explains the behavior, someone talks about a family member, someone shows kindness and understanding.  It moves people to change their perception.  It is a slow process, but it does move towards understanding, and then the last remaining group will struggle to gain control back to what they want to believe is true.  Look at the religious right for Muslims and christaiins.  They cannot hold on to people who have been shown a true perspective.  Mental illness is scary because there but for the grace of God go I.  Deep down that is known.  One day I hope soon, I will never see a picture of a young boy licking a mailbox because that would be seen as exploitive and crass by the audience viewing it.

As far as people go, no one's really off limits for jokes.   Thank goodness. Once you start with the political correctness crap it just makes people walk on eggshells. It's misery.  Some subreddits already operate like that. Thankfully, there's still quite a few people who enjoy a good politically incorrect joke.  OP, nobody cares. Because making jokes doesn't mean anything. Because most of those people would be understanding of someone dealing with issues. If they did an IAmA, there'd be jokes, alongside questions, and the best participants will have a sense of humor about themselves. It's not hostility, and pretending it's that is misleading. It's people having fun to cope with the fact that there's some awful crap out there."
TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,onebit,3,Tue Apr 21 13:39:06 2015 UTC,"As a redditor with mental illness, I have to be honest in saying I sometimes find that people are far too sensitive at times. Don't get me wrong, if you go to advice related subs, they'll tell you almost unanimously to run, run far away, from someone with mental illness. This I think is where I'll feel the need to comment. On the other hand, I really get a kick out of really offensive stuff said about mental illness. Just depends on the sub. I've come to expect a level of compassion displayed on /r/MorbidReality and will tend to react much more appalled to offensive stuff on that sub. However, on a lot of other subs, I pretty much want it to be offensive. There's no point in me laughing at one offensive joke, then not laughing at one aimed at mental illness.  In real life, I noticed that my friends wouldn't laugh at a joke on some TV show or movie because I was in the room. So, if Family Guy made a really off-color joke about Meg killing herself, my friends wouldn't laugh. I had to start being the first to laugh at the joke, so they felt comfortable doing so. I really would much rather have them laugh. I want there to be less stigma, but I really don't like being PC. I think there's a difference between being aware that it's wrong and being offensive for the sheer fun of it."
TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,zublits,4,Mon Apr 20 20:31:58 2015 UTC,"I think this is true of most of society. It annoys me as well as someone with a psychology degree currently pursuing a medical degree. Mental illness continues to be stigmatized, undertreated, underdiagnosed, and underserved. It's sad.    On a similar note, I also hate the attitude about disabilities around here. Namely the phrase, ""never go full retard"". I wish it would die. I guess not everyone has had the same experience as me, having worked at a residence for people with disabilities. It's hard for people to empathize with what they don't know. But again, it's sad."

TheoryOfReddit,3372pz,ravia,2,Mon Apr 20 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"This is one of the most important things about the reddit community at large: it has been steadily getting younger since the site's conception. That isn't to say we shouldn't be concerned about the often-troubling dialogue that makes its way to the top of the stack in defaults, but it's important to keep in context.  OPs mention of the contrast between science topics and mental health is interesting. I think it's the same one you see when comparing STEM in general to the arts and humanities.  If these kids view something as an objective science, they will express deference to anyone who sounds like they know what they're talking about.  With topics viewed as 'subjective,' however, every uneducated brat thinks that their opinion is somehow just as valid as everyone else's.  Topics such as psychology & mental health get caught up in this, because they aren't thought of as hard sciences. There is no bowing to expertise, and the posts that get upvoted are strictly the ones that redditors agree with."

TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,JonnyRobbie,66,Wed Apr 15 20:16:29 2015 UTC,"On /r/redditrequest (which is run by the admins), they define an inactive redditor as someone who hasn't logged in in 60 days."

TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,cecilkorik,20,Thu Apr 16 06:31:23 2015 UTC,"Another problem to face, would be the fact that some people like to strictly ONLY lurk.

TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,james_bonged,11,Thu Apr 16 11:34:17 2015 UTC,"If someone doesn't log into an account for a few years, I'd be ok with someone else taking the username."

If I'm sick of reddit tomorrow I expect my account to be waiting for me in three years time when I decide I'm interested again.  If a company ever gave away the account I built for the sole reason of someone else liking the name and me not logging in for two months, I would rightfully never use their service again.  Hell, the whole reason I'm playing Neopets and Runescape in 2015 is because my account has been there for thirteen and a half years now, and I can check back every two or three years and see how badass I still am."
TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,Dlgredael,5,Thu Apr 16 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"I think It would be better to separate the account name from the account, then just have the person reassign their name when they log in."

TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,DEADB33F,31,Thu Apr 16 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"You can sort of figure out if an account is inactive by viewing the trophies on their profile.  If the account is over a year old but they don't have the '1 year' trophy then the account hasn't been logged in since before the trophy was awarded.   (Awarded trophies only get updated when the account is active.)  Likewise for two year old accounts missing the '2 year' trophy, etc.    Until an account is at least a year old you can't tell either way though."
TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,DEADB33F,4,Thu Apr 16 08:41:02 2015 UTC,"Users also have a user ID. For example, if you go to a user profile and inspect the source on the 'friend' link you can get an individual user's 'ID' (it'll begin 't2_').  These are base36 encoded numbers which increment with each new member.  IIRC there's an API endpoint which allows you to stick in any  'thing' ID (user, subreddit, submission, comment, whatever) and get info on that 'thing'.  Which means that given enough time you could theoretically go through each user ID numerically (starting at the beginning, finishing once you reach accounts which are less than a year old) and figure out whether each user has been active in the last 12 months or so.    It'd probably be easier and quicker to just ask some of the devs on #reddit-dev (freenode) to look up the actual figures though. This method would also save tens of millions of page requests, which even if you did them would only give you a vague answer that may not even be all that accurate."

Traffic definitely exacerbates things, but the way to actually fix a lot of issues can be changing how the data is stored/accessed. We definitely have issues related to the sheer volume of data, but that's generally more related to things like votes. Account data is a pretty tiny chunk of our data overall."
TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,dakta,2,Wed Apr 15 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you're simply wrong. Reddit's structural problems, at this point, are not due so much to traffic (they have automatically configured load-balanced application servers that are initialized based on current traffic patterns) as they are to other issues like the size of some stored data objects. For example, that time when AutoModerator was causing the site to be slow:   The issue in that case was basically that we cache entire account objects, and AutoModerator's account object was very large. Most of the size was related to it having karma in many different subreddits (an account object contains each subreddit's karma individually) and flair in many different subreddits (again, all contained in the object). AutoMod's data is also pulled from cache a lot because it comments in a lot of places, is in a lot of mod lists, etc. So pulling a large object extremely frequently was a huge amount of bandwidth, and it ended up actually maxing out the bandwidth of the cache server that it's stored on.   So sayeth Deimorz in this very thread."

TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,robotortoise,2,Thu Apr 16 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"Well... There was that issue a while back where the site was literally being slowed down because AutoModerator's account had too many comments associated with it. It was mucking with Cassandra or some of the caching servers, IIRC. /u/Deimorz could probably elaborate.  My point is that due to the way reddit is structured, slowdowns come from all sorts of places, and from what I hear basically none of it has to do with application server capacity (their system dynamically scales to accommodate additional load). So, no, you're actually wrong."
TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,justcool393,3,Thu Apr 16 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"The issue in that case was basically that we cache entire account objects, and AutoModerator's account object was very large.

There are various issues here that should probably be fixed - individual subreddit karmas really don't need to be retrieved all the time, since they're almost never needed (it's pretty much always just the total when anything related to karma is even needed), all the flair shouldn't be directly attached to the account object either, and just in general pulling all attributes from an object out of the cache every single time even if you don't need almost all of them is pretty inefficient. These are all known things that need improvement, just have to find time to get around to them amongst all the other infrastructure-type issues."
TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,dakta,2,Thu Apr 16 15:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's just one example of how structural issues—and in some cases stored data size—are, at this point, the primary bottleneck in reddit's speed and availability.  This was meant as a rebuttal to the previous commenter's claim that ""reddit's issue is traffic, not data"", and the parent conversation about how pruning long-inactive accounts and subs might be beneficial to reddit's speed. I wanted to point out that that is, in fact, a pertinent discussion, despite what the other users claimed (""That's not how it works"")"
TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,dakta,4,Thu Apr 16 15:50:06 2015 UTC,I don't know about that. Remember when the site crashed because of Automod's massive amount of data?
TheoryOfReddit,32pzco,elevator_guy96,7,Thu Apr 16 14:00:24 2015 UTC,"Seems like it was more an issue with per-subreddit karma and subreddit flair.  From the announcement:   ...the majority of this data was the flair text/class settings that it had from many subreddits, as well as the fact that it had karma from many different subreddits since it leaves comments in thousands of subreddits regularly.   I wouldn't mind them deleting the dummy accounts, but inactive account deletion could potentially be problematic."

TheoryOfReddit,32qqhy,vir_innominatus,5,Wed Apr 15 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"So, that was a situation with relatively low traffic, but also with people clicking the button lots of times very early?  I could see someone using bots to click when the time got low (either to get the flair, or to prevent it from hitting 0), but I can't see why anyone would hit it from a bunch of different alt accounts in the high 50's. I would chalk it up the hacker news, but then I'd expect to see a jump in traffic as well.  I can't think of a good explanation, so I'll make a wild guess instead: someone's bot malfunctioned and clicked for a bunch of alt accounts at the ""wrong"" time?"
TheoryOfReddit,32qqhy,newdefinition,2,Thu Apr 16 00:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can see a small bump in the traffic that I think is curious people from hacker news. It just doesn't match up with the spike in the click rate.   I don't think it was intended to get the best flair (or if it was, it failed miserably). A lot of those clicks received the worst flair. You can see from the previous three nights that the best chances for that are actually later in the morning, around 07:00 EDT.  Another issue is that after this event (during the day on Monday), the traffic was much higher than it was the previous few days. People on /r/thebutton think it was to do with increased publicity, since a few other articles also came out (e.g. the Guardian). As you can see though, that activity is better correlated. I think the two proposed causes (increased publicity vs. bots) is hard to tease apart."
TheoryOfReddit,32qqhy,InRustITrust,5,Thu Apr 16 00:28:04 2015 UTC,"It's possibly from /r/Knightsofthebutton.  Someone wrote a browser add-in and posted it there that will serialize clicks to try to keep the button alive as long as possible.  I don't know how many of them there are, but that's their stated goal.  There could also just be a small, uncoordinated group who have also observed that trend and are using times of low traffic to try for hard-to-get colors."

However, it had a nasty/amusing (depending on how important ""the button"" is to you and your sense of humor) payload that pushed the button after a certain date and time.  Turned a bunch of people purple in one fell swoop.  As far as I know, everyone stopped using it, so it's not likely to show up anymore."

Right now we've just been living through 6-8 months of public investigation & prosecution of videos of American cops executing black men... including two kids shot to death for carrying toy guns. This story has steamrolled and it is having a transformative effect on police departments across the country, hopefully but not always necessarily for the better.   I've said it over & over on reddit & elsewhere, but people who are shocked and appalled by stories of NSA spying on citizens are missing the forest for the trees.

Hopefully you're not suggesting that what happened wasn't a problem that should be discussed.  Many who participated in that mess were whipping up people into a frenzy against innocent people.  What happens when this occurs again and the police don't get to the ""suspects"" first?  Who should be held accountable when the hive mind gets somebody murdered in the name of justice?  It didn't used to be such a problem that with ubiquitous Internet connections to tens of thousands of people or more that a witch hunt could come together so quickly and involving so many.

TheoryOfReddit,32hx67,DoctorDank,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"What I assume the documentary will be getting at is the the events on reddit are a symbol, or a manifestation, of the greater consequences which mob rule and social media have on broadcasting and journalism. Nobody cares that it's reddit, but the potential for something like that to happen again on a much larger scale (what if someone gets wrongly accused and killed the next time, for example?) that people are worried about.  Not to mention how journalists have to change the way they deal with the news? Lots and lots of people complain about big network news being out of touch, obsessed with social media because it fluffs out their 24 hour cycle and makes them look good with the kids. When twitter collectively decides to focus itself on a single person who may very well be innocent, we consider that a bunch of stupid individuals jumping to conclusions, but then CNN, supposedly an authority in 'objective' reporting, follows up on it because a witchhunt rakes in the views, and now you have an international multimillion dollar institution staring you down alongside thousands of people it brought along with them.  We do good on reddit to acknowledge that it was a screw up, and I hope the documentary doesn't just spin it into a big controversy game because the site collectively did the adult thing and took responsibility for itself. But if the documentary does it right, it will show plainly that reddit here is just the vessel for the idea of mob rule actually trying to take action on its own. And if that's a real threat to media and possibly to just people on the ground, then maybe that's why there's a 'need' for the film. That's just my opinion on it."

TheoryOfReddit,32ekcw,Shaper_pmp,9,Mon Apr 13 05:38:37 2015 UTC,"appending ""true"" seems a bit silly   Actually it started when some of the older redditors got annoyed with dilution on the site, and created /r/truereddit as a place where they could gather to preserve more of the original/""pure"" spirit of the reddit community.  Subsequently.other people attempting to start alternative, higher-quality communities to existing popular subreddits followed the same trend because they (usually) shared similar ideals.  We don't have /r/funny1 and /r/funny2 because the names are meaningless and not adequately distinguishable - what's the difference between ""1"" and ""2"" in the context of ""funny""?  The only reason TV channels are numbered is because early TV sets only offered a numbered dial (because different channels are called different things in different countries and regions). Then as TV evolved and suddenly the BBC needed a second channel there was still such a restricted range of channels available that everyone could just learn by rote that BBC1 was for mainstream programming and BBC2 was for niche appeal, and it was more important to advertise the shared ownership and editorial control than the type of content on offer.  TL;DR: TV channels are named for the owners, and broadcast a variety of programming on each channel. Subreddits are named for the content, and generally streamline content into topic-specific subreddits. Numbering TV channels was also influenced by historical quirks of TV UI design, whereas subreddits are beholden to no such technological legacy."

FB is a prime example of social networking based on who you are and know - it requires you to declare your 'official' identity as an individual.   Reddit is networking based on what you talk and think about, but I don't think that necessarily makes it less of a social medium. I feel like it's more of one than Instagram/ Imgur because it's structured to encourage conversations (threads). More so than FB in a way even, because FB posts are like a public journal but reddit is premised on interaction."
TheoryOfReddit,323qud,argent-skies,3,Fri Apr 10 10:50:59 2015 UTC,"One can even build an official identity here by making a post history, and your subscribed subreddits are pretty much analogous to status markers, either by being directly tied to an AFK status marker, or by getting pegged into a sort of site wide hierarchy."

TheoryOfReddit,323qud,BadCowz,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:02:27 2015 UTC,I opened this to say that and you have already said it.  Reddit is where you come to discuss and read things which either your friends/family are not interested in or which you don't want them to know you are interested in.  It is a social media network for sure.  There was an article about this that referenced Zuckerberg as saying this was a recognised limitation of FaceBook.

TheoryOfReddit,323qud,BadCowz,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"The ""pure"" ones would be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, etc.   I disagree.  An social network is a network where there is   1) A clear demarcation in both roles, work and status between the breeders and the childfree.  Twitter, Linkedin, Snapchat offer no clear split in roles between breeders and non-breeders, and Reddit you can't even tell who's the breeder and who's the sockpuppet (except possibly which subreddit the conversation is occurring in, and then only in part).  2) A clear caste system based on the division of labour, whereupon resources are pooled (roughly from each according to his ability to provide fitness to the network, to each according to his need of resources from the network as far as permissible).  While there's definitely labour that happens on Facebook and Twitter, it's unclear anything at all of the sort happens on Instram/Snapchat/Linkedin, nevermind that it is so ordered.  3) An overlap between the use of the system over 3 generations, and care of the young by the old (often unrelated).  Neither Facebook/Twitter/etc has been around long enough that grandmothers conceived while using the system.  It's too early to call.  Yahoo, maybe.  But the care of the young is pretty haphazard."
TheoryOfReddit,31yufp,zzxxzzxxzz,57,Thu Apr 9 05:38:32 2015 UTC,"It probably has to do with the new context injokes and memes have. They are probably the same thing, but each time you see them they are funny for slightly different reasons. Related to this is that comments and memes (generally) have context (at least the context of the post they are in). However, reposts do not (as they are content that is supposed to create the context themselves). As the other poster said, it is likely that group cohesion and belonging also play a large part, as validating the meme or in joke validates your status as a member of the group (at least in your own eyes), while reposting does not imply the same amount, level, and type of knowledge of the community. It could also be possibly due to the imprint effect: from the time you start using forae you learn that ""reposts are baaaaad, ok?"", which translates to not liking reposts for any reason. Interesting problem overall. :)."
TheoryOfReddit,31yufp,guilleme,11,Thu Apr 9 06:27:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is closest to the mark. I don't buy the reason that people want to feel like part of an in-group or that they want the self-validation of getting the joke. Those are both true in general, but I don't think they sufficiently answer OP's question.    ...memes (generally) have context (at least the context of the post they are in). However, reposts do not (as they are content that is supposed to create the context themselves).   This nails it, and it also explains why reposts are tolerated and even embraced in comments but not as entire submissions.   If a meme is posted, it's a variation on a known theme (unless the submission is a reposted meme, which is generally looked down upon). It's acceptable as a creation of context for discussion. If a submission is a repost, the context environment created by that submission is already stale before comments on the post have even begun.  On the other hand, in the comments, it's not uncommon at all for someone to copypasta a story someone else told months ago or repeat a comment they made about a topic in a different submission. Usually repeating yourself multiple times per comment thread is frowned upon, but repeating a helpful comment in the appropriate context is often celebrated, especially if you qualify it by mentioning that you or someone else posted it before.   I don't think I've ever seen someone say ""laaaame, repost"" in response to a comment (although I'm sure it's happened, it's just not common). Also, it's harder to give the ""this has been posted before, but I thought it was cool"" context in a submission repost without wasting valuable title space or commenting on your own submission, which depending on the subreddit and the timing, can also be frowned upon, or might not even get noticed by other commenters."

You see an image and that's it. If it's a picture you've seen ten times before it's boring and annoying.  Inside jokes, references and circlejerks involve feedback from the group. You see a reference you recognize, you reply with a related reference, you give upvotes, you get upvotes. Happy days! And it comes with the added benefits of being included while excluding others, because there's usually someone who asks what the joke is (especially when it's old reddit stories being referenced)."
TheoryOfReddit,31yufp,CoruscantSunset,2,Thu Apr 9 12:01:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. You're ""in the group"" when you recognize and cry about something that has been posted before - it means you're very active on Reddit, after all. You're also ""in the group"" when you repeat an in-joke."
TheoryOfReddit,31yufp,greenmoonlight,7,Thu Apr 9 17:54:51 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason reposts are so disliked is the frequency with which false stories are included with them.  Reusing memes is annoying at the very worst, and when a meme has run its course, it no longer garners any upvotes or positive attention.  Reposts can gain tons of link karma while using a lie about someone else's OC.  That's the difference."
TheoryOfReddit,31yufp,SOwED,6,Thu Apr 9 07:10:13 2015 UTC,"There's this old marketing concept about social networks called the 90-9-1 principle. There's talk about these numbers changing, but same basic principle.   1 percent of a system's users are active content producers.  9 percent of users are sharing content, talking about it etc, but not actively producing content. 90 percent of users are basically lurkers.   Let's apply this  to reddit's registered users.    1 percent of users includes people who are doing everything: posting (OC, reposts, x-posts, self posts), commenting, voting 9 percent of users are commenting and voting. 90 percent of users are voting.    It's easy to see that the people complaining about the issues you mentioned are inside that ten-percent. However, in-jokes make the 10-percent feel good about being the 10-percent.  Whereas reposts ruin their experience.  They're here the most often and are looking for OC.    What's important to also note is that when it comes to voting, the sway of the 9-percent is vastly outweighed by the sheer numbers of the 90 percent.    And since those that are posting will be encouraged by the karma given by the entire group, that means that re-posts, and in-jokes will be repeated by 1 and 9 percenters for that sweet sweet karma.  Everyone loves acceptance.  This brings us to memes.  Years ago there was no /r/adviceanimals.  When it came, the 9-percent was really really worried that it would take over the site.  When it became a top-10 subreddit people freaked. But the 90-percent had spoken.    The old 9-percent either gave up or retreated to other parts of reddit and were replaced by folks who aren't bothered as much by them."

So the ignorance due to lack of participation leads to the continuation of the meme because it's just so darned hilarious to all the new people that can't keep up.

TheoryOfReddit,31yufp,iEATu23,2,Thu Apr 9 07:12:15 2015 UTC,"I think it boils down to people being concerned about their perceived intellect and karma. To recognize a situation where a meme or joke is applicable is a show of wit and it took effort on their part to recognize this. If you post something that has been already posted before, you are (generally) viewed as not putting in any effort and should not be awarded karma. I think a lot of people posting memes and jokes are expecting karma for their witty display; seeing people get upvoted for content that isn't theirs undermines their own efforts to get noticed. The backlash is downvoting reposts or calling them out. Even though you can argue that spouting memes and jokes are really just unoriginal content."

Most people, however, are content with repetition as entertainment, and others still have only just discovered the meme and don't realise how old it really is.

On Wikipedia, the browser version has sidelinks and a logo and all that jazz. On the mobile version, despite the fact I'm using an UHD-definition (1680x1050) panel, it has an excessively minimal interface that scales beautifully to my screen.   On most websites, the mobile versions are castrated and paraplegic in comparison. Lacking in all the features that defined the original site, and adding some cumbersome and inefficient ""extra features"" for mobile users, most mobile versions of websites find themselves irrelevant.   I ought to be using a Reddit client because lately I've been despising some of the local changes.

TheoryOfReddit,31sn9s,phdbatman,4,Tue Apr 7 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely consider myself someone who explores these communities. When multireddits and the exploration page were announced I consider myself to have taken full advantage of them, discovering hundreds of communities of different sizes and demographics which I tend to drop in on at times. For some communities, I browse more intensely, going directly to them rather than, say, wandering in if they happen to frontpage on a multireddit I follow or if they show up in my explore page. I tend to check these subreddits because I have a personal investment in the content, culture, or community that exists there, that I believe I have something to contribute. There are communities which I browse selfishly, with a passion to learn new things, and try and take in what I can about whatever instrument, programming language, lifestyle, etc. the community is about. Subreddits like that I don't contribute in and browse directly but only for a short period of time before they become passive, saved in my subscriptions or elsewhere. I also tend to explore naturally; if there's an interesting link to a new subreddit posted on just any thread I'm browsing, I'll take the time to check it out. Same thing goes for subreddits that make the daily trending list...if a link shows up, I might check it out.  I tend to be a very sparing contributor to communities I consider myself a part of. I'm a lurker by most definitions. However, I consider myself to be very involved with the subreddits I browse whether or not I've commented within them. Each community has its own unique culture and behavior (speech patterns included), and I often absorb the inside jokes and nuances of the community for a time. If I leave a community (which I often do, to keep up with the ones I join) I tend to drop these nuances over time, but sometimes as these communities grow these nuances are lost, jokes become tasteless or even butchered. I'm not huge on complaining about 'Eternal September' but it most certainly exists. Communities evolve, and sometimes they and I disagree on the new direction.  I would say that I've grown a lot better at joining new communities. I used to be very insular in my browsing, and actually really detested my reddit experience. After I first started switching to new communities it became a lot easier to continue exploring (this was right around the time new exploration tools were being implemented in the first place). My experience of having strong dislike of reddit in general blossomed into an appreciation for the platform and even a love for the site and the potential it holds for discovery and participation."

Then I decide if I like the community and if so I subscribe. At this point I try to interact to gauge the friendliness of the community. If it sucks or is too inactive, I back off and eventually unsub.

TheoryOfReddit,31sn9s,HippityLongEars,3,Tue Apr 21 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this type of research. It seems to at least vaguely be based on real scientific methods, there seems to be a legitimate interest in making sure bias was avoided and results are relevant, AND it's on a relevant topic.   All of which is more than can be said about most ""studies"" I've seen. I don't have the time or motivation to scrutinize the work to really make sure it's up to my standard (not to be full of myself, but my standard seems to be similar to many other valid standards) so kudos anyways.   ""Redditors are more likely to stop posting in subreddits where they get bad initial feedback."" One thing to consider (somehow) is a person's expectations. Here's a good example. I found the sub /r/StormComing around the same time I discovered subs like /r/MacroPorn and /r/EarthPorn. So maybe I was primed. But I posted some ""storm-ey"" themed posts for a while, before I realized I was mistaken and /r/StormComing is actually an end-of-the-world apocalypse-predicting sort of place. So needlessly to say, my storm pictures were only mildly appreciated, shoutout to the sub for being tolerant to my type. I'm not the only one who has done this, I forgot about the incident for several months until another weather-related post from /r/Stormcoming popped up on my frontpage and I thought ""that guy got lucky"".   I'll answer you questions too, maybe they'll be used for something bigger than me.    Nope, I can't think of the things I'm interested in off the top of my head. When I see an interesting sub, populous or not, I'll join it. I can't really go hunting though, since I don't know if I'll like something till I see a) what it is, and b) how it's implemented.  I'll split this into two halves, new subscribed subs, and new unsubscribed subs. Sometimes I'll come across a non-interesting sub with an interesting convo going on, I'll put my 2 cents in and leave. If I post in a new sub after I subscribe to it, it's because I believe I have something to contribute that could be valuable in karma. If I comment, well it's because somebody said something worth responding too, on-topic or not.  Cross-posts, conglomerate subs like /r/mistyfront, and people talking about them. Talking about obscure topics on large/vocal subs is a great way to find new subs.  I pretty much only browse my frontpage. I really ought to look at and contribute to some of the communities that I enjoy, but I really only visit them when I have a reason to ie. posting relevant content. If I have an ability to produce my own relevant content (pics, sites, text especially, or OC), or enjoy talking about that topic irl, I'll visit a sub more often (ie. /r/bicycling and /r/MacroPorn for me). So really only 3-4 subs find regular attention from me.   All subs have generally the same methods of communication and point generating, only specific subs (/r/circlejerk comes to mind) have a significantly different culture. But if you're interested enough to subscribe, I can't imagine many ppl having too much trouble being assimilated.  For me, some posts to /r/sex, /r/bicycling, and /r/AdviceAnimals were particularly enlightening. I didn't care about people or what they thought, and I posted anything I wanted right up until my first successful /r/AdviceAnimals post. I was used to scoring up to 100 for content before I made something that must have appealed to the crowd, because suddenly I had 1500 extra points sitting around. It was around then that I really realized that karma isn't about my morals or reasoning, it's about how relevant my topic is and how well I made my point, whether it be blending in with something popular or standing out with something new. Some of my posts to /r/sex made me realize ""hey, these are real people in real situations, donig the same thing I am - trying to talk to ppl on the 'net"". And /r/bicycling... really drove it home that people are more concerned about karma than logic. /r/Bicycling should be remade into /r/BicyclingCirclejerk because they've really abandoned reason over there."
TheoryOfReddit,31sn9s,HippityLongEars,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:44:50 2015 UTC,Thanks! Really glad that you liked our approach. The expectation of users is a good point but hard to measure. I did not quite get how you find new subs to subscribe.
TheoryOfReddit,31sn9s,q9rtn,2,Tue Apr 21 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"Can we talk about the line graphs?    At the top where we are measuring %posts vs #communities, I can't even begin to guess what that displays. The first one in the row of three seems to say that users who are destined to leave reddit post more often and do not drop off their posting rate as quickly during their initial 50 posts. (what is the x-axis? It is labeled 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50. Is this the user's change in behavior over the course of their first 50 posts? I'm going to assume so.)  I don't get how that means ""users are more adventurous."" Which users are you talking about? Wait, maybe the y-axis means ""posts per month per community"" in which case you are not saying the lasting users post less, but that they post in more communities. ??? The second one kind of maybe shows that users gradually adopt a community's language, whether they are destined to leave or not. But the y-axis is massively distorted, presumably on purpose, to show the effect. Also, isn't the more interesting fact that the users who are destined to leave are the ones who conform the most? That's a really interesting point, and looks much more backed up by the data.   Cheers!"

In small subs, however, links get clicked on more often. I think there are many subs which have userbases that have participation problems (voting but not commenting).

Granted, making a group hate is relatively easy to any other emotion, but the fact is, a good percentage of a sub of over 5M people have a seething animosity towards a cable company of all things.  If this is a product of Reddit manipulation (and I'm not saying it is), then I'd consider that an incredible feat.

But at the same time we can consider the average redditor, which (generalization alert) is usually portrayed as a male between 13 & 29.  Many millennials are technologically native and lean left politically.  Hence they understand why Comcast is ""bad"", they disagree with Chick-Fil-A's corporate anti-gay policy, and probably don't like corporations to begin with.

TheoryOfReddit,31kpzo,shaggorama,8,Mon Apr 6 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"Reddit is very easy to manipulate, especially if you utilize vote manipulation along with it. There was a study here about randomly upvoting and downvoting 20 new posts and tracking their point progress after a day. There was a significant correlation between the posts that were given that vote and their score after a day, upvotes correlating to higher scores and downvotes to lower scores. The 90% of Reddit is a very hive minded entity, and thus can be easily pushed along by the minority.  If you want to make /r/liberals more right leaning, all you need to do is utilize vote manipulation and make points close to the current view but just ever so slightly more to the right. People will see the initial, inflated upvotes, immediately gain a bias that this is a correct opinion, and then read through it, automatically agreeing and upvoting. Congrats, you have just made this person more right leaning. Do this many more times and you now have a substantially more right leaning community.  Manipulating reddit is a piece of cake if you are dedicated enough, the question is, who wants to spend that time to adjust the opinions of a few thousand maybe people?

In particular, if you can frame your project as somehow beneficial to straight upper-middle-class white men between the ages of 25 and 40 who live in large cities, Reddit will climb on board. (So that's Uber, flat taxes, bitcoins, Ron Paul, male fashion accessories, gamer culture, and any kind of consumer good which allows nebbishy urbanites to feel ""manly"".)  If you tick fewer of those boxes, things get dicey. (Affirmative action, union rights, poverty, homelessness, police brutality...)  It's much easier to sell Reddit a can of beer, so long as that can of beer has a lumberjack printed on it, than it is to sell Reddit on feeding homeless children.

It's much easier to sell Reddit a can of beer, so long as that can of beer has a lumberjack printed on it, than it is to sell Reddit on feeding homeless children.   Isn't that true with pretty much everyone? Maybe not beer, but don't most people spend more on their own personal consumption than on homeless children?  http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1rr1mp/meta_preliminary_census_results/  According to this online poll (which is not a super-reliable source, its from ""SubredditDrama""), those polled were is 48% left, 28% centrist, and only 8% libertarian. The poll also found about a quarter of responders does not identify as heterosexual, which is a bit more than in the general population, so while the large majority is straight, it is not disproportionatly so.   In terms of income, the poll showed that half has no income, and another 15% made less than 20,000 a year.  You also said that reddit is mostly between ""the ages of 25 and 40""- but the first poll and this pew poll both say that reddit strongly skews young; high school and college age people.: http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_reddit_usage_2013.pdf  I googled ""is reddit libertarian"" and got nothing. I googled ""is reddit liberal"" and got this: https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=is+reddit+liberal  erm, none of this other than the Pew research poll is high quality scientific stuff, so I'm not saying me googling ""is reddit libertarian"" is proof on anything. I'm just pointing out that reddit is more likely mostly liberal and poor, and not so much upper-class and libertarian."
TheoryOfReddit,31kpzo,wdr1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"You're looking at how Reddit self-identifies, not at Reddit's actual behaviour.  Insofar as Reddit is broadly supportive of certain liberal positions, these positions normally overlap with libertarian positions. (Same-sex marriage, net neutrality, legalization of marijuana, police cameras, etc.)  But on issues where liberals and libertarians don't overlap, Reddit rarely swerves liberal.  Consider that Reddit is opposed to union rights. Reddit is opposed to progressive taxation. Reddit is opposed to affirmative action. Reddit is opposed to mainstream feminism. Reddit is opposed to serious environmental protections. Reddit is opposed to measures which promote women and POC within fields which have historically excluded them. Reddit doesn't particularly want to think about what we're going to do with the hundreds of millions of people who will shortly be automated out of jobs and left to rot in the streets. Reddit thinks immigrants should go home. And Reddit's views on leaking illegally-obtained naked images of unconsenting women are, at best, ""conflicted"".    If Reddit is this liberal mecca (bravely, even smugly, so), why does it so consistently adopt positions at odds with the liberal mainstream, especially on the most important and challenging stuff? Reddit swings left on some of the interesting contemporary social issues, but on fundamental questions about the economy, race and gender relations, international relations and the environment -- issues which have lingered for centuries and which will never really go away -- Reddit is actually well within the right-wing mainstream.  I mean, that's really it in a nutshell, right?  Reddit is in favour of same-sex marriage, and talks incessantly about how it's in favour of same-sex marriage, and feels kind of smug about it. (Even though the majority of the American public is now in favour of same-sex marriage.) This position gets lots of attention, and the fact that this one issue gets talked about so much can easily lead one to believe that Reddit is just broadly liberal.  But that's just because we don't talk about the economy the same way we talk about same-sex marriage.  I don't care how Reddit self-identifies. Reddit's behaviour is far more important."

But in the beginning, when not  much was known a bunch a couple individuals, with their own perspective on life, spoke their opinion and wanted to make something out of it. One (Knights of the Button) wanted it to continue, and to see where it ends up, to protect it at all costs. Another (Followers of the Shade) said that he shall not give into temptation and possibly viewed it as a challenge, and thought it was pointless or above it. When others joined and saw the two different philosophies, one sided with the one more preferable to their own views.

TheoryOfReddit,31d4se,Takeshimoa,22,Sat Apr 4 00:43:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The difference between Periwinkle / Orangered and TPP or the button is that TPP and the button both have static dynamic parties.  In Per/Ora, the opposing teams were completely dynamic static - there was no mystery or confusion about who was on the other team - the other team was just more redditors.  In TPP and the button, there is a confusing or constant natural phenomenon that has to be explained. That's how the religious jokes started in TPP - the community was trying to come up with a reason for why Red kept looking at the Helix Fossil.  With the button, redditors are almost being forced to justify their actions, so this religious/idealogical meme was brought up much sooner than in TPP.  Was the button influenced by TPP? No doubt, people know the steps to make a religious meme (we are already at the propaganda stage). However, I think this line of thought would have happened regardless of redditors seeing TPP or not."

The button doesn't really just monitor time and willpower, it shows the traits of those who press and don't press. The button can let you see if you are impulsive, cautious, adventurous, greedy, and pretty much anything else. People see the button and want to press it or don't want to press it based off of their traits.  The factions are a completely different story though. The factions are often supported and set up because of what people have as a flair at the time. Those who clicked on 60s and 59s group with each other often because of the fact that they are the same.  Other factions are similar to those who sabotaged gameplay in TPP, where they want to just go against what everybody else wants. However, nobody knows what the button will do. Probably nothing, but nobody quite knows. This is different from TPP because there is/was a story and a goal to reach, and it didn't matter how long it took. The button will inevitably hit 0s, despite what people do to prolong it.  The mentality of pressing or not pressing the button out of sabotage is similar to what happened in TPP, but I wouldn't say that it is blatant imitation.

I didn't really get the Periwinkle/Orangered thing when it happened, but the button is much different. Orangered and Periwinkle were arbitrary assignments. The button gives people a choice.  To me it seems to be sort of a blank slate that people can flush their ideas onto. Ones that they wouldn't necessarily take the time consider otherwise, and that's what makes it powerful - that's why all these micro-religions have sprung out of it. If every choice is an act of creation in a causal sense, then the choice of the button lets people create their own ideologies and philosophies around it - not about it so much...they're really about other things, but the button sort of opens that door to give people the space to let those things out. It's absurd, but it can be cathartic.  I only take it seriously insofar as it's an enjoyable exercise, and enjoy it most when people are fleshing out the different systems of belief they're operating under.  edit: the ideas I've been projecting on the button, for example, have been generally based around Buddhist philosophy and Existentialism.

Or what pre-existing notions led people to either choose willingly not to click (to stay in the shade), or to save their click for a particular flair or for the button's extension (the knights of the button/redguard)?  The factions are defined by beliefs and principles, which is why I think people are getting so caught up in it, enough to take the time and effort to define and create these micro-religions that reflect how they see themselves and allow them to join with others like them...and perhaps oppose those that are not them.  I'm not religious or spiritual at all, and I subscribe to the beliefs that the only meaning that exists in an indifferent universe is that which we create ourselves, and that certain beliefs can have social and personal benefits even if they aren't necessarily based in reason or fact. Which I think is part of why I'm finding the button so interesting, because it's become a small-scale version of how, faced against certain death (or the end of the timer), people form beliefs and commingle with others who share the same beliefs to make themselves feel better about it.  edit: ^ that's probably me getting too caught up in it again, but like I said, I find it very interesting, and a bit confusing still too."

Ok so now imagine another guy responds ""no the t64 is crap, the Sherman was lighter, faster and cheaper to produce which meant more could be brought online more quickly. Thus while the t64 may be a better machine in a sense, considering all that makes a tank effective by the criteria of how it functions in context of production, logistics as well as a war theater deployment, the Sherman was far superior.""  Now imagine the identifying words were programmatically stripped from the conversation and replaced with consistent but completely different signifiers.  You'd have   ""Gabergewalishesikes were the most quality all round machines to be mass produced in the history of the world.""  ""no the Gabergewalishesikes is crap, the murwikaliwhap was lighter, faster and cheaper to produce which meant more could be brought online more quickly.

TheoryOfReddit,30zolh,picflute,5,Thu Apr 2 23:43:12 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting case. It's unique in that I can't think of another instance where a gaming community is carried almost completely by its subreddit. I don't play every game, so I'm sure someone will give me an example, but can any match the magnitude of League of Legends?   Riot realized very early on that the best way to disseminate information to their players was through Reddit. As they did this, more people joined the community. Repeat this over many years and you have the current situation. I'm sure you know this since you seem to be an avid subscriber, but for anyone unfamiliar..  I wonder how many people view the league forums compared to how many people check the subreddit. I don't know the answer to that, but I do know that the League forums were redesigned to look exactly like Reddit. That has to tell us something. Perhaps it's that Riot wants the traffic on their side, but they can't get it. It's too late. I'm not even sure Riot had forums until a year or more in. They waited too long and interacted too much on Reddit for a substantial community to form on their side. Why go to Riot if you can get the same info on a site you already use?  That's the stage. That's the problem. If Riot can't get the traffic, why shouldn't they work with the current mod team to get information out? Take the new NURF game mode as an example. If Riot only announced it on their forums it is certain someone would have submitted it. If this happened every time, though, there would be open complaints. ""Riot, please submit changes to the subreddit. RITO PLZ"" every single day until it happened. The community has already formed around this. It's too late.  I do see your point about the swag, but I also notice how big the subreddit has gotten. The mods do a ton of work, and Riot gives out goodies all the time. After all, these people dedicate much of their free time to the game. Why wouldn't the company want to show its appreciation? This is the subreddit of a for-profit company after all. To say it's underhanded is to miss the entire point of the sub. It's about making money. It always has been. As long as it's a furry Porro or a teemo hat I think we're good. If it becomes cars or houses or hard cash then I think we can worry.  Which may bring you to the NDA...I don't even know. That's a tough one. When Riot says, ""hey we want to get information out about x game mode,"" I guess they want to make sure the mods don't leak it early. However, like everything else in this post I'm speculating. Since it precludes them speaking, we can't know. That's a bummer, but what reason do we have to think it's bad? We can't know, but why not air on the side of positive?"
TheoryOfReddit,30zolh,telestrial,2,Wed Apr 1 06:39:02 2015 UTC,"A recent very active mod quit the subreddit after the story broke.  I've seen reports that he himself was doing 40-50% of the work of moderating.  Many of the mods on the subreddit are inactive, only about  6-7 mods do the majority of the work."
TheoryOfReddit,30zolh,picflute,1 point,Wed Apr 1 10:44:35 2015 UTC,"Like I get you're trying to stay ""neutral"" about this topic but at least read the actual posts.

KT Left because he was overworked but he still loved the community and did a lot to make it better. KT was the most transparent mod the team had.   And again this   Many of the mods on the subreddit are inactive   Is just not true. Like at least research your facts. Posting!=Activity. There's a lot you just didn't cover in your post."
TheoryOfReddit,30zolh,kamikazplatypus,3,Fri Apr 3 07:21:03 2015 UTC,"I would like to reiterate that I tried to remain neutral,  I'm sure there were areas where I was not as neutral as I could've been, but that was not due to lack of effort, but likely due to oversight and human error.  I do not believe it is misinformative nor insincere to state that I did try to remain as neutral as possible.  Any discussion over whether I succeeded in remaining neutral and to what degree largely lies outside of the realms of the purpose and the main topic of the post which is the most important part.  Secondly, since you are a mod of the subreddit being discussed, /r/leagueoflegends, I think it would be appropriate for transparency to put a small disclaimer or brief mention of such, just so other people of the subreddit who do not know you are a mod of the subreddit to know that, and also be able to weigh your words against that backdrop.    Next, your comment to me does not answer questions the post presented and the main topic it was about, the main topic being in the title of the post.  Instead your comment is mostly direct attacks against my reading knowledge and the information I had seen.  The information I had seen said that most of the mods are inactive.  I do understand that I presented no direct evidence to that fact, but neither did you present any direct evidence to the contrary, so it is simply a he said, she said argument with no solid evidence one way or the other about that particular point.    Unfortunately, the direct attacks towards me have derailed the post somewhat and detracted from the topic as I felt I needed to defend myself somewhat and explain my intentions more clearly, but by and by I simply wanted this to be a discussion about the topic and questions I presented which is why I asked an open ended question in the topic.  It's not supposed to have a right or wrong answer necessarily.  Lastly, instead of directly attacking my reading comprehension skills or the information I saw,  I think it would have been really great if you had simply answered the questions my post posed and explained in detail why you thought those things.  Also, if you had evidence that was directly in conflict with what I presented, then by all means show any evidence yourself that goes against what I presented.  That would have been a very powerful way for you to prove your point.  I find it rather unfortunate that your first reaction was to just personally attack certain aspects about myself and ignore the overarching theme and questions asked by the post."

TheoryOfReddit,30zolh,moush,4,Wed Apr 1 00:21:42 2015 UTC,I think there are benefits to having a community manager from the game as a subreddit mod. Means more access to the games company. As long as they don't try and run it like they run their main forum. However it should be disclosed and the mod should be tagged as a games company employee.  As someone who works for games companies (not the ones that run the game who's sub I mod) I have a strong belief in keeping the lines of communication as open as possible so that CMs can better serve their communities.   However one thing that is important is that the games company employee is not able to take any action against players for anything they say on the subreddit.
TheoryOfReddit,30zolh,Amonette2012,2,Wed Apr 1 13:44:12 2015 UTC,At least then it's in the open about who their loyalties are to.  The problem is mods pretending to be impartial when it's obvious they're not.  They get to hide behind anonymity on reddit.

Plus, someone who may be interested in modding such a large community for a product probably may also be interest in working for the company who makes this product.  If a company wanted to hire someone and had to decide between Joe Schmoe versus the guy who runs a large community dedicated to the product, it would be no contest who the company would hire."

This can be done via special flair. I know /r/Planetside /r/H1Z1, and /r/SimCity are a few of the many gaming subs that provide user flair for studio employees. It's often been said that /r/Planetside is the unofficial official forums for PS2 since the devs are more likely to engage with the subreddit than the official official forums!   However one thing that is important is that the games company employee is not able to take any action against players for anything they say on the subreddit.   I'm guessing that most subreddits, especially for games that have been around for a while, are fan-created. It serves as a place for fans/users to celebrate the game. Of course, it's usually used for bitching about the game, outside any official forums where moderation may be a little more heavy-handed.  And that's where the problem lies. No one polices the moderators. Moderators effectively own their respective subreddits. So assuming I'm a CM, and my boss tells me to remove all the negative comments on the subreddit or else I'm canned, what am I most likely going to do?"

TheoryOfReddit,30zolh,johnnybigoode,2,Wed Apr 1 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"As long as they disclose the relationship I think it's alright. Someone can always go and create a non corporate league of legends sub. Not being transparent about the fact that they are basically doing PR work for riot is a problem though.   I have always wondered how this sort of thing doesn't fall under vote manipulation though. If a company payed 20 people to go around and instantly downvote any post that made their company look bad you'd be breaking reddit rules. If they pay the mods to instantly delete any post in their subreddit that makes their company look bad it's ok. Seems like a double standard, also sets up a system where larger corporate entities have an advantage over smaller businesses trying to promote their product since buying out a lot of the mods would cost far more than hiring random ip's to upvote your product.

The community never knew any of the information beforehand.  The mods of the subreddit have long been criticized for not following their own rules the same for everyone and holding everyone to the same standards.  Some repeat posters are allowed to break the sidebar rules of the subreddit, while others are not and get their content taken down for breaking the same rules.  But the community never knew that Riot was working directly with the mod team and influencing some of their decisions.  Also an NDA agreement being in place is pretty much antithetical to promoting transparency from the mods.  An NDA is much better used to obfuscate rather than promote transparency."

So long as its clear what the relationship is between the mods and the companies or products that the subreddit is focused on, it shouldn't be an issue.

Are we supposed to take your version at face value, and talk general moderating philosophy?    Here is a better recap of what occurred if you want a quick overview.    The NDA was an optional, personal NDA between individual mod members and Riot - so that those members were able to access Riot's internal tech support Skype chat so they could get accelerated server status updates from the people responsible for maintaining them.  Except the tech people are obviously not also PR, and might leak something by mistake. The mod teams' participation in the NDA has been specifically cleared by Admin.  The ""journalist"" was Richard Lewis, who had been banned less than a week prior after an extensive history of atrocious behavior in the community, up to and including threatening to drop dox on mod team members in order to avoid discipline and digging up someone's past post about suicidal ideation just for a little extra character assassination ammunition.

I asked clear questions which your comment never attempted to answer and which was the main point of the post.  Should mods be allowed to work directly and be influenced by a company for PR purposes or should mods stay true to the desires of their community first?  Should conflicts of interest be allowed to exist between mods and companies within reddit?

I mean, even a cursory interest in ""balance"" would have included the parallel narratives from /r/leagueoflegends.     In fact, I never presented my own opinion,   Uh, lol.  Actually, you presented lots of opinion.     ""All of these things are a clear conflict of interest, and reddit has the rule that a company can not pay mods to do PR work, but it seems being paid in company swag and signing of NDA agreements by the company are overlooked by reddit staff.""   All of these things are not ""clear conflict of interest"" especially if you even half-assed your attempt to explore the space between Lewis' ""journalism"" and what actually occurrs in /league and between its mods and Riot.  Reddit does not have a ""rule that a company can not pay mods to do PR work"" - the two relevant rules are very clearly ""cannot recieve compensation for moderation work"" and ""cannot engage deals on behalf of Reddit as a whole or /r/leagueoflegends as a whole"".  And the signing of the NDA has not only not been overlooked by reddit staff, but specifically cleared by them.   You wrote directly hyperbolic statements such as ""extensive history of atrocious behavior, without even attempting to give evidence and accurate context to your accusations.   I take it you have an aversion to clicking links?  Because the evidence is all through the links provided in my initial post.  It's really hard to check the evidence, even if it's clearly supplied, if you're unwilling to click through and read it.     My post was mostly a series of questions with background information    Except your background information is entirely based on the story told by the guy having a very public temper tantrum about being banned.  If all the shit he claims happened actually happened the way he claims it did, then maybe you could claim ""just asking questions"" but when you're solely trying to sell Lewis' narrative like it's an unbiased ""evidence"" is not just disingenuous, but downright intentionally misleading.    ""Oh, I'm so innocent, just asking questions...""  If you weren't trying to sell a specific version, why you so upset at being corrected?  More, why are you taking everything Lewis says as gospel without even checking if there's more at play?  All of your questions are assuming Lewis is not only telling the truth, but his interpretations themselves are similarly factual.     Should mods be allowed to work directly and be influenced by a company for PR purposes or should mods stay true to the desires of their community first?   Assuming you don't mean ""outside of their mod role"", probably not.  But none of those things are actually occuring in the community you're accusing, so it's a moot point, ain't it?     Should conflicts of interest be allowed to exist between mods and companies within reddit?   It's inevitable.  It should be controlled and dealt with carefully, but it is inevitable.     Should such conflict of interests be allowed between mods and companies who are influencing the decisions of some mods or should there exist clear boundaries and the mods should care first and foremost about the desires of the community members rather than company interests?   This is your ""just asking questions"" ...  Such conflicts of interest don't exist.  Some measure of influence is inevitable when a community exists as fans of a product.  There do exist boundaries, mods do care first and foremost about community members.    I mean, RL sells this as /lol enforcing Riot's will when it's actually removing a scam that targets community members and could wind up costing them their accounts.     simply not understanding of the purpose of post.   I think I understand the ""purpose of post"" just fine.  Edit: You get what I mean."

It's a bit of a grey area since accessing the sites isn't illegal nor is providing a link to access said sites. The potentially illegal part comes in if they were to allow direct links to vendor pages.   Then they could possibly have some trouble. But considering how many drug forums there are, I'd be surprised if anything were to directly come against the subreddit.   Even if it were to be shut down it wouldn't do anything.

When those communities are linked to bestof, it runs completely counter to the subreddit's purpose.  The NoFap/Katie incident is a perfect example.  It's no secret that Reddit as a whole loves porn, but here we have a community that is intended to support people who are struggling with porn use.  When it was linked to bestof, it was flooded with people mocking NoFap users, downvoting their comments by the hundreds.  Even the bestof mods have acknowledged that things like that are a problem and encourage people to report it to them so they can remove threads that get out of hand."
TheoryOfReddit,30iuwq,oldsystemlodgment,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"This is really working under the premise that communities who intend to be echochambers (in the sense they are for like-minded individuals and don't want contrasting opinions) are a good thing and that their self-selected exclusivity ought to be respected.  I'm not sure I agree that this is always the case. If you want to benefit from the exposure and infrastructure that is Reddit, then you have to also take the community of Reddit - the whole community, not just the parts that you want. Otherwise, feel free to start another site altogether, or make the sub a closed/private sub.  I mean, I don't think that anyone believes the kind of atmosphere in /GreatApes or /TRP is a good thing, but it's the same forces at work there that you're supporting when you say to respect the 'community' of Nofap for example."
TheoryOfReddit,30iuwq,Shaper_pmp,16,Sun Apr 12 06:19:10 2015 UTC,"The part you're missing is that reddit is no longer really a community in any meaningful sense - ever since subreddits came along it's really a platform for creating communities in.  The whole point of subreddits is that they can (in fact are intended to) form wildly diverse communities wholly different from the ""average"" reddit default, to allow people to find others and construct different social environments without constantly being held to the tyranny of the majority.  This works fine until someone links to a post in a community from outside that community - then you get a bunch of outsiders flooding in, disrupting and drowning out the actual community. It's a direct violation of the entire purpose of subreddits - a sudden, forcible invasion of a community by motivated outsiders attempting to force the discourse back towards reddit's average values and attitudes, instead of a voluntary sorting of users into like-minded groups.  It's conceptually no different to a group from another website raiding reddit and shitting up the place by causing trouble and trying to impose their values on the community, who have a moral right to gather there without being harassed and disrupted by outsiders."

By that logic all small towns are one community because the members of one have access to all the others, and all churches are one community because the member of one can walk into any other.  Community is delineated by shared values and identity, not locks and fences. Claiming that /r/truereddit and /r/f7u12 are the ""same community"" merely because individuals can move freely between them reduces the term ""community"" to something akin to ""closed-border state"".   There is no such right. Against harassment? Definitely. Against opposing opinions? Hardly.   You're trying hard to pick a fight, but you're wrestling a straw man.  I never said a community has a moral right not to ever hear dissent.  I said they had a right to meet and interact without being swamped and prevented from doing so by an organised mob of outsiders who shout down and drown out the community so they can't reasonably meet and interact, and that definitely falls under the umbrella of ""harassment""."

But if you're holding a discussion in a public place that's open to the public, you don't have a right that other members of the public can't join in.

Well... yeah.  It's a spectrum rather than a binary either/or, but someone who is a loner and avoids socialising or identifying as part of a community is by definition less a part of that community than someone who identifies with and/or socialises with other members of the community.  That's kind of what community means, isn't it? :-p   All I'm saying is that a community can have internal dissenting views. Just because your views are different doesn't necessarily make you ""not part of that community.""   Absolutely, yes.  As I've said several times, dissent within a community is perfectly reasonable.  The issue is when large groups of people from outside the community with dissenting views try to invade and disrupt the community, that's not fair or right.   But you're defining a lot of dissenting voices as ""harassment and disruption"", so by your definition you can't have a large number of dissenting voices because that would be, in and of itself, harassment and disruption.   Not really - if you don't hang out in a subreddit or club, don't identify with the other people who do and disagree with pretty much every consensus belief of the club's membership, and then you decide to invade with a lot of friends with the result that you disrupt and prevent the members from meeting and discussing issues, then yeah - you're harassing and disrupting the club.  If you identify as part of the club and spend time there and disagree with some of the consensus beliefs, of course that's not harassment - it's just internal dissent.  If approximately half the club hold beliefs diametrically opposed to the other half, but both halves identify as part of the club and spend time socialising with others in that context, then the club has no meaningful overall consensus, and/or it's actually just two different communities confusingly sharing the same name, with neither exercising any more moral right to the location or name than the other.  The issue is not - and never has been - about dissent within a community.  It's about large groups of people who are not (and do not identify as) members of a community by any meaningful definition invading and disrupting that community.  Even individual visitors can dissent without it being a serious problem (in fact, I'd argue it's often a valuable and essential ingredient in avoiding the group falling prey to groupthink and circle-jerking), but when a large, cohesive group invades with the intentional (or merely emergent) result that they make normal discussion and the normal operation of that community impossible, I think that's morally wrong.   Is there a quota for how many dissenting voices a community can choose to allow before it turns into harassment entitling the community to block and ban every other dissenting voice?   That's the hard question, but it's not actually a counterargument (it would arguably be a continuum fallacy if presented as one).  Just because I can't reasonably point to a specific dividing line where ""one dyed-in-the-wool member of a community with one dissenting opinion"" turns into ""a thousand inveterate culture warriors from a different community vehemently opposed to everything a community stands for invading that community with the intent of disrupting it and shouting down its members"" doesn't mean that there's no difference between the two extremes - it just means a continuum of possibilities exists between them, and exactly where you draw the line is a judgement call depending on your personal beliefs and the specific situation under consideration."
TheoryOfReddit,30iuwq,creesch,13,Mon Apr 13 11:53:27 2015 UTC,"/r/bestof tends to destroy threads since people come barging in like rude tourists that don't realize they are visiting. The other way around sometimes works as well, someone that ""lost"" an argument but was still in healthy discussion positive numbers going into a deep negative score.   It is really disheartening to see people from subs like bestof behave that without any regard for the community of the sub they are effectively visiting. Even more so because it completely destroys the original structure of the conversation as it was originally linked to bestof.  In that regard, I honestly think that /r/bestof and reddit would be better of if you could only link to archived comments and posts. Which would be a lot closer to what /r/bestof set out to be, a subreddit about great comments that otherwise would not have been seen.

I'm still getting messages from creeps asking me for nudes, more information about myself, and generally weird requests.   It seems now that anytime I make a post or comment somewhere, someone goes through my posting history, and feels the need to message me about it, which does get on my nerves.

No one cares about the crap I say!""  Secondly, why should this point be sufficient to say to someone ""your opinion does not matter to this particular situation""? Everyone's opinion should matter as that is how the site is set up. People are encouraged to get involved and speak their minds. To create a situation where we merely observe feels counterproductive. It's like slowing down to observe the remains of a nasty train wreck. It's pointless and self-serving. Its no different than Youtube comments on a video of someone getting their ass kicked in a fight. We do it merely to fluff ourselves up.  That said, if the issue merely keeping voting from getting out of control without meaningful participation, i.e. commenting, then there should be a system in place to exercise that option:  In order to vote in this thread, you must comment. Your vote can only be applied to the comment or post you are responding to.  By enforcing an option like this, you create a very positive situation. People contribute to the content of the thread and people can according to what they feel is relevant. It would severely reduce brigading as it would force people to make an effort to comment and then vote. Bots couldn't step in and vote, skewing the numbers.  This isn't to say that someone couldn't find a way to abuse the system, but in any system like this there will always be abuse. Why should we let that ruin everyone's ability to provide input just to avoid...what exactly? Needless downvoting / upvoting? Considering that karma has no inherent value, cannot be traded, sold, exchanged, or otherwise used as a currency in any form, if someone decides to be an asshat and post something disagreeable, is it not the nature of karma that they reap what they sow?"

At some point it simply becomes not fair that just because you disagree with a community ten times your size - that you can't continue to operate without getting stomped on.   ""omg who cares though!""  there are plenty of groups on this site that would gladly create a meta-army to purposefully alter another community due to their opinions.  It already happens. It's already a problem.  It's really really really really hard to deal with as it is and now you want even less barriers.   All of this gets into the current limits of reddit as a platform, limits of how reddit operates, reddit rules, , how they're interpreted, etc. The meta-community issue has been a problem for a long time and one that has yet to be reckoned with.

We were very careful to implement embeds specifically so that we can't tie your browsing habits to your reddit account, even though it would have been faster, cleaner, and easier technically to do otherwise. This is why, if you look at the network requests on a page with an embedded comment, you'll see they go to redditmedia.com and redditstatic.com, which can't access your reddit.com cookie - this is by design."
TheoryOfReddit,30488z,go1dfish,15,Tue Mar 24 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"redditmedia.com also gets loaded from any reddit.com page, so redditmedia.com (and it may be anonymous) will know that you've visited a reddit page and a washingtonpost.com embedded content (for example).  And I'd have assumed that all your processing of data would be completely anonymous anyway (as it should be).  From redditmedia.com you could serve specific adverts to a specific subset of users as they browse reddit (I'm not saying you will, but you could).  It doesn't need to be tied into the user id (normal remarketing would never be either).  I'd be much happier if the rules of personal data were set up based on processing and rules about what you can and can't do with that data rather than jumping through hoops about how you collect it.  But I also understand that we have a much stronger data protection laws here in the UK than you have in the US, so you're much happier going with the not collecting approach where European firms would collect the data and then have limitations on how they could use it."
TheoryOfReddit,30488z,2015goodyear,7,Tue Mar 24 17:23:16 2015 UTC,Not collecting has some significant benefits in the US where the government can potentially compel the release of ANY data that reddit collects.

So... like, did you ask the admins if they're doing this, or are you just assuming because moneyseotrackingNSAcookieswatchout?  You can read the beautified JS used for 'rembeddit' here. Nothing in that seems to even reference cookies.   You might notice the '_anonymousPixelTrackingUrl' bit though. That's not even called.   I beautified the script, did some debugging and couldn't get it to raise. So I added some simple console log functions to just show me the value of those. again; this section never gets raised; it's junk.  Now, if you click a link on that embedded output, it will direct you to an in-between step and I'm quite certain reddit is tracking where its hits come from. But that is a far cry from what you're asserting they're doing, which is just casually looking over the shoulder of the user and seeing what else they're reading.   Now if you use a cookie manager you might notice a few cookies from .redditmedia.com: These are CloudFlare cookies, and they're used on any website which utilizes CloudFlare, as reddit does.   In this modern day of privacy concerns, I really wish people would be less assuming about this kind of thing and just go look at the code.   It took you less than 30 seconds to assert that A) Admins are doing something they didn't tell us and B) it's meant to spy on us.

But that isn't to say it isn't possible When you are logged in to Reddit.com and you load content from redditmedia.com (which you do on most pages) you are passing a cookie id to redditmedia.com.  The content in the embed gets loaded from redditmedia.com.  When the content is loaded the value of the cookie is passed across.  It's not hard to see that you could combine the two data sets (if they are even two different data sets) to be able to tell you what a user who has viewed embedded content has also viewed on reddit.  What then happens to that is a completely different matter - it can be ignored, thrown away, stripped out of log files before they're stored, turned into a ascii cat or passed into the advertising system to throw up an advert that is specific to that subset of users.  Just because it doesn't explicitly pass the ID of the user doesn't mean that it couldn't be gathered afterwards by linking up different data sets (if you even need to do that) If you are not logged in, it drops a cookie from redditmedia.com at the moment (but it is an externally hosted piece of JavaScript so they could easily change that), but it would be a third party cookie at that point anyway, so would be blocked by many browsers I'm not a developer, nor do I ever claim to be one"

Lol, I'm doing exactly what you're saying. The problem is that threads become too big and have too many sub discussions so you don't have a stream of discussion that everyone can talk amongst. Reddit's creators believe that threads are good because it allows people to talk more clearly with each other and bring up important discussion topics quickly, but all it really does it homogenize discussion so that everything is repeated all the time, and the ""newfags"" remain new (not knowing how to lurk). Even though a traditional stream of comments is ""less"" efficient, it at least lets people observe what is happening instead of shitting into the gutter and posting everywhere haphazardly, with karma points bolstering often vague opinions (as you mentioned) instead of people learning how to belay in a discussion.   Talking about politicians...the thread comment system works the same way in simplifying topics so they don't have to be too invested in the discussion. This attracts a lot of people who are accused by some redditors as not knowing what they are doing because they don't follow by the rules of the subreddit or never learn how to not be another sheep that blindly follows the upvotes. This becomes even worse because comments are hidden easily by a mass of downvotes which additionally change people's opinions reading these comments just because they more easily associate downvotes with a bad comment."

When you do require additional detail, sometimes it's better to be vague or not say anything and let the comments possibly continue on their own, or make your affirmation more open ended so you aren't attacked by downvotes or other comments that people read which concludes with people downvoting you, which has a negative reaction of future people reading your post with possible less trust or even your post being hidden.

TheoryOfReddit,2zy7sd,rosecenter,3,Mon Mar 23 14:55:00 2015 UTC,"We've all got a lot of social filters we apply around others and they're complicated and distinct.  What we'd say in front of our parents, one of our (possibly several) circles of friends, business associates, in front of an audience on a stage, around children, etc. would employ different language patterns.  This is something fairly well established in linguistics.  I think what you're really observing is an outgrowth of how we learn to work with anonymity.  Reddit permits you to express that inner monologue, completely unfiltered, if you so desire.  However, anyone quickly finds that there isn't really anything ""unfiltered"" about any established user of the site.  Sure, at first they'll say some things that cut against Reddit's own culture and be punished with downvotes for it.  What they then do is begin to naturally adapt their set of filters for the new distinct subgroup of people they're now learning to communicate with.  This is certainly subconscious for most people - we've become experts at it through repeated retraining of our filters.  You and I know nothing about one another, but we can engage in a conversation publicly that might normally fall into our filters for what we might talk about with close friends.  However, we are occasionally and shockingly reminded that our conversation isn't private at all (by votes) and that we should be using our ""out in public"" filter a bit more.  So, what I think we get is some gray area that lets us express ourselves in a more intimate way, but more ""safely"" in public.  It's kind of like the hushed tone you take and the careful adjustment of phrasing and word selection you employ when out with friends at a restaurant.  You can joke around with them in ways that may be perfectly normal in your social circle, but might offend others who might overhear."
TheoryOfReddit,2zy7sd,coahman,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:06:07 2015 UTC,"upvotes/downvotes create a reward system that ""trains"" you as you use reddit more ... it's like a subconscious effort to get widespread appeal.   This concept is the backbone of several methods of mathematically modelling social systems (whether bees or ants or humans). Basically, each individual samples a random place (posts a comment), then everybody checks to see what what everybody's scores were. The next sample is now partially random and partially directed toward the highest score of the previous round. Repeat a few times, and you get a literal 'hivemind' around the optimal scores.  The parameters of the algorithm are reproducing the 'culture' of the population. Pretty cool stuff. This algorithm has also been extended to optimize general mathematical spaces.

TheoryOfReddit,2zy7sd,Warlizard,5,Mon Mar 30 10:51:53 2015 UTC,"Conversely, there are posts that are recognized specifically for their ability to be insightful and useful. Check out /r/DepthHub for examples of this (one of my favorite subs).   I think it has more to do with the fact that the vast majority of users who browse reddit are younger kids/teenagers who are skimming comments. The shorter and more generalized comments get a quick read and upvote. In depth comments, while certainly more polarizing, tend to be skipped if there isn't a TLDR. I think it's simply to do with the userbase of (maybe the wrong word here) immature or less critical thinkers who dislike having their existing schisms challenged far outweighing the userbase of older and less opinionated redditors.   Generalized comments also open the door for more responses, thus generating more positive attention. Others feel they can weigh in to add to the comment, or subtract, etc.   I believe this will also vary greatly when you venture further away from default subs."
TheoryOfReddit,2zy7sd,clang_ley,4,Mon Mar 23 06:07:55 2015 UTC,"Generalized comments also open the door for more responses, thus generating more positive attention.    I don't agree with this. A generalized comment might receive more replies, but it will not attract more attention. I'm not sure that even makes sense. A comment will receive the attention of those who seek to read or skim through enough commentary. Whether or not someone views a specific comment is, for the lack of a better word, random. It completely depends on how far said reader decides to look and if said reader decides to read a said comment."
TheoryOfReddit,2zy7sd,Warlizard,5,Mon Mar 23 10:53:42 2015 UTC,"I know that personally I'm guilty of using comment sections for validation too. For example, I see an article or picture posted, I have a specific thought about it. So out of curiosity I pop into the comment section to see if the top comment is similar to what I was thinking, even though the mere fact that it was the first thing I thought of is evidence that it's likely a very common reaction.  So when broad language is used, more people will identify with the post as being similar to their own thinking (even if it really wasn't), and upvote the comment for visibility.  It's just straight up manipulation, if you think about it."

Anyone in public speaking is taught the same thing - the more specific you get on controversial subjects, the more you are opening up yourself to criticism.    The average person is terrible at keeping an open mind.  When confronted with an opinion that runs contrary to their beliefs, instead of embracing the possibility of changing their mind, they are instead going to try to challenge the speaker to protect their own precious belief system.    When points are kept more vague and general, it provides room for the listener to contemplate an outside opinion while simultaneously remaining steadfast in their own belief system, because there is no direct conflict.  Basically, people tend to be egocentric, and the bigger the group, the more average to below average people you're going to have in it.

You observed a dynamic of social systems that has far-reaching implications. It is applicable not just to Reddit, of course, and also not just to politics, but to ideology in general. Sounds like you would be interested in Slavoj Zizek's movie ""The Pervert's Guide to Ideology"" (its on Netflix). One of his points is exactly this:  (To paraphrase) Ideology is never just meaning (the specifics of what was said), it has to serve as an empty container which each subject can fill with whatever meaning they want.

We wondered if the mainstreaming of Reddit will have any effect on the general level of discourse/rhetoric, especially in young people.  Votes on comments are like grades, fast and definite feedback showing how effective your post was at achieving its goal.  If you were trying to be clever/funny/whatever you find out quickly if you were successful and can improve on your attempts iteratively.  Does this help the ability of a small percentage of a generation to make and defend points since it's such an efficient way of learning what works or what doesn't?  Or is it just enforcing to the same people that long, thought-out points are not often worthwhile compared to a quick quip?"

The conclusion in particular is basically identical to what I've already heard from Christopher Poole (founder of 4chan) concerning anonymized communication. I suppose it's a nice summary of ideas, but I found little other value from it.

What I wanted to see: in addition to interview responses, to what degree was there agreement of the responses. If one person says ""It feels more legitimate if I cite that it’s a publication instead of people talking on the internet,"" do the others agree? Or is this opinion an outlier? What was the full range of responses?  Additionally, if the authors are picking and choosing which responses to discuss in the paper, to what degree do the authors' opinions shape the conclusions of the paper? Is there a more impartial way of collecting and presenting this information?  Someone else replied to me that qualitative studies are a prerequisite to quantitative studies... is this because qualitative studies inform survey design? Given the nature of bias and such, what is the established way of getting as-unbiased-as-possible, as-objectively-true-as-possible data?  Of course I'm biased by posts made to this subreddit where someone runs a script to collect data in an automatic, unbiased way, then similarly designs automatic, unbiased metrics for ascertaining something about that data. This is the sort of thing I expected. ""Never mind what people say, what does real data tell us?"" This is where I was coming from with my remarks."
TheoryOfReddit,2zxcas,damn_it_so_much,2,Mon Mar 23 04:19:08 2015 UTC,"I think you give quantitative work too much credit for being unbiased.   Collecting data has a lot of bias; the person doing the study has to choose some subsets of the data, then how to filter it, what to look at, etc. For example, I can say ""I studied commenting in the top 200 subreddits"". How do I measure a top subreddit? By posting? By subscribers? How do you collect the comments? Is it the top 500 comments according to score? Is it the top 500 according to time? etc.   Any time where someone introduces a metric, there's a bias going on (particularly when its a non-standard metric). Why this metric as opposed to another one? Does this metric really mean anything? The recent post describing how someone measured a subreddit's toxicity (link: http://idibon.com/toxicity-in-reddit-communities-a-journey-to-the-darkest-depths-of-the-interwebs/) is a good example. There are biases in how they measure what is a toxic word, what's a racist word, etc.   In all cases, these choices are made. Sure, I can easily state them and you can ""remove"" some bias but I didn't do some analysis to show how my results might have changed if I had done some other method of data collection.   To your point of ""should I believe what's in the paper"" (mentioned below), I don't think its a matter of qualitative vs quantitative. You can deceive easily with either approach, so judge it on other metrics (like did the authors seem to explore counterfactuals, acknowledge points that dont directly support their thesis, etc)."
TheoryOfReddit,2zxcas,thisaintnogame,14,Mon Mar 23 16:51:19 2015 UTC,Hence why it was called a qualitative study. Qualitative designs are still valuable research. The next step would be to quantify the findings at scale.

TheoryOfReddit,2zxcas,damn_it_so_much,5,Mon Mar 23 04:25:40 2015 UTC,One thing that immediately comes to mind is to pilot test instruments... how do you know what your asking means the same to you as it does your subjects? Do a few focus groups about the your research question -- things will come up that you never thought of.   This way you don't blow your budget by sending out a survey that asks a question nobody understands.   What /u/alexleavitt did a good example of a mixed methods approach.

Nowadays reddit, when browsed anonymously, is appealing to people that like low-effort pictures, memes and tabloid headlines.  Reddit is no longer the sort of place that is attractive (at first glance) to the users that have been here the longest, and the accelerated increase in users attracted by content that is unappealing to that sort of person leads to a dwindling engagement (and increased marginalisation) of that demographic.   I no longer find reddit to be a place where I accidentally stumble across something interesting from outside my normal interests, and more a place where I regularly hit a couple of specific subreddits for news or updates on my current interests."

Then you could submit a new post that would link to it's own URL if you timed it right. After a flood of people trying to make posts that linked to themselves they just added the self-post officially.

There may be many people on reddit who do not appreciate the pioneer nature of the original community (damn kids).    But at the same time, it is very important to point out that whatever new thing reddit is becoming, (reddit is changing, there is no doubt about it) the new reddit will still be based on the foundational principles set up by it's founders and pioneers. These things include philosophy on the role of free expression on the internet, reddiquette that has seeped onto many other platforms of social internet experiences, and a specific brand of inside humor.    There will always be a group that will say that reddit is only becoming worse off than what is was 1-4 years ago, but at the same time, for newer users, this space is the coolest thing they've ever experienced, and evolving ideas will ultimately assist in both introducing shitty concepts, and weeding out poor aspects of the old way of doing things, and introduce new methods of promoting the principles reddit was founded on."

We've all heard that the anonymity that reddit provides often can act as a mask, and through the use of a mask, people are able to show their true selves. This includes people's ideas, as racist, homophobic, prejudiced, or bigoted as they may be. reddit then acts as a platform for these ideas to be voiced.   I think though, that once these ideas can be brought into the light and into a wider context, their airing out shows their faults. With any poor idea, the more exposure it gets, the hope would be that it loses its validity and place in a modern society. In real life, people are often contained by geography, and social standards and experiences are limited to such a geography, which may be the thriving metropolis of New York City, or it could be a town of 3,000 white people in Alabama who all attend the same 10 bible belt churches.    For both groups of people, city slickers and country folk, reddit acts a platform for meeting new ideas and cultures that a farm boy from alabama would never come into contact with apart from reddit. If all he hears is his 90 year old grandfather talk about gay people or non-white people and never experience being with those people himself, he will never change his opinion.    reddit enables such a person to get exposure to the outside world, and while an argument could be made that racist or prejudiced people find each other on reddit and make communities around their hateful beliefs, thereby perpetuating a hateful ideology, I would argue that a larger majority of people, and the community at large, benefits from the exposure of differences in conversations on larger subreddits, because change comes through ideas being challenged, not through closed minded people keeping silent.

They get off on the idea of causing as much misery as possible to as many people as possible. These people are not going to engage in good-faith debate or discussion, nor will they have their minds changed: they're just here to cause pain.  Consider that, even if the targeted person ""wins"" the argument, the experience of having to justify your own personhood is profoundly unpleasant. Conversely, the trolls can't lose the argument: they might not have attained the ultimate victory of singlehandedly forcing someone off the site, but they caused discomfort and anger and consternation, and that's usually mission-accomplished.  In that manner, unless concrete steps are taken to limit and eliminate trolling and to enshrine respect for marginalized groups, the trolls are inevitably going to win: unless you are a Default Person (straight white western heterosexual cisdude) who subscribes to the Default Opinions of Reddit (self-identifying as ""progressive"" despite actually being deeply conservative), you simply become so unwelcome that no reasonable person would bother sticking around. (After all, no reasonable person has a bottomless reserve of ""please stop calling me a nigger"".)  If it were the case that Reddit was already open-minded and prepared to go to bat for marginalized groups, you might be onto something. But it isn't.  ""That's retarded.""  ""OP is a faggot.""  ""Go back to Tumblr you SJW bitch.""  ""Dude, that's fucking gay.""  And that's just the overt, every-thread-on-a-default-sub stuff. There's loads more insiduous and hidden stuff, to say nothing of /r/coontown or /r/fatpeoplehate or any of the other subreddits whose explicit and overt purpose is to spread hatred and derision of marginalized groups.  And all of that gets tolerated because people like you get all huffed up on this notion that Reddit is an open-minded marketplace of ideas which, by virtue of sunlight alone, will ultimately be purged of hatred.  It's a pleasant thought. It's also a delusion."

For some people sure, but those people have the option not to get into the argument in the first place. Reddit allows you to downvote and move on, you don't have to engage with the idiots.   And all of that gets tolerated because people like you get all huffed up on this notion that Reddit is an open-minded marketplace of ideas...   Reddit is an open-minded marketplace of ideas. I've seen reddit threads where absolutely racist bigoted shit gets upvoted to the top, and in another thread the completely opposite opinion is  being championed. The style and caliber of content is entirely dependent on the subreddits you expose yourself too.     unless you are a Default Person (straight white western heterosexual cisdude) who subscribes to the Default Opinions of Reddit (self-identifying as ""progressive"" despite actually being deeply conservative), you simply become so unwelcome that no reasonable person would bother sticking around.

I am a black, gay, liberal, social activist, and in the  nearly 3 years I've had an account on reddit I've never once been called a nigger or felt unwelcome.

Even though my opinion diverges from yours at some very critical junctions, I won't be compelled to answer to something that is clearly hateful and ignorant.   Just like I can't change the way people who I know irl think, you should only engage in discussion with people who are able to adjust their viewpoint if faced with facts.  It is true that inaction leads to ignorance, but if every little victory is a costly one, you are in fact detrimental to your cause. You are worth more than any little victory."
TheoryOfReddit,2zvccz,NemkeKira,0,Tue Mar 31 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"You don't have to win every battle.   See, here's the thing: to someone who encounters a forum which is permeated by things toxic and noxious to them, they don't get to ""choose their battles"". Choosing to be involved, at all, is necessarily going to be a battle. (And quite often the battles find them: ask a female user sometime about how many unsolicited angry PMs and dick pics she's received.)  It's fine and well to say ""Well, if it offends you so much, don't participate"", but at that point you're saying that you're okay with the forum being so toxic that it effectively excludes entire classes of people from participation.

I am sure that you realize that people are prejudiced by nature, and most have a difficult time admitting that the view they have is wrong, or flawed even. They default to flocking with like minded and aggressively defending their opinion.  I don't visit the defaults at all to be honest, but I can take your word for it, that the state of things IS in fact that bad. That is a problem, and I absolutely agree that something needs, actually HAS to be done about it. But the subs you listed above, my opinion is that those bastions of hate shouldn't be touched.

With that out of the way, let me become the voice of dissent.   That's extremely naive and privileged.   To be honest, this feels just like the name-calling you talk about latter in your post. It's certainly way more benign, but it feels like a rude way to start off a post, at least to me, it feels like you're saying ""hey looking at me I'm better than you and here's why"", mostly because that's the way I'd start off a post if I felt the same way. Might just be me though.   You're completely discounting the disempowering nature of racism, homophobia, sexism and transphobia. When a lesbian is made to argue about homophobia, or a woman about sexism, these people aren't arguing about abstract political ideas, they're arguing about themselves: about something extremely personal.   To be blunt, my opinion on this is that they should simply cope. People tend to identify with their opinions anyway, so any attack on their beliefs is interpreted as an attack on them. That's just a fact about the nature of argument; it was optimized as a method of signalling dominance, not a method of finding true facts.    I can argue with a person about sexism or race issues without  them thinking any less of me because of it, and if I can't, I don't have the argument in the first place. If I meet someone who will think less of me because I'm black, then I'll just stop talking to them. There isn't a universally convincing argument that you can give. As a rule of thumb: if you don't convince someone with one fell swoop, you aren't going to convince them any way. Another rule of thumb: if think you are exempt from the first one, you aren't.   And arguing about yourself is fucking exhausting.   Too true. I almost never lose my cool and the only times I come close are when I have to argue about myself for an extended period of time. It's magical how unreasonable anyone gets in the heat of debate.   unless you are a Default Person (straight white western heterosexual cisdude) who subscribes to the Default Opinions of Reddit (self-identifying as ""progressive"" despite actually being deeply conservative), you simply become so unwelcome that no reasonable person would bother sticking around. (After all, no reasonable person has a bottomless reserve of ""please stop calling me a nigger"".)If it were the case that Reddit was already open-minded and prepared to go to bat for marginalized groups, you might be onto something. But it isn't.     I want to say you are being unreasonably cynical, but I unsubbed to all of the defaults a long time ago. Are they really that bad?   ""That's retarded.""  ""OP is a faggot.""   There's nothing discriminatory about either of these. 'faggot' and 'retarded' are very disentangled with 'homosexual' and 'special needs'. Don't get me wrong, anyone saying either of those things is a instant downvote button for me, but they're doing nothing more harmful than a 12yo calling someone 'dickface'   ""Go back to Tumblr you SJW bitch.""   If it weren't for that 'SJW bitch' remark, this would be perfectly valid as a response, if it came packaged with a reasonable argument. There's nothing wrong with telling someone to fuck off if they threaten your forums culture in a non-constructive way. (if think 'every change isn't an improvement but every improvement is a change, the inverse also applies: 'even if every change isn't a degradation, every degradation is change'. Consider the difference between introducing fundamentalism to an atheist community as opposed to introducing, say, transhumanism"")   ""Dude, that's fucking gay.""   This is indefensible.   And that's just the overt, every-thread-on-a-default-sub stuff. There's loads more insiduous and hidden stuff, to say nothing of /r/coontown or /r/fatpeoplehate or any of the other subreddits whose explicit and overt purpose is to spread hatred and derision of marginalized groups.   /r/coontown is just a bunch of people who think because some people of a given skin color have certain failings, those failings must be because of their skin color.    /r/fatpeople hate is the same thing on the surface, but you need to think utilitarian: suppose you were fat in world where everyone disapproves of you because you were fat. Naturally you didn't want people to disapprove of you, so you start putting in effort to lose weight. People then stop disapproving of you..  This is the way it would be in an ideal world. There should be a social stigma on things you can change practically (being fat, being lazy, being uneducated, being xenophobic, etc.) but not on things you can't change (your skin tone, your intelligence (to the extent that it's genetically determined), etc.) nor on things you could change but should have to (your gender, your political beliefs, etc.). Although I don't think straight up hating the fat/lazy/uneducated/xenophobic/etc. is a good thing, since it's a product of their environment and not their inner self. I just think we should change the environment to influence the fat/lazy/uneducated into not being so. This is why I use words like 'disapprove of' and 'social stigma' to make my point instead of saying people should should straight up hate.      Any part of your post that I didn't comment on I agree wholeheartedly with.  Sorry for being so goddamn long-winded.    Edit: I just spent an hour writing this post. Never again."

That they should suck it up, and get over it, and move on with their lives. Furthermore, that they should not be discouraged or put off by this experience, and that anyone who does is weak and pathetic and should grow up.    But then you whip right around and contradict yourself. As you put it, when people insult you personally or question your personhood, you ""lose your cool"" and have to remove yourself from the situation because it's just too toxic for you to remain reasonable. Moreover, if someone insults you repeatedly, you leave the forum, because there's no point in continuing the discussion.    So which one is it?  You can't have it both ways.  Either it's reasonable for marginalized people to find these encounters toxic and unwelcoming and to ""lose their cool"" and respond emotionally, or they need to shut up and ""simply cope"" and get over it.  Well? You seem to be an expert on acceptable emotional reactions to personal abuse: go ahead and tell us how people should react.  (Spoiler alert: you can't. And if your response to people getting upset at being targeted is to give these tedious, masturbatory lectures on ""here's how you OUGHT to react to abuse, you pathetic weak things who need to grow up and learn to cope"", you're just pushing them even further away from the site, even as you say you want to include them.)

Part of the problem of writing a response over the course of an hour is that it's hard as hell to make sure everything is worded consistently.  Hopefully I didn't embarrass my self too much here.   As you put it, when a marginalized person gets called out and shamed for being fat, or black, or female, or trans*, you think the only acceptable response is:   That isn't the context I meant for that to be taken in. I was speaking under the assumption that they were discussing being a POC/LGBT/transperson/etc. as an abstract political issue but things turn sour because they're defending their selves and all the nastiness that entails.    You're completely discounting the disempowering nature of racism, homophobia, sexism and transphobia. When a lesbian is made to argue about homophobia, or a woman about sexism, these people aren't arguing about abstract political ideas, they're arguing about themselves: about something extremely personal. To be blunt, my opinion on this is that they should simply cope.    I wasn't thinking about someone being treated unfairly for stupid reasons. If that is the case, my opinion is that they should either change the subject or walk away because there rarely is any winning with someone like that.  My 'They should cope' comment was with regards to people attacking their beliefs and getting upset because they feel those beliefs are a apart of who they are, and therefore thinking that person is attacking their character.  I think you agree with me here. It rarely accomplishes anything to get upset in argument.   That they should suck it up, and get over it, and move on with their lives.   Yes. Unless there's a way to change their beliefs (And let's honest, if they are reasonable to change their minds after an argument, you wouldn't have this problem in the first place.)

When neo-nazi's and fringe far right groups are openly recruiting and changing a sub's narrative that is certainly a terrible thing. I'm not talking about subs like /r/niggers or the whole chimpire that are openly racist, I'm talking about videos, pics, worldnews, adviceanimals and many others. You have a bunch of younger people being exposed to literal stormfront mantras and they eat it up. These people specifically target threads and cordinate invasions through stromfront. There's an entire system they use called BUGS and people thinking this is some open equal ""forum for debate"" such as yourselves are deluding yourself. Any well organized attempt to control the narrative of a thread can be achived due to reddit's upvote system. People who call out their racist bullshit get downvoted. Reddit isn't a platform for meeting new ideas or culture or what ever naive lofty notion you think it is, at least not in the defaults. Only through strict moderation such as in askhistory do you see platforms such as that but those are rare exceptions because redditers tend to flip out over moderation. Most of them want to tell shitty jokes over and over again (look at any new askscience post), they'll defend ""free speech"" as long as it sounds like status quo that appeals to middle class white men. That's it. Promote any other narrative in most subs and you're a radical or you'll be silenced or mocked. Stormfront has admitted that they exploit this mentality and they're doing it quite well.  The average person I know who doesn't go on reddit thinks reddit is a place full of pedos and racist, that's their opionion. Who wants to go to a site like that? Who wants to invest in that or advertise there? Only delusional redditers think this is a great platform for debate or a bastion of free speech."

People used to ask for votes in the titles, /r/atheism used to be way more popular, etc.  But there were far more articles posted--it was more about the content, and not about outrage or your opinions.  I really, really do think that F7U12 and advice animals changed reddit significantly.  It's turned reddit into an imageboard like 4chan.

At that moment, discussion and conversation began to end. At that moment, people had to go and actively seek out their echo chamber of similarity, not ever get exposed to new and interesting topics that were fresh and cool. No, you have to into the ""X"" room, where X is.   Things became more and more compartmentalized, and now while it's slowed... everything has been boiled down. Nobody's exposed to new perspectives anymore. You go to X subreddit for X and- this fucks me up the most- you can make a ""multireddit"" now of all these little echo chambers, where in the past, that was just one fucking subreddit with a bunch of people.

TheoryOfReddit,2zvccz,keepeetron,5,Sun Mar 22 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"I've had mixed feelings about reddit's growing user base. When I used to describe reddit, I probably came off as an evangelist. Now when I mention reddit, I need to give the disclaimer that the true value that reddit once had is now restricted to the smaller, niche communities. I'm not sure if I'm lying to myself and that the old reddit and modern reddit are not all that different. I question if perhaps as my maturity increased, the maturity of reddit remained stagnant so that the decrease in quality was really relative to myself.  I question if I was a part of the ""decline"" when introducing everyone I met and their mother to reddit. The first time I thought that:  I noticed that a friend I had introduced to reddit was several hundred links deep. He was just looking at pictures, voting, click to next page. While I enjoy looking at pictures as much as anyone else, I couldn't see why he was skipping what in my eyes was the valuable content. I used to be able to spend hours just looking at the articles on the front page and then doing some further wikipedia investigation. I'm not sure if that is possible these days with the default front page.  On the other hand, the number of people allows for much more knowledge to be present that the previous smaller user base. I am consistently impressed by the quality of discussions found on /r/askscience although it is a default subreddit. Still, there's a lot of potential for numerous subreddits to flourish. My concern is that the default face of reddit is low brow enough to scare contributors to /r/bioinformatics away.  Well that's enough of my rambling. Really I think the answer lies in the Wayback Machine. People will recall things differently, but there you can get a pretty objective view. April 2008 is more in line with the what I view as the golden age. At the same time, now I would probably recall April 2009 as being a part of that golden age, but I question my memory when I look at the front page from that time."

Honestly though I think they did it to remove the place where all users could discuss reddit itself. That is where ideas and complaints would be posted so that everyone could see it.  Now the only place to have those discussions is in theoryofreddit, which is only visible to those who sub.  That and the removal of vote numbers really neutered the site. It's imperceptible even to me now that they are missing, but there was so much more you could glean about the discussion when votes were shown.  Now I have no idea if my post with 1 point is highly controversial, or if nobody even bothered to read it. I think you can see controversial on comments with enough votes, but can't see that shit on alien blue for some reason."

That being said, the answer depends on the person. If this is your first day, then things seem so amazing and cool and new. If you were one of the first people here, I'm sure you remember when the high point was for you.   I'm particularly into the creepier side, like /r/nosleep, and the highpoint for that was about a year and a half ago when every story would make your skin crawl. Now, it's become a default, and so user numbers have shot up, and as one would expect quality went down. However, there are still quite a few stories that are near professional quality.   I'm not into it, but if you were on /r/computers or /r/technology, as those things progress there will be new posts because new things exist that didn't before. The answer is entirely based on how long you've been here and what subreddits you frequent"
TheoryOfReddit,2zvccz,FearAndLawyering,5,Sun Mar 22 12:29:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd divide the ""Ages of reddit"" up (subjectively, of course) as follows:   ""Silicon Age"" (2005-2008) - site is mostly tech enthusiasts, like a more democratic Slashdot.  Example subreddits:  programming, science. ""Bronze Age"" (2008-2009) - there were subreddits, but IIRC it wasn't ""anyone can turn any text string into a subreddit.""  Example subreddits:  funny, tech, politics. ""Golden Age"" (2009-2010) - so named because gold was introduced; reddit becomes much more popular.  Example subreddits:  gifs, todayilearned, AMA, f7u12. ""Uncivil War"" (2010-2013) - as subreddits proliferate, reddit becomes a beacon for a lot of unpopular subjects, and for the people trying to shut them down.  Example subreddits:  jailbait, creepshots, shitredditsays. ""Dark Age"" (2013-present) - the shitlords win; reddit becomes particularly known for a lot of awful content.  Example subreddits:  coontown, thefappening, theredpill, fatpeoplehate, tumblrinaction."

I don't think that someone should be denied access to a social medium because of the opinions they would share through it. What I do think should be done is that whenever bigots try to spread their ideas the community confronts them, shames them, and respond to their arguments with better reasoning. And that's pretty much what OP's saying we're doing pretty well at."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,Hobodoctor,10,Sun Mar 22 07:05:51 2015 UTC,"Wow. So let's start at the beginning.   I actually respectfully disagree with you.   Actually, you jumped straight to stuffing words into my mouth and accusing me of zealous censorship. There's nothing ""respectful"" about it.   In nearly every instance where that sort of bigotry gets brought up outside of subreddits specifically tailored for it, the greater community calls it out and shuns it.   This has not been my experience, at all. Indeed, several leading subreddits are hotbeds of sexism, homophobia, transphobia and racism, even in overt forms. If ever you want to attract a bunch of downvotes in a hurry, go to a default sub and ask someone if they really needed to use the word ""retarded"" or the sentence ""OP is a faggot"" and just watch the downvotes pour over you.  Then there's the more insiduous stuff: rants about Tumblr and ""SJWs""; POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE MAD; and, of course, the usual tactic of tying any criticism of these beliefs to censorship, as you're attempting here.  Bottom line? No, Reddit does not do a particularly good job of avoiding cyberbulling, slut-shaming, or anything else in that line. And it is very unlikely Reddit will ever be any good at dodging these social problems unless and until it adequately addresses the extremely popular forums which serve explicitly to advance these aims and projects.   Wanting those subreddits to be gone is either wanting those opinions to not exist (which would be great if we could manage it) or it's wanting those views to be censored.   I didn't say I wanted anyone or anything banned. I did say that, if we want to talk about Reddit as if it is a haven from bullying and slut-shaming, you need to somehow square that against the fact that it hosts a whole bunch of forums whose explicit and overt purpose is bullying and slut-shaming.   What I do think should be done is that whenever bigots try to spread their ideas the community confronts them, shames them, and respond to their arguments with better reasoning.   And this is just privileged nonsense, on several levels and for several reasons.  Firstly, /r/coontown is not an ""argument"", nor will any amount of ""reasoning"" break people away from it. /r/coontown, and forums like it, exist at the intersection of genuine hatred and a bunch of people who just like trolling. (Just think of how many Tumblr SJWs you're offending! Isn't it grand?!) Neither group cares about your ""superior reasoning"", and the notion that you're going to crack that nut by meekly advancing arguments is just delusional.  Secondly, you're talking of these things as if allowing them to quietly go about their business is somehow a neutral position, and it manifestly isn't. For one thing, they aren't quietly going about their business: these subreddits are corrosive and destructive. The only thing they contribute to the site is their own traffic; everything else they do -- normalizing abhorrent views and behaviours, promoting out-and-out hatred of targeted groups, organizing and coordinating campaigns and broader projects, and so on -- is fundamentally destructive to any site which claims it wants users from all walks of life.  But most importantly of all, you're making ridiculous and absurd demands. It clearly hasn't occurred to you that, when a woman is hounded by people from /r/theredpill (or a black person by people from /r/coontown, or a fat person by /r/fatpeoplehate, etc.), this isn't an abstract detached armchair discussion: this is someone challenging the legitimacy of your very personhood, and doing it in an extremely public and totally unavoidable way. Even if this person gets downvotes, even if they get banned from a forum situationally, and even if other people join you in fighting them off, the experience is at best frustrating, and at worst traumatic.  On your account, the right action for this person to take is to ""win the argument"" by calmly and evenhandedly responding to this treatment.  And that's ridiculous.  In reality, most people who are dehumanized in this manner will do one of two things:   Get frustrated and react accordingly. (Indeed, a great many trolls prey on precisely this reaction: find a marginalized person; goad them into flying off the handle; complain to the moderators and get them banned for swearing, or being ""angry"" or ""uncivil"".) Get frustrated and leave Reddit entirely, having been bullied off the site.   In this manner, your position mostly just serves to hollow the forum out. The trolls win every time, and as more and more people are made to leave the forum by virtue of harassment, the forum inevitably becomes more and more hostile to members of targeted groups: they see people like them being targeted; they see people like them leaving; they see more abuse and hatred directed at people like them; they give up, even if they themselves haven't been personally targeted.  And, to reiterate, the experience of being targeted is destructive even if you ""win"" the argument. Every time you have to defend your very personhood, you don't grow stronger: you grow weaker. You get a little bit more bored of being told to justify your own existence. You get a little more upset at having your experiences dictated to you by an outsider who doesn't understand or care to understand. You get a little bit less inclined to even bother with the argument next time. And after even a very small number of negative encounters, you stop bothering altogether: there won't be a next time, because you're leaving. Not once in human history has anyone ever gone to bed thinking ""You know, I sure am glad that guy from /r/coontown called me a 'dumb nigger, all full of monkeyshines'. That felt really good. I can't wait to see what he says next.""  What you're left with, then, is a forum full of trolls who enjoy amazing and unprecedented freedom of speech -- and very little else.  But they'll have unprecedented freedom of speech, and that's the important thing... right?"

I'm not the person you're responding to. But that's never occurred to me either. The reason that thought hasn't occurred to me is because it's completely ridiculous.  Look, I used to be like you too. I had to sit up on the computer late at night and make very long posts on my local BBS and Compuserve and explain to people how I was right and they were wrong. It was important to me.  Then I grew the fuck up. The reality is that stupid people are going to believe stupid things, and there's nothing I can do to ""fix"" them. I might be able to learn about what makes them tick, so that I can better deal with stupid people that I have to deal with in school or at work or in public or in traffic. I might be able to glean some sort of wisdom from them anyway, because even a broken clock is right twice a day. Sometimes I can just sit back and laugh at them.

TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,pigeon768,3,Sun Mar 22 08:33:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's take a step back. I've obviously offended you, which I had no intention of doing, and I'm sorry that the way I phrased certain things came across as putting words in your mouth. I'm going to respond to your points, but I see no absolutely no reason for this to be a fight.  Let's be clear, I did not and would not accuse you of ""zealous censorship"". What I said was that the only scenarios I can think of (and let me know if there are others) in which the people we're talking about don't exist on reddit is they don't exist in the world (which I don't think is likely to happen soon) or if they're not allowed to represent those views on reddit (which I think would be bad to do).  Again, you say that what I'm attempting to do is ""tying any criticism of these beliefs as censorship"". Not only did I not make any sort of claim about what you do or it being good or bad, but the what I actually did say was that bigoted beliefs should be openly confronted and shamed. I'm literally saying that the criticism of those beliefs is good and should be further encouraged - the exact opposite of the impression you seem to have of me.  As for the parts you called privileged nonsense.  Your first point: people who are racist or otherwise bigoted, in the real world or on reddit, have certain factually incorrect beliefs about the world and the people in it and also have a tendency to spread information they know isn't true in order to try to spread their beliefs. When I say arguments, these are the things I'm referring to. I think it's important that when these factually incorrect beliefs and false claims are introduced into a public forum, they're responded to with the reason they're wrong, right next to it for everyone to see. That way, even though the racist probably won't suddenly realize the error of his ways, it keeps others whose opinions aren't as hardened from falling into bigotry. It's important that people in the right on these issues demonstrate they're not only against the bigots because they hurt people (which still an important reason), but also that we're against the bigots because they are just demonstrably wrong about the world and its people.  Yes, there's still the issue with things that are just insults and name calling, which are very hurtful things which there's no counterargument to. But when it comes to them, when they're directly harassing someone, they are often deleted by mods or downvoted by the community. That's not as good as it having never happened in the first place, but there's really no way for reddit to prevent someone from saying something before they say it.  Your second point: we are in total agreement regarding how harmful these subreddits and their members are. I absolutely agree with you. But I think the best response to it is to foster a community that directly challenges and whenever possible shames these people.  Your third point: of course it's occurred to me how harmful harassment is. I don't see how reddit or its community can really do much more strategically against it, though. We're talking about users on large, popular subreddits attacking people for the color of their skin or their weight or gender or a whole slew of other possible issue. Ideally, these comments are reported to the mods who then take some action against it depending on the situation. Deleting /r/fatpeoplehate won't delete the people who contribute to it. They'll still be able to harass innocent people until reddit manages to find a way to use a brain scanner to prevent people who might break community rules from making accounts.  To be clear, I'm not saying that it's the responsibility of the person being attacked to point out why the attacker is wrong - I think I think it's the responsibility of the entire community to defend the people being attacked whenever they see it happen so that they hopefully don't get bullied off the site. And again, this scenario relates more directly to a person getting harassed, which I wrote about above. Counterarguments work much better and more directly in the scenario where an offensive link is posted to a topic-specific subreddit.  Just to sum up: I am completely opposed to bullying and harassment on reddit. I think the best strategy would be for the community to defend the targets of this treatment and invalidate the beliefs and arguments of the attackers. This doesn't happen every time, but as I think OP was referring to, the reddit community tends to be better about this than most other online communities (like, say, youtube or Facebook). We can't just make these people go away because there's no way to stop someone from cyberbullying someone on a large subreddit before they do it and we're already making at least a commendable effort in addressing direct bullying and harassment when we find out about it.  The only other issue to address is bigoted, hateful subreddits being allowing to exist, and that's a somewhat different issue. Yes, it's unsettling and I'm sure deeply troubling for many people just to know that these communities exist, whether or not you choose to visit them and read what they have to say. But even if we wanted to ban every one of these subreddits, it would be impossible to point a finger at an entire subreddit and call it harassment - a lot of it's just articles and pictures and opinions, shared predominantly between people who don't feel attacked by it. The other side of the issue is that since what these subreddits are doing isn't illegal, the only way for reddit to ban them would be adopting a policy of deleting subreddits based on moral opposition, and that would set the precedence for the entire reddit community having to adhere to a specific set of beliefs that the people who run reddit hold, beyond just their beliefs on issues that we're talking about. That just isn't anyone infallible enough to not mess that up in the long run, and most people would do a terrible job of it right off the bat.  Is there anyone you can think of who you would trust completely to decide for you what opinions you're allowed hear and which you aren't?"

You act as if they're inherently evil without any redeemable or sympathetic qualities.  That's not true, they're people, and I think it's worth looking into whatever experiences caused them to behave this way.  It's not these people are devoid of reason either as you insinuate.  No one believes anything without some internal reasoning.  So somehow, these racists have, through some perverted logic, affirmed their own beliefs.  And that's important, because a racist will interpret your refusal to dignify their argument as a lack of a counterargument.  They won't think : ""Oh shoot, my beliefs are so bigoted and archaic, society won't even acknowledge me.""  They will think: ""I'm a lone beacon of true knowledge in this ignorant society.""  The more you try to shut someone down without argument, the more convinced they'll become of their beliefs.  It's also important to realize that anyone of an outdated and bigoted belief is inherently opposed to admitting it.  No one wants to be a stupid bigot and if you infer that they are for believing whatever it is they believe (no matter how true it is) they'll naturally resist your arguments."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,TheChainsawNinja,3,Tue Mar 24 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't say trolls are evil. I said trolls find amusement in the suffering of others. (And I also think you're wrong in asserting that trolls believe their own PR. They don't. They know full well that they're saying outrageous and offensive things, because saying outrageous and offensive things is the very point of the exercise. Their language and ""ideology"" are deliberately calibrated to produce this effect.)  I should be clear that, by ""troll"", I don't mean someone with racist views; I mean someone who deliberately and consciously affects racist views in order to generate an emotional reaction from the people they're abusing.  With that in mind, treating these people as mere bigots -- as people with ""bad ideas"" whose minds can be changed -- is counterproductive. They don't actually believe the words they're using, they just want to piss you off."

TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,TheChainsawNinja,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"Bottom line? No, Reddit does not do a particularly good job of avoiding cyberbulling, slut-shaming, or anything else in that line. And it is very unlikely Reddit will ever be any good at dodging these social problems unless and until it adequately addresses the extremely popular forums which serve explicitly to advance these aims and projects.   In your opinion, how could Reddit even do something like this?   promoting out-and-out hatred of targeted groups   Also, it seems to me like you're doing the same to these groups that you deem offensive (which admittedly they completely are.)     But they'll have unprecedented freedom of speech, and that's the important thing... right?   I would say so. Isn't that one of the main pillars of reddit?"
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,abravelittletoaster,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:08:17 2015 UTC,"""progressive"" or ""accommodating""    I think the biggest problem is that when people say ""open minded"" or ""diverse"" they really mean ""...to views that I find acceptable"", when the exact point of open-minded ness and diversity is that you rely on the marketplace of ideas, and that opinions are determined to be 'acceptable' or not by a ground-up process (voting, etc) rather than a top-down mechanism which really becomes ""What is acceptable is what I think is acceptable."""
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,oldsystemlodgment,23,Sun Apr 12 06:32:11 2015 UTC,"Just because you don't see slut-shaming or cyberbullying in the comments doesn't mean that it doesn't show up in someones inbox. Since we can't know what's landing in inboxes, I don't know if ToR has the data to really get at this question."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,TDaltonC,11,Sun Mar 22 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"While that's possible, the usual pattern is that the worst bullying takes place in public, where the bully can perform for an audience.  Or at least that's my experience and the general consensus elsewhere I've seen this discussed."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,dspeyer,6,Sun Mar 22 03:17:27 2015 UTC,"That seem reasonable. If bullying is a performance, then we would also expect the bullies to gravitate toward sub's that cater to their performance (weak mods, reactive audience, etc)."

TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,TRVDante,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:22:56 2015 UTC,"Evil right-wing neoreactionary here, I'd just like to point out that the ""Broken window"" theory is generally reviled by the liberal zeitgeist because it reaches the conclusion that gentrification and race-oriented police work improves communities.  That being said, I think you're right. I know I'm already digging myself a hole here, but in a conversation I had with Weev, he said something that this reminds me of: ""My goal is to widen the overton window until genocide becomes acceptable."" In a sense, that's why I think reddit's policies favor the ""transgressive right""- we can break so many liberal windows that breaking these windows becomes the norm, and you have a community that accepts this as the default norm, and before long mainstream reddit is like a less funny version of a chan site.   Crucify me if you want for my wrongthink, I'm just saying that this is how it works."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,danthemango,-2,Sat Mar 21 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Don't think so. The biggest difference between reddit and other online communities is the voting system, bullying does not stimulate the hive mind.  Bullying could easily be fixed on Facebook if they only implemented down votes, and on YouTube once YouTube implements votes that are more than just placebos."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,Myxomycota,4,Sat Mar 21 20:57:56 2015 UTC,"Another big difference between reddit and other online communities is the obligate anonymity both at the user and subreddit level. Am I a subscriber to /r/TheoryOfReddit ? Maybe I just don't post often. Maybe I just landed here on random. Its easy for people on reddit to assume that because some posts in a given sub, they are a member of the sub, and agree to whatever modes of persuasion are prevalent to that community. A good example of this is /r/conservative where they effectively want to not ever have to talk to or respond to anything or anyone who might identify as liberal, one can get away with being present for a very long time by simply avoiding confrontation. Its not quite the same as cyberbullying or slut-shaming, but I think it is very similar in mode of action, finding its roots in group identification."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,alexleavitt,8,Sat Mar 21 21:10:13 2015 UTC,How certain are you sure it's not happening? I'm not saying you are wrong -- there are many subs that do excellent public moderation -- but I know a few subs that suffer from these behaviors occurring through targeted private messages...

TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,jckgat,6,Sat Mar 21 21:35:40 2015 UTC,Which subs are you referring to as the ones where this sorta thing doesn't happen?
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,Kuxir,2,Sat Mar 21 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of them are smaller subs (e.g., /r/Farscape), but I've yet to see such behavior on (random examples) /r/buffy*, /r/ScenesFromAHat, or /r/shittyfoodporn.  The more I think about this, I'm realizing that many of the subs I frequent stick to hating on celebrities, usually in a joking manner, e.g., /r/nfl, but don't publicly shame other users.  *The occasional character is berated here, but those who appreciate generally unliked characters are welcomed nonetheless."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,Joeyfield,5,Sat Mar 21 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"It's odd you list /r/nfl as a positive sub, because I consider it one of the worst. Just look at the comments any time a player is accused of rape. The top comments are always declaring that it's a sham and the woman is making it up for money, or something equally appalling. Anyone who even suggests the players is anything but innocent is flat out attacked. The community is so toxic in their defense of players for any crime it has made me stop watching the NFL entirely. It is a horrible culture, and the sub happily cheers the worst in fan culture. That's leaving aside all of the toxicity if you dare criticize a fan favorite team.   /r/nfl is an example of Reddit at it's worst, not it's best."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,matter098,-4,Tue Apr 14 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"Just look at the comments any time a player is accused of rape   A large reason for this is because of the ""cleat chaser"" culture. Maybe there are cases where popular athletes are responsible for rape but its highly unlikely due to the vast amount of ""cleat chasers"" that are out there specifically to try this type of scam, the small occurence of (at least reported) rape compared to the large amount of rape accusations against athletes."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,StarTrekMike,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's part of the reason.  Reddit is made in which any time you want to post or comment, you have a subreddit, a label representing something, with people looking viewing that area.  When people are rude and not funny, they get downvoted, or it goes against the rules of that subredddit and is removed. This also creates the image where the subreddit will have a popular view on something that a lot of people agree with while a select view disagree with.  (ie: on /r/funny, most people agree that when someone is offended about something, you should not care.  I disagree with that idea, yet it does appear as one of the top post in that regard.)"
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,matter098,2,Sat Mar 21 23:23:39 2015 UTC,"I'd like to believe that cyber bullying doesn't exist as one can always turn the computer off but not everyone is willing to do so. I'm sure some subreddits are more prone to negativity due to the topics they discuss. This instance isn't mean to be an excuse to the negativity but there are definitely places on Reddit where arguments are more likely to occur. These arguments tend to lend themselves to ""inappropriate"" response. The best means to go about avoiding I guess would be to moderate troll accounts, praise those who do their research, and have a low tolerance for toxic people.  TLDR: Praise positivity, ignore the bad, don't take things too serious"
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,QQ_L2P,6,Sat Mar 21 17:49:52 2015 UTC,"I actually wonder if ""ignoring the bad' is what let things get so bad in the first place. So bad in fact that I don't think there is really any way to make it better anymore."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,Waff1es,2,Sat Mar 21 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"I think what you are referring to is ignoring the bad in the sense of not doing anything about it. Of course, moderators/admins can ban people. To clarify, I was trying to say that no attention should be given to them. ""Haters"" only have as much power as you are willing to give them. The amount of haters will build up overtime but they do eventually go away. Those who wish negativity upon another do so solely for a reaction. If the reaction is taken away, they have no motivation to hate. Your point is very interesting though, I really wonder if there is a point where you can no longer ""fix"" the problem."
TheoryOfReddit,2ztmp6,Waff1es,-6,Sat Mar 21 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Seems reasonable that if you do dumb shit, you should expect to be called out on it.  She was had a job and she mixed it with pleasure. Not just any job mind you, she was an intern at the White House. She was there to learn so she could perform better at her career.  She didn't do that. She got down and dirty with the President, not the manager of some no-name supermarket on the outskirts of some back water town, The President of the United States. She goofed and she goofed hard. She deserved everything that she got.  And for all the chatter about cyber bullying and slut-shaming, she is making a rather comfortable living (nicely into the millions of dollars) today talking about how she ""made a mistake"" with the President. She has no marketable skills, nothing of value to anything other than the fact that she was part of a scandal with a PotUS.  So no, I have no sympathy for her and yes, she deserved every bit of derision she got. Because at the end of the day, she didn't go into work and do her job, she did something incredibly stupid and the fact she has the gall to try and turn it around and say that she is the victim? Jog right on. Next time, keep your legs closed and do what you were there to do, which is to be an intern gaining knowledge to increase knowledge base and improve their career prospects."

Then, once you're good and fucked up, the toxicity travels outwards to infect others by baiting them into ""conversation"", by guilt-tripping or emotionally extorting them, or just plain ol ""you're a fag if you disagree. Don't disagree.""   when I use the term ""toxic"", it basically means an echo chamber environment where bad opinions(you know what I mean) are amplified, angry or hateful notions are amplified, and it spreads to people who originally didn't give a damn, and we go from a few extremists and a bunch of normal people, to a ton of extremists attacking whatever now partisan people there are that used to be normal."

The study also weighed toxic comments against those he defined as supportive, which includes language that expresses support or appreciation of another user.   This whole study comes down the what algorithms define ""toxicity"" ""supportiveness"" and ""bigoted.""   From what I can gather, they made fairly simple searches for phrases they assume are bigoted/toxic/supportive. But I doubt very much they actually sifted through the results.   What about sarcasm? What about those buzzwords that weren't be used ""toxicly"" etc. Plus, wtf does ""toxic"" mean exactly? ""An outright attack on another user"" what exactly does that mean? I guarantee they aren't manually sorting through millions of comments, they have searches for key terms. How can a search accurately and consistently pick up only ""outright attacks"" on users? These are all subjective phrases, and can mean many things to many different people.   As I see it, they did a search for common phrases, assigned those phrases a ""toxic"" ""supportive"" ""bigoted"" tag (however they pleased) and then posted the results. But these are all very subjective terms.   I bet if you changed the search parameters or phrased used, you'd get dramatically different results. Perhaps you could even intentionally change those definitions to fit whatever agenda you might want to pursue... hint hint  My conclusion: take it with a huge grain of salt, and I want to know exactly what definition of ""toxic"" ""bigoted"" and ""supportive"" they're using and how exactly they are measuring those characteristics."

So they just took a sample of comments, and ""scored"" them on toxicity/etc. First off, that's just a sample, and how do they choose what comments to look at. It just said they took comments from top posts.  I just think that imposing labels like toxic/bigoted etc on subreddits is kind of stupid. Each subreddit is a very complex mix of users, and each thread will vary quite radically depending on who is commenting. 1000 comments is nothing to most subs, and only captures a tiny amount of the people reading/commenting on them.  So to make sweeping generalizations based on 1000 comments, seems suspect and misguided."
TheoryOfReddit,2zpmyb,ReverseSolipsist,5,Sat Mar 21 13:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think the problem you're getting at is this:  A) Men are violent and controlling.  B) Women are stupid whores.  If you were they type of person who would, say, describe /r/TumblrinAction  as ""a subreddit dedicated to mocking Tumblr – where marginalized groups, particularly LGBTQ, post about their experiences"" rather than ""a subreddit dedicated to mocking extreme-left victim-mongering on Tumblr"" (which would arguably be closer to how they would describe themselves), or, say, someone who is sympathetic for /r/SRS enough to investigate exactly why it was found to be toxic and defend it while essentially saying, ""yeah, of course /r/theredpill is toxic"" without mustering up any sort of defense, you might be the type of person who thinks statement B) is toxic but statement A) is not toxic. This would lead to your algorithm learning that words like ""stupid,"" and ""whore"" which are often used to denigrate women are toxic, while words like ""violent"" and ""controlling"" which are often used to denigrate men remain neutral.  That might cause your algorithm to, for example, determine that subreddits you don't like are toxic, while determining that subreddits you do like are supportive. Is that what you were trying to say?  DISCLAIMER: I don't have any love for any of the subs I mentioned."
TheoryOfReddit,2zpmyb,moonroots64,2,Sat Mar 21 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie, took me 3-4 rereads of your comment to get it, but I think yes, I agree with you saying ""That might cause your algorithm to, for example, determine that subreddits you don't like are toxic, while determining that subreddits you do like are supportive.""  Yes, I am saying that the definitions of these terms and how they are measured very much determine the outcome of the results. I also agree that the subreddits the authors like are far more likely to be favored, and the subreddits the authors dislike are far more likely to be disfavored.  I don't believe the authors are being objective, that's what I'm really saying. But even more importantly I don't think their goal (labeling or ranking subreddits as ""toxic"" or whatever) is even a legitimate end. My point is: trying to label a subreddit as ""toxic"" is misguided. First, your definitions of toxis/supportive/whatever are not going to agree with many others. Second, subreddits aren't a ""thing"" or a ""person"". They are an aggregate of huge numbers of people, so they aren't one thing or another... they are a huge group of individuals each with individual beliefs.  Yeah, you can try to make generalizations based on statistics of that aggregate group, but that's all they are. Generalizations. They don't reflect each individual, and much more than that, a small (1000 comment) sample of an entire huge subreddit can no more encapsilate my personality and looking at my actions in 1 day of my life. It is pathetically small.  So, people need a much more comprehensive study to give actual representative results. Otherwise, all this study is is an exercise in confirmating the test-takers' already affirmed beliefs."
TheoryOfReddit,2zpmyb,electricfistula,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:59:23 2015 UTC,"Your complaints about this study seem extremely disingenuous.  As if you are really stretching for some reason, any reason, to find a flaw with the study.   I am saying that the definitions of these terms and how they are measured very much determine the outcome of the results.   This is such an obvious tautology as to not be worth mentioning.  Of course the definitions of the terms determine the outcome.  If they did not, the outcome would be random.  There is no ""true"" definition for the word - they told you what definition they were using though.  If a comment was overtly attacking another redditor or used bigoted language, they considered it toxic.  You may have a different definition for the word toxic.  If so, the results of this study may not match your definition for toxicity.  They shared the definitions they were using, so that you, and others, could understand what they meant by toxic and what their findings implied.   I also agree that the subreddits the authors like are far more likely to be favored, and the subreddits the authors dislike are far more likely to be disfavored.   That is not reasonable to think based on the arguments you've given.  The ratings were done by recruiting 500 random people off CloudFlower and then used sentiment analysis based on that input to determine the remaining ratings.  Where, exactly, do you think the authors injected their bias for or against subreddits?  Perhaps you think the sentiment analysis algorithm is flawed.  That would be interesting, but you would need to explain how you reached that conclusion.  Or, perhaps you think that the 500 random people recruited for the evaluation were predisposed to be biased against certain subreddits.  Again, you'd have to explain why you think that.   I don't believe the authors are being objective, that's what I'm really saying   In what way.  They are showing you their algorithm, detailing their method, and then presenting their quantified findings.  You can't just say ""You aren't being objective"" you must point out what their bias is, and how it impacts their results.   even more importantly I don't think their goal (labeling or ranking subreddits as ""toxic"" or whatever) is even a legitimate end   There is behavior they have characterized as ""toxic"".  They can quantify how frequently that behavior occurs within subreddits.  They are doing that to show off their sentiment analysis tools.  How is this not a legitimate end?  Perhaps you don't care which subreddits are or are not toxic.  That's fine, but your interests are not the definition of legitimacy.  They have an interesting approach and have produced and shared interesting results.   My point is: trying to label a subreddit as ""toxic"" is misguided   They are not.  They are trying to quantify how toxic a subreddit is based on their methodology.   First, your definitions of toxis/supportive/whatever are not going to agree with many others.   That is why they GAVE THEIR DEFINITIONS.  You could never make any statement about anything if you couldn't take as axiomatic the meaning of words.   Second, subreddits aren't a ""thing"" or a ""person"". They are an aggregate of huge numbers of people, so they aren't one thing or another... they are a huge group of individuals each with individual beliefs.   This is not a valid complaint against the study.  The study never supposes that subreddits are singular things.  Their definition for toxic does not rely on the thing being evaluated being a single thing.  Subreddits have collections of comments.  Those comments were evaluated for being toxic according to the methods that they outline in their study.   you can try to make generalizations based on statistics of that aggregate group, but that's all they are. Generalizations.    No... by sampling data and finding trends in the sample you can make mathematically valid predictions with regards to the content of the data that you did not sample.  This is the basic premise upon which every survey is based.  If you mean that their results are not literally certain to be accurate, you are correct, but trivially so.  If being literally certain was a standard for discourse, we would not be able to make very many statements at all.  For example, we can't be certain the sun didn't just vanish.  Or that there ever was a sun in the first place."
TheoryOfReddit,2zpmyb,moonroots64,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, well at least I put an idea out there. What are you original thoughts about the subject? Or do you prefer just comment and not interject original thoughts of your own?   I presume you agree with the study then? And you think their definition of toxicity etc is correct?   And you believe that even by using 500 ""impartial"" individuals that you can come to define entire subreddits? Sure, you can make a definition, and conduct a study that supports that subjective definition. But that doesn't make it true that a subreddit is Toxic, or to expand it to a more objective terminology, wrong or bad.  My point is mostly that subreddits are aggregates of individuals, so the entire point of having 500 ""impartial"" individuals trying to determine value of these subreddits based on a VERY SMALL SUBSET of comments overall, is misguided.   You make many good points, I'll admit. The methodology might be valid, but I don't think it makes a sound point. Yes, based on their definitions, participants, and outcomes, their study has labeled subreddits. My point is that their entire system of classifying any subreddit is misguided. Yes, they have outcomes. But my point is that those outcomes are devoid of interesting information. Which makes me wonder why I even care about this.   In summary, I grant you, the study makes logically valid points, but I find those points pretty uninteresting overall. They are aggregating multiple individuals responses and trying to make a generalization (stereotype) of that community's ""essence"". I don't think such an ""essence"" exists."
TheoryOfReddit,2zpmyb,electricfistula,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:10:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, well at least I put an idea out there   I don't think that is to your credit when your ideas are wrong.   Or do you prefer just comment and not interject original thoughts of your own?   That is my preference.  I haven't studied the subject and I didn't notice any glaring methodological flaws.  The findings I think are somewhat interesting though mostly an advertisement for that company.  I wish they had gone into more detail about how sentiment analysis works.  Their definitions don't exactly match mine, e.g. I wouldn't expect /r/libertarian to be the least bigoted sub, but their findings match my expectations better than random chance, which I think is commendable.   What are you original thoughts about the subject?   I read SRS fairly regularly.  I find it to be extremely bitter, caustic, and hateful.  It doesn't surprise me that the sub shows a high ""toxic"" measurement given the definitions in this study.   I presume you agree with the study then? And you think their definition of toxicity etc is correct?   I think words are axiomatic and cannot be incorrect.  People have definitions for words.  Words point to concepts.  If you understand what concepts someones words point to, you can figure out what they are trying to communicate.  If someone said to me, ""Sub X is the most flogwort sub in all of reddit."" I wouldn't say ""No it isn't"" I'd say ""What is flogwort?"" And after they told me, I'd say ""How did you measure that?"" And then I'd either accept their methods and consider that I had learned something about vocabulary and reddit, or I'd debate problems with it, or dismiss it out of hand.   And you believe that even by using 500 ""impartial"" individuals that you can come to define entire subreddits?    500 individuals to train the sentiment analysis which considered even more content.  And yes, I do believe that by using statistically significant sample sizes you can come to make very probably true generalizations about still larger sets of data.  I would be very curious to know why you don't think this is so.   But that doesn't make it true that a subreddit is Toxic,   It makes it very likely to be true that the subreddit is toxic, for the given definition of toxic.  Consider that there are two possibilities.  Either the subreddit is toxic, or it isn't.  If we determine it by a purely random coin flip, then we will be right fifty percent of the time.  Is the method outlined in the study better or worse than a coinflip?  My estimation is that it is better.  How much better, I can't meaningfully estimate, and I note that the authors didn't talk about statistical significance or the like either.  But if the truth is a bullseye, we should trust that this method of shooting at it is hitting closer to the mark than random chance.  This also feels like a substantially better and more quantifiable method than asking individuals opinions about each subreddit.   The methodology might be valid, but I don't think it makes a sound point   If you think this, presumably you think they lied about actually carrying out the study or what their results were.  That is, if they have a valid method, and they aren't lying, and they actually did the study, how do they not have a sound result?   But my point is that those outcomes are devoid of interesting information.   This is a silly point to try and express.  You don't think something is interesting, why are you sharing that?  Why would you read about and discuss something you find dull?  Why would you try to persuade others that the interest they place in this kind of thing is misplaced?   They are aggregating multiple individuals responses and trying to make a generalization (stereotype) of that community's ""essence"".    Generalization isn't the same thing as a stereotype.  For example, the statement ""In a year, most people take more vacation days than sick days."" And this is a generalization.  That is, it isn't refuted by pointing out one really sick guy, or one guy who doesn't like vacations.  Most people have this behavior most of the time.  Similarly, generalizations can be made about subreddits.  They tend to engage in quantifiably different behaviors.  We can measure and discuss those."

In fact, the most successful text posts are just creative ways to manipulate html in the post title, and it's usually just asking for upvotes (which I guess is more or less the essence of reddit) or doing the donger thing. In any case, when /r/circlejerk is at its most active, it really has nothing to do with the reddit circlejerk at all, that top commenter in that first link is right in theory but not in practice."

My best shot would be to say that /r/circlejerk is a subreddit devoted to making fun of the hivemind and the collective (sub)consciousness of the entire reddit userbase, particularly (but not only) the frontpage and the default subs.   As a meta community, it often consumes itself in self-references, formatting experimentations and is well aware of those link post / self post cycles that you mentioned. They act as a kind of motto that is supposed to guide collective creations, which could perhaps explain why they try to force a given meme from time to time, in the hopes it will trigger some sort of chain reaction and end up being everywhere.   In other words, I'd say /r/circlejerk sees right through what some would refer themselves to as reddit's own sense of entitlement. It is a reminder that perhaps we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously, while they themselves refuse to do so as well."
TheoryOfReddit,2zk012,ravia,7,Thu Mar 19 11:29:28 2015 UTC,"In other words, I'd say /r/circlejerk sees right through what some would refer themselves to as reddit's own sense of entitlement.   That's probably how it started out but it's no longer that, or at least no longer just that.   If I had to describe that subreddit and its subscribers in just a single word, I would use the word ""contrarian"". That subreddit and its ilk are exactly like the outcasts in highschool who would sit and watch the popular kids and then make fun of how stupid they are for following trends or liking popular things.  People in that subreddit are contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. And since teenagers and young adults love to run counter to popular culture, being a contrarian suits them perfectly. There, they can feel intelligent and superior. They're above and ""better"" than the hivemind. Really, it's no different than those atheists who are ""enlightened by their own intelligence"", it's just not as blatant. It was actually funny to watch them make fun of that when it happened, completely oblivious to their own hypocrisy."
TheoryOfReddit,2zk012,enormousloser,3,Thu Mar 19 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"That's what I see regular Reddit as, being that Reddit as a whole generally is self loathing. I don't see CJ as that. CJ is more of a satire of the very common 'circlejerks' that occur on the rest of Reddit. A lot of times this is overdone but there are some quality posts, that brilliantly satirize a lot of the hivemind Reddit posts/opinions."
TheoryOfReddit,2zk012,supergauntlet,3,Fri Mar 20 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"/r/circlejerk is what you get when you banish, by necessity or not, making a certain kind of joke within a normal context. I tend to see it as a kind of ""categorization impulse run amok"". The idea is that if someone makes a certain kind of joke, which seems to have to do with ""we recognize X as a repetitive and humorous condition"", where this whole complex is beyond arising through a close substantive connection with a give post or material. When it reaches that point, people will say, ""take it to /r/circlejerk"", either because they are being (too) categorical and want ""a place for everything"", or because such comments are distracting, tend to be overdone and can ruin a thread. The sub, then, is a ""proper place"" for the ""improper"" kind of joking that goes on in what is called ""circlejerking"".  It is useful to consider the actual meaning of a ""circlejerk"": people in a group, each mastubrating the next, in a circle. Typically males. I don't know how often this actually happens, but the symbolism of it is a kind of ""reaching over"" that avoids the middle man of actual and substantive engagement and leads into a more direct ""cut to the chase"" satisfaction with a ""too easy"" local consummation of sexual (or humorous, as is the case in the standard metaphorical use of the term) desire. The ""cut"" means referencing more local knowledge having to do with the site, rather than going through the ""middle man"" (date and a movie, so to speak) of actually reading the article, engaging its issues, etc., and either commenting seriously or, in the case of humor, making a joke that is simply germane to the article.  The strange ""devolution"", hard to figure what to call it, of circlejerking within an appropriate place of category, where the category is clarified and established through the sub, its title, its ""rules"" and practiced conventions, etc., has to do a great deal with the fact that it is just that sequestration. Deprived of the air of being at least in an authentic sub, the jerking revs up in a certain way, and strains at the limits of the space. Variously games that make use of the space are developed, but they also tend to have the character of trying to do the impossible: a kind of self-referential, usually disparaging, local and non-substantive reference and humor that belongs as the ""properly improper"" within a given sub. That is to say, if one is to make a joke, it still must be in a the right context and can't be set entirely off into its own space.   I include the idea that is less to prevent degrade of subs because people can simply be category crazy and want to set up a new category for everything, without realizing the consequences of this and the more organic nature of things."
TheoryOfReddit,2zk012,Reason-and-rhyme,11,Thu Mar 19 13:28:04 2015 UTC,"The problem with /r/circlejerk is that it isn't satire at all. It's simply a meme factory--nothing but reddit inside jokes. ""I'm a grill btw"" or ""ayy lmao"" --these are not actually satire. They are inside jokes. Inside jokes, by definition, fail as satire, because satire transcends such insularity. That is its power, and its point. There is a whole grand tradition of satire from Swift to Colbert that /r/circlejerk has nothing at all to do with."

TheoryOfReddit,2zhlk8,creesch,3,Wed Mar 18 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"As far as I know however, if a user gets reported enough, their account starts getting marked for spam automatically? That's what the mods over there have said to me."

TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,theantisocialist,21,Tue Mar 17 13:41:26 2015 UTC,This is such a strange excuse given how integral the voting system is on reddit. I upvote most people I interact with unless they're being assholes or not contributing to conversation.
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,metamongoose,9,Tue Mar 17 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"I'm terrible at voting. I scroll through the front page and click on things, and I scroll through the comments, but I do all these things automatically. It's rare that a comment arrests my attention long enough for me to think about actually voting. And it's even rarer that I will up or down-vote a submission, simply because when I come back to reddit after having read the submission, I'm moving on to the next thing.  The set of voters and the set of commenters and the set of readers are quite different, I think. There's huge overlap between them but people use this site in hugely varying ways.  edit: I read this post, submitted this response, and didn't vote once. It didn't even cross my mind."
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,theantisocialist,8,Wed Mar 18 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"people use this site in hugely varying ways.   Completely understandable. My point is without comment voting there's nothing separating comments from people who post bigoted, racist, homophobic things and people who post informative, helpful or interesting things. I think there's a big difference between comments like this and I think an upvote or downvote is the difference between slowing reddit from turning into the mess that YouTube comments sections are and trying to maintain intelligent discussion."
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,sykoKanesh,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:54:38 2015 UTC,I'm the same way. 100% including your edit. I've lately been trying to make a more conscious effort to upvote funny or interesting comments and posts though.
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,yoshemitzu,4,Wed Mar 18 12:23:11 2015 UTC,It's not strange at all. Some people (I would include myself in this) use reddit primarily for conversation and tend to disregard the voting system almost entirely. I probably comment more than I vote.
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,theantisocialist,4,Wed Mar 18 00:07:17 2015 UTC,It's understandable that people use reddit in this way now that it's so popular but that approach kind of fucks up the whole intention behind reddits inception. Upvoting interesting links and quality contributions and comments is what pushed the best stuff to the top and therefore kept people interested and attracted new people. The whole point of voting is a way for the community to self police shit comments and be exposed to valuable comments.
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,yoshemitzu,2,Wed Mar 18 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"...that approach kind of fucks up the whole intention behind reddits inception.    Only if you believe voting has actually succeeded in propelling ""interesting links and quality contributions and comments...to the top"".  In my experience, voting rewards a certain kind of content which isn't always the best or the highest quality. The extent to which a user needs the help sorting good content from bad will depend on which subreddits you read.  If you read mostly the defaults, i.e., subreddits with a lot more content on a daily basis, voting will probably seem more significant to you. I read mostly small subreddits with a small enough amount of content I can realistically ""clear"" my reddit frontpage in a day. For this kind of reddit use, voting seems mostly pointless."
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,czerilla,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"For this kind of reddit use, voting seems mostly pointless.   It still serves the purpose of promoting good contributions.

TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,jippiejee,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:29:53 2015 UTC,I can see how you'd read it that way.  I read it as upvoting the comment itself.

I think the layout is also a contributing factor - with comments, they're usually short enough that when you finish reading it, the up/down vote arrows are still within reach.  With posts, unless it's a very short text post, either it leads you somewhere else or it's usually a longer post that when you finish reading the up/down arrows are no longer on the screen/within reach."

TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,Takuza,8,Tue Mar 17 16:35:38 2015 UTC,Yeah this is huge on specialty subs. Once a question has been answered there's no real reason for anyone else to click on it.
TheoryOfReddit,2zcggi,danceswithronin,3,Tue Mar 17 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Especially for subs like DIY or HomeImprovement.  There are a lot of really shitty posts on there that I might comment on but I shouldn't be at the top.    Shit like:   ""I got a SINGLE quote for a bathroom remodel but I think it's kind of high, what do you think?"" You didn't say your location, the scope of the work, nor get any other quotes from contractors in the area.  Reddit isn't your personal remodel quote source.   ""I signed a contract that spelled out the specific work that would be done by the contractor but he didn't do ____ because he said it wasn't in the contract, shouldn't this be assumed?""  No, nothing is assumed.  That's why there's a contract.  If you don't see it there, he's not required to do it.  If he was doing it, it'd be more expensive.  If you don't know enough about the job to know what to expect, you should've hired a general contractor.     So yeah, I can definitely see situations where I'd comment on something but it shouldn't be automatically be moved up to the top."

The voting system is an integral component of reddit and it is literally the quickest and easiest way to express what you think and let other people know which posts you think contribute and have value.  It's great that people like you literally contribute by commenting but if noone upvoted your comments they probably wouldn't be seen because most people don't read an entire thread.

TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,schrobby,2,Sun Mar 15 11:25:25 2015 UTC,You can adjust the cap in your reddit preferences.
TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,Shaper_pmp,3,Sun Mar 15 12:07:36 2015 UTC,"If upvotes were capped at 2,000, then AskReddit threads would have multiple comments all sitting on that score. You wouldn't be able to tell which is the top comment.   How does that not apply equally to downvotes?  If you cap scores at -1 then the worst trolling or nonsense comments would be intermixed with someone who posted a controversial opinion that pissed off the first two people who saw it."
TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,UnholyDemigod,-1,Sun Mar 15 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"Then make the cap lower, like -20 or so."

TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,Ajnin123,3,Sun Mar 15 11:28:16 2015 UTC,Upvotes sort content and is used as a sort of score for users.

TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,seanziewonzie,1 point,Sat Mar 14 18:12:43 2015 UTC,And submissions can't go past '0' which is -1 for your total link karma. He basically is suggesting the same system for comments.

If they do, at least it  stops ""popular/social justice"" from becoming a thing..."

TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,InfoSponger,5,Sat Mar 14 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Hes really not. He's not saying ""no downvotes"" he's saying ""no downvotes past a certain point"". Since fb has no dislikes, if some piece of shit makes a comment that appeals to thirty people but a thousand people hate, that comment will have thirty likes; those thousand people don't get to have an impact. That's bad. It presents a hated comment as ""liked"". In this system OP is proposing, downvotes still lower scores and cancel upvotes, just not to the point where scores get slammed out of dogpile mentality. But if you see a comment that's got a negative score, you don't have the same misrepresentation Facebook causes.  There's a use to not limiting upvotes: sorting and ranking of successful content. But why not downvotes? Once something gets a lot of downvotes, why bother impacting the score anymore? It's already failed content; it's already going to be hidden."

TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,xiipaoc,16,Sat Mar 14 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"Here is the problem with voting on reddit...   It does not work as humans learn and understand the mechanics of voting are supposed to work. We accept that if we agree with something we vote up and disagree we vote down. By extension this mentality flows over into whether we agree (like) with something or disagree (dislike). No amount of RED ALL CAPS EXPLANATIONS informing us that the downvote is not a ""disagree"" button will change this. We all find it insulting to some degree that a brigade can be assembled to up or down a topic or comment. We find it annoying that a topic will ONLY reflect -1 no matter how many actual downvotes it received. Reddit has ""fuzzy logic"" running to try and compensate for up and down votes, yet will never release these formulas because the reddit users are not only smart enough to find the errors in the system they are smart enough to subvert them as well.   So those are just a FEW of the reasons voting on this site is broken and unless the system is scrapped in favor of a system that actually works you will be forced to limp along on this crutch of a voting system. Which by the way I see NO way in which a system could be designed that would be impervious to user abuses to begin with as long as there is anonymity."
TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,Chronic8888,2,Sun Mar 15 02:16:10 2015 UTC,Since they made it impossible to show uppers and downers I think they scaled back the fuzzing or removed it entirely.

Then the 3 racists come in and upvote it, and now the racist comment is at +2.  It kinda subverts the community, no?  Hiding negative totals may be a plausible thing to do -- the first downvoter makes it go from 0 (let's assume it starts at 0 instead of +1) to ""negative"", and the next 99 just keep it ""negative"" while the actual total becomes -100.  Then 3 people upvote it to -97, but the total still just reads ""negative"".  That might be plausible, I don't know.  But preventing people from downvoting really ruins the balance."

There's quite a difference between -1 (lets say 6 disapprove/5 approve) and -20 (25 dissaprove/5 approve) and it is a significant difference.   Most definitely.  This is why I miss RES being able to display the separate up- and downvotes.  If I have a comment at say, -2, it that's +1 and -3, that could just be a few drive-by downvotes or even some particularly-upset user downvoting from multiple accounts.

They collectively push bad responses and posts out of the sub for appropriate reasons. Many smaller subs are targeted by the blogosphere or folks looking to boost site traffic. They are down voted excessively while the occasional unpopular opinion is left at one point.   It's hard to account for how this works on the defaults. Like on advice animals? Who knows what the down vote paradigm is in such a large sub."
TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,McShizzL,2,Sun Mar 15 09:48:50 2015 UTC,"I agree it's not terribly useful to keep track of negative scores.  Reddit is only any good at finding the most popular content, it doesn't really make any attempt to sort the least popular crap.  That said, perhaps it's useful as an outlet for people's frustration?  If downvotes stopped working after a certain number then maybe redditors would be more likely to leave nasty comments or PMs instead.  It would be an interesting study."

I say keep the downvotes but add a feature that the person you are replying to can't downvote you. Because that's the default move for 99% of people regardless of the facts presented."
TheoryOfReddit,2z1ey2,Autopilot_Psychonaut,2,Sun Mar 15 15:57:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with your thought.  I would also add that having a visible number of upvotes on a post influences the opinion of who sees it; I see a post differently depending on if there's 10 upvotes or 1000, relative to all the others on the subreddit. Same goes for negatives. Sorting posts according to upvotes means that the ones that garner lots in the beginning are likely to keep doing so, and others, which for whatever reason don't, will not. Again, same goes for negatives. For this reason this kind of voting is a problem, because if I'm browsing ELI5, I don't care how many votes it has, I care how interesting it is to me personally, which is something up/downvotes can't measure.  But here's the thing: I don't feel the same way about comments. There can be objectively good and bad comments. Also, if you're on the post's page and you're looking at the comments, then if you see a well-informed opinion/thought (like on Reddit, unlike on Youtube) as the top comment, you're more likely to follow the comment thread down to the downvoted comments as well, and upvote if you agree."

This gives way too much power to people who read trends and game the system."
TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,cromwest,6,Fri Mar 13 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"So what if we use this system per subreddit? Of course, it can't be implemented, but for the sake of argument, let's try this one out.  As a plus, the problem of interfering votes from bigger subs wouldn't be so big anymore. In fact, come to think of it: it wouldn't be a big problem anyway! All those votes on big subs are from lurkers, a group that generally doesn't contribute much, so that they won't be able to vote as much in this system. Even brigading will come to a halt, as brigaders generally don't brigade the subs they're active in, since this would be self-defeating.  This system would also make sure that good content would be upvoted (because only the people that post often and get recognition can vote, etc). I am, of course, making the assumtion here that people who post much post the stuff relevant to that sub. Whether or not this is the case is, as I see it, mostly a problem of the mods of that sub.  I've already mentioned the lurkers, I believe this system has something to offer there as well. Lurkers will need to be posting to vote, and since voting is an integral part of reddit some, if not most, of the lurkers will actually begin to post/comment more in order to vote.  One more problem that might get solved by this system, which you've already mentioned, are the reposts. People would need to be careful about what they upvote, which would mean reposts will get less upvotes.  Now for the cons.  I think one of the major cons are that downvotes would also be restricted to posts/comments. If downvotes are restricted, bad content that got a few upvotes from friends, bots, or unsuspecting innocents, will be harder to deal with, because votes would be scarce, a group of users could take advantage of that.  This bring me to what I believe to be the last, but definitly not least, of the major problems of this system. Every sub with regulars would tend more towards elitarism. There will be a strong group of users agreeing with each other and upvoting each other, which would give new users or redditors with alternating views a real disadvantage. This is even now a problem, but I believe it to be far worse with a system like this implemented.  But of course, there is ultimately only one argument that stands out. If we really look at this from different sides, we have to conclude by this argument that we need this system. What is this argument?  karma would actually mean something."
TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,barrelrollmais,2,Wed Mar 11 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"and since voting is an integral part of reddit some, if not most, of the lurkers will actually begin to post/comment more in order to vote.   I'd wager most lurkers would simply not come back to reddit. They don't have much invested in the website or any subreddits. What makes you think they care enough about voting to start commenting when they didn't want to comment in the first place?"
TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,ColumW,2,Wed Mar 11 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"I think you are right about that, if only partially so. let's define ""lurkers"" first, before I get ahead of myself and write a reply about the wrong subject ahem.  At the moment, we're talking about the people on reddit who have an account and vote. most of those will be reading and voting the main subreddits, since they are, as you already said, not really invested in the site. These people I'll call semi-active lurkers (since they are actively upvoting things.)  I believe that while this is the group we see the most of, it's probably a smaller group than passive lurkers, people who have made an account and are not voting, or people who haven't made an account at all. However we never see the passive lurkers, for obvious reasons. Most active lurkers do have a little investment in the site, because they are voting.   So the semi-active lurkers have a choice: they can become passive lurkers or active members or they can quit from reddit altogether. I believe that all three options will be chosen, depending on the users. However the biggest portion will choose the first two options because of respectively their will to participate or their laziness. The third option would also not be wrong (as seen from reddit users) because all we're losing are a bunch of voters who contribute nothing. since these quitters were passive lurkers who don't buy gold or gift gold, I don't believe they represent a big amount of money to reddit itself, either.  tldr: the portion of redditors that are active lurkers that don't convert to active users won't be missed much."
TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,barrelrollmais,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"I agree that losing the lurker votes won't negatively impact reddit that much. But I don't think very many lurkers are going to start taking place in the discussion just so they can keep voting. The workload of voting vs the workload of discourse is very different.

At that, your guess sounds reasonable.   quality of ""lurker forced to post"" comments (...)   Luckily, those are already around. Remember: they are not forced to participate: they can make the choice to participate with the added benefit of voting (everyone would agree that little amount of lurkers will only post so they can vote, because there must be a motive for voting apart from voting itself.)  So when I say they are already around I mean the ""first time posters"" we see every now and then, a lot of this kind of posts I often find in /r/talesfromtechsupport . I would not like to argue about how to interpret 'quality' (at least not in this post) but the quality of those posts are usually not sub par compared to the rest of reddit, so I don't worry about that."

But as I've said in my answer above, there must usually be a reason to vote, except voting in and of itself. OP's system will only stress this motive. The passive lurkers will either not vote or interact. Either is a benefit for us.   Just for clarification, your problem lies with the active lurkers (which was, as discussed, a small group within the group of lurkers) and than the people within that group who wish to interact, and than the people within that group who made the irrational decision to try and contribute just so they would be able to rate internet posts with (to a non-poster) meaningless pointing arrows.  I won't deny there will be people like that, but it is easy to see that it is a very specific subgroup, which is quite small.  Thus I conclude the problem is moot."

In particular upvotes are free and give let's say 10 points to the user. Downvotes on the other hand require a base level of ""karma"" and remove 2 points from the user and 1 from the downvoter. It all but entirely gets rid of retributional or ""I disagree"" downvoting.   It's tough to dig out cause vs correlation, especially given the major demographic and site interface differences, but in any case it's noteworthy that the signal:noise ratio is visibly better over there while on Reddit it seems to be trending strongly downward."

TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,incaseanyonecared,3,Wed Mar 11 17:52:58 2015 UTC,this is falling into the false idea that stuff that upvote is totally good and stuff that gets downvoted is totally bad. Reddit is a Democracy and what might be cool in a racist sub wouldn't fly in a feminist sub.   It shouldn't be about karma because if it was then you know who would have all the power? Power users. What are Power Users goals? To get more karma so it would just turn into a bigger gaming system that before.
TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,raspberrykraken,2,Thu Mar 12 01:36:20 2015 UTC,"I think most likely it would just lead to less voting, and that's about it. If I'm reading through a thread and run out of votes, I'm not going to find something to post to gain more votes. It'll take too much time, and I'd have to wait for people to vote on it anyways. I mean hell, when I'm logged out, I won't even bother to log in to vote on something unless I really like it."
TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,jsmooth7,2,Wed Mar 11 15:54:33 2015 UTC,"I think a better system would be that you have to earn ups or downs by giving downs or ups. So if you want to downvote you have to upvote something else. Because people are more likely to give negative feedback than positive feedback.  The problem with your system is that the math just doesn't work. If upvotes are a one to one exchange rate, then how would you ever ""earn"" upvotes? It would be a zero sum game."
TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,see_bee,2,Wed Mar 11 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"I don't like it. If we define our goals broadly as ""better posts, better votes,"" the people who vote but don't post are still contributing, provided they are not just spamming random votes. Requiring the acquisition of karma to vote might increase the volume of meaningless posts from people who still want to vote a lot, but it's not going to increase the quality of their posts. I think that people are already posting the best quality they can. Who the heck thinks ""I have an idea for a good post, but I'm going to write shit-tier content instead?""  I'm only one data point, but I think I'm representative of a lot of Reddit users. If I had to generate more upvotes in order to use other features of the site I wanted, I wouldn't do so by making better content. I already make the best posts I can. I pour my heart out in some of my posts and lend the benefits of my professional experience in others. Not all of these generate karma. Some are just buried too deep. Others are 3 paragraphs long and only really written for one user. Often the posts I'm most happy about and work on the longest never get past +3.   If I had to generate karma, I'd stick with short, slightly negative personal anecdotes about experiences that many people on Reddit have. That's where the money is."

TheoryOfReddit,2yn4y5,johnsciarrino,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:56:03 2015 UTC,"Well first it would have to start with users being issued an amount of votes in order to get the whole thing rolling. However the fact that only receiving an upvote enables one to vote would mean that every downvote used would deplete the number of votes in the system until there are eventually none. So the system as you present it wouldn't work.   So you would have to give users more than one vote per upvote received. Let x=the proportion of all votes that are upvotes. Then in order to maintain an steady number of votes in the system (assuming no user base growth) you would have to issue to each user 1/x votes for each upvote received. In order to keep pace with user base growth, each new user would have to receive a number of votes.   Alternatively, each downvote a user receives could decrease the number of votes that they have, but there would have to be some sort of mechanism for when users have a very unpopular post and go into the negatives."

That is, I think it might exacerbate current problems more than it would fix anything.  If you want to address the way people vote, then you should target their actual voting.  Consider for instance if you gave moderators the ability to mark ""good"" and ""bad"" posts and comments in their own subreddits.   Then you could directly effect people's actual votes.  For instance, a vote marked ""bad"" maybe for low effort or tastelessness would have it's voters marked.  And those people who upvoted that bad comment would have their votes unweighted, or perhaps shadowbanned for a period of time within that subreddit.  Likewise with a ""good"" post, people that downvote a substantial post because they disagree with it could have their ability to downvote affected.  If you wanted, you could apply the inverse as well, people who downvote bad posts and upvote good ones could have value of their vote increased, but I think the initial system would be sufficient to produce good results.  And the most important thing is that these values stay insulated within each subreddit, or perhaps groups of subreddits who agree to share values."

TheoryOfReddit,2yg6f8,adminbeast,20,Mon Mar 9 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"I agree that works in smaller, niche subs, but in larger subreddits, I have found the exact opposite to be true. The more ""known"" you make yourself, the more of a target you're presenting to the anonymous public. And when something goes wrong, and something will go wrong, those 7 million subscribers have a bulls-eye for their outrage. Even if you weren't the mod involved.   Every mod that has got out in front of their huge user-base and became well-known or a ""reddit celeb"" has ended up pariah. Examples include people like Karmanaut, Saydrah, etc... In fact, I can't think of any highly prolific mods who are universally liked. The single exception being Kylde but he's not exactly prolific. Just well-known due to his spam-fighting superpowers. Some mods may start out universally liked, but it doesn't last. It never does.   I find that people don't like being reminded that there's someone with authority or power over them, and when you combined that with reddit's demographic, it goes double. When you get out there and begin interacting and become outgoing, many people will think you're just doing it for the attention or spotlight. You may be doing it for completely altruistic reasons but that doesn't matter, it's how people perceive it. People can be jealous, fickle and quick to harbor animosity.  I personally prefer the ""not seen and not heard"" approach if only to keep everything running like a well-oiled machine. ""When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all."" I try to keep my head down and not stir the pot. It's worked out well for me for over a half a decade now. :)"

All large subs with very present moderators and strong subscriber approval. I think this discussion is a prime example of why we should be flexible as moderators with our approach in every aspect. Much of it is dependent on factors like how narrow or broad the subject matter is, the strictness of the rule set, how divisive or politicized the sub can be, and whether the sub has had continued mod involvement since day 1. There's no one size fits all to moderation; it requires a certain level of adaptiveness."
TheoryOfReddit,2yg6f8,astarkey12,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"What about /r/askscience   /r/askscience isn't really a good comparison, they have like 400 moderators and people go to the subreddit specifically to ask them scientific questions. It's a bit of a unique situation. The mods aren't there joking around with the community; they're answering (often difficult) scientific and technical questions.   /r/photoshopbattles, and /r/listentothis?   They're still not what I would consider huge subs (even though they're defaults). ListenToThis has 2.3 million subscribers while PSB has 2.5. Huge subs like r/Pics, TIL, Videos have not double but nearly triple those numbers. They also get triple the traffic. I mod /r/Space which has similar subscriber numbers to those you listed, and the traffic and activity we see in Videos and TIL just isn't comparable. It's still on a whole different level.  Also, I don't think there are any hugely prolific mods in those subs? I actually can't think of a single mod off the top of my head so that says something. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying having a visible mod presence is entirely bad, just that it has the potential to backfire. And it can backfire in a huge way as we've seen."

Qualifies, sure, but my point is that it's an apples and oranges comparison. It's the way they interact that's different. It's sorta unique on reddit. The mods are acting in an academic capacity. People go into the community with the expectation and understanding that there are those who are or have authority (or knowledge) and they seek assistance from them. This just isn't comparable to a subreddit like /r/Pics or /r/Worldnews for example."
TheoryOfReddit,2yg6f8,relic2279,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:41:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's apples and oranges, and this actually supports my original point that each large sub needs a somewhat tailored approach in moderating. The 7+ million subs are extremely broad in content/topics and have also been at the mercy of the default crowd for several years longer than the newer additions. Any semblance of a community (if there ever was one) is completely gone now.   I think we're pretty much both right in everything we've said. The subs you've referenced are higher profile and require certain tactics that aren't necessary in newer defaults since many of them are more narrowly focused with stricter rules. It also helps when you've had strict rules from the get-go and have built your mod team's reputation on having them as opposed to implementing them after already achieving a huge subscriber base."
TheoryOfReddit,2yg6f8,astarkey12,1 point,Tue Mar 10 10:31:07 2015 UTC,"I think you don't recognize prolific mods from those subs because they're good teams who rarely if ever encounter any type of conflict or drama that would draw significant attention to any one individual in addition to the fact that they're newer defaults. The average user knows karmanaut because of the BLB AMA fiasco, not because he's a strong mod.   People generally only remember you when you're doing something perceived as wrong. But to be fair, it's easier to avoid doing something controversial in a sub for music and photoshops as opposed to news and politics. Might be partially attributable to the fact that they're suppressant of anything deemed off-topic, so discussion doesn't even have a chance of devolving into anything meta-related. In L2T, meta discussions happen when and how the mods want them to happen and are almost never reactionary. Again, it's probably easier to do that as a narrowly focused music sub though.   Also, L2T and PSB have only been defaults for 10 months. But thanks for not recognizing me, relic! Must be doing something right."
TheoryOfReddit,2yg6f8,astarkey12,2,Tue Mar 10 10:23:33 2015 UTC,"The average user knows karmanaut because of the BLB AMA fiasco, not because he's a strong mod.   Actually, he was incredibly popular long before then. Leading up to that incident, he was one of reddit's most prolific users. People followed him around and pretty much upvoted anything he said on name recognition alone... That's kind of my point, you may be popular or well-liked for a while, but it only takes making a hard call or doing the unpopular (but right) thing once before they turn on you. I think my point is that if you're not a celeb when it happens, you don't have as far to fall. Even Karmanaut recognized this and went on to create alts and/or sockpuppets to mod under so people would stop following him around and so he could enjoy his relative anonymity.    But to be fair, it's easier to avoid doing something controversial in a sub for music and photoshops as opposed to news and politics.   Yeah, I agree with this. But again, those two subs are still small when compared to the likes of the behemoths. r/Listentothis only gets 2 million pageviews a month according to this. For comparison, a subreddit like /r/Videos gets 100 million pageviews per month. That's over 50x more traffic. We see more traffic in a single day than listentothis sees all month. :) That's not a knock on your subreddit, far from it. I'm only pointing it out because the comparison, to me, is still apples and oranges. You were only recently made a default so it takes time to grow. Videos has been a default for years so it's had a leg up and a head start. It's a dirty cheater is what it is.. :P   But thanks for not recognizing me, relic! Must be doing something right.   Hah, I meant no offense. I'm at the point now in my life where age is beginning to take its toll on my memory (just turned 36 believe it or not). Or maybe I'm more selective in what I remember. Then it again, it could be pure laziness on my part. I'm anything if not lazy. :D"
TheoryOfReddit,2yg6f8,relic2279,2,Tue Mar 10 14:21:24 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this. I mod two major subs, one with ~40 000 subscribers (of which a few hundred are active), and one a default. I find that in the smaller sub, being a mod is seen as a bit of a joke by the community. I can whip out my green hat, get upvoted for it, and generally foster a sense that we're all in it together. I suspect this has to do with the type of sub as much as the size - it's a group that generally accepts that mods do good things, and is there specifically to refute things that they see going wrong when mods don't intervene.  The other is a default. In the first month I modded the default, I didn't do too much that was blatantly visible. Since I've started doing a weekly post and becoming more and more visible in terms of removing comments and posts, and banning people, I've had people follow me around, make hate accounts, and harass me across subs. I find the difference in community fascinating, and I don't think it's necessarily just because of size. Obviously the fact that I put myself out there had an effect, but the group, too, matters. One sub likes mods and likes what they do. The other sees mods as horrible censorship monsters. That, to me, makes more of a difference than the size of the sub."

IMO it's the difference between a king in a high castle who issues orders without ever leaving, and a king who spends time among the populace, learning about his people firsthand and sharing in their joy and misery. The king in the high castle is a distant ruler, an ""other"", while the king that's among the people is one of them. (I'm not saying that mods are kings, of course...)  Here's the catch though: the type of interaction is the most important thing. Many mods think that their main job is to enforce rules, but when you bring that mindset to interacting with the users, then you will inevitably come across as some sort of authoritarian.

Two examples:   /r/futurologyremovals  /r/listentoremoved (aka /r/listentothat)   Many of these subreddits are made to ""keep mods in check"", those are kind of problematic. Two examples:   /r/undelete  /r/unremovable    There's even a sub that keeps track of removed comments.    So it's probably a good thing for people interested in how mods run their subreddit. Sadly in the case of /r/undelete it regularly ends in accusations of censorship and abusive moderation from people who don't care for reading subreddit rules but are simply looking for some kind of conspiracy or boogie man. Undelete might be the reason why some subreddits don't opt for having a removal log subreddit."

The times when it wasn't, the police should police themselves and take steps to punish and/or remove the offending officers.

If police never killed people, who would go willingly to jail?  The enforcement underlying taxation goes away if there is no expectation that the enforcers will use force.  Unless you expect people to willingly put themselves in a cage?    If nobody paid taxes, the police would have to secure funds through voluntary contributions like any other service.  They would have an incentive NOT to kill people because people generally don't like giving money to organizations that unjustifiably kill people."

I have no desire to stop you from voluntarily paying into services and programs you want to support.  I just think we should stop forcing people to pay for these things under threat of jail time.

TheoryOfReddit,2y1oir,vulgarman1,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:42:39 2015 UTC,Taxes are enforced via threat of jail time   I'm going to dispute that. I pay taxes because if I don't they will mark my credit and seize my assets. I don't think a lot of people associate taxes with jail time.   Anyway I do like the idea of privatizing security. AFAIK no country has done that successfully though. You make it sound way too simple.
TheoryOfReddit,2y1oir,PubliusPontifex,4,Thu Mar 5 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"The credit marking is actually a good point.  If taxation was purely enforced via reputation and social mores it would be a lot more acceptable.  The ability for government to seize assets stems from the threat of force/jail time though.  Consider the case where you are in a car the State wishes to seize and you refuse to get out.     I don't think a lot of people associate taxes with jail time.   I think this is deliberate; if they did they would find taxes to be less acceptable than thinking that the only penalty for failing to pay taxes is essentially more taxes.  I don't claim to have the answers for privatizing security; but I have lost all faith in assigning powers to government.  To continue along this line of reasoning, we wouldn't have an NSA without taxes either.  People don't willfully pay for a panopticon."

TheoryOfReddit,2y1oir,QnA,-6,Fri Mar 6 08:51:56 2015 UTC,"Hate for police is what allows the continuation of the cognitive dissonance that exists in reddit as it relates to government.  It's a Love/Hate relationship.  Reddit genuinely believes government really is a tool for positive social change; most redditors want to believe this with every fiber of their being.  Tax the rich, net neutrality, care for the poor etc....    But government is inherently violent and coercive.  Hatred for the Police (and the NSA) allows an outlet against the contemptible parts of government; but compartmentalizing that distaste in a way that separates it from the pillars of their world view.  Focusing on the aggressive and violent nature of the Police (as an entity separate from and far removed from the government that enforced Net neutrality etc...) helps shield them from having to realize that it is government itself that is necessarily violent and aggressive.  Police violence is a symptom, not the disease.  The disease is Statism itself."

What is it about this particular social issue that holds reddit's interest? It's obviously a controversial issue that is of interest to the youth. And by ""youth"", I mean anyone under 25. Kids, teens and young adults have a disproportionate amount of dislike for authority, even those with no reason to distrust authority hate anyone who holds authority over them.   Go to a high-school and the students there all have a general disdain for their teachers and anyone working at the school except for the janitors and lunch people. Why? Those people have no authority over them. Everyone else gets the stink-eye if they can get away with it.   When that ""authority"" gets taken down a couple pegs by scandal, the kids eat that up. This even happens here on reddit. Just look at all the mod hate. Kids can't stand authority. As you get older, you start to understand why there needs to be an authority and you accept it. By then, you've also accepted the fact that ""the authority"" is human and prone to make mistakes so the little mistakes don't turn into scandals. Not that these police shootings are ""little mistakes"", I'm just commenting on reddit's general distrust of authority. Which, by the way, is usually a sign of immaturity."
TheoryOfReddit,2y1oir,QnA,-2,Fri Mar 6 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"The older I get, one thing I've noticed about ""authority"" when it comes to government is that when government screws up, it gets bigger to correct itself.  It never scales back.   Kids can't stand authority   Because it's a fundamentally oppressive and wrong concept to assume that some specially group of people have the authority to rule over another.  Almost every instance of widespread abuse in history can be boiled down to some group thinking they know what's best for some larger group of people.  Authority is an illusion."

Do you think teachers rule over their students? Do you think cops feel like rulers in their cars as they hand out speeding tickets?   It's this very mentality that is immature and naive. Like a teenager rebelling against his parents.  As you get older, you realize one very important thing, people need leadership, protection, order and direction. Hell, 5 minutes on reddit watching the hive mind work should tell you that. Mob rule is the last thing anyone should want. It's why when groups of people get together and live together, governments form naturally.  Now I'm not one to make assumptions, but your naive viewpoints come across as a bit anarchist or libertarian. If that's the case, well then, there's really no point in discussing this with you. You see authority as straight up evil. But life isn't black and white, it's shades of grey. So if you can't accept that some authority can be good, we don't have much to discuss."

I would argue that the post with the gilded comment made it's way to an entirely different audience because it was on the frontpage or highly sorted via /r/all, and when that happens people who don't normally see a subreddit's material start viewing, voting, and commenting.   The other post, 950 karma. You would almost have to be viewing that specific subreddit to see it. Less people, votes, comments. Smaller cross section of people than something seen in /r/all.

Take a look at this!"" This changes the post from just a criticism/satire of Russia to a clever and more relevant post.

I think that the standard readers of /r/worldnews will recognize how many things are simply wrong with the comment and downvote it.

So you'll find something that's actually pretty uncontroversial and reasonable hovering well in the negatives because, after a the first few people downvoted it, a lot more people got some kind of pleasure out of doing so, too. This happens a lot in subs that are dedicated to intense fandom of a specific work or set of works: if someone posts something that basically amounts to an opinion that countervails the received wisdom, they'll get downvoted pretty quickly regardless of their tone, and then eventually end up in deeply negative karma hell."

In that regard, I resented the bot because it did limit discussion.   I think, ultimately, it did more harm than good, especially since it did encourage brigading."
TheoryOfReddit,2xtauo,SavinaRoja,3,Tue Mar 3 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"The biggest concerns I've seen are drama and brigading. When a meta post is made, a potential brigade is born. Including the original user-made meta post as well as the meta response from a user or meta bot like /u/totes_meta_bot. On one hand there is the desire to quell brigading behavior and so it may seem better to not have the meta bot (it doesn't do anything a human can't but it does it more, and better). On the other hand is the desire to bring the first potential brigade more into the open, then at least it will be known and perhaps addressed. Which of these matters more and/or can there be a balance?  Then of course, it's not all about the brigading issue either. Sometimes meta produces fun, insight, and positive discovery of communities. I'm certainly not the first to muse on brigades, but I might posit that the concept of ""community"" on reddit is critical to understanding the opposition to brigades. If one views a subreddit as the central unit of reddit communities, then an influx of contribution from the outside may distort it or degrade its quality. If one views reddit itself as the community, then brigading is not so unusual. There are merits to both views I think, and there is room for both to exist. If a subreddit commits mostly/wholly to the former then it becomes private, while public ones strike some sort of balance between the two (/r/AskReddit might be a good example of the polar extreme from a private sub).  This balance is not the same for every subreddit, nor is it a constant in time. Some subreddits remain public yet have in/formal policies that the subreddit not be mentioned elsewhere. I'm sure many can think of other examples of meta-efforts within subs to direct the community's character due to growth or flux.  If you're still with me, thanks, I'll cut myself off here and get to the point. I think a meta bot can be an asset, but different people use reddit in different ways. In the best case, the meta bot should be nuanced enough to not interfere with anyone's style; respecting individual communities is an aspect of reddiquette. I will argue that much of the anger towards meta bots stems from a lack (I don't mean to say total) of per-subreddit customization.  To what extent do you agree or disagree? What do you think a good meta bot could offer? How do you think a meta bot could be implemented gracefully?  I'll leave off with a few ideas:   Subreddits opt-in/out for external mention. Subreddits opt-in/out for allowing meta bot report. Subreddits blacklist/whitelist specific subreddits for which meta reports are made. Meta bot messages moderators and/or OP, vs posting a public reply. Customizable by subreddit. Should meta services be monolithic (perhaps even core functionality), or should micro meta services be the norm?"

TheoryOfReddit,2xvx21,InOranAsElsewhere,8,Wed Mar 4 07:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think it would be important to get demographics on these sorts of things before trying to make a judgment call.  Do people circlejerk about things they do believe in or things they don't believe in?  Many CJers will claim they are mocking their own viewpoints, but is this actually the case?  Look at this subreddit intersection of the original /r/CircleJerk from last May:  https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditAnalysis/comments/26f3gc/rcirclejerk_drilldown_may_2014/  I'm not sure seeing the subs that come up is a good indicator, since they would only be relevant upon knowing what the populations of those subs was at the time, but what you can probably glean from it are the subs that are clearly missing.  Is it any surprise that /r/Atheism doesn't appear in that list?  /r/TrueAtheism does appear but very low (then again, it has a very low sub count).    One of the reasons I no longer post to TIA is that it began to feel less like mocking bad reasoning / extremists and more like a genuine hatred of ""feminazis"" and subtle racism.  I'm still subscribed, but I no longer comment (nor read them) because many times, the people lampooning this reasoning (and no, not sarcastically) make up equally poor explanations for their ""side"".  I think it's likely that, to some extent, the racist / redpiller subs use TIA as a sort of gateway since their goals more or less align with what is, outwardly, a well-intentioned sub.  It's a real coincidence you posted this now.  Earlier today I spoke with a user who was confused about how philosophers believed in god for what they felt were ridiculous reasons, like ontological arguments.  They appeared to be under the impression that most philosophers were religious or at least theistic.  How did they come to this belief?  Something they read in /r/BadPhilosophy.  While I rarely post there - my philosophy mostly consists of what I've read with no formal education - the sub's intention is to point out ridiculous reasoning and ""stoner"" philosopher.  However, sometimes I do feel like the vibe that user got was very real.  Maybe that sub really does cater to more theologians and theistic philosophers?  How can we get that data?"
TheoryOfReddit,2xvx21,jokul,4,Wed Mar 4 08:17:24 2015 UTC,"Good analysis. One thing in particular I'd like to take note of is   Do people circlejerk about things they do believe in or things they don't believe in? Many CJers will claim they are mocking their own viewpoints, but is this actually the case?   To be honest, part of why I bring this up is I fall in between the Social Justice-jerk and Anti-Social Justice-jerk, as I'm a jaded social justice advocate, tired of how much the extremist, unhinged end has damaged the movement... So I'm unsure of where that leaves me."
TheoryOfReddit,2xvx21,jokul,2,Wed Mar 4 08:30:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't think that those people (or you for that matter) are lying, I just think that those who will publicly announce their position on a CJ will be the ones who do ""politically correct jerking"".  I can at least conceive of a silent majority of CJers who are really in these communities to hate on whatever demographic the CJ mocks."
TheoryOfReddit,2xvx21,InfoSponger,2,Wed Mar 4 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also, from your initial comment   I think it's likely that, to some extent, the racist / redpiller subs use TIA as a sort of gateway since their goals more or less align with what is, outwardly, a well-intentioned sub.   As a former mod of that sub, I can tell you without a doubt that this happened. While this stuff was often downvoted, the more subtle recruitment was often not even noticed."
TheoryOfReddit,2xvx21,InfoSponger,3,Wed Mar 4 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"I am actually happy to see this brought up because it plays into a recent realization I had, ""CJ is just not for me"". I am exactly on reddit as I am in my day to day life. If I would commit it to text here, I would commit it to words in person and vice versa. But it took the realization that not everyone is this honest about themselves and their words/posts for me to decide that until online anonymity is done away with ALL online interactions are just open wells of delicious water waiting for the cesspool to invade.  Sure I have thoughts and opinions that for one reason or another I keep to myself in person. They might be offensive to others, inappropriate for the room, etc. But online it seems that no one exercises these kinds of filters. Some people say things online for the express purpose of being offensive when you know for a fact that these things wouldn't be said in person.  Now you can have some sort of idealist mindset where free speech should not be infringed or even a view that includes a social dynamic in which no one should fear any sort of physical retribution over mere words, but I promise you this.... I support your right to freely express yourself with words, but I also support the rights of a bunch of people kicking your ass when you go running through the wrong neighborhood yelling, ""Nigger Nigger Nigger!"" Not that there is a ""right"" neighborhood to yell such things to begin with but I think this illustrates the point I am trying to make.  Be it circle or silly as a preface, in the end it is still jerking. When I factored that tidbit into the realization about online anonymity and lack of filter I began unsubscribing from all kinds of subreddits. When you combine this type of general mindset to just say ""what-the-fuck-ever"" with the RAMPANT stupidity displayed by a large segment of redditors I find myself enjoying reddit less and less actually. It's almost as if over time each online community becomes a reflection of the lowest common denominator who carve out a place to roost.  You hear about a cool place and hang out there for a while and then watch it degrade to the point that you move on and leave those users behind for somewhere else. When all of the ""good users"" have exited the ""bad users"" look up one day and realize they aren't offending anyone anymore and go looking for where the ""good users"" are now and invade there. Myspace, Digg, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, the list goes on and on.   I thought they would have just been happy in each others company at 4chan but no. Apparently it is far more lulz to fuck with me than it is to fuck with their own kind online. In person however, I would knock someone the fuck out when they told me how they were going to fuck the eye socket of my dead mothers skull."
TheoryOfReddit,2xvx21,InfoSponger,1 point,Wed Mar 4 09:38:50 2015 UTC,"See for me, my circlejerking is primarily a way to act silly in a way that I don't often get to in my day to day life. I'm often incredibly serious in my daily life (bordering on morose) so silly-jerking on reddit allows me to act silly in ways I don't often get to."
TheoryOfReddit,2xvx21,InfoSponger,2,Wed Mar 4 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Are you willing to admit that you ""sillyjerk"" online because of the anonymity and wouldn't otherwise if your actual identity were attached to your words?"

TheoryOfReddit,2xdupq,lvysaur,9,Fri Feb 27 21:30:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure since Reddit stopped users from being able to see specific upvotes and downvotes, they reduced the amount of vote fuzzing and auto-downvotes for popular posts."
TheoryOfReddit,2xdupq,mullerjones,5,Sat Feb 28 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"I realized it too. I started noticing upvote count for major posts since I read a thread here about how the votes are calculated to keep popular posts from now to get higher than posts from a time where there weren't as many redditors. And, lately, I notice that's starting to vanish. No post got over 4.5k but recently I've seen more than one at 6, 7 or even 10k."
TheoryOfReddit,2xdupq,HighYellowBlackMan,3,Sat Feb 28 04:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Reddit's vote algorithms are weird. I think they may be logarithmically displayed instead of just having the position calculated logarithmically. For example, the first 10 votes are 10 points, but the next 100 may only count for 50, and the next 1000 may only count for 300, and so forth. It looks like they may have changed that, because even simple AA posts are getting as popular as big net neutrality posts from two months ago."

That's the question.  Like I mentioned in the post, the Reddit 'about' page states that about 1.8m users logged in yesterday.  I'd wager that the total unique user accounts that log in every month should be significantly higher, given the number of people who just check reddit once a week or a month or on weekends and so on.  If I had to guess I'd say 4-6m of the 8m are active each month."

It doesn't encompass all possible users. It encompasses the users who are active in any particular thread. So 90% of the people who open this thread will read comments and leave, 9% will participate in voting in some way, and 1% will leave a comment.    In my personal experience with posting photos on reddit exclusively (through a private imugr account) I find 90/9/1 to be fairly accurate in general, relating the view count of my photos to voting and comment activity."

This might be the case, but only for text based subreddits. For subreddits like /r/pics, /r/funny, and subreddits with content that link you away from the Reddit post itself, the number of people who read through comments and vote/participate as a percentage are likely what the 90/9/1 rule suggests:  90% view content provided, move on. 9% read through comments to some extent, mostly top comments 1% comment, vote, or both."

TheoryOfReddit,2x0jj5,angrypotato1,10,Wed Feb 25 00:47:44 2015 UTC,"Last month, Reddit had basically 160m users. That means that, taking our guesswork further, the total amount of (undeleted) Reddit accounts in history, amounts to just under 5% of the monthly uniques.   One problem with this estimate is that 'unique visitors' will always overestimate the actual number of human beings who have looked at the website. Someone accessing reddit from their phone on different wireless networks will appear as a different visitor. Someone with a cable modem at home doesn't necessarily have a static IP address, so they will appear as a different visitor. Considering that it seems to be very common for people to reddit from work, school, etc, you probably have to scale that 160m number down by a factor of several, maybe an order of magnitude, to get a reaonable estimate of the number of humans actually using the site on a regular basis."
TheoryOfReddit,2x0jj5,c74,6,Tue Feb 24 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"This is a fair and valid point, certainly.   Still, I question the total number of users that really reddit from a huge number of locations.  Anecdotally, there almost seems to be quite a division between 'phone' and 'desktop' users, judging by discussion sometimes in the comments.  Does the casual user, who probably doesn't have an account and doesn't check reddit multiple times per day,  really use the site on a vast number of devices each month?  I'm not so sure.  Still, like you say, it does make an impact."

It would be interesting to see how this applies to Reddit, since there's multiple channels and a much larger population sample."
TheoryOfReddit,2wyw8h,authorsa,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"There already are comments about the Eastern/Western difference in users, but most importantly is the relatively conservative/liberal difference, which will probably greatly influence opinion discussions like these.   On a related note, I find that posts in the times when Americans are sleeping to have less comments; even redditors sometimes recommend posts to be reuploaded at a different time for better visibility. Maybe you can post this again at some other time and gauge different answers?"
TheoryOfReddit,2wyw8h,eferoth,3,Tue Feb 24 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"less comments   This is because, as you said, the Americans are sleeping. Page-views for most subs are almost halved during that time, so are comments."

Much of reddit is US-centric, but approximately 40-50% of the site are non-Americans (and a smaller but still significant proportion are not even from the continental Americas).  You might even see subtle gradation of attitude and cultural bias given the various timezones across the USA, with a three hour difference between the east and west coasts (implying a similar demographic bump of various groups of people waking up, getting to work, taking a lunch-break or arriving home in the evenings)."

Something relatively unique happened?  I don't believe you (play clip from Anchorman). Something happened to somebody that I've never personally experienced myself?  Well, seeing as I lack the ability to put myself in another's shoes, I highly doubt that happens - unless you can provide pics that have been authenticated as not having been photoshopped!    Ugh.

I won't upvote crap posts that simply happen to agree with me... but it's rare for me to upvote posts I disagree with.

This was one of the most surprising results for me; I would have guessed that the fraction would be closer to 30% than 60%. Perhaps some users simply don't think to utilize this feature, which might be the cause of long conversations occurring in comment threads rather than via PM.   I met my boyfriend because I sent him a PM. I've had a few interesting conversations in reddit because of the PM function, and actually met one other person because of a PM conversation besides my boyfriend.     When I first started using the internet a long time ago, and then in the late 1990s and early 2000s, I participated in quite a few online messageboards/forums/communities. Reddit is kind of similar, but the anonymity is really the big difference. With those other online forums, although there was anonymity, it was also easier to get to the stage of knowing real names, ages, details about real their real lives, and where they lived. It seemed like it was easier to become friends that way, and there are actually still people I consider friends whom I met through those messageboards fifteen years ago.     I find the PM function on Reddit to be the closest thing to establishing that kind of closeness, although to be fair, the conversations I started through PMs were never done with the intention of ""Hey, let's be friends!"" One was sent because I found a six-month old post when I was using the search function on a particular topic, one was to tell an author that I liked their stories, and another was simply, ""Hey, let's take this to PM because we've been replying to each other for days on this AskReddit thread.""      I guess I'm more open to sending PMs because I miss the messageboard of the '90s. I don't know. I didn't even do the original survey because I don't subscribe to /r/SampleSize, but wanted to elaborate on that one point (Can you tell that most of my research is qualitative? :P)"

I've only ever been alive in this millennium, so I'm fairly out-of-touch with these archaic services you refer to. I don't think I've ever had a super close connection with someone via PM, although I made what I'd consider a friend and had a really interesting conversation about how math competitions work in their country.  About the anonymity, I think that could, and perhaps already has, warranted an /r/TheoryOfReddit post about why Reddit is more protective of anonymity than other forums, like Youtube or Facebook-associated commenting.

Reddit is a different beast to the forums of my teenage years, and that's fine.     I was going through a box of old letters recently and found letters and card from people I met through online communities back in the day, and it's kind of nice to read them again. We wrote about things that were happening in our lives at the time, like real life friendships, just conducted at a distance.      Reddit I see as much more of a giant black hole of stuff, and except for a couple of small subs I go to frequently, I find it difficult to remember usernames. Even with the subs I do go to the most, I couldn't tell you their real names, how old they are, where they live, or any of those mundane details like that, which is a very big part of how Reddit is."

You can tag people, and I've started doing this to an extent that I'll occasionally run into someone who I've already tagged with context from whatever scenario I met them in.  I think an interesting part of the anonymity is that while almost everyone on reddit except for celebrities is very secretive about their real-life identity, I have no doubt that a reasonably dedicated stalker (perhaps using various websites to locate older comments of mine) could probably uncover my real-life identity (or at least be 70% sure of it). And yet I don't ever say what my name is, or reveal a lot of my personal information in one place. I'm not sure why this is, really; I think anyone who was going to bother with doing something to affect me irl would also put in the effort to find out who I was even if I made it more difficult."
TheoryOfReddit,2wqzd7,BOLDTHUMB,3,Mon Feb 23 10:22:28 2015 UTC,"I do have RES installed, but don't really use the tagging option that much. AskReddit is a sub that I visit pretty regularly, and it's too big for tags to even make that much of a difference. With the smaller subs, I certainly recognise usernames but I couldn't tell you too much about their real life.  With one of my older reddit usernames, I used a name that I use pretty much everywhere else on the internet, and anyone who knew that username and then read a few of my posts could have worked out it was me. With this username, you could probably still work out who I am, but it would take a fair bit more time to work out my exact identity.  I could delete this account and begin again, but I don't think I care that much, really."

The most active, most-interested redditors are going to be the people in this survey. That is probably the top 10% of contributors, which is like the top 1% of redditors in general. The 90/9/1 rule applies here, and we're looking at the results of the most interested 1%.    If there were, say, 2000 survey participants who came from the entire broad swath of reddit users, then there might be some results we could rely on, even if there would be an uncomfrotable margin of error, but we're still not accounting for the vast majority of redditors who never go beyond lurking."

Conversely, I find myself scrolling to the bottom of threads just to read the below threshold comments (I wonder how many other redditors do this?).  If I see reasonable shit that is simply contrary to the 'reddit party line' I'll give it an upvote (which, sadly, I don't do for similar comments that are still in the positive), but if it's all just garbage as expected (memes, lols, ""this""), I'll definitely pile on the downvote.   I would say for every 8 below threshold comments, only 1 is of the variety that deserves an upvote.  More often than not, contrary-to-circle-jerk posts are left at 1 and ignored, I find."

That is, when people face the fact that the Holocaust happened, they have a tendency to become more antisemitic.  The thinking is that people try to justify the fact that bad things happened to people, and one way that they do this is by assuming that the crime was just and the victims are to blame.  I think this might be a scaled-down version of the same effect.  Basically, downvoted comments get victim blamed.  We see something bad happening to someone, and some part of us wants to believe that they deserve it.  As a result, we find something to accuse them of (in the case of downvoting, that the comment actually is bad) and say that they deserved what they got.  This is an unfortunate effect in the human psyche, but perhaps there is a golden lining.  If the same effect, victim blaming, is in play on this small scale as well as larger scales in the real world, perhaps it is possible to find a solution on this scale to the problem on a larger scale."

People on reddit need to realize the power of conformity.  The actual psychological effect.  If you see a comment at -3, you're instantly primed to view the comment as ""probably a shitty comment"", and you therefore parse it with that presumption in mind.

I try to make myself reread negative score comments and sometimes I upvote or ignore it. And of course more often the downvotes are correct and it's a comment that should be buried.  So yeah, I would say it's very true that a downvoted comment makes readers more likely to think negatively about the comment which leads to more downvotes."

I am a bad person.  The big exception is in IAmA when there is a celebrity scheduled to go on. It seems very common to see every early post sitting at 0 or -1, while a question slightly later (like 1 minute) is at 1.

Saint Victoria From Reddit is aware of this, though, so hope exists for RedditKind.  I just go through the 0 questions and get them back to 1.

One of the main discoveries in the class is that people don't poll consistently. Again, that alone doesn't like much, but some of the poll data (I forget the amount of people taking the polls, but it was enough that the margin of error was low) showed that people often believe one thing and then do something entirely different. For example, a state might poll in support of marijuana legalization but then vote down a referendum to make it so.   A political science dude would say that these voters lack conceptualization. In simpler terms, these people don't understand (or have yet to form) their own beliefs on the topic, and they don't connect a higher level belief with spur of the moment action. Another term for this is called a latent opinion. This is where I think my anecdote relates to your findings. Americans (as this term was coined based on US polling) form their opinion about a situation on the spot, and it's unlikely they even connect the decision they make (or the words they say or the action they take) with a deeply held belief.

People are inconsistent in their beliefs. Take a hot button issue and ask the question in two different ways and you'll get two conflicting answers.  Do you believe every citizen should have legal documents proving they are a resident to live here? Yes.  Should we deport children of illegal immigrants who have no such documentation? No.  I like /r/cromulent_word's video in this thread.  The truth is, given a room with no recording equipment and enough time to talk, a typical politician can persuade the majority of the room to their side within a few minutes armed only with their words, because so few people are familiar with the philosophical background that drives most political discussion. You can run around them in circles and they'll be forced to at least admit they need to think about it more.

The majority of it's demographic is between 13-25 years of age. I know a lot of people at the tail end of that demo don't consider themselves so, but they're all still kids.

The behaviors mocked there are ones that are stereotypical in the culture to the Fat, such as-   poor diet apathy/inertia with exercise greed about food loud/obnoxious behavior entitled attitude impoliteness and inconsideration for others' space or boundaries   Most of the people posting there are just as upset by those behaviors as Thin or Regular sized people would be; the fact that they're Fat doesn't change their negative perceptions of those behaviors.   Going to that sub and posting a story about an encounter with someone who has 'fattitude' is a way to distance themselves from those behaviors and point out that while they, themselves, may be a bit 'hammy', they're not obnoxious people---not like the ones they're writing about. I think that adding their own personal statistics or info is a way to distance themselves further; simply pointing out that they have good manners while these other people do not, isn't enough- they're accustomed to being judged by appearance only, so they feel the need to make the separation as clear as possible.  It's a way to deny the stereotype for themselves, while still being able to vent about seeing it in others.

Suppose deleting a comment with a lot of downvotes removed those downvotes and restored my karma.  I make a comment. A bunch of people downvote it for one reason or another. I notice this, and think ""Huh, that could negatively affect my karma. I should get rid of that"" so I delete my comment. I'm assuming that having positive karma gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, which I think is a reasonable assumption for a lot of people.  Off the top of my head, I can think of some benefits to that. It would give me a chance quietly retract something I said, rather than having to defend myself and escalating it into an all-out flame war. That's good for me because I get to keep my precious karma, and it's good for everyone else because people who would normally have started an argument with me over that comment never even get to see it after I delete it (which I have incentive to do if it restores my karma).  So, what do vote brigades, ""hivemind influence"" and people being dicks have to do with it?"

Equally, however, someone so enslaved by their need for social approval that they're only prepared to even acknowledge a belief they have if they already know everyone around them implicitly agrees with it is a boring, spineless wimp.  Feel free to enjoy karma when you get it, and feel free to let it sting a bit when you lose it.

It would give you a chance to pretend you never said something.  That's a totally different thing.  If you want to retract a comment you have to leave it there to begin with so your retraction means anything in the first place.  And you can do so easily, by posting a follow-up in the discussion or editing an retraction into the top or bottom of your original post.  Pretending you never said something is a totally different idea - it means you can never be held to account for anything you do or say on reddit, and you can quietly re-write history to your own advantage.  Even deleting posts without it affecting your already-gained/lost karma is cowardly and revisionist, but positively encouraging people to do it by also letting them escape from any consequences accrued while the comment was visible seems intellectually dishonest, and a corrupting influence on the community.   rather than having to defend myself and escalating it into an all-out flame war.   Or, y'know, just post a retraction.  Or just stop responding to replies to your comment.  Hell, reddit even gives you a handy ""disable inbox replies"" option underneath each comment you make, specifically so you can easily ignore replies to comments you made without having to delete the comment or try to rewrite history.  What you're doing here is proposing a change to the social mechanisms that make reddit work as a community, in order to save yourself a little temporary butthurt when you say something unpopular or stupid.  Sometimes unpopular things need to be said, and you're not necessarily wrong for saying them even if you get downvoted.  Equally, stupidity needs to be identified and publicly punished, so it doesn't just dissuade the person posting it from doing it again but also everyone else who sees it.  With all due respect, the butthurt is a negligible, truly irrelevant consequence and the social systems that serve to inhibit unacceptable behaviour are a profound and vital part of reddit being as successful a community as it is.  It's like suggesting we take the propeller off the plane in mid-flight because you personally find the noise slightly irritating.   That's good for me because I get to keep my precious karma   Honestly, I think you need to grow up a little bit and care less about karma.  If you're so weak and spineless that you refuse to say anything that someone else might disagree with (and in the case of brigading, that can be a very small proportion of the community) then you're unlikely ever to say anything worth saying.  I don't mean that as an insult - although it's certainly impossible to phrase it in an inoffensive way, for which I sincerely apologise - I mean it because it's seriously something you should think hard about.  Are you really so terrified of a basically meaningless number ticking down or a tiny bit of social disapproval that you'll go and retroactively try to deny you ever said something you believe in?  If so I suggest you might have bigger problems than merely losing a handful of karma on reddit.   it's good for everyone else because people who would normally have started an argument with me over that comment never even get to see it after I delete it   Actually no - it's very bad for everyone else (by which I mean ""the community at large"").  It means that:   The entire ensuing conversation loses context, so later posters can't make any sense of it. Any useful developments or lessons learned in the ensuing conversation are lost. Anyone else who might otherwise have seen your downvoted comment and learned important lessons themselves about what content reddit approves of or doesn't approve of now doesn't learn that lesson. Anyone who might have seen your name and remembered you as a crappy poster/bad debater/racist/asshole/idiot/etc now doesn't get to see that, and hence you get to get away with bad behaviour. Equally, anyone who might agree with your comment now doesn't get to see it, register their approval or be reassured that they aren't the only one who thinks it.  I've lost count how many times I've seen comments dip into the negatives before later posters come along and vote them up highly.  Delete it the second it dips below 0 and that will never, ever happen.   Every comment is a historical fact, and context for the comments that come after it... and arguments (even acrimonious ones) are not always regrettable things that should never happen.  A lot of the time they're the way we divine truth, and the way we work out issues.  Every stupid statement is a chance for the community people to learn when it's corrected, and everyone hung out to dry by a vote brigade is a chance for the community to notice the pressure group and unfair voting and begin to self-correct.  The fact that a comment might not have been appreciated by the tiny fraction of the community that saw it does not mean it's worthless, or didn't need to be said, or doesn't substantially add to the discussion.  And equally, if someone's posting bad content in a public forum then they damn well should suffer the indignity of being downvoted, and should be left as a public statement and warning to other shitty posters that that kind of behaviour is not tolerated by the community.  Ultimately you move all these important mechanisms that help the community self-balance, maintain consensus and provide historical context for later discussions... for what?  So you can post crappy content without suffering the penalty, or so you can carefully prune your comment history to only the blandest, most derivative and boring statements that nobody could ever disagree with?  What's the point of posting, if that's all you ever want to contribute to the discussion?"

I know in practice this isn't usually how people act, but at least in my experience, even if people don't always upvote a good post they disagree with, they'll usually downvote a boring or repetetive post they do agree with.  If a comment of mine gets downvoted a lot, it would be silly not to at least consider the possibility that maybe people are downvoting because they saw it as irrelevant, or annoying, or mean-spirited, and not just because they disagree.

TheoryOfReddit,2w1d29,Shaper_pmp,2,Mon Feb 16 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"Are you arguing against giving people the option of deleting their posts at all?   Not necessarily (sometimes it's arguably worth doing for serious enough consequences, such as when someone accidentally doxes themself, or posts copyrighted or confidential information, etc).  I just disagree that it's worth destroying a public record of the conversation to save someone a tiny amount of temporary butthurt for something they were happy to publicly say in the first place.  You can't un-say something in real life, so why should you be able to do it online?  And if you couldn't, don't you think that might encourage people to think a little more carefully about what they said, instead of injecting any old shit (or insults, or racism, or whatever) into online conversations?   at least in my experience, even if people don't always upvote a good post they disagree with, they'll usually downvote a boring or repetetive post they do agree with.   With respect, my experience on reddit over the last six years or so has been the exact opposite.  Most people treat the downvote button as an ""I disagree with this"" option, not a ""this adds nothing to the conversation"".  Likewise most people will cheerfully upvote any old crap that flatters their preconceptions, but will only upvote comments they disagree with if they're extremely well-argued and insightful and phrased carefully.  People will upvote lame puns (""I did Nazi that coming!!!"", etc) the hundredth time they see them, and will still upvote those ""clever"" comments where each person merely rearranges the words in the comment above them long after the rearranged comments stop being relevant to the discussion, and often still keep doing it after they stop even making sense.   If a comment of mine gets downvoted a lot, it would be silly not to at least consider the possibility that maybe people are downvoting because they saw it as irrelevant, or annoying, or mean-spirited, and not just because they disagree.   True, but most of the time it's merely because they disagree with it.  And after a few downvotes it's usually shuffled to the bottom of the thread or even collapsed by default, so nobody else has to see it to disagree with it unless they want to.  However, if someone does want to see it (or link to it, or refer back to it later) they still can.  You're giving the community the choice of how they want to deal with the content, as opposed to not only presuming to know what they want, but also presuming that every member of the community necessarily agrees with your decision.   I don't think that's a true statement about me -- I said something that you disagreed with, didn't I?   Right, and if five more people (you're currently on +4) had disagreed with it enough to downvote it you would have deleted your comment, right?  Fair point that I was employing hyperbole - you aren't deleting your comment if it gets even a single downvote - only if a handful more people of the minority of the community who happen to read it downvote than upvote.   Even if I did suffer from some social anxiety that made me afraid to disagree with people, why is it so important to you that people on the internet face criticism?   It's a combination of things, but among them:   People should have integrity - if they're willing to say something in public then they should also be prepared to stand by those words even if (in fact, most importantly if) challenged or disagreed-with. If you say something and later you modify your position or change your mind, one should acknowledge their previous position and then note that they've changed their beliefs (and ideally, even why) - not only is this more honest and good exercise for your own sense of integrity and self-awareness, but it also provides a learning experience for anyone coming to the conversation later (especially people who hold the same initial position belief as you), as they may also be persuaded by your change, or tempted to look into whatever caused you to change your mind.    You strike me as the kind of person who would be happy if every conflict in the world ended like a Shakespearian tragedy, with everyone dead or traumatized but justice served on some cosmic level.   Not at all - I'd rather every conflict in the world ended up with people achieving reasonable consensus, and noting what that consensus was, and why and how the different parties achieved it to reduce the chance that other people are then forced to play out the same conflict later themselves.  It has nothing to do with suffering or trauma, and everything with people being honest about their beliefs, not presuming to hold beliefs unless they're based on something and they're prepared to defend those beliefs in the face of disagreement.  If that requires some small, temporary butthurt for the odd individual then so be it - I think the benefits to the individual and society are far, far greater than the drawbacks.  Incidentally, did you really intend to equate ""losing a few karma points"" with ""a Shakespearian tragedy, with everyone dead or traumatized""?  I'm assuming you were just employing hyperbole and rhetoric, because otherwise the position is too ridiculous to even address (and would entirely validate my point, to boot)."

There are plenty of things you can do online that you can't do in real life. Some of them are good.   With respect, my experience on reddit over the last six years or so has been the exact opposite.   Is it possible we've been using different subreddits? If people by the hundreds are downvoting high-quality posts because they disagree and upvoting low-quality posts because they agree, that doesn't sound like a community that's likely to have high-quality discussions, and I'd rather not be a part of it.   Right, and if five more people (you're currently on +4) had disagreed with it enough to downvote it you would have deleted your comment, right?   No, but if it got into the negative tens or hundreds, then it seems to me like it would be time to consider that I might be the one who's being an asshole, rather than everyone else. If the difference between -1 and -100 seems arbitrary to you, then fine, my decisions are arbitrary.  At least in all the communities I've been part of, when a comment gets downvoted a lot, it's not because it was a provocative and sparked a lot of discussion because people disagreed with it; it's because, rightly or wrongly, the members of the community saw it as intrusive and irrelevant. To the extent that their is discussion, it quickly devolves into exchanging insults.  If, on reflection, I realize my comment was useless or just bad, I don't think there's much value in leaving it there. It's not like anyone would genuinely miss it. If, on the other hand, I think it had potential to contribute to the conversation but people responded negatively, maybe there is some value in keeping the comment up.  But if you're using the metaphor of real-life conversations, then so can I. If there are a group of people having a discussion who believe ""X"", and one person who believes ""not X"", it seems to me that it's rude for all the ""X""ers to gang up on the ""not X""er, putting down everything they say and drowning them out. The ""not X""er is at a disadvantage, and it would be nice if the ""X""ers realized that and acted accordingly. If the ""X""ers are rude and deliberately drown the ""not X""er out of the conversation or insult them, it might be admirable for the ""not X""er to stick around and try to be heard anyway. But if the ""not X""er says ""I don't need this -- if these people aren't going to show some basic level of politeness, I don't owe them anything"" and decides to leave the conversation, I wouldn't blame them.

You're talking as if every comment on Reddit is someone defending their sincere opinion on some subject of importance. This is not the case.  If, for example, I make a dumb joke that doesn't land, and everyone hates it, what are the benefits of leaving it up as a matter of public knowledge?   Incidentally, did you really intend to equate ""losing a few karma points"" with ""a Shakespearian tragedy, with everyone dead or traumatized""?   No. I equated ""the unshakable desire to make other people act morally or face the consequences online at all costs"" with ""the unshakable desire to make other people act morally or face the consequences in real life at all costs""."

No, but if it got into the negative tens or hundreds, then it seems to me like it would be time to consider that I might be the one who's being an asshole, rather than everyone else.   Not really - if it gets hammered that badly then it's almost certainly because you gored a community's sacred cow, you're being targeted by a downvote brigade or a few people vehemently disagreed with the comment to begin with and the rest of the community has piled on in a feedback loop of social-disapproval and public castigation.

TheoryOfReddit,2vsxzl,aphoenix,2,Fri Feb 13 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's totally a valid concern as well.  One trick you may already be taking advantage of is you can omit the domain from your links and just link to /r/ffxiv/search?q=....  But it will still be longer for most scenarios.  That link trick works with any reddit.com links though; but it will exacerbate the stickiness of custom domains.  If all your links are of the relative /r/subreddit/... form then if a user hits your sub from say np.reddit.com all your sidebar links will keep them on that same domain.  If people used language domains for their intended purpose this would always be the desirable behavior, but given that the functionality gets abused for things like np. you might want explicit domains in your urls."

TheoryOfReddit,2vsxzl,nowhere3,7,Fri Feb 13 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"when I wrote that flair code, I'm pretty sure you couldn't do flair searches flair search only looks at the flair text, meaning all your flairs need a text component, which is largely clutter filtering and searching aren't the same thing. Intuitively, I don't expect a filter to turn up results from 3 years ago if it's in an active sub. Using the CSS version still adds a dependence on the sub's activity. CSS filtering is easier to copypaste between subs [I had no idea DIY was using that code:P] the need to support non-reddit.com clients is non-existent. Sidebars only end up being shown at reddit.com; furthermore, having CSS filters doesn't prevent searches from being done using the language domain means you can easily show which filter is active, by comparison to a search bar, which could be very complicated/hard to read. the search bar takes up space in the listing section of the page finaly, and the most important reason: when I wrote that code for /r/facepalm, I was also going change the header to say other things, which makes knowing the active filter important.   My preferred solution however would be to get user-flair classes added to the body of the page, which would let users choose filters using their user-flair, and avoiding the misuse of language codes. The admins however,    dont want filters on reddit, and  don't want pages to change based on what flair a user has   another thing people do is add something link #header to the end of their filter link. This only allows for one or two filters though."

Sidebars only end up being shown at reddit.com;   Only because existing clients suck.  One of the reasons I'm asking about this is because I'm trying to develop a browser based reddit client that mimics reddit at the DOM level and supports subreddit sidebars and CSS styling.  But the domain hacks are a difficult thing to replicate.  This is a buggy incomplete proof of concept: http://politicbot.github.io/#/r/diy  Searches don't work right now but they can, domain hacks will be very hard to support in a generic way, but might still be doable.  Even aside from my concerns as a developer, the user experience feels subpar when using css for filtering vs letting the api do its job.   using the language domain means you can easily show which filter is active, by comparison to a search bar, which could be very complicated/hard to read.   This is absolutely a valid concern, but I think it may be solvable with clever use of input value based css selectors.   the search bar takes up space in the listing section of the page   This is easily addressable via CSS as well and is closer to its intended purpose."

TheoryOfReddit,2v4rhm,Tezcatlipokemon,7,Sat Feb 7 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"You can't just say ""subreddit"". There are distinct types.   Subs like /aww and /wtf are almost exclusively product/consumption based. The /Asks are based on exchange and conversation.   My own, /r/knitting, is a combination of both. There are two very discrete sets of members -- those who lurk, look, and upvote the most ""like""able"", and those who ask/reply. It's the second group that mostly creates the content, but the first that has the power over the front page ranking.   Our culture has become established enough that anyone being a jerk is immediately called on it (and reported), unwelcome posts are always met with a polite ""this doesn't belong here, try r/whatever"" by non-mod users, and most savvy regulars know to just downvote/hide/move on.   The sub seems to police itself. But it can't. There is always going to be a need for active moderation.   All it takes is for one browser (or a drive-by daytripper) to post a cute cartoon of a cat tangled in yarn, with no attribution and no comment (that's three strikes), and for that post to get upvoted straight to the top by fellow gawkers (which it will be, if it's cute), and for us mods to allow it to remain, and I guarantee there will be two more the next day, five the next, and then the puppies will start.   And then will come a cat with crochet, and a puppy with macrame, and a ferret with knitting needles, and then a ferret with a frisbee.   Each post will move incrementally away from the sub's purpose, each will seem harmless, each if allowed to remain will cue the next.  Monkey-see-monkey-post is just too strong and too fast.    The churn of newcomers who don't yet ""get"" the subs character/goals is always going to have the power to sway the front page.   I do not personally believe this will stop if/when we get enough posts per day to make it hard to read them all.    We've hit a sweet spot where actual interaction has become self-policing, but reddit's reverse ""broken-windows"" effect, in which perceived success breeds attempted imitation, is always going to need direct moderation."
TheoryOfReddit,2v4rhm,japaneseknotweed,10,Sun Feb 8 09:56:45 2015 UTC,"There are two, maybe three, different dynamics at work here. Dunbars number relates to intensely close relationships, I believe. Reddit is not intensely close.  Second, Reddit, as all internet conglomerating sites must be, can either grow or die. Hence, a great compromise was the development of subreddits - a brilliant move. At least there came a chance of breaking into smaller groups where community norms could direct the culture - even for really silly or vile subcultures.  Then we have the issue of spill-over, where a noxious community (I'm looking at you, /r/atheism) with strong views jumps into other communities and all hell breaks loose.  But I doubt that an arbitrary assignment of users into a group would do anything positive. Unless we had some sort of way to sort people... maybe a magical hat?

TheoryOfReddit,2v4rhm,Eternally65,5,Sun Feb 8 00:12:20 2015 UTC,"So included in the number is everybody you are actively tracking, you are expending some energy maintaining ties with, that you have an interpersonal relationship, OR that you want to one day reestablish ties with if circumstances arise--so in a basic sense i think it means somebody you are actively caching data in your brain about. I think the coverage would extend over some reddit user relationships but not the typical. Maybe those in a close knit or small sub that interact more frequently.  I can say with authority that over in /r/Dogecoin if you spend time people know you, form opinions and prejudices in both directions. Maybe assisted by our very handy record of previous interactions and RES (which I dont know how that affects the Dunbar idea, but I am not sure they know either--extension of written language and their stores doesn't seem to be treated to great satisfaction within the concept.). Still unless you are scanning every reddit user against your user character database (but doesn't everybody?) at time of contact, you'll need at least what is analagous to a pointer in computer memory, something that directs locally (here, your brain) to the proper place in the external store where the bulk of info is kept on a subj. So there should still be a limit.   To some extent you are right that reddit is not close enough to have these kind of relationships on the reg. But maybe it's a matter of structure and home groups or something like then would bring about a new level of community. I think its a possibility.   Well now I think you are onto something with the hat. I am involved in (and at this very moment going to plug) sales of magic glasses maybe we could require these up front with accounts and figure out the rest later.   Now I am guessing you are assuming that we assign these groups at account sign-up which is probably ideal. But you also could wait a year, six months, a month and then sort. There's a wealth of data we see like karma, comments, sub activity etc. and likely some we don't see presented every day about use.  It wouldn't have to be a big compartmentalizing thing.

TheoryOfReddit,2uwxsy,shelchang,3,Thu Feb 5 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"Setting aside some particulars of this case that some others have already pointed out, I think the answer is that there is little real reason.    The most importantly thing to the success of a submission is just chance.   If a persons submits a lot, they will get some of their link submissions noticed by the Reddit userbase on the whole.  If a person doesn't submit a lot, then they lower their chances of success.     The first person to submit on a topic should, ideally, be the one rewarded with the upvotes and karma.   But often it's the johnny come lately that the userbase decides had the better submission.   Often it's a submission that is obviously not very good too.    How many times do you see a news story from a news-blog site that is 3 or 4 paragraphs long get all the upvotes, while a real news story from a real news site (BBC, Reuters, NY Times, Chicago Tribune, etc.) that contains good back-story and good analysis mostly gets ignored?       The userbase of Reddit is fickle.   What they choose to up vote in mass often has little to do with the actual quality of the submission.    In short, it's not about you or your submission.  It's about them more than anything else."
TheoryOfReddit,2uwxsy,davidreiss666,2,Fri Feb 6 01:20:07 2015 UTC,"Be more precise in your titles.  Also, there's bots who vote on the default subs to keep certain sites above others. And there's bellweather wannabees who vote in the New Queue that determine if things get a lot of votes who decide these things based upon whether the text fits Reddit's circlejerks."
TheoryOfReddit,2uwxsy,desantoos,-2,Fri Feb 6 02:10:12 2015 UTC,Your title is shit Your picture is not better than the other picture   Making front page worthy stuff is a bit of an art form that you haven't learnt yet.
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,HarryPotter5777,38,Wed Feb 4 07:25:31 2015 UTC,"Its called the ""Call to Action"" and is used everywhere in social media and marketing. Anyone with a business degree or a degree in psychology could have told you that one. Its why every youtuber says ""Like, share, and subscribe"". Its not that they're begging but on average they'll receive 50% more views if they have a call to action at the beginning of their videos (more comments/likes puts it higher in Google's algorithm so it gets promoted more). It's why infomercials tell you to call the number 100 times during the commercial instead of just telling you more about the benefits of their product. They WILL get more sales by telling you to call as annoying as possible."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,AllAboutGamers,11,Wed Feb 4 11:23:48 2015 UTC,"And certainly explains a lot of Facebook posts with the ""share this so we can get xxx likes"" or ""to see if it will go to all 50 states"" call to action. People see it as a public service of sorts. Gives them a feel good for contributing which I'm sure is what the case was in OPs math post."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,hairierdog,4,Wed Feb 4 13:40:28 2015 UTC,"How is calling attention to the upvote a call to action? ""Remember to subscribe"" is a call to action. ""Hey guys, we changed the upvote arrow"" doesn't seem like a call to action."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,amici_ursi,8,Wed Feb 4 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's clearly a call to action to ""try it out"". Sure, it's not as direct as others though."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,a_fucken_alien,22,Wed Feb 4 23:38:16 2015 UTC,"It flabbergasts me every time it's proved to me, but apparently the vast majority of redditors just flat-out forget that upvoting is something you can do.  Reminding them is bound to cause an uptick."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,Atario,6,Wed Feb 4 10:50:29 2015 UTC,Yep. I almost never upvote posts simply because I don't remember to
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,Extractum11,2,Wed Feb 4 23:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do this all the time. I'll comment, and see the automatic oranging of my comment and then remember ""d'oh!"" I forgot to vote.  I think this is especially true for redditors who frequent meta circles, because many of us get terrified into never voting anywhere."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,hermithome,14,Thu Feb 5 07:01:46 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll see if your theory holds and this gets highly upvoted!  I bet this could be solved by scraping submissions that contain the word ""vote"" and seeing if the average point value for those is higher than a selection of other random submissions."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,AnalyticalAlpaca,11,Wed Feb 4 08:04:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that it will catch a lot of posts that say ""don't upvote"", which is a separate phenomenon that has the mixed results of either people rebelling (see: test post please ignore) or actually following said advice. But excluding something along the lines of ""don't upvote"" will then exclude actual things like ""I think the users of this sub don't upvote enough."" I think the easiest way to get this data is to just spend a lot of time manually collecting data from these posts until a large sample size is gathered."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,EternalInflation,6,Wed Feb 4 08:09:49 2015 UTC,"When you say theory do you mean hypothesis? I like this hypothesis and I think it's worthy of investigation. I like social media, it seems to give a fast and inexpensive way to test or falsify social science hypotheses. Anyone know if there's any studies on the effects of social media on the testability and repeatability of social hypotheses? A lot of ""Call to Action"" seems like pandering, it's really sad to see these people seemingly ""beg""."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,heterosis,6,Wed Feb 4 20:50:06 2015 UTC,Quality post.  I wonder if upvote gifs get a higher score than on average than downvote gifs or just whatever reaction gifs.  A scrape of /r/highqualitygifs might work for testing this (not that I know how to do such a thing).
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,ErrorlessGnome,3,Wed Feb 4 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! It's my first submission to /r/TheoryOfReddit  and I was a bit worried about creating something awful.  My intuition says that upvote gifs would do a bit better, but I think it's mostly drawing attention to voting in general. I don't know if the difference would be distinguishable from whether or not people just like upvote gifs more."

TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,BlackPresident,3,Wed Feb 4 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know I'd you're on to something or not,  but I upvoted you to support your theory."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,BlackPresident,4,Thu Feb 5 01:42:38 2015 UTC,"If you look closely too, the user only has 2.8k link karma despite this."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,BlackPresident,3,Thu Feb 5 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting, although I think this is more of a fact about Reddit's score-interpreting systems."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,jdquey,3,Thu Feb 5 04:24:47 2015 UTC,How do you mean? I would expect it just takes all of your submissions and adds the total post karma together:  http://www.reddit.com/user/ProRustlinFederation/submitted/  His link karma should be about 14k
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,jdquey,3,Thu Feb 5 04:27:12 2015 UTC,"Right, and the fact that it doesn't means that Reddit isn't counting all 12k karma towards his/her user profile for some reason."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,jimmyolsenblues,3,Thu Feb 5 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"True, so neither of us are sure why it does that.."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,creesch,4,Thu Feb 5 04:44:52 2015 UTC,"Well, seems that your theory worked for this post :).  I'm curious about what is exactly permissible regarding the use of the word ""upvote"" in a post. I've seen redditors give reminders that upvotes gain visibility (such as here, here, and here).  Does this violate asking for an upvote?"
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,danny_b23,2,Fri Feb 6 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm a little surprised that the second one survived, it's probably because the body of the post was actually good quality. In general asking for upvotes is acceptable if:   It's a mod post with important content A self post with content that should actually have visibility /r/circlejerk  Not much else   I think asking for upvotes in the title is particularly discouraged, if it's at the bottom of the post's body it's probably acceptable. Note that the second and third posts you linked, the ones with more explicit upvote-begging, were upvoted in the 70 to 80 percent range, while the first one was over 90% upvoted."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,PostNationalism,2,Sat Feb 7 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds plausible, but as you pointed out, hard to say for sure without more data :)."
TheoryOfReddit,2uqfry,thadil95,3,Sat Feb 7 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"People upvote things they don't even read. Its amazing. If something has 5 it goes to 10, if something has 20 it goes to 40.  No way everyone reads all those posts they upvote."
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,Riley_2025,18,Tue Feb 3 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"Given how finicky the admins have become about what counts as ""vote manipulation"", combined with the age of my account I hardly vote at all anymore.  If voting on a thread is a bannable offense just because of where I got linked to it from; I'd rather not bother.  I've been more of a reader/lurker for most of my reddit days anyway."
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,go1dfish,9,Tue Feb 3 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Hopefully voting your reply up is safe.  Voting up your top level reply, though informative; could be seen as attempting to improve the exposure of my own comment in an evil attempt to amass useless internet points.  So I'll try my chances with this one instead."
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,go1dfish,2,Wed Feb 4 02:28:12 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple, though. Vote on threads you see on your frontpage, on /r/all or within the specific subreddit. But then I never really upvote/downvote. It's not really worth it, unless the submission is new"
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,Zakkeh,14,Wed Feb 4 02:31:35 2015 UTC,"I would think that voting on top posts doesn't have much to do with the viability of new posts; it is whether or not you vote at all on the new content.  The two aren't mutually exclusive.  You can upvote a post with 4550 karma just like one with 3 karma.  Some people just don't take the time.   This sounds to me like a call for Knights of the New, or whatever the term is that reddit likes to use for people who intentionally wade through /r/all/new looking for good stuff before it gets buried.    New content doesn't get buried by the front page, new content get buried by other new content."
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,cbat_Maersk,0,Wed Feb 4 02:35:30 2015 UTC,What I mean if we should be more thoughtful of what we upvote.
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,CalvinLawson,5,Wed Feb 4 08:02:42 2015 UTC,Why?  I usually upvote based on instincts.  If I had to think through every upvote I would probably just stop voting at all.
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,SloppySynapses,4,Tue Feb 3 18:17:37 2015 UTC,Unfortunately that's exactly why so much shit content gets to the front page. I'm guilty of it too.
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,cbat_Maersk,-1,Tue Feb 3 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"I don't mean that, of course."
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,cbat_Maersk,7,Tue Feb 3 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps this is irresponsible of me, but when i'm in the top100 of /r/all, I tend to upvote/downvote fairly absent-mindedly just to clean and clear out content.  I figure once things hit 3000+ karma, it isn't going to make a difference in the long run.    But I do pay more attention when in specific subs, or on my own front page, which rarely has posts over a few hundred karma."

I'm sure everyone's done this at one point. What I do is I will go to a sub like /r/CasualConversation, and I will just upvote everything just because I love the sub and I want it to grow. Also if the submitters see people upvoting their content, they will be more motivated to post there."
TheoryOfReddit,2unqqt,Creep_The_Night,5,Tue Feb 3 18:45:53 2015 UTC,Interesting you mention /r/casualconversation.  That is the only sub where I upvote everything and everyone unless I have a good reason not to.  It is one of the most friendly and laid back subs i've come across.

Yeah that kind of conflict is very interesting for the study...when I was designing the scenarios I found myself varying on the acceptability, tendency, and punishment of the same behaviour as well.

TheoryOfReddit,2udz9q,yaix,9,Sun Feb 1 13:42:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, yet on the other hand many of the most upvoted comments are trite and pointless one liner jokes or ""circle jerk"" style comments - namely just speak badly of a majority perceived bad thing without adding content or speaking positively of a majority perceived positive thing without adding any content. For example, worldnews is the largest ""serious"" sub. Here are the top 3 comments on the most recent article about an Iraqi guy going on a revenge killing spree against ISIS:   +2291) I hope he got the ones who were responsible for his sons death, can't imagine the anger he was feeling. +2146) The son was avenged seven fold. +1639) his son was a college kid.... his dad probably worked his life away to give his son a chance of a better life and these slugs take that away from him. fuck.   Interestingly enough, the sort of users that make these comments also tend to make almost nothing but these sort of comments so you can even use their own post history as evidence of the fact that there's something strange (not in the conspiratorial but rather the sociological sense) going on. The vast majority of their comments end up in the -1 to +3 range and then every once in a while one, largely identical to the rest, just goes supernova.  In any case this is all just hypothetical mental masturbation. Reddit can't get much larger than it already is, but it can certainly get a whole lot smaller. Social interaction sites are finicky. The difference in reception of changes at times seems as mysterious as one pointless comment getting -1 and another pointless comment getting +2000. It's not a wager I imagine most people would be willing to take when you're already this successful."
TheoryOfReddit,2udz9q,rwbj,2,Sun Feb 1 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"I have to thank you. You improved my reddit experience 100% by teaching me about the use of those collapsible buttons.

It might be a bit off putting (why is that bird there, why does /r/anarchism have so many sunflowers, how come the sidebar in /r/civ has those weird faces?) to new comers but it does help the community, and when you stick around you start getting the hang of the subreddits atmosphere and changes to the subreddits CSS seem to be community driven, making it feel like the mods are paying attention (even if you don't see the thread where they decide to change it the joke they made the change about will be around).   Subs with a stagnant CSS seem to be kinda sad, like as if the moderators don't visit or read the new queue, but that can be untrue, maybe they think it's just perfect."

However,  in some communities,  that help I mentioned earlier can be defining.  an individual  visual identity  can be  key to growing an individual feeling  community.    However,  beyond those simplistic points,  once you have a  recognisable identity,  you are pretty much done.  An interesting question  is "" should we revamp the css?"".  if what you have is not  actual shit,  and doesn't make the experience more difficult,  the only reason I  see for a revamp is if a  noticeable change is required,   I  mean like a change in the air, s  renewal  of  users,  more than css.  My example is karmacourt.  you tell me. Actually, I  have done /r/captionplease, /r/kamacourt, /r/karmacourtblog, and to keep the list short /r/artbuddy.

I'm kind of upset they went after the recent text changes instead of actually making the default stylesheet a bit more aesthetically pleasing. Maybe they're afraid it'd ruin their image or turn away the ""function over form"" nerds.  I wholly disagree with your opinion that they are mutually exclusive, by the way. For example, flair filtering. Keeping rules in the sidebar tidy. Making navigation more intuitive. Adding menus to the top like in /r/shitty____. Making the search page not an confusing mass of eyesore. The list goes on and on. There are so many changes that could be added to make this a more welcoming place, but with more and more visitors coming via mobile, it's probably not Reddit'$ priority."

Flair filtering and such can be a bonus for organizing posts, and therefore the sub. I have always felt that the reddit default was trying to be as NOTHING as possible, nowhere at all, a neutral and strictly organizational thing, possibly to better allow people to deviate from it, and also to claim a stake in the world of slightly geeky, programmer-like pure content don't-look-at-us sort of thing, perhaps where the reddit roots were once. It does have certain ""young user"" points, like tiny text and a very thin header, and I also feel that the new text thing is just to come out of that a little bit and open up to a wider audience that doesn't specialize in tiny fonts. In a nutshell, more readable, and possibly more compliant with readability specs out there. How people fill their sidebar, though, is different problem. I suppose that all this is part of the problem of ""WHAT IS RIGHT?"" and there is no big answer to that one that would cover everybody."

People didn't want to wait for a new thread to arrive so they made a subreddit and that became /r/nosleep.  Soon, it was evident that people were making up stories just for the art of it, and while that's great, and while I don't want to insinuate the stories before were always truthful, at least there was an aura of ""this really happened to me, I needed to tell someone about it"" that made them exciting.  /r/nosleep is just straight up horror prose now, with predictable twists, ridiculous nonsensical scares, and pages and pages of ""OMG GREAT STORY I'M SHITTING MY PANTS"" ""LITERALLY THE SCARIEST THING I'VE EVER READ"" as replies. I don't want to read amateur horror prose. I want Humpermonkey-style recounts of things that have happened to people.

It allows you to make swift, succinct, and authoritative connections between otherwise randomly unconnected statements without the trouble of explaining what your source or authority actually is.  It’s great.  It’s hugely better than its predecessors ‘I read somewhere that...’ or the craven ‘they say that...’ because it suggests not only that whatever flimsy bit of urban mythology you are passing on is actually based on brand new, ground breaking research, but that it’s research in which you yourself were intimately involved.  But again, with no actual authority anywhere in sight.”   ""So"" is basically the same thing, but more casual.  It's definitely a good way to hook people in.  Do you think it counts as clickbait?"

You can see the full comment chain here, where several others pipe in with additional criticism.   So, have you looked into that whole arbitrary subset of posts vs. rest of posts thing I mentioned the last time you did this? Quote from last time:   I wonder if the relative volume of the posts plays a role here. Presumably OC posts are a small fraction of all reddit posts, meaning that the non-OC post category has a ton of junk posts that bring down the average.  For example, what if we compared the average score of DIB posts vs. the average score of the rest of reddit posts? Or the average score of any arbitrary subset of posts vs. the rest? Can we take a quick look at a few subsets just to make sure that relative volume isn't the real factor?   The same issue applies here: The volume of posts starting with ""so"" is very small compared to the rest of the posts on reddit.  I really think you really need to address this issue before you can continue making these claims that some subset of posts does better than the rest of posts on reddit."

I feel bad that you are getting a lot of flak from people on r/dataisbeautiful. For all of their fancy chat, none of us can critique their work because they don't have any to post (with the exception of u/rhiever of course).   Anyway, one thing that I think would strengthen all of these analyses is a ""spam"" filter type thing to get rid of a lot of junk. In my own experience working with this data, there are tons of posts that don't seem be generated by any sort of human process. Posts with titles like ""1239aifadajf"" in subreddits called ""r/a2jjc"", and the like. I think that the critique that u/rhiever has about filtering by any sort of human signal (like containing [OC] or starting with ""so"") is valid because that filtering gives you a much higher fraction of non-spam inputs relative to the rest of reddit.   In my opinion, it would be a good use of your time to develop a subset of that data that's ""higher quality"" (devoid of spam, etc) that you can then run these analyses on. A little bit of work now would pay off a long way in the future.   Not that I have any particular expertise in this sort of thing but I'd be willing to help out. PM me if you're interested."

TheoryOfReddit,2tuq64,shaggorama,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:09:50 2015 UTC,"might be an understatement   Yea but you don't really need to engineer it to the Google level or anything crazy like that. If you did something simple, like ran the titles through a filter for having english words or looking like a sentence, etc, you would probably get a rid of a lot of the crap.   I'm not sure what you qualify as little but it wouldn't take weeks worth of work. It will require you to use something more than SQL queries but its really not a monumental efforts. Plus if you just go to github and search for ""spam detection"", you'll get tons of libraries that you could use.   But putting spam aside, my suggestion was to build a corpus of Reddit posts that are somehow ""higher quality"", in the sense that it gets rid of a lot of the junk posts. Other people have suggested only using links that have at least a score of 5, or only using subreddits that appear in the top 100 by activity. I think all of those are good suggestions and it would be worthwhile to consider only running your next analysis on that subset.   And, for what its worth, building a basic spam detection algorithm is the second or third project that an undergrad would do in an undergrad machine learning class.

I know a company I worked for did.  be sure to know that there are hundreds (if not thousands) of accounts set up simply to ask the right questions and give the right answers that lead people to desired conclusions.  these accounts are also encouraged to browse and use reddit in their personal time as well making them harder identify as someone with nefarious motives  There are baddies out there not just trying to trick you into giving them your upvotes, but trying to win your hearts and minds as well. In all likelihood, it’s working because they’re extremely skilled at what they do.   I mean, you tell us that you've successfully fabricated a story for votes and then you come here and tell us another story.   The last time this came up here in ToR, I asked the exact same questions and got zero evidence. If there really are companies manipulating reddit the way you claim, there should be proof. The alternative is that every single company who does it has never slipped up.

So it's important to identify those who aren't a real part.   Or.  People, especially users of Reddit, believe they are smarter than everyone else. Pointing out that you haven't been fooled is a big ego boost and a signal to everyone that you are smart.   Both are deeply flawed unfortunately. You can't have a true community online in the same way that you do in person. Your online persona is what you present to others. Which is why it doesn't really matter if marketers are adding content. The community is what you experience. If you enjoy experiencing something, then it's valuable. It's not fake because online everything is fake / everything is real. It's what you make it.

AMAs designed to sell products, viral videos (or weak attempts at making a video go viral), and even user posted pictures of things drivers do that annoy them can all be acceptable content even if they are misleading, untruthful, or profit-motivated.  Sometimes, the most educational part of these posts are the comments and discussions within the post.  I remember the white civic posts. I recall thinking ""bullshit"" at the time.. but either way, the first post captured the idea of one of my biggest pet peeves while driving. Even if I don't know the whole story of why the person behind the civic was blocked, I know it happens enough to me that it's good observational humor. Just like when a stand-up comedian makes humorous generalizations. They may not be 100% accurate 100% of the time, but as long as they are relatable, the audience can find enjoyment in sharing that relatable experience.  I also think some people on reddit take your advice too far sometimes too. If someone that has no affiliation with Taco Bell posts a picture that happens to have a product with a Taco Bell product, /r/hailcorporate or individual users will point and shout about it. The OP could just be posting a picture that happens to have a product, but because we have to view everything with a skeptical eye, we end up overreacting sometimes.  ...  Edit: What is up with the spacing on this sub?"
TheoryOfReddit,2trvm5,hsmith711,3,Mon Jan 26 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"I see the 'It doesn't really matter if something isn't true, it can still be educational/entertaining' thing a lot. You're right that without fictional situations, it would be hard to create dialogue over issues which may rise in the future. The problem comes when people are specifically claiming that things happened to them which are complete BS. I wrote a really long reply on the subject recently, here is an abridged version:     When somebody makes a post and includes a suggestion of legitimacy in the title (EG: ""This just happened to me today"" or ""Reddit, meet my brother""), the content automatically takes on a more personal relationship with the viewer. You may not know this random person posting a meme, but the fact that it is ostensibly a true story gives it a 'This could happen to you too!' effect. The more outlandish and entertaining the 'true story' is, the more of an emotional pull it has.   This is why there are things like the 'Guinness Book of World Records' or 'Ripley's Believe it or Not': your standard for the incredulity of real occurrences is astronomically lower than that of made-up stories. It is simple logic- one can lie about literally anything, whereas there are finite constrictions on how interactions work in reality. In our world, no matter how hard you try, you are not going to go faster than the speed of light, but in Star Wars people routinely travel at multiple times this speed. If you were to read a news headline saying 'Man Travels Faster That Light!' it would blow your mind and overturn everything we understand about physics, whereas if you read a news headline saying 'Millennium Falcon Travels Faster Than Light!', you would think 'Why the fuck is this in a newspaper?'  It does not take a quantum leap of philosophy to see why truth matters; why a good journalist will sort fact from hearsay, or why historians will try to discern history from legend, even if legends are more interesting: because truth lets you expand and contract what you understand to be possible. If you see evidence throughout your life that a baby cannot be born speaking fluent Latin from the second it leaves the womb, you will never expect a baby to be born speaking fluent Latin. If you see posts on reddit every day about people dropping their cellphone and breaking it, you will expect that your cellphone will break when you drop it.  Now here is where is all returns to the original point: it is very possible that lying for an entertaining story can hurt someone. When you meddle with what people expect to plausbily occur, you can put them in a bad situation. Now obviously somebody seeing an incredible story and taking it without a grain of salt is an idiot in the first place, but there are many situations where one can demonstrate the effects of bullshit.     One of the most famous examples is the AA confession bear:   My sister's boyfriend is an abusive asshole and a drug addict: I killed him with his own drugs, they ruled it as an overdose   This post caused an absolute shitstorm, and ended up with warrants issued and a police investigation which lead to the man responsible for the post, who then finally admitted it was made up.  There are countless examples of people using maladies like cancer or autism to get attention to a post, only to have it revealed that the story is fabricated, which takes away legitimacy from actual cases of cancer or autism, and spreads a 'boy who cried wolf' dynamic. In fact, the proliferation of blatant bullshit across the internet is precisely what makes people now automatically assume any out-of-the-ordinary story is a lie.  Another way fake stories can harm is when they are used to push an agenda. People will pretend that a sequence of events 'actually happened to them' but instead create a strawman to reinforce their beliefs. This is the type of stuff that usually gets submitted to /r/ForwardsFromGrandma or /r/JustNeckbeardThings-    I was waiting in a store when a man said 'happy holidays'. A navy SEAL punched him in the face because that is not what America stands for, and the whole store cheered, including the cashier! An eagle named 'small government' flew into the room and shed a single tear on the constitution, and then free bibles were handed out!   A user on /r/TheoryofReddit or /r/NoStupidQuestions once put the effect of bullshit stories very eloquently: they cause a sort of 'story inflation', where people keep trying to outdo each other by having more and more unbelievable stories. Truth obviously cannot compete with fiction, so you end up with a wasteland of fabricated crap. Truth loses all value, and is impossible to discern from all the chaff."
TheoryOfReddit,2trvm5,hsmith711,0,Tue Jan 27 12:43:43 2015 UTC,"You cover a wide range of types and motivations for made up stories there. The first, a story like the one OP mentioned is harmless in my opinion. The stories in each of the two posts are likely to happen on a regular basis. Oblivious driver blocks other drivers vs driver blocks other driver as revenge for aggressive driving. Neither of those things actually has to happen to the OPs for them to be relatable stories to an audience. You see this most often in stand up comedy. Comedians make up characters, family members, events just to go along with a relatable humorous story. I'm sure some people leave the comedy club thinking the comedian actually had a dog named Rufus, but nobody is harmed by them believing that.  Some of the other examples you give have varying impact, but again, overall, I have no issue with the stories. I know for a fact that I cannot control what people post. I can only control how I read and interpret the content and how I react to content. I am aware that some people have irrational reactions. I'm also aware that sometimes a particular story + reaction combination can have some potentially bad outcomes. I find that interesting. I learn something from the story + reaction + outcome.

You go outside of the bounds of the thread and investigate to find the truth.  To me, your comments based on your findings are just part of the story. People like you contribute to my interest in the story.   However, your investigating may also be flawed or inaccurate. It's also possible that some people do what you do and intentionally provide misleading or inaccurate findings to spice up the story even more. (I'm not saying you do that, just that it's possible some people do.)  So if I were to take your research into the eBay scam as 100% absolute fact, I would be guilty of the very same thing you and the OP of this thread are warning about. Which again brings me back to:   I cannot control what people post. I can only control how I read and interpret the content and how I react to content.   The internet, magazines, newspapers, books (fiction & non-fiction), even the bible are full of stories that are anywhere from 0% true to 100% true.

TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,CODDE117,4,Tue Jan 27 06:52:02 2015 UTC,"I have to add my own observation. Sometimes, a meme falters during stage 2. These memes stay small, never really hit their stride, and don't leave reddit/4chan. They stay small, miss their puberty, and don't get to the stage of popularity that made them hated by reddit. These jokes tend to stay within certain subs. Things like ""& Knuckles"" and ""is kill"" didn't really gain over-popularity, and only stay used when they make sense, and tend to never get negative attention.  Anyways, your post was great, and I could never have explained these stages like you did."

TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,Hail_Bokonon,5,Tue Jan 27 08:04:18 2015 UTC,"You forgot 2 points  It becomes overused to a point where it starts losing it's original meaning/context. It start being used for similar things that don't quite match the memes 'requirement'. The socially awesome/awkward combo meme is a good example, the original joke was it started out seemingly normal and turned awkward on the second line, people started just using plain awkward text the whole way, then the combo meme was born which actually serves the same purpose as the original. It gets worse when it spreads to mainstream media it starts losing the original text/theme. People start using the picture with literally any old text on top of it.   Then there is the spinoff stage where people try to cash in on Spinoffs or combo memes. Then stuff like Scumbag Stacy or GG Boss are born. A lot of these spinoffs don't last outside of the initial hype of the meme."
TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,Circumspector,4,Mon Jan 26 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"It becomes overused to a point where it starts losing it's original meaning/context.   Reminds me of ""epic.""

TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,sprashoo,4,Mon Jan 26 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"As a meta theme to your meta observations, I'm realizing that there's also a generational thing not just in what memes are favored, but in paying attention to memes at all. About 5-10 years ago I thought memes were hilarious and was aware of them in their fairly early stages - today I mentally block them out, and barely recognize the ones you've listed."
TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,gethcake,5,Mon Jan 26 23:52:17 2015 UTC,"By ""generational"", I take it you mean that you've matured? As in, you don't possess the same sense of humour that made you follow memes originally?"

TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,gethcake,2,Mon Jan 26 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Perhaps this could be generalised to the groups who generate them - since they grow older, the group ""grows out"" of existing and future memes?"
TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,sprashoo,2,Mon Jan 26 19:54:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think when people are young it's very important to them to be part of a group, and sharing memes is part of that. Not consciously, but memes seem  interesting and attractive (and funny) because they are shibboleths for the desirable 'in' group.   As one gets older, these kind of things start to seem silly and less interesting. Most are not inherently funny - it's more akin to how a group of teenage friends can be rolling on the floor giggling about something that isn't actually 'funny' in an absolute way. Their reaction is more one of bonding over an idea than of actual appreciation of something humorous, although subjectively they perceive it as funny at the time.   One view of it, anyway."

TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,hex_m_hell,4,Mon Jan 26 20:10:27 2015 UTC,"This actually makes a lot of sense if you imagine that memes a phenotype for a gene that identifies copies of itself (an idea I've been playing around a bit with). This gene creates ideas that can be modified, shares these ideas, then detects when the ideas are repeated back in proper context. This is all subconscious.   1) The meme is created by an individual. By sharing it the individual can identify other carriers of the gene by seeing which individuals can use the gene properly (mimic within specific context). All individuals who can do this are probably carriers. 2) The meme is picked up. Once an individual integrates it, they can also use it as a marker to identify others. It spreads within a small group. Group pressures will help others within the group to adapt and use it correctly. ""No, you're using that meme wrong. It's supposed to be like this..."" The meme becomes a group identifier. 3/4) After it has become a group identifier within reddit/4chan, it's spread to other social media. Here it's used to identify other people from the original group. During this time wide scale mimicry shows that it can no longer be used as a group identification marker. Now the message goes out that the meme is dead. ""The meme is dead"" is a secondary meme that basically goes to step 1 again, but skips step 3. 5) When sufficient time has passed the meme can be revived for short periods of time to identify other group members who've been around for a while.    This idea also kind of explains circlejerks, anti-circlejerks, reposts, and repost hating. Specifically with reposts ""Repost"" becomes a broadcast ping to identify reddit activity and patterns. ""This is sooo common"" indicates that the redditor is regular and has been around for a while. Other responses give information about browsing patterns where ""Oh yeah, fuck OP"" is the ""Yes, I'm like you"" response.   But memes evolve over time. In fact, this is part of the truest expression of the phenotype. Those that can identify a changing idea as related to a previous idea must be carriers of a gene that allows individuals to create ideas, mutate them, and reflect back the mutation to others who identify that those are mutations. That's why memes exist.   The more you think about reddit (or really any social communication) as a set of ""Are you like me?""/""I'm like you"" subconscious query responses, the more common activity makes sense. Social structure is an emergent complexity that develops from the expression of the genes that create the brain.  (I'm skipping quite a bit for brevity.)"
TheoryOfReddit,2tpq9w,kensaiMADNESS,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"This is a most interesting idea.  I disagree with your assumption that memes are an identification mechanism for GENES though.   I would rather say that memes (the popular interpretation of the term) could serve as identification mechanism for similar memetic makeup of an individual (the sum of the memes in a specific individual). This is not restricted to 'memes' (popular meaning). Secret handshakes are the same. Distinct memes to identify group/cultur membership.  But who would profit from such a mechanism? The culture, obviously. The superorganism if you will.  I realy would like to read more about your idea. Blog maybe, or pm :)"

My running theory is that there's a subreddit-based multiplier in the picture (which is why link submissions in /r/funny get less karma per score, and link submissions to askreddit last April Fools got way more than score).  You can sort-of refresh to get statistically close to the actual vote totals, but the idea is that outside of small subreddits, you don't have the time to get good data before someone else may have voted. Thus fuzzing isn't revealed, and is still hard to show.  Removing fuzzing would be worse than the current state of things."
TheoryOfReddit,2tkpfv,Deimorz,1 point,Sun Jan 25 03:43:52 2015 UTC,"Are you certain that link karma and score don't use the same multipliers?

TheoryOfReddit,2tkpfv,Deimorz,4,Sun Jan 25 11:48:53 2015 UTC,The amount of karma you gain from something is not very related to its internal score at all. You absolutely can't use knowledge of one to derive the other.
TheoryOfReddit,2tkpfv,Deimorz,1 point,Sun Jan 25 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"What suggests that to you?  Maybe I am observing at a different scale than you and a couple of the other comments... At least within the ~100 vote range (100 presented votes, at least, as gathered by multiple refreshes) I see a strong correlation between link karma and post upvotes in the number and rate of accrual. Try it for yourself when you have a single growing post by a slow trickle and see if you don't get almost exactly similar additions to both scores on a similar schedule.  I am open to the fact that I'm wrong here, but I'd like to see it demonstrated because it seems otherwise in observation."

Upvotes and karma gain are certainly correlated (naturally, since you can't gain karma without getting upvoted), but not in such a way that you can simply use one of them to determine the other."

I'll may have to track more closely once to disillusion myself.  Especially at low vote totals it seemed like you can take evidence of a increase (both driven ultimately by vote(s) ) over a similar period of time and cross-reference it with evidence or lack of evidence of voting in the other to circumvent some of the uncertainty.    Well, while I've got your ear, as someone on the inside do you feel like fuzzing when applied to obfuscate in hope of preventing artificially inflated relevance and drives to vote to thresholds and stuff like that are effective and provide greater benefit overall than would be provided by clear feedback to submitters about the appropriateness and success of their posts?"

By itself the tone of the above sentence is a hateful one, but when an emoticon is added...   You are an utter bastard! :P   Suddenly it's a playful jab. Emoticons are great for setting tone, but they are also a lazy way of doing it. Tone can be presented in a myriad of ways by using context, wordplay, formatting, or just changing your word choice as seen here:   You are a wiley bastard!   In a lot of online forums and websites the use of emoticons is almost necessary either because you need to move quickly in order to be relevant with your comment, or the word limits restrict how you can express your thoughts.   10,000 characters as well as bold/italic/strikethrough/s is generally enough to present your thoughts and emotions in an adequate way, without having to resort to winky faces."

First each individual member of the crowd must have their own independent source of information. Second they must make individual decisions and not be swayed by the decisions of those around them.

I do think specific subreddits can have objectivity as a goal. For example, r/askscience, r/askhistory, TIL, etc all have rules which either encourage or outright require objectivity.

I can kind of understand it in the case of /r/SubredditDrama, due to the very nature of the posts (in that they all point to heated debates.) But unlike people being linked from subs like ShitRedditSays or RedPill, or r/conservative, there is no one singular agenda to a sub like /r/SubredditDrama.  Yes, people are being pointed toward heated debates, and any of these people may be more likely to ""side"" with one party or another... but all types of people, with all types of views are being directed at once.  How is that even almost the same thing as brigading?  Nevermind a sub like /r/bestof which seems far more neutral.

It's not the same as a political subreddit linking, but it can still bring in a bunch of outsiders that appear to downvote someone (Who may just as well have it coming).    The whole sudden shadowbans for voting though, which is a subversion of what reddit is about EXCEPT for this one specific interaction, seems like a really slap-dash solution that I don't agree with.

In the case of /r/SubredditDrama, users come to that subreddit to see drama (as the name clearly advertises) and, if given the chance, will more likely vote in a manner that promotes or exacerbates dramatic posts/comments rather than productive ones.  That being said, since subreddits like /r/SubredditDrama follow rules dictating the use of non-participatory links this concern is something of a moot point in practice, in principle, there is certainly an argument for considering those subreddits' behavior as harmful brigading.   With respect to /r/bestof, one could reasonably assume their implicit agenda, which is actually quite explicit, is to promote good, productive content and, as such, may be considered helpful brigading.

They might put in the TOS - in the form of a warrant canary most likely - but any subpeonas served under the Patriot Act which can be interpreted REALLY broadly as we've seen in recent years are not allowed to be disclosed by admission to the public/site users.   Regular subpoenas, you'd still have to go to the admins or something for that, and I doubt they would tell you, for two reasons:   1) Privacy  2) Time/Tracking - doubt Reddit keeps a spreadsheet of the subpoenas they've been served, whether or not they've fought them, whether or not they've won that fight, and/or if they haven't fought them and have given in and then, if they've given in, what they've provided.   Also, I'd like to point out that, as Abraham Lincoln said,    Anybody can say anything on the Internet.    It would be rather foolish of law enforcement personnel to investigate potential crimes based solely on the fact that someone claimed they committed them on the internet (not to mention issues of jurisdiction, i.e., unless you know who a user is and where they are located, OR are a federal body, as a law enforcement official you wouldn't even know if you were able to prosecute a matter) so I imagine that really they would turn to Reddit when already investigating someone and if they were able to determine the username of the person.   __   Maybe I'm giving law enforcement in our country the benefit of the doubt, I guess CIA or someone could dragnet the full population of reddit comments for keywords and try and decide to monitor those usernames for further information, but that seems like a lot of time and manwork unless you could automate it. In that case I could see them serving subpoenas for more information but I suspect it would be under the patriot act.     Also, for what it's worth, court records are usually public so if Reddit either was brought to court over a subpoena or was a member in a legal battle you should be able to find that out. I suspect it would have to be in the jurisdiction where Reddit's headquarters were located if it wasn't federal. (Most states have sites where you can search their court records.) However, I'd also expect that any such matter would get publicity, even if not publicly acknowledged by Reddit, so you'd probably have heard about it if you follow tech news, at least recently."

An example of an alternate metric would be: look for the submissions that have a low total vote (say, between 10 and 50, varying of course on subreddit traffic) but a high % upvoted.  The idea behind this is that if the title reflects the content of the article and the article is about something redditors don't have a pre-formed, ready-to-vote belief on (i.e. political or whatever), people would be less inclined to vote without reading, leading to a low vote total. It would indicate a combination of unfamiliarity and/or low digestibility, both of which could be positive indicators of something in-depth and original.  edit: Or you could say low vote total + high % upvoted = indicator that the title's not vote baiting, at least."

TheoryOfReddit,2szs9p,Death_Star_,3,Tue Jan 20 00:04:23 2015 UTC,"There's two things to understand:    First the ""hot score"", which is what Reddit uses to rank, is a combination of time and voting. So there will be cases where a brand new link with 1 upvote will be ranked higher than something old with 1000 upvotes, simply because that first link is much newer.  Second, when Reddit ranks your front page, it has to combine these hot scores from across multiple subreddits. What they do is normalize the hot score of each link by the average hot score in that subreddit. The idea being that something with 10 upvotes is more impressive in a sub where most things have a single upvote, than a link with 100 upvotes in a sub where most things have 200 upvotes.

If thread locking hadn't been built into AutoModerator by an admin, then someone would have made another tool to do the same thing.  Locking threads is a built-in feature on virtually every other forum.

Namely, to stop a witch-hunt in progress. We experience these quite often in /r/videos. People see something that upsets them and a few individuals decide to full out dox (acquire the person's personal information) the target of their ire. Then they post that information in the comment threads. It gets seen by other people and they post it too. It can spiral out of control within a matter of minutes.  When you're dealing with a subreddit with 7 million subscribers, in threads that can have several thousand comments, it's unrealistic to expect moderators to monitor that thread every minute until the thread dies (~24-30 hours). This is an unpaid volunteer job after all. We also can't spend all of our free time eyeballing a single submission, other submissions deserve/require our attention. It's unfair to the rest of our subreddit to have all of our attention focused on a single submission.  So you ask if it's acceptable modding for a default? I'm confident I can make a case that locking threads should be a required feature for mods. I'm actually surprised it isn't something native to our mod tools yet.

Especially like on gigantic threads like the one with 10k comments about the part 3 of the hilariously fake/troll story. It was auto removing all comments for about an hour. But they seemed to stop doing that and just superficially removed the ability to coment through the subreddit styles. But you can bypass that if you have RES.

Unless they are willing to go to /r/science or /r/askscience's route of adding literally hundreds of mods you cant expect people volunteering their free time to be around all the time and make sure every single comment has correct information.  Even if they did go down that route there is still no guarantee that it would work since human error and general lazyness plays factors.

It absolutely addresses the problem. The only reason to troll is to get a certain reaction out of people. If there's no reaction, there's no incentive to troll.    2) ... Cons: Some trolls just want attention, and upvotes are attention, which will perpetuate and encourage their trolling. Their comments also become more visible within threads.   also, you know, completely negating the purpose of upvotes altogether.    3) Cons: This is what they want. It will encourage more trolling.   Wrong. They want butthurt people to write angry replies. See 1)   4) Cons: Reddit turns away from a community, into a content-based site, not a user-based site. Reddit would quickly decline in popularity and fade away.   How exactly does banning people who break the rules turn Reddit into a content-based site? I have never once seen people complain about mods banning people who are trolling or breaking rules. That's what they're supposed to do.     The absolute best course of action is to simply ignore and downvote them. If they quickly get downvoted out of visibility and don't even have any replies, there won't be a reason to do it anymore. Naturally, that won't stop all trolls, but it will minimize the incentive."

TheoryOfReddit,2sv1tw,DrFisharoo,4,Mon Jan 19 05:35:12 2015 UTC,"The best solution as a user is to ignore and report trolls. Then hopefully mods will intervene to and ban them, but at the very least you haven't egged them on at all which might discourage them in the future.  I don't quite agree with the cons for either of these plans. Ignoring them isn't ""avoiding the problem"", it's a valid solution considering the well known fact that trolls want attention. And having a lot of rules won't destroy the community aspect of reddit. I think that some of the highest quality subs are the ones with rules that are clearly defined and rigidly enforced (like /r/AskHistorians).   If you have a sub that just has a shit ton of rules you get confusion among the users because they don't know what is and isn't allowed and chances are it is never going to be enforced (like /r/funny)."

Personally, I think a troll kinda has to believe what he's writing, at least on some level. I mean, take a troll who's spouting racism; if he was truly against racism, he wouldn't be comfortable with spouting stuff like that. Even if he's deliberately doing it for downvotes, upvotes would just result in him going 'uhurhur I knew I was right after all'.

What is considered ""persistent"" is highly dependent on the community.  The rules of course have to be consistent and there should be at least an illusion they are evenly applied.  Reddit, for some reason, seems to think ""let the trolls play"".  Libertarian crowd maybe, no idea.  Personally, I think this is silly and detrimental.  Better to ban them quickly for transgressions, make them make a new account, and take away their ability to get any sort of response in your sub.  Real communities have leaders and fuck-ups.  No reason to keep them all ""at the same level"", that is nonsense.  Please, let's not make ""leaders"" out of our fuck ups, we have enough of that IRL.  Seriously, fuck trolls man.

I was being a bit of a troll a while ago, and I asked why I was getting downvoted, and he said this:  I will tell you why. 1st please note that I have not down voted you on anything. (I don't think.) However I 100% understand why. You are extremely inconsistent. You post that you need chat micros, acting as if you are unsure how to set this up. But in the very same post you say that you can build a user script for your self. What? You ignored the fact that PengWin straight up told you that all of TagPros extensions are on Chrome. You post things like ""nomomomom"" that have 0 to do with the thread.  This is part of a bigger issue I see. You appear to constantly troll. You are disruptive. In less then 48 hours I have done a 180 on my feelings towards your charter as a person. I looked at your 20% win and thought to my self that this is a person who is perfect for NLTP. I started thinking of ways the team could help you, What Macros I would need to set up for you. I thought we could really help this guy get better. Now looking at everything I believe you have been intentionally loosing games.  You could have told us from the start you were banned. You did not. In fact by the time you got into group you told me at least 2 different times on how long before you could play again. Seeing as you are banned again just adds to my point. Getting reported that many times, that quickly would mean that you have the poorest luck in computers or simply enjoy trolling and going AFK. When we got into group and you could not join, (because you were banned) You started to talk about who knows what while we were trying to run a scrimmage. You posted a YouTube link. Did you really think I was going to stop practice to go look at whatever video you posted?  NLTP is the place to learn, to meet friends and to win. I want to win. I can play with anyone regardless of skill as long as they A) Try. And B) just be honest with me. If I loose and the team did its best then okay, I lost and the other team was better. I will try to learn from my mistakes and go on. But If I loose because a team mate decided to go AFK (over 30 times) I'm going to get frustrated. At this point I am frustrated.  I believe at this point you are possibly a TagPro veteran who for whatever reason thinks its just fun and games to you. Or a child who is immature. If your computer has this many problems you can ask someone to help in your household. I don't have a lick of power, but if If I had my way you would be kicked off this team and kicked off of NLTP.  I apologize for being so harsh with my words but this is the truth how I see it.  P.S. I can't give a link because the sub is private."

People will always just like the short, cute, bite-sized comments. I think the biggest difference from Reddit is that they moderate to get rid of any negative or disparaging comments, which is nice I guess.  Internet vernacular is pretty much the same across the board, things catch on fastest on Reddit I think, and then spread elsewhere. Facebook is usually the last stop on the cheesy meme train.

This sort of false flag attack has been used before on here. I don't have a link,EDIT: LINK but there was a transcription of a chat from one company explaining how they make sure none of their competitors can gain traction on reddit:  They would make spam accounts and then subtly spam ads for their competitors, well enough that it looked real but bad enough that the admins would eventually catch them. Thus, their competitors would get their domains banned sitewide.  In the internet age, it is pretty much impossible to avoid or truly know about this sort of thing. If you wanted to get a poweruser banned, you could just make several accounts and have them upvote everything they post as soon as it is posted- again, well enough that it looks real, but bad enough that you eventually get caught. Take what Unidan did for himself and do it to another person.

I frequent /r/hockey and we have all of the following regular threads:   General Discussion Thursdays: Talk about anything you want. Some people come to this one regularly because /r/hockey is more than just the part of reddit that brings them hockey stuff: it's a place they go just to socialize with people they know they have common interests with. TRASH TALK FRIDAYS: FRIENDLY SHIT-TALKING OF OTHER TEAMS. CAPS LOCK MANDATORY. Whose line is it Saturdays: Users make prompts, others make humorous responses. Best of /r/hockey: The sub has it's own bestof, just for comments and posts within it. I check it every week because there's always something awesome that I missed. CANADIAN MANNERS MONDAYS: LIKE TRASH TALK FRIDAYS BUT YOU GIVE COMPLIMENTS. Tenderfoot Tuesdays: Ask any question! Geared toward new users. Wayback Wednesdays: Some dedicated users give hockey history lessons. Game-day threads: One for every NHL game, and you can discuss the game as it happens (awesome when you're stuck watching alone). Also for the World Junior Championships and Olympics. There is even a bot that will send you mail when your team's game threads are posted (an hour before puck drop). Special GDTs: The NHL Entry Draft gets a thread, and so do some other events for humorous reasons (like press conferences and live streams of ice installations, to name a few).   Anyway, I think these are the entire reason the sub is good: the moderation team created this community where we know and recognize each other and are very civil, as opposed to /r/nhl which is just a place people post terrible image-macro jokes. I'd say almost all of the active users are there regularly because of game threads and at least one other featured recurrent thread.  Hope you found that interesting, OP!"

I don't think it's a mistranslation because the sentence, as written, makes sense.    So that's pretty much all I wanted to say, just a petty constatation of a phenomenon.

There may be a style that doesn't, but if so I'm not aware of it and it's probably not widely used.  ² When discussing the term of art in music, the French pronunciation is used exclusively.

TheoryOfReddit,2sfft4,zem,3,Fri Jan 16 06:24:10 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain regular threads provide a safe way for lurkers and other non-participants in the sub to interact with the community. Posting your own content or a link is much more hit-and-miss, so Redditors are more likely to join in on another discussion than to submit one. When you combine that with regular threads, then a Redditor knows what to expect and what will be socially acceptable on those threads, feels comfortable to post, has a good time, and upvotes."
TheoryOfReddit,2saep3,wasmachien,110,Tue Jan 13 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"The big celebrity AMAs are often facilitated by the famous Victoria from Reddit.  (You'll see that on many celeb ones: ""I'm here with Victoria from Reddit"" or ""Victoria from Reddit is helping me on the phone"" or ""Victoria from Reddit is getting me started"")  Sometimes she types in the answers, picks the questions, explains how Reddit works, or a combination of some of these.  The quality level of a Victoria transcribed AMA is astonishingly higher than those without her help.  Apparently she is a crazy fast typist and she has figured out how to convey tone via text better than anyone I have ever read.  She (finally, and after much pleading) did an AMA of her own, which is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/  And, before that, an AMA request turned into an informal IAmA when she showed up, here: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2c89f4/ama_request_victoria_taylor_from_reddit/  Both are worth reading.  I have an avuncular crush on Victoria.  Her user name, by the way, is /u/chooter.  As far as money changing hands is concerned, I'd highly doubt it.  Celebrities do this because it is easy and free publicity for them.  If they do it well, they gain fans.  If they do it badly (I'm looking at you, Woody Harrelson and Morgan Freeman) then Reddit doesn't like them anymore, but that doesn't hurt their prospects significantly.  (Although Woody Harrelson's AMA disaster did leak out into multiple other media sites.)  Reddit as a company likes IAmA because a lot of new users are drawn here from celebrity AMAs.  It's a win-win for both sides.  tl; dr: Yes, some celebrity AMAs are helped by a Reddit employee.  No, there is no money changing hands."
TheoryOfReddit,2saep3,Eternally65,28,Tue Jan 13 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"The quality level of a Victoria transcribed AMA is astonishingly higher than those without her help.    For the average subject, sure.  Independently-done AMAs hosted by celebrities who are reasonably computer-literate are the best, I think, because the words are straight from them to us. Ryan North's is the best example, because he has a certain distinct style of writing in his work that 100% comes through in the AMA. His is my favourite of all time."

I think it is valid to ask, as it could be argued that IAMA is one of the biggest advertising platforms for the site. (I mean... look at the caliber of people that do AMAs)  Being, arguably, the biggest advertising platform for Reddit could (and does) provide Reddit a reason to help BOTH the Reddit community and the IAMA topic individuals (who are often peddling something) best use the platform.  I imagine that the money garnished from any possible payment from a celeb would be immensely overshadowed by the value proposition of having these people on Reddit. As Reddit has become more popular, so has the number of large personalities doing AMAs, which I am sure has increased readership, subscriptions and all the other things that a website wants.   Having these people on Reddit and making it interesting, beneficial for celebs and beneficial for the readers probably has pooptons of value.   Reddit is paid in pooptons of value by the celebs."

TheoryOfReddit,2sbl1h,Somuchlose1109,3,Tue Jan 13 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"There have been a number of posts on this sub about reaching the front page and what's involved in it. There are also people who are very good at getting their stuff to the front page. There's a number of things that come together, at least with regards to the high-traffic defaults like /r/funny or /r/todayilearned. First, it's important to remember to post at the right time. A post posted in the morning EST is more likely to make it than one posted at peak hours. It has all day to accumulate upvotes in the new queue instead of just a few minutes. Topics also generally need to hit whatever Reddit is interested in at the moment. For instance, posts satirising Islam were popular in /r/funny recently, now less so. Knowing what Reddit is interested in is key to getting to the front page.   As for what to beat, it depends on the sub, really. It's much easier to hit the front page on, say, /r/history than it is on /r/funny just because it's easier to appeal to the crowd and easier to get seen through the number of submissions.   Most users will never hit the front page, but neither is it particularly hard to do. It's just a matter of understanding what the site is, how it works, and how best to manipulate it."

It does seem it varies greatly depending on your grasp of the dynamics at work. I got invited to r/EternityClub when I hit front page and looking at some of the profiles there it's crazy how often they hit front page or get top comment. Just very carefully crafted posts I guess. For example, I noticed top comments these people always secure are 1) generally brief and terse by design, 2) tap into reddit's hive mind in some way, and 3) are usually slightly off-topic or subtley contrarian to the spirit of OP's post.   I was also a little disillusioned by how top posters there talk so crassly about just reposting material. This one guy was talking casually about how he has hit 100,000 karma on two accounts, once in only three weeks, just regurgitating old popular material. It's not even taboo. Just how life is."

They deleted all comments that were responding to him to place some diatribe in lieu of all of that that effectively said ""That admins said they -the new accounts- weren't shills, so stop talking about it you harassers."" while in no way whatsoever addressing the fact that he seemed to be disproportionately directing his answers towards these new accounts. Here's that post. He made 20 comments in his initial flurry, at least 6 of them went to shill-like accounts. If there was no bias in his response then there should have been hundreds of other shill-like questions that went unanswered. That doesn't appear to be the case.  I'm not suggesting the mods there are involved in some secret conspiracy, but rather that they already are going to be heavily biased towards defending big name AMAs as it provides potentially worldwide visibility for a sub that they have a lot of power over and that's gotta be just kinda cool. However, start overtly throwing money into the mix and things are absolutely going to go full retard where the above subversion of reddit's normal flow of conversation becomes the rule rather than the exception as an attempt to attract ever bigger (and better paying) AMAs."

If a post ends up with a score around or below 1, it is effectively ignored because very few people will see and interact with it --  probably only people who follow the /new queue -- unless it's on a pretty inactive subreddit in the first place.  Does the title have some hyperbole in it? Yes, but it doesn't invalidate the overall conclusion that a very large portion of reddit posts don't get the attention they deserve."

In cases of less active users, 1000 comments might stretch back years.  In what way do you think things are likely to have changed in a year?

If you don't edit, the error may attract downvotes.  The only real comparison would be between editing without saying anything, and editing with a comment.  I can't speak for everyone else, but I generally upvote people who have admitted their mistake, to encourage this behaviour. Less so when it's a simple typo, more so when they changed their mind on a topic."
TheoryOfReddit,2s548e,penises_everywhere,3,Mon Jan 12 10:14:44 2015 UTC,"There are a number of users who value karma for itself. For them the deleted comment is cutting losses.  For users that don't care about karma itself, I think it is mostly a psychological thing. A user may not care about their karma score yet they do care about the feeling of rejection at their words/statement being downvoted into oblivion. Downvotes get interpreted as 'the community doesn't like you' or 'thinks you are an idiot.' Deleting the comment prevents further downvoting/rejection, removes their username, and effectively erases their mistake (outside of screenshots etc.).  I personally prefer the edit and admit mistake option that you mention, but people do have their own reasons for deleting."

TheoryOfReddit,2rztfj,NotThatBot,19,Sat Jan 10 23:14:13 2015 UTC,"An excerpt from the book ""Sled Driver"" by former SR-71 pilot Brian Shul:   There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.  It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.  I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.  We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground."" Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the ""Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.  Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.  Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check."" Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.  Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.  ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground."" I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""  For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, ""Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one."" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

Reddit can know where you've been if it records it.  Edit: try using a different browser for your incognito expeditions, that's what I do, and I've never had this happen. The different browser may (possibly) record you as a different user, despite sharing some of the same information, such as IP, but don't quote me on that."

TheoryOfReddit,2ruqbe,deltree711,2,Fri Jan 9 15:24:58 2015 UTC,Probably because the list is built via the onClick() event which is triggered regardless if you open the link in different window.   Try copy and pasting the link into an incognito window.

TheoryOfReddit,2ruqbe,kutuzof,2,Sat Jan 10 06:02:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, false alarm, what's actually happening is that there's a mousedown handler (which fires on left or right clicks), and the story ID (i.e., 2ruqbe for this) is stored in a cookie as a comma separated list (it's the username_recentclicks2 cookie). On page load, this cookie is sent to the server, and the page comes pre-filled with recently viewed links based on the contents of the cookie.  This doesn't really have anything to do with opening a page in incognito mode, as the cookie is modified on right click. If you right click on a link and then reload the page, that link will still appear in the recently viewed links."

TheoryOfReddit,2ruqbe,wolfkin,2,Mon Jan 12 10:33:36 2015 UTC,"""Recently viewed links"" on reddit is managed by reddit, not by your browser. Reddit has no idea whether you're opening a link in an incognito window or not - it only knows that you've clicked on a link, and stores those links in the ""Recently viewed"" list associated with your account.  Incognito mode is managed by your browser - its a mode where the browser doesn't store any history or cookies from your incognito session after you close the last incognito tab, but there's no way (even in theory) that the browser can tell third-party systems (like reddit, or other websites you visit incognito) ""oh, all those pages the guy requested are incognito, so you should forget them now"".  If you want to browse reddit links incognito then open an incognito tab and browse reddit without signing in, or (perhaps, depending on how reddit's javascript is written) right-click on a link in a normal browser window, choose ""copy link address"" (or similar) and paste it into the incognito window's address bar."

TheoryOfReddit,2rqsue,Dospunk,5,Fri Jan 9 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea! But as a lot of other people are saying, it might end up just being what a majority of people did not want instead of what they wanted. Also it might end up being bombed by other subs, for example, what if /r/history decides that they want a /r/moderndayHistory - they have around to million users, and could actively just bomb the votes to get what they wanted.   Instead, i would suggest something like letting people access the sub, post there, and comment on what they wanted gone. But only let a team of mods, and high karma users vote (mods taken from a lot of different subs for the project)  Well, the idea is interesting , but i really think that there are a lot of fall groups with it ."

TheoryOfReddit,2rrgqo,Gilgamesh-,3,Thu Jan 8 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, but the algorithm isn't in reddit's code; the 'trending' bar data comes from the newest post on the trending subreddit, /r/TrendingSubreddits by /u/reddit.  The admins run the script privately, I imagine, to minimize any gaming of the selection system that would be possible were they to publicise the algorithm; a keen mod woupd potentially be able to manipulate their subreddit to trend. The selected subreddits are posted by /u/reddit, although probably manually approved as suitable first; the public code that can be seen on github then picks up that post and displays it to users as the bar above the post listings on the front page.  Here is the update code, which is run daily after the posting of the subreddits trending that day.  The list of 'new' posts to trending_sr, /r/TrendingSubreddits, is fetched:  iq = iter(trending_sr.get_links('new', 'all'))   The first, and therefore most recent link is fetched:  link = Thing._by_fullname(next(iq), data=True)    A regex locates the subreddits (string a of the format ""/r/<x>"") in the title of that post:  subreddit_names = _SUBREDDIT_RE.findall(link.title)   All of which are parcelled into trending_data and saved to a global variable, accessible everywhere.  NamedGlobals.set(TRENDING_SUBREDDITS_KEY, trending_data)   The set of trending subreddits is now saved.  When it needs to be displayed - when the front page is visited; that global variable is fetched and returned.  def get_trending_subreddits():      return NamedGlobals.get(TRENDING_SUBREDDITS_KEY, None)"

TheoryOfReddit,2rrgqo,relic2279,1 point,Thu Jan 8 21:45:21 2015 UTC,"What gives?   As of right now, that subreddit only has 2,400 subscribers. I'm a mod on several subs that have been on the trending list (multiple times) and I'm confident that 2,400 just isn't enough for the algorithm to notice. That sub is also 4 years old so it probably added less than 2,400 subscribers yesterday.   As an example, the day before /r/EatCheapAndHealthy was selected as a trending subreddit, it added approximately 20k subscribers in a single day due to a popular askreddit post. I don't know what the lower limit is to appear on the listing, and I'm sure subs compete against one another, but I'm certain the limit is significantly higher than 2500."
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,SnowGabe,5,Wed Jan 7 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"It really is a problem, especially since downvotes are so much more powerful than upvotes in the early stages of a comment"
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,cetigo,11,Thu Jan 8 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"Having recently been the butt of a downvote brigade, from users in a sub known for spawning downvote brigades (despite the sub's mods attempts to prevent them), the instigators of which bragged about their intention to rally a downvote brigade against me (in two separate posts, in two separate subs), and having lost close to three hundred points over night, the answer is no.   Downvotes stick, appear difficult or impossible to track, and can not be reversed.  I'd like to note : Mods of both subs reported the situation as soon as they became aware of it, admins took quick action to stop the brigade, Mods from both subs and Admins apologized to me and were very sweet about the whole thing. I was also told that the instigators and several of the participants were banned.  The good news is, if you continue adding content and adding to/participating in discussions, the points do grow back.  Most importantly, if you are being stalked by a downvoter or downvoters or know that another user is, report the situation to Admins immediately. Admins can't help if they don't know what is happening."
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,chalkchick0,3,Thu Jan 8 02:50:04 2015 UTC,Serious question. Why do you care about downvotes? What bearing does it have on your life?
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,MrPejorative,2,Thu Jan 8 20:37:52 2015 UTC,A few early downvotes effectively assigns a comments to oblivion. Why participate at all then?
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,MrPejorative,2,Thu Jan 8 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"Well I think the default setting is -4, so it would have to be a determined group of people to make every one of your comments disappear. It also wouldn't stop people being notified that they were replied to, so you'd at least be able to have the discussion with the person you're talking to, which is really the most important part.   Though I think the problem is with comment karma in general. It's a terrible way to have discussions. It's like having an audience applaud or boo you every time you express a thought."
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,chalkchick0,2,Thu Jan 8 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"This is the cut and paste response I give when one of the Noobs (New users) on /r/FreeKarma asks about the value of Karma points :    ""Granny's third most often cut and paste comment :  A simplified statement explaining Karma points value :   ""They are kind of like brownie points. They have no value except as a gauge for how interesting or entertaining your posts and comments are. Like bragging rights but you aren't really supposed to brag. You know the song The train they call the city of New Orleans? A line from the song says ""A penny a point, ain't no one keeping score"". It's like that.   Just for funzies. LOL  If you aren't having trouble with posting limits, the only reason I know of to collect Karma is to buffer your account so if you have controversial opinions and want to make comments or posts that might result in a downvote landslide you don't wind up with negative Karma.   Kind of a Karma bank.""    It's a game, and just like in any game, the only value to the score is to show how well you are playing."
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,MrPejorative,1 point,Thu Jan 8 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose I understand your point of view now, but it's a bizarre analogy, and certainly explains the distress people feel when their ""brownie points"" are under threat. So thank you for that.  Here's how I look at it.   A vote is also a representation of a human being's opinion, and I'm okay with that, whether it's up or down. If they felt a bit more strongly about it they'd post a comment, and maybe I'd learn something. That's the bit I'm more interested in.   As for a brigade, A brigade is a person telling their friends about this opinion they didn't like, and those friends let me know what their opinion is. Same applies as above.  I don't really need an analogy to describe it, as that is pretty much exactly what's going on.   Brigading isn't really a problem to me either( though I do respect the rules), as it's essentially a solution to reddit's biggest problem, a tendency to separate into hug boxes and circle jerks. There are so many subreddits that want to be separate enough to have their point of view the dominant one, but also want to passive aggressively gossip about what's going on in other subreddits too. Sooner or later, the inevitable brigade happens as somebody just has to let that person know what they think. And about 20 people also have the same thought simultaneously.   I welcome it when it happens to me or a subreddit I'm in. The tendency for discussion to break away into cliques based around points of view is a very sad state of affairs, so it's good to be reminded that there are opposing points of view. I just wish they were a little more willing to discuss them."
TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,chalkchick0,3,Thu Jan 8 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"I mostly participate in art and music subs. To me Reddit is, for the most part, a light hearted place.

I think this was the first time a large group of people felt the need to throw my board game.  I'm still going to express my opinions.

TheoryOfReddit,2ro84b,_vargas_,12,Thu Jan 8 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know about if it's one user but I can speak of my experience having thousands of people down voting my history.   It happened on an alt account a couple years ago. For whatever reason, people got it in their heads to go after one of my accounts. Someone linked to a bunch of my higher rates comments, which made it easy for everyone to go right in and downvote them (wouldn't have worked if they'd downvoted from my userpage). Within a couple hours, comments that were once at 1000-2000 were down to zero.   However, the overall karma count for the account didn't budge one bit. I'm talking thousands of downvotes and my score didn't drop one vote from where it had been even though the comments themselves were dropped to nothing.  What I guess happened is that certain Reddit safeguards which protect against massive downvote brigades kicked in and rendered the down voting futile. I imagine it's one of those things that Reddit doesn't really advertise much. Kind of like a trade secret of sorts."

TheoryOfReddit,2ro7yl,316nuts,3,Wed Jan 7 21:46:26 2015 UTC,I dont see it much as showing hobbies.  It might make reddit a bit more personal now that you look at a genderless alien instead of just a username.  Admins need to make that more visible tho or else nobody is going to see them.   One of the hats has fox ears so people might get upset they are hats for furries and it might encourage bullying.   The same with skin color.   Another something to think about is how many new snoos are going to be made for communities that dont have a graphic designer they can call.

TheoryOfReddit,2ro7yl,agentlame,2,Wed Jan 7 22:05:28 2015 UTC,I like the concept a lot.  One of the issues I've always had with username autolinking is (other than to summon people) there isn't much point in it linking to the user page.  There's nothing there but your comments and submissions.  And neither of those say anything about you--other than you participated in a pun thread in /r/funny and like cat pictures.  I think it might have been a better idea to offer a feature where you can at least add a short (500 char?) blurb or some links to stuff you like.  But I think a reddit Mii is at least something that adds value/personalization to your page... even if it's not actually on the page. :/
