MarioMaker,3e6e22,mrmariomaster,3,Wed Jul 22 08:37:21 2015 UTC,"That's honestly always weirded me out. Treehouse always talked of ""some"" online courses, and I always thought 100 levels was a bit excessive. Still doesn't mean we won't be getting a couple dozen though (I think some of them will be based on locations as seen in the Hyper Japan presentation)"
MarioMaker,3e6e22,EveMK89,3,Wed Jul 22 08:39:41 2015 UTC,"Ah they've gone even further to actually deny it now. It used to say will contain 100 courses. Then they removed it. Now it denies it completely. It was already pretty obviously false after they removed it. Pretty silly, so many people got excited for the 100 courses. I personally don't even understand the hype since the whole point of the game is for the players to use their tools to make levels. Why ""wear"" the tools out by playing developer created levels? I mean it's not the worst or anything but I don't understand the excitement for it."
MarioMaker,3e6e22,Confuzet,3,Wed Jul 22 10:28:05 2015 UTC,Someone probably mixed it up with the 100-Mario challenge. I guess all the level's we've been seeing will just be available to play online.
MarioMaker,3e6e22,jawbit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:17:34 2015 UTC,Is this the UK page?  I have a feeling different regions may do different things .  I am pretty sure over 100 levels will be available online from nintendo but they won't even matter if there is some good fan stuff.
MarioMaker,3e6e22,cupknifespoon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:33:54 2015 UTC,Well at least there's an official word now. While I'm disappointed that sure did seem ambitious since many other regular Mario games don't have 100 levels in total. Though I do hope there is a way to download levels or something so you can play without internet if need be.

MarioMaker,3e4mb8,RotomGuy,6,Tue Jul 21 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"Reminder that winged buzzy beetles act as parabeetles, you can stand on them as they fly, and winged spinies throw spikes around them, that should be good for some interesting levels, and that the difference between spike and normal shell-mets is that spike helmets can break solid blocks and kill enemies and the buzzy shell only deflects incoming stuff  That said I think I'll focus more on the parabeetles, I always liked them"
MarioMaker,3e4mb8,insanesana,3,Tue Jul 21 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'd try make a puzzle where the player starts on a brick floor, and have a buzzy shell moving above them, through a sort of obstacle course. The player would have to make bridges for the shell (maybe through hitting invisible question mark blocks?) to avoid the shell landing on a p-switch, killing the player."
MarioMaker,3e4mb8,filipop,3,Tue Jul 21 22:55:35 2015 UTC,"A series? Hell yeah. Buzzies will be a very important element in both platform-intensive and puzzle levels alike, due to their unique property of being both harmless and indestructible from above. I'm looking forward to some daring acrobatics with parabuzzies. Not to mention their empty shell being a brand new helmet power up! I wonder if spiny helmets and regular helmets have different properties."
MarioMaker,3e4mb8,jawbit,2,Wed Jul 22 01:26:32 2015 UTC,"From the footage out there, the spiny helmet kills enemies that attack from above and can actually break solid blocks, while the buzzy helmet just deflects attacks, I think the block breaking property of the spiny shell really interesting for some ideas but if misplaced can also mean sequence breaking, so gotta think well when placing it"
MarioMaker,3e4mb8,insanesana,2,Wed Jul 22 01:39:17 2015 UTC,Big Mario + Spiny Helmet... SUPER MARIO DESTRUCTION!
MarioMaker,3e49wu,landi_kong,7,Tue Jul 21 21:05:13 2015 UTC,I'm glad everything is running smoothly between everyone too :-) We're all very excited for this game. I can wait until it comes out and everyone shares their creations.
MarioMaker,3e49wu,Black_Salsa,5,Tue Jul 21 21:21:12 2015 UTC,I wonder how big it will be on 9/11.

MarioMaker,3e49wu,titcriss,3,Wed Jul 22 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"It's really possible with how much they are pushing the game, so a bundle might be coming soon!"
MarioMaker,3e49wu,insanesana,3,Wed Jul 22 01:48:46 2015 UTC,Looking foward to play the game. Soon i'll be able to make my very own NES world!!
MarioMaker,3e4ltk,Cptn_Insano,5,Tue Jul 21 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting. It refreshed my memory of what I studied at my university in the past year ( sorry for the weird sentence ). What might be tricky with SMM is the fact that it's not a linear game. Normally, a game is easy in the beginning, then the difficulty spikes fairly. But for SMM, you get to choose your levels, so the difficulty spike happens in the same level ( unless you decide to make it difficult right at the beginning, or easy all along ).  We have to consider the player's skills too, which vary a lot. Many videos from E3 that were rated ""Hard"" looked very easy to me. Playing a game and watching someone play it is quite different of course, but still ! I wonder how it will play out once the game is released."
MarioMaker,3e4ltk,Black_Salsa,5,Tue Jul 21 22:58:35 2015 UTC,"I thought Tropical Freeze treaded this fine line excellently. The secret levels were brutal, but you only died because you hadn't practiced a certain part enough. Every couple tries, you'd get a little further, and soon you would find yourself not dying near the beginning anymore. It was always as rewarding as it was challenging. I hope to emulate that style in my most challenging levels."
MarioMaker,3e4ltk,jawbit,2,Wed Jul 22 01:30:15 2015 UTC,The thing with the secret levels is they were considerably more challenging but always fair. No checkpoints but much shorter than normal stages too. It didn't overstay its welcome.
MarioMaker,3e4ltk,Confuzet,4,Wed Jul 22 10:34:59 2015 UTC,"Instead of linking it in your post, you could've put the link in the thread title. :P"
MarioMaker,3e4ltk,UM3000,3,Tue Jul 21 22:52:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I suppose I could have. Didn't think about it.
MarioMaker,3e4ilx,GelatoCube,4,Tue Jul 21 22:07:09 2015 UTC,"The only issues in recreating TLL levels is since we don't know of any wind (I doubt they're in the game) being added, how will you design the wind levels? Will you make them like SMBDX's levels were, where they removed the wind? Also, we don't know of any Red Piranha Plants (I mean in SMB style.), so I guess you'll have to use regular Piranha Plants instead. Also, Green Springs haven't been confirmed yet, so I don't see how you'll make those levels with the huge pits without them. I mean, you could use platforms, but it wouldn't be quite the same in difficulty."
MarioMaker,3e4ilx,UM3000,3,Tue Jul 21 23:01:21 2015 UTC,"I thought of that as well, and I'm guessing I won't do those levels due to the fact they're the most bullshit"
MarioMaker,3e4ilx,ROBOTlNATOR,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"To add to the issues, there are no poison mushrooms as of yet, and no mazes/looping, though I do hope all these things make it into the final game.  One can dream right?"
MarioMaker,3e4ilx,insanesana,2,Wed Jul 22 07:48:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to focus more on puzzle levels where the player needs to think before jumping on stuff  I'll try not to make it unbeatable if you fail, which might be challenging but that's where the fun is at!"

MarioMaker,3e4cde,MightyArtio,5,Tue Jul 21 21:22:37 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they'll just unlock an outfit based on the Mii design of the amiibo.
MarioMaker,3e4cde,RotomGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"Well they only work in SMB style, so. I'm not too sure myself if they'd work or not. Although the fact that there's like 90 slots for costumes, they probably do work.    Btw, it'd be pretty cool seeing 8-bit Miis, considering the fact that the concept of Miis have been around since the Famicom Disk System."
MarioMaker,3e4cde,UM3000,2,Tue Jul 21 21:37:08 2015 UTC,Since they've done it for every other character I don't see why they couldn't take the time to make 3 more 8-Bit spites
MarioMaker,3e4cde,Scotsman333,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:53:55 2015 UTC,They could do something like the Tomodachi Quest event where it pixelates the mii's face.

MarioMaker,3e3p5e,filipop,5,Tue Jul 21 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of trolling to be done in this game. It'll just be kept in check by miiverse comments, level completion %, likes (or whatever they're called), and especially the level preview image (although this can be avoided by putting the ""troll"" element in the sublevel which I don't think shows up in the preview)."
MarioMaker,3e3p5e,jawbit,5,Tue Jul 21 19:07:26 2015 UTC,Seen it suggested before. Looks like a solid method to earn zero stars on your level.
MarioMaker,3e3p5e,Confuzet,4,Tue Jul 21 19:19:48 2015 UTC,"I had a similar idea where you have a really challenging level, that ends in a warp pipe.  The warp pipe appears to just take you to the start of the level again, but really it's a new level exactly the same as the first except for a secret exit activated by a p-switch in a block.  The trick is that the first time around there's an enemy in the block, so people would think to skip it the second time around."
MarioMaker,3e3p5e,ShawnisMaximus,3,Tue Jul 21 21:46:30 2015 UTC,"I thought of that as soon as they announced that you would need to complete the level yourself to upload it. People will create Kaizo levels and simply have an invisible block with a vine that leads to a tube, which lead to the end. I don't really mind though. If I see a level that's simply impossible to beat, either I quit it, or try to find the invisible block. I just hope those levels won't appear often in the 10/100 Mario Challenge."
MarioMaker,3e3p5e,Black_Salsa,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:53 2015 UTC,I had a similar idea.
MarioMaker,3e2b8a,UM3000,7,Tue Jul 21 12:21:33 2015 UTC,"I think combos with entities that can create others (lakitus, bill blasters, etc) are not possible unless it is with something they can't carry (like wings)  Other than that the list is pretty much what all of us were asking for in a while! I personally don't see slopes making in as stages are really short and most people will focus on a puzzle/gimmick than an actual long stage, but it would be nice to have them in  For checkpoints, I imagine they'd be a toggleable element (not a toolbar one, something more on the sidebar like the frog icon) if they make it, and only one or two would be in each stage, so no putting checkpoints everywhere before hard jumps!  That said I have many things I hope make it into the game, but I'm not holding my breath, the game is already looking nice so far and I can't wait until it's released!"
MarioMaker,3e2b8a,insanesana,3,Tue Jul 21 13:20:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. I know some of these have already been said, and I'm not too sure on enemy combos, but I'd feel I wanted to make a comprehensive wishlist with all the things I would like. :D"

MarioMaker,3e1tmx,Hillumititee,4,Tue Jul 21 08:33:00 2015 UTC,That'd be neat. That and ghost data!
MarioMaker,3e1tmx,EveMK89,3,Tue Jul 21 09:47:52 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely like to see some sort of multiplayer in the game. I'm a bit surprised we haven't heard anything on that yet. If there isn't, I guess it'll be time to make up some of our own multiplayer games we can do, such as simple things like trying to beat the other players high score/time/etc."
MarioMaker,3e1tmx,Joshers744,2,Tue Jul 21 12:18:38 2015 UTC,It'd be very unlikely that there is NO multiplayer in the game. It was even shoehorned into Splatoon. That's probably what it'll be.
MarioMaker,3e1tmx,jawbit,3,Tue Jul 21 12:09:28 2015 UTC,"It was confirmed in treehouse and dev interviews that there would be no multiplayer though, it would stretch the camera and that can mess with how the sprites look (NSMB uses 3D models so it's better)"
MarioMaker,3e1tmx,insanesana,2,Tue Jul 21 13:13:08 2015 UTC,"Well this thread doesn't mean NSMB style multiplayer, so. :P"
MarioMaker,3e1tmx,UM3000,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"That would be a cool idea. I don't see it being in the game though. However, you could still take turns with a single controller, and try to beat yor friend's score, as if there was multiplayer."
MarioMaker,3e1krl,Nathanyal,7,Tue Jul 21 06:37:22 2015 UTC,It's probably almost all QA/bugproofing/network code testing/final tweaking.  The last 10% of the game release takes forever because of all these things you need to do to not end up with a hot buggy mess on release.
MarioMaker,3e1krl,XenesisXenon,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know why they would've used it in NWC if it wasn't working properly. If it wasn't finished, why would they use it in something so major? What if it glitched out and crashed or something..."
MarioMaker,3e1krl,EveMK89,4,Tue Jul 21 06:44:29 2015 UTC,"The other stuff we haven't seen yet will be stuff that was excluded from that build because it was unstable at that time. So rather there's stuff that was added a while ago, but stuff that wasn't presentable until recently. *There's also the fact that it's release date might have been shifted to go along with the 30th anniversary"
MarioMaker,3e1krl,insanesana,2,Tue Jul 21 07:14:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's more like they were saving elements for potential unlocks and/or surprizes so they only added the generic enemies that appear in all games to showcase, reason why stretches, fishbones and monty moles were nowhere to be seen in the toolbar (there is a possibility they are shakeable variations but we all can hope)  At this point all they could do in the 3 month period since E3 was to bug test and fix inconsistencies, I can't see them adding new stuff in such short time"
MarioMaker,3e1krl,EveMK89,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what? Why would you want them to have their own place on the toolbar? That's the last thing you should want. Those are valuable spots that could be inhabited by something else? If they work as shakeables, use the bloody shakeables. o_e"
MarioMaker,3e1krl,insanesana,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:24 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that more game specific elements would appear as stretches were SMB3 exclusive, and some other people before were suggesting a master palette you can choose elements to use in the stages, as in, the palettes to use per stage are limited, but outside of it you can customized them with lots of other stuff to use per levels, or like others were saying recently, stuff like 1-up mushrooms and block types would be put together into a single slot so that there is more room for other elements, etc  So yeah, I guess I just want more stuff in general, being a bit greedy"
MarioMaker,3e1krl,EveMK89,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:56 2015 UTC,There are a few items on the roster that don't belong on their own slot - you don't need two spiked enemies on different slots. The ice block doesn't need it's own slot (and I suspect it might just be hinting at additional themes anyway?) and I don't even think the 1-Up Mushroom deserves it's own slot when so many people will be quick to shake a Super Mushroom anyway.
MarioMaker,3e1krl,XenesisXenon,0,Tue Jul 21 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"It is already going along with the 30th anniversary. It comes out Friday, September 11th. The anniversary is September 13th. Games release on Fridays."

MarioMaker,3dztyr,Joshers744,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:46:14 2015 UTC,Watched it last night with the wife. It was interesting. I wish I could have seen what they could have done without being in such a rush. The ones I wanted to win both lost anyway. Though I wish I would have known before hand that all I had to do was become a cake expert to get into e3 and meet Miyamoto...living in WV gives you little to no way to get into the gaming industry.
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,UM3000,8,Tue Jul 21 01:54:46 2015 UTC,Probably their way of handling the fact that little kids are gonna make levels that just have 3465 goombas
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,ThatsSoFunnyHeHe,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:59 2015 UTC,yep.  And I would rather a consistent 30 fps then have it stutter when lots of things are happening.
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,ShawnisMaximus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:06:00 2015 UTC,This is probably a bad idea but it makes me wonder if they couldn't make the game have a threshold for elements where it switches from 60 to 30 fps.
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,Confuzet,6,Wed Jul 22 00:06:30 2015 UTC,I can feel it now...  Gamespot:  3.0/10 - The framerate is absolutely destroyed when in the Wii U graphics mode.  We are forced to make a major deduction.  0.1 points for every frame per second goombas walk.

MarioMaker,3e0r8k,mq_krem,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:45 2015 UTC,"True, that could be the case as well. Either it's only like this for the demo, or maybe they aren't up to snuff. I think it probably depends on the amount of objects in the level."
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,Cozmosus,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:38 2015 UTC,to fit better with the engine   They've confirmed that Super Mario Maker is actually running in the NSMBU engine to begin with.
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,EveMK89,3,Tue Jul 21 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that too and found it very odd. I have no idea why they would choose to do that when other games have proven that the Wii U can handle 60fps for cartoony games like Mario and such."
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,TORFdot0,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:16 2015 UTC,"I know, right? Like I said before, maybe it has to do with how much is in the level. Or maybe it's a quirk only in the demo. Who knows?"
MarioMaker,3e0r8k,mq_krem,3,Tue Jul 21 04:12:54 2015 UTC,There is no definitive way of knowing that's the case considering Nintendo usually have to go out of their way to upload 60fps content.
MarioMaker,3dznqx,RotomGuy,7,Mon Jul 20 20:48:53 2015 UTC,I actually like SMB3's the most. Like others have said NSMBU looks like plastic.
MarioMaker,3dznqx,VerticalSnoop,7,Mon Jul 20 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"Visuals: New Super Mario Bros. U  It's a bit of a tie between SMW and this, but since the ghost houses in this game look a lot better and even the ghosts themselves look gorgeous I think this one is better. Underwater levels isn't even fair for the others.  From the small particles that are flying around to the background parallaxing, NSMBU outclasses all the others in my opinion.       Sound: Super Mario World  This is perhaps the nostalgia factor (since most of our nostalgic thoughts are triggered by sound) but every soundtrack in this game is a masterpiece. They are mostly a fast-paced upbeat that sticks in our memory like glue. While NSMBW has those type of upbeats too, they have those annoying and uninspired ""wahs"" in the entire game which kind of subtracts some points."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,Wesai,4,Mon Jul 20 21:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yup. After the 4th installment in the ""new"" series I got tired of its music-design.  We need something ""New-New"" here. No ""New X bros Y"". Some new Artstyle would also go a long way IMO in a new Mario game."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,Malorak,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"Personally I found the ""wah"" parts to be the best of the music, I always found myself singing it along while playing"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,insanesana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"Uninspired? While you think it's annoying, it actually plays a key role in identifying NSMB. music as it distinguishes it from its predecessors; this is because it adds personality and is as much of a staple as anything else in the series. I don't see/hear what's uninspired about that, if anything it's a very bold thing to do..."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,5,Mon Jul 20 21:45:55 2015 UTC,"Put them on repeat throughout most of its tracks and it ""wears out"" and you just become tired of hearing those ""wahs"" that played on 1-1.  Listen to NSMBU title theme music, it's very easy to distinguish it from any other Mario game and yet it has none of those wahs.  It could be an acorn plains thingy, or NSMBU desert thingy, but in the end they decided to put it on everything!  Anyway, with that aside, I still rate them #2 and I think SMB3 or even the original falls in comparison."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,Wesai,2,Mon Jul 20 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"Nope, I've never gotten tired of it. It's a fun means of accentuating the song when it needs it, and usually the accompaniment is so bombastic that it fits right in anyway"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,5,Mon Jul 20 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Those ""wahs"" make me want to mute the game."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,BowsersaurusRex,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:12 2015 UTC,Well that'd be because you're an overly irritant person.
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,6,Tue Jul 21 05:23:23 2015 UTC,"My favorite is actually Mario All Stars, so I'm a bit bummed it didn't make it in.  From the ones that did, SMW is my favorite.  NSMB is my least favorite. I'm not sure why, but I feel it lacks the charm of the others."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,BowsersaurusRex,3,Mon Jul 20 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"Very interesting choice with All Stars. I think I agree with you, except SMW is above that for me.  I really like NSMB as well (especially the Wii U game) but I think the issue with it is (at least for me) is that it doesn't have the same amount of it's own identity. I think it's tries to play off the past too much, such as using the flagpole again. I know that sounds like a silly complaint but that's just an example. I may have nostalgia for Mario games, but I want these newer games to be a little more recognizable on there own. That's actually been my complaint with a few others such as Super Mario 3D Land. Still good games. Just a thought I had."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,Joshers744,4,Tue Jul 21 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"Did you know smb 2 is actually a whole other Japanese game called Doki Doki panic? That's why it's not like any of the other games, none of the characters are the same, etc"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,valeriekim86,3,Tue Jul 21 20:17:19 2015 UTC,Mario All Stars included SMB1 and SMB3 as well.
MarioMaker,3dznqx,BowsersaurusRex,3,Tue Jul 21 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"I know. It had smb 1-3 and the lost levels. The lost levels is what was actually released in Japan as smb2 (the real super Mario bros 2) but they thought it was too difficult for Americans, so they changed the characters in their (Japanese) Doki Doki and released it to the US as smb2"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,valeriekim86,2,Tue Jul 21 20:46:37 2015 UTC,Is there anyone who doesn't know this?
MarioMaker,3dznqx,BowsersaurusRex,3,Tue Jul 21 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"SMB3 have the best looking sprites for me, and I agree, NSMBU looks like everything is made of plastic, so in my opnion SMB3 > SMW > SMB = NSMBU (not saying they look bad but that's my opnion)  Though I'll focus on the koopa clown car for some of my levels, and I actually prefer the SMB3 and NSMBU look for them, the resized bowser one in SMW looks cool too  I just wish the new dry bones look got added to the older versions, I love them"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,insanesana,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"The only appropriation I'm really not into is SMW's Bowser sprite. He doesn't fit the aesthetic that that game had or even remotely looks how he did there, he's just way too modern and ""cool""-looking compared to..."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that his sprite wasn't well fleshed out because the game wasn't ready, the black outlines seems really weird (the hammer bro somewhat also suffers from this but not as much)  The original sprite tho was also really big, as was the koopa clown car was double the size it is now, so they had to resize them and to make bowser walk and breathe fire  Hopefully it will be fixed on release"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,insanesana,2,Mon Jul 20 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"He looks too much like Giga Bowser when he should look more like N64's Bowser, that's my problem with it.   EDIT: Ouch... Seriously, lookit how similar they look. That's so stupid and weird ._."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"I get where you are coming from, but I still think that if they fixed the outline/colors to be closer to the game itself, it could fix those problems  Compare all SMW sprites, almost none of them have those dark outlines on the inside, only bowser does, this leads me to think it is unfinished, it isn't likely of nintendo to make their games with such glaring mismatches in style"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,insanesana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"It's the long snout and higher shoulders. That, and him gritting his teeth like that... It's all very un-Bowser like. He doesn't look like Bowser to me :U is Bowser's #1 fan"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 22:32:08 2015 UTC,"Huh, fair enough, I never really looked at the shoulders before! It sure looks out of place"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,insanesana,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:53 2015 UTC,"This VS. This. Bowser's not the snarling type! But you get it by now, I'm sure."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,3,Mon Jul 20 22:45:07 2015 UTC,clears throat loudly
MarioMaker,3dznqx,BowsersaurusRex,2,Tue Jul 21 02:45:42 2015 UTC,"If we're counting the newer sprites added in SMM, I'd say SMB. based on the Adventure Of Link and Monty's Mine Go Boom levels. In terms of music, it's a toss-up between SMB. 3 and SMW... SMB. 3's music is simplistic (and more memorable as a result) but there's more variety in SMW's soundtrack and it's more compelling in places"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"The upgrade from NSMBW to NSMBU was incredible, and honestly the second game is gorgeous. However, just for style alone, SMW is so damn quirky and colorful that it's impossible not to love. JUST LOOK AT THIS FREAKING HAMMER BRO"
MarioMaker,3dznqx,jawbit,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:25 2015 UTC,"New Super Mario Bros. U in terms of graphics and Super Mario World in terms of music, although I do love SMW'S graphics."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,UM3000,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"New Super Mario Bros. U in terms of graphics and Super Mario World in terms of music, although I do love SMW'S graphics."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,UM3000,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:51 2015 UTC,Super Mario world for sure! Might just be a nostalgia bias though
MarioMaker,3dznqx,Padankadank,2,Tue Jul 21 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"SMB. Most of my levels will be in that style. I just really enjoy looking at it in SMM. It's brighter, smoother and clearer than the original NES version."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,MightyArtio,2,Tue Jul 21 06:32:21 2015 UTC,"Mario 3! Nostalgia goggles are influencing that a little bit, but the art style still holds up to this day."
MarioMaker,3dznqx,dustymons,2,Tue Jul 21 06:49:29 2015 UTC,"I definitely like them all, but I'm going to have to go with SMW above all the rest. It might be nostalgia talking since it was my first game ever, but I've always loved the feel, look, and sounds of that game. Plus, Yoshi is my favorite game character. Honestly though, it's hard to say this since I'm a huge Mario fan but I'm not big on the feel of the original SMB. Maybe it's because I started with World. It's not terrible, but definitely not my favorite of the series."
MarioMaker,3e13c1,igotpolo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:36:21 2015 UTC,I feel the handheld games would make more sense if they made a 3DS version of the game.
MarioMaker,3e13c1,UM3000,3,Tue Jul 21 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessary because they don't really introduce any new mechanics. SML is basically SMB., SML2 is basically SMW."
MarioMaker,3e13c1,EveMK89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:41:01 2015 UTC,I've been thinking that recently. I feel like just adding the enemies could actually do a lot for the game.
MarioMaker,3e13c1,ThatsSoFunnyHeHe,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:06 2015 UTC,"I doubt everything from the main titles will be included, so I'd prefer they stick with those. Wouldn't want content to be spread thin."
MarioMaker,3e13c1,Hillumititee,2,Tue Jul 21 08:28:17 2015 UTC,"Though it's almost a completely different style and doesn't have color (at least originally), I'd love to see my first Game Boy game show up in this (Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins). To this day I think it's still my favorite Game Boy game, and I play it on my 3DSXL quite often (just did a bit this morning actually). It's style is so unique from the console games, and I really enjoy it. It's a shame not even Super Mario 3D Land stuck to it though, but that was still a good game."
MarioMaker,3e13c1,Joshers744,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:56 2015 UTC,I think the gameboy version like SMB2 would be basically impossible to implement in the same way. Since they're making it so you can switch game at any time during create mode.
MarioMaker,3e13c1,Confuzet,2,Tue Jul 21 09:59:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair in comparison with the four games, SML is still easier to implement than SMB2 would be. Unlike SMB2, it has some aspects from the other games. The only thing that would be in the way of making this game style would be making new sprites."
MarioMaker,3e13c1,UM3000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:49 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure. I have a lot of doubts but I can't say for sure. Like I doubt the enemies in common would work or they'd have to leave out too many SML enemies. And I'm not sure how the graphics would really fit over one another.
MarioMaker,3e13c1,Confuzet,2,Tue Jul 21 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"Well maybe they'd put it in color, I dunno. For the enemies in common they could possibly edit the sprites so they're more like the regular enemy. They'd have to make custom sprites for all the course styles, objects, and enemies not present tho."
MarioMaker,3e13c1,UM3000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:16 2015 UTC,I didn't even mean color. But yeah they might have to change so much about SML that it'll barely even be SML anymore.
MarioMaker,3dzqm7,RotomGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:08:30 2015 UTC,"Oh that's something I didn't know I wanted! Though I saw a level where you have to defeat bowser jr to get his clown car to proceed and another where bowser is just inside a small area that you need fireballs to clear the way, so you could just be creative and figure a way for the player to defeat the boss to proceed"
MarioMaker,3dzqm7,insanesana,2,Mon Jul 20 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"That was a fantastic use of the clown car, to force an actual boss fight. Unfortunately, I can't think of any other powerup that could function that way."
MarioMaker,3dzqm7,jawbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how they'd implement this, but I'd just really like a toggle for certain enemies hurting other enemies."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,jawbit,6,Mon Jul 20 16:57:01 2015 UTC,Definitely SMW or NSMB. It's basically a decision between whether I like throwing shells upwards or wall jumping.
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,RotomGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:46 2015 UTC,Totally forgot about upwards throws. Such a small but great mechanic. Thanks for reaffirming my preference!
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,AtomKick,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:11 2015 UTC,Throwing shells upwards is so essential for creating more diverse puzzles. I think it will be the reason SMW will be the most popular type in SMM
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,Dustfromthestars,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"SMW for me, but I do really like SMB physics too. They're definitely more limited and less twitchy but they force a certain style of patience while playing. There are so many jumps in SMB where death is staring you right in the face and I love that."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,AtomKick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like SMB physics are the least forgiving, which makes the technical jumps more challenging. I plan to make levels for all the types, but i'm pretty sure the majority of levels i make will be SMB and SMW levels."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,Wesai,3,Mon Jul 20 20:16:19 2015 UTC,"My two favorites:     1 - Super Mario World  Mario feels more responsive to command and being able to throw shells upwards makes you feeling like you have more control, the flying feather is harder to master compared to SMB3 or NSMBU but it gets you to places very quickly as a reward.       2 - New Super Mario Bros. U  Wall jumps,  triple jumps and air stalls are a great addition to the series. It feels fun controlling Mario no matter if you are using wii-motes, the gamepad or pro controllers."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,Joshers744,2,Mon Jul 20 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"I've always felt like I've had the most control with SMW (though it was my first ever game so I may be a bit bias). I like them all, but honestly the original SMB feel is my least favorite. I've played it for years of course, but that slow upward jump, than that suddenly fall without having much control just gets me into trouble."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,insanesana,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"Most physics are the same, the difference is mainly acceleration  Like in SMB it is difficult to turn in midair, but in newer games it is way easier, and when landing while running, it takes a while to stop and you can slide off a platform if you are not careful  That said, my favorites are SMW and NSMBU, I just can't play any NSMB games without airstalls anymore!"
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,MightyArtio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"Having replayed SMB and SMB3, I prefer SMB and dislike SMB3 physics."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,NuIIatrum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:20 2015 UTC,SMW for me.
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,UM3000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, NSMB and SMW are my 2 favorites."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,ilovesnes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:47 2015 UTC,"I can barely stand Super Mario World's physics compared to the others. There's just something so unsatisfying about that game that I can't put my finger on. I feel more in control with both SMB and NSMBU. Having said that, Super Mario World was the only pre-NSMB 2D Mario game I never played growing up, hence the negative predisposition."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,Mettie7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"All of them except NSMB/U were perfect. NSMB/U has some crazy control problems imo, it's aggravating. I only have Luigi U because it has Luigi, I haven't even played the game more than once."
MarioMaker,3dyqqw,Malorak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:08 2015 UTC,Give SMW proper Walljumps and that'd be my dreamgame. I love the spinjump's ability to jump on enemies who are otherwise impossible to jump on. (Made a level in Lunarmagic which makes you spinjump for like 3 minutes on a saw. It was hard as nails and I loved it.)
MarioMaker,3dzqeb,Confuzet,7,Mon Jul 20 21:06:47 2015 UTC,Everyone either misses the Propellor Mushroom or can't use it properly.
MarioMaker,3dzqeb,RotomGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with this level is that it's too short, you could make a really interesting puzzle based levels where you have to use thwomps to activate switches and other enemies  But it is a good concept for ideas"
MarioMaker,3e01mm,UM3000,3,Mon Jul 20 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"If by beach koopas you mean shellless ones, then yes, they do, but only if Mario jumps on them, you can't place those ones that kick shells so far"
MarioMaker,3e01mm,insanesana,3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:29 2015 UTC,"Aw, I just realized that. What a shame..."
MarioMaker,3e01mm,FawfulCopterFury,2,Tue Jul 21 07:00:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks! I was curious. :)"
MarioMaker,3e01mm,Joshers744,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"While we are on the topic, will the various colors give Yoshi different power ups like they used to? Such as the blue ones giving him wings?"
MarioMaker,3e01mm,insanesana,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:14 2015 UTC,"Good thinking. Blue and Yellow Koopas haven't been confirmed yet, unfortunately. Maybe you can put Wings on a Yoshi? I dunno!"
MarioMaker,3e01bv,ilovesnes,4,Mon Jul 20 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"The only NSMBU exclusive powerup is the propeller mushroom (leaf in SMB3, feather in SMW and mystery mushroom in SMB), but there is a chance that they might add new powerups by release  So, no acorns yet so far, but there is still a chance"
MarioMaker,3e01bv,insanesana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's a shame. Cheers for the response. I was hoping to make a stage based on precise gliding; it would be based almost exclusively  in the air, with bullet bills & winged koopas serving as the main opposition."
MarioMaker,3e01bv,EveMK89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Propeller Cap already fills that role. So unless it's a shakeable item in the final version, it'll be left out I'm afraid"
MarioMaker,3e01bv,samus12345,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, really; you can float down, but not glide. SMW cape might work for OP's idea, though."
MarioMaker,3e01bv,Hillumititee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, I never considered that some power ups were exclusive. I figured with them making spooky level types for SMB and SMB3 and things like that they'd bring the power ups over. :/"
MarioMaker,3e01bv,UM3000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it appears a lot of stuff is either not in the older games but brought over, or areexclusive to 1 or 2 games."

MarioMaker,3dzx44,insanesana,4,Mon Jul 20 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is the Ghost House theme, they were never in the original so they added it to keep it constant with the other games."

MarioMaker,3dyt7m,insanesana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"You could use one-way walls to allow enemies in, but not Mario out. Not exactly what you were saying, but it's something.  The fake walls from NSMBU would be great for a maze level, as long as they were done tastefully and there were subtle clues in the terrain or objects. It'd also be awesome if we could have a ""lights-out"" theme and objects like lights, lanterns, light blocks, etc. That would make for a fantastic maze level, both in design and flavor."
MarioMaker,3dyt7m,jawbit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yes that's what I was talking about, a wall that only allows stuff to get through but Mario can't  That way you can have enemies or a koopa clown car go through a treadmill to a closed off area the player can't, which could be used for interesting puzzles  Also fake walls would be a nice addition, but I can't see how they could be editted well unless they are a type of platform you can adjust the size and can blend with the blocks around it"
MarioMaker,3dz12d,XonSuprimes,11,Mon Jul 20 18:07:56 2015 UTC,I've never been a fan of leaderboards. They always end up being full of people that found a way to glitch or exploit the game to finish something in 00'00'01 or with 999999999 points.
MarioMaker,3dz12d,MightyArtio,8,Mon Jul 20 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe not leaderboards, (for the reasons MightyArtio stated), but I'd love to see some level replays, where we can see how other people played the level."
MarioMaker,3dz12d,filipop,4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"Now, this, I'd love to see. I want to see how everyone plays my level. Either one by one or all at once. I saw a video years ago with someone having 100 marios playing the first level of SMB at the same time. That would be cool to see in SMM."
MarioMaker,3dz12d,MightyArtio,4,Mon Jul 20 18:34:03 2015 UTC,You mean like how 3D World had Mii Ghosts? That'd be pretty cool.
MarioMaker,3dz12d,UM3000,3,Mon Jul 20 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"This would be great, both for other players and the creator."
MarioMaker,3dz12d,jawbit,3,Mon Jul 20 18:48:13 2015 UTC,You'd think that might be the case with taunts (for the Mystery Mushrooms) being in there. There wouldn't really be that much point in having them otherwise?
MarioMaker,3dz12d,EveMK89,3,Mon Jul 20 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe, (and I hope so!) but I thought the taunts were just to make each costume a bit more unique."
MarioMaker,3dz12d,filipop,3,Mon Jul 20 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"It probably is and it works, but realistically you don't have any other reason for doing them unless it's to show off x3 Unless they each qualify as easter eggs, idk."
MarioMaker,3dz12d,EveMK89,3,Mon Jul 20 20:12:37 2015 UTC,I thought every level did have leaderboards? Not for time but for score?

MarioMaker,3dxa7u,Scotsman333,3,Mon Jul 20 14:18:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I really want the snow and desert themes for some stage ideas, and they have been in every game except for a few, it wouldn't be too hard to add them if they added airship and ghost house themes to all others"
MarioMaker,3dxa7u,insanesana,6,Mon Jul 20 15:01:03 2015 UTC,Maybe like $0.99
MarioMaker,3dxa7u,XonSuprimes,4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:50 2015 UTC,That's the price I was thinking of.
MarioMaker,3dxa7u,syxtfour,4,Mon Jul 20 18:22:02 2015 UTC,$0. Something like that should be free DLC.

MarioMaker,3dxa7u,Wesai,3,Mon Jul 20 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Nothing. You guys shouldn't be content with something like this when this could be in the disc to begin with.  If they felt like they had to release the game before being able to work on other things, then sure by all means go ahead. As long as they remember they released a game lacking features that waves of fan have been wanting since day 1 like ice & desert themes + more enemies.  One of the first enemies you see in SMW for example isn't even in the game, the dinos! That game revolves around being in the dinosaur land (it even introduces Yoshi) and then we don't get them. I'm a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I can't wait to buy this day one, but I feel like it could have been a game with a greater scale."
MarioMaker,3dxa7u,Butters_Creamy_Goo,8,Mon Jul 20 19:11:32 2015 UTC,No. I'm already paying $60. Nintendo should keep it free for this game.

MarioMaker,3dxa7u,m1kepro,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:20 2015 UTC,"DLC that only some users have will fragment the game pretty severely, as any map with even one piece of DLC in it will be rendered useless to everyone who hasn't bought it.  So I agree with OP here. The game would be vastly better if DLC is free. Or at the very least, free to play, but costs to build with."
MarioMaker,3dxa7u,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"For these packs? Like... £3.99 each. But it's irrelevant, 'cos I'd get them regardless. I'd pay in my own blood if I had to.

MarioMaker,3dxa7u,Joshers744,2,Mon Jul 20 08:29:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe $5 or so. If they do DLC, I'd like to see some other games added in. It's a big stretch, but I'd go with SML2 first if I could. The lack of color might look a bit odd next to the other styles though."

MarioMaker,3dx508,EveMK89,5,Mon Jul 20 07:23:33 2015 UTC,Being able to use Wario's shoulder barge to break blocks that are stacked vertically would be cool.  Maybe a Wario Land skin for everything? I'm aware it's insanely unlikely but I want to dream.
MarioMaker,3dx508,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 07:37:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're both very ambitious. Y'know how Mario Paint had hidden mini-games? I wonder if those will make a return via amiibo."
MarioMaker,3dx508,EveMK89,3,Mon Jul 20 07:43:50 2015 UTC,"Well, fly swatting is still in there so, you never know.  While it is cool that we can dress as other characters, it does feel like a missed opportunity to not have them differentiate more from Mario. Wether it's as ambitious as different properties and abilities or as doable as allowing them to get a Fire Flower and reskinning the fireballs to suit the character (volleyballs for Wii Fit Trainer, pills for Dr Mario, barrels for DK etc), they could do a little more with the idea.  Maybe have the creator of the level make the character the default state of Mario in that level so you start as that character and can't loose the costume but still die. That way we could have entire levels about Bowser turning on his minions or Peach saving herself."
MarioMaker,3dx508,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 08:17:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can see why that's the case. Consistency is really important throughout, and in messing with the physics/properties you're introducing difficulty with a learning curve that shouldn't be there. That, and some would say cosmetic amiibo are the best amiibo because it doesn't feel like you're being sold out of new experiences (I'm all-for new features, but I'm one of few on that one.)  EDIT: Completely agree with the fireballs. I wouldn't even care if it was something as basic as a palette swap! Worst case scenario - the Fire Flower doesn't apply if you're already wearing a costume, but I doubt that's the case seeing as the Mystery Mushroom is effectively a Super Mushroom and stuff. Scary thought though!"
MarioMaker,3dx508,UM3000,2,Mon Jul 20 08:33:54 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, amiibo costumes are unlockable but having the amiibo unlocks them instantly. So no one would really miss out. I'd happily settle for reskinned fireballs. It's a pity costume+Fire Flower isn't possible."
MarioMaker,3dx508,EveMK89,2,Mon Jul 20 09:15:09 2015 UTC,"No, that's not the case. Mystery Mushrooms are their own item because you can unlock non-amiibo costumes (including Goombas, that we know of) but it's never been said that amiibo costumes are unlockable, i'm afraid (they're cosmetic anyway, and it's not like they're mandatory to play other courses or anything!). That'd explain why Mystery Mushrooms are their own item when you could have easily just scanned in the amiibo and had the appear costume then and there in the level without having to dive into any sub-menus."
MarioMaker,3dx508,Scotsman333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:22 2015 UTC,I thought it was said you can unlock them in the 100 Mario Challenge. S
MarioMaker,3dx508,UM3000,2,Mon Jul 20 12:02:41 2015 UTC,"They said you can unlock costumes via 10/100 Mario Challenge (Goomba) but they've never specifically said that amiibo can be. I dunno' maybe that's the difference between the two? Maybe the 100 Mario Challenge nabs you an amiibo costume, while the 10 Mario Challenge nabs you a non-amiibo costume."

MarioMaker,3dvlad,insanesana,3,Sun Jul 19 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"Toad-ally. That's why I go out of my way to avoid saying ""NEED"" because yeah, I'd be quite content with the game as we know it now"
MarioMaker,3dvlad,Alexander12476,2,Sun Jul 19 23:08:00 2015 UTC,"I can easily imagine a SMB 2 Character/Enemy DLC pack.  Birdo, Shy Guys, Hopping Birds, etc."
MarioMaker,3dvlad,insanesana,3,Sun Jul 19 23:37:10 2015 UTC,Birdo and Shy Guy are especially prevalent in the Mario franchise! (Pokeys would work too)
MarioMaker,3dvlad,Cozmosus,2,Sun Jul 19 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"I find it unlikely, unless shy guys replace goombas and hopping birds are replacing koopas, and how would blocks work since SMB2 didn't use question blocks? Maybe they could be used as grass, still...  If they do add it I think it will be appearance only and not have many features unless they make like the Mario Advance 4 e-reader levels and add those mechanics to the game, the grass and stuff, but to all styles too, or else it would be troublesome to switch when editting"
MarioMaker,3dvlad,thinbuddha,2,Mon Jul 20 02:37:09 2015 UTC,"Splatoon is a testament to that   I wouldn't say that just yet. Yes, the content being released is awesome and it's good for the longevity of the game, but it is not DLC. Everything that is being released is already in the game and on disk. What they are doing is flipping switches and letting you unlock the content you already have when they feel the time is right. We need to wait until after August (presumably when they release the last bit of on-disk content) to see what they do with actual DLC."
MarioMaker,3dvlad,insanesana,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"That's not what I thought was happening. Do you have a source?   I was under the impression that they rushed an unfinished game to market, and that they were adding the extra weapons and courses that they had originally planned to include, but didn't have time to include.... But I don't have a source, and it might be based on speculation."
MarioMaker,3dvlad,BowsersaurusRex,2,Mon Jul 20 05:56:22 2015 UTC,"No, it's a publicity campaign - all of the weapons were included on disc."
MarioMaker,3dvlad,RadzPrower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:56:03 2015 UTC,"You'd find it weird the game doesn't download any data when the ""DLC"" arrives, all it gets is a time from the server and allow the unlock  A neat system to give the impression new stuff is coming, it works, but it isn't really DLC as all content is just locked on disc and the server only tells which time to unlock it  Most noticeable when you are playing and then bam the weapons just get unlocked, no need to even close the game"
MarioMaker,3dvek7,jawbit,8,Sun Jul 19 21:10:25 2015 UTC,Star Coins/Dragon Coins should be in the game.

MarioMaker,3dtn5b,eetmorturkee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true. Nintendo has developers on the floor watching people play their games and making notes for tweaks later.  They just have so many people wanting to play that they have to have marketers serve as the primary interface.   Devs also spend time with high-profile journalists (IGN, etc.) in back rooms discussing and playing the games.  I can't remember specific cases to dig up, but I know that I've seen examples of Miyamoto and others commenting on their observations, and also cases where journalists ask about a feature because they noticed what was going on on the floor and want to draw attention to it.   Last thing to note is that the playable versions are usually not the latest, so not only will they be missing features shown in videos, but the development might be nearly finalized, even when the demo doesn't seem to be.   *edit: SDCC was definitely a marketing presence for marketing purposes."
MarioMaker,3dtn5b,insanesana,2,Mon Jul 20 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't really work since you can adjust their heights, it would be like seeing a flying wall across the screen! (that would be actually interesting for some level ideas)"
MarioMaker,3drvkw,MrStickventuresYT,8,Sat Jul 18 21:25:31 2015 UTC,"I love being able to hit ""Make"" and just jump right into the editor."
MarioMaker,3drvkw,InspectorSpaceman,5,Sun Jul 19 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"Hah, the timer ticks down even on the title screen. What would happen if you waited until it hits zero and Mario dies?"
MarioMaker,3drvkw,Beed28,4,Sun Jul 19 00:44:01 2015 UTC,Totaka's Song?
MarioMaker,3drvkw,GroriousNipponSteer,2,Sun Jul 19 11:22:23 2015 UTC,Totaka isn't known to be working on this game. People don't seem to understand what Totaka's Song even is anymore...
MarioMaker,3drvkw,EveMK89,3,Sun Jul 19 12:06:39 2015 UTC,"I understand what Totaka's Song is. I was saying it because this game is somewhat of a spiritual successor to Mario Paint, a game which Totaka worked on and featured Totaka's song is. Besides, it's purely speculation, no need to be rude."
MarioMaker,3drvkw,GroriousNipponSteer,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:32 2015 UTC,"I know, I wasn't talking about you specifically. Totaka might very well be working on this game, I don't know anymore than you do. It was just a statement is all. People talk about Totaka's Song in Splatoon and it's like ""Have you even heard Totaka's Song or know what it is?"""
MarioMaker,3drvkw,EveMK89,4,Sun Jul 19 12:39:20 2015 UTC,You can play the title screen? Seeing this makes me so anxious to finally play this game!
MarioMaker,3drvkw,jesusfromthebible,3,Sun Jul 19 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"So catchy... ;-; NWR always compresses their videos to death for whatever reason, though."
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,NoName12321,3,Sun Jul 19 02:08:43 2015 UTC,"I know it may seem a little weird, but since this came out, I've wanted to recreate old Mega Man games in the style of Super Mario.  I'm going to rebuild the levels as faithfully as I can, and then recreate the enemies using Mario enemies.  The hard part will be the placement of fire flowers for Mario to use instead of the Mega Blaster.  I don't want people dying after two hits, so spacing them out to make it like Mega Man is important.  In later Mega Man games, when he got Rush, those levels will have Yoshi.  For example, when Rush is needed as a spring board, there will be a Yoshi egg and a spring board, etc.  What do you think?"
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,Alexander12476,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds really cool, I'd love to play that."
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,InspectorSpaceman,2,Mon Jul 20 02:39:40 2015 UTC,"Unless nobody has tried shaking the Super Mushroom, there is no poison mushroom in this game it appears."
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,insanesana,3,Sun Jul 19 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"I was hoping they added it in or mini mushrooms so you could shrink enemies as well, making twimps and mini goombas viable  Hopefully it can be in the stuff they didn't show yet"
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,EveMK89,2,Sun Jul 19 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"Mini? Mmm... Nah. That wouldn't fit the grid they've already implemented, it'd be a mess."
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,InspectorSpaceman,2,Sun Jul 19 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"Good point, Nintendo said no more SLOT would be added, doesn't mean no more ""Shake Variations"" won't."
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,UM3000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"It was only an example, didn't say I would do it. (If there was one I probably would though)"
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,koenn,3,Sun Jul 19 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"Either way, it lets anyone who may have not known that it is currently the case.  I'd love to see it though!"
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,UM3000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:09 2015 UTC,SMB already has a hard mode. And I don't think there is Poison Mushrooms.
MarioMaker,3dsoq4,GelatoCube,2,Sun Jul 19 03:01:55 2015 UTC,SMB hard mode just changes the goombas to buzzy beetles. Not that big of a difference.
MarioMaker,3dryqv,SooperTreeMan,2,Sat Jul 18 21:54:10 2015 UTC,At least half of this stuff is possible.
MarioMaker,3dryqv,Videoboysayscube,2,Sat Jul 18 21:55:15 2015 UTC,I can't imagine the amount of trial and error involved in making something like this.
MarioMaker,3dqvce,filipop,3,Sat Jul 18 16:07:42 2015 UTC,This (along with Monty Mine goes Boom!) is probably one of my favourite levels so far. It really uses the leaf power-up as a theme well and makes the level quite fun to watch!
MarioMaker,3dqvce,Black_Salsa,3,Sat Jul 18 16:15:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting. You can choose the Lava Bubbles' jump height. This level feels like a ""real"" one too."
MarioMaker,3dqvce,EveMK89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"We actually seen already Podoboo's jumping at different heights in NWC-3, I think? It was super impressive there."

MarioMaker,3dqvce,EveMK89,3,Sat Jul 18 17:46:52 2015 UTC,Finally! A leaf-level! There's something really satisfactory about a Bullet Blaster firing a Tanooki Leaf. It's really neat how you can tail-whip the Koopa Clown Car away like that
MarioMaker,3dqvce,VerticalSnoop,2,Sat Jul 18 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"Is it me or is the green on the Clown Car replaced with black in castle levels? If that's a nod to how colour-palettes worked in 8-bit and 16-bit systems then that's a pretty clever detail.  Also, why do these level-designers have such an obsession with SMB3's castle mode? There's so many levels using it that I'm convinced it's a developer in-joke."
MarioMaker,3dqvce,HUGE_HOG,2,Sat Jul 18 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"One of the better levels that I've seen. Being able to whack the clown car with your tail like that is interesting, I bet that can be used to make some puzzles."
MarioMaker,3dqvce,smajda85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:51:52 2015 UTC,This is what I hope to see more of when we play the game online. This is great!
MarioMaker,3dqepk,GamerRealms,3,Sat Jul 18 13:06:44 2015 UTC,GameXplain... Hm. To watch or not to watch?
MarioMaker,3dqepk,EveMK89,7,Sat Jul 18 13:43:48 2015 UTC,"Nothing to see here, it's just a load of footage that we've already seen with them saying ""Mario Maker is good"" and ""We want more bosses and the ability to upload entire games"""
MarioMaker,3dqepk,HUGE_HOG,2,Sat Jul 18 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, it did have that tidbit about Sonic, Mega Man and Pac-Man."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 16:34:23 2015 UTC,Do you ate pizza for an entire month and posted daily video updates?
MarioMaker,3dqepk,paranoideo,3,Sun Jul 19 01:58:41 2015 UTC,"I've still got the videos lying around on my computer, I never uploaded them though. At first it was a time thing, I was too busy with university and stuff. Each video (there are either 30 or 31, I dunno) is a couple of minutes long, so overall the whole thing would've been painfully long. Then I left /r/smashbros because it went back to being a rubbish sub after Sm4sh released, and I figured that nobody else would care. Now I work in film & television where word gets around and I'm honestly scared of my pizza diaries going viral and potential employers recognising me from it.   I did eat pizza for an entire month though, and it wasn't great. I haven't eaten a pizza since."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,HUGE_HOG,3,Sun Jul 19 09:33:26 2015 UTC,Wait. Are the physics consistent or not? I know the mechanics change but I've heard the Treehouse say that physics stay the same throughout. I'm personally hoping the physics are actually consistent :/
MarioMaker,3dqepk,EveMK89,3,Sat Jul 18 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"I think the basics are almost the same, tho I heard someone say a while ago that SMB feels clunkier than the newer games, but still better than the original"
MarioMaker,3dqepk,insanesana,2,Sat Jul 18 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"Well I know for a fact that SMB is different because you can jump off of enemies, when you couldn't in the original. I dunno' I think they're probably just confusing it with the mechanics. It'd introduce so much unneeded difficulty if you had to adjust to the physics every single time..."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 13:58:15 2015 UTC,What do you even mean by are the physics consistent? Each game has their own physics.. that's all?
MarioMaker,3dqepk,Confuzet,2,Sat Jul 18 19:19:21 2015 UTC,"I mean that every theme controls the same. So that, instead of having adjust between themes, you know exactly what you're doing."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,EveMK89,2,Sun Jul 19 03:12:02 2015 UTC,"That would be awful. Each game has their own physics, not giving them their own respective physics would be a huge letdown for most people."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,Confuzet,2,Sun Jul 19 09:54:03 2015 UTC,"People know what they want, but they don't understand the ramifications of it. Best to have consistency among all styles, if anything..."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,EveMK89,2,Sun Jul 19 09:59:50 2015 UTC,"It might get tricky for the unpracticed player. But a lot of things can get tricky in the gaming world. If so, you just kinda gotta make/play levels that fit your skill and get better. Me personally I grew up with all the Mario games in SMM and it would just be second nature to me."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,Confuzet,2,Sun Jul 19 10:01:31 2015 UTC,"I play a lot of Mario games, and 60% of the difficulty comes from having to adapt to the new controls every time. It's arbitrary and annoying, and I don't like it."
MarioMaker,3dqepk,EveMK89,2,Sun Jul 19 10:03:13 2015 UTC,"Well, you are one person. I don't think that's how most people would feel about it."
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,BowsersaurusRex,2,Sat Jul 18 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"From the footage shown so far, picking a mushroom while with the mystery one does nothing, and I assume the same goes for the fire flower"
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,insanesana,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't assume that. Mystery Mushroom is effectively a Super Mushroom, so there's no reason a Fire Flower wouldn't stack on top of it."
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,EveMK89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"I find it unlikely that Nintendo will give every costume a fire flower alt, and it already gives you super mushroom properties while keeping small mario size  it is replaced by the leaf, cape and propeller mushroom in the other styles, so it is just a powerup above the others from what I see"
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,insanesana,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:46:55 2015 UTC,So the costumes are only in the SMB style?
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,HUGE_HOG,3,Sat Jul 18 18:52:55 2015 UTC,Yeah this is confirmed
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,InspectorSpaceman,3,Sat Jul 18 18:53:49 2015 UTC,I has a sad.
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,Cozmosus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:00:45 2015 UTC,"It occupies the same slot as the Leaf, Feather, and Propeller Mushroom.  Sort of the ""Game Exclusive"" powerup."
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,EveMK89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:40 2015 UTC,Making a version of each character for every version would be a LOT of work. Especially trying to make them for NSMBU while keeping the models looking good.
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,insanesana,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:19:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, which is why I think this game may have been better if they had focused on a single Style."
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,Black_Salsa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"Why? They wouldn't need to give you an alt, and if they did it'd just be a simple palette swap."
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,MightyArtio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:57:35 2015 UTC,"Well I am not sure, this is what I think, if they add fire flower powers on the costumes, it would be amazing  But we'll only know on release"
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,MightyArtio,2,Sat Jul 18 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah it doesn't do anything, as you can see here."
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 18:03:21 2015 UTC,That's a bummer. The only thing more pathetic than tiny Bowser is a Bowser that can't shoot fire. :P
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 18:08:01 2015 UTC,It would be cool if you could pick up a fire flower as other characters. The mechanics would remain the same but the actual graphic would change.  So Luigi would throw green fireballs  Peach would throw love hearts.  Wii Fit Trainer would throw volleyballs  DK would throw barrels.  I could go on and on. It's actually pretty fun to think of what to replace the fireballs with.
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,EveMK89,3,Sat Jul 18 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"At the very least, I was hoping the costumes would be the larger sprite size. Most of them look silly at 1x1."
MarioMaker,3dr4yi,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with that."
MarioMaker,3dqo1o,MightyArtio,3,Sat Jul 18 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"I contacted a Nintendo helpline to ask about their shirt stock, and sadly they said they have no information about if the stock will return, individually or packaged :( (""I regret to inform you that we do not have any information on stock levels and can only advise that you try searching the online store for the item that you are looking for in the next few days."")"
MarioMaker,3dqo1o,filipop,2,Sat Jul 18 15:35:30 2015 UTC,"Aw, hopefully they do sell it individually or restock the LE."
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,EveMK89,6,Sat Jul 18 06:43:07 2015 UTC,"The demo at E3 was exactly that, a demo  The Smash demo didn't have every character and the Splatoon demo didn't have every weapon"
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,Scotsman333,2,Sat Jul 18 12:47:46 2015 UTC,I haven't heard it referred to as a demo by anyone officially though. Have you? (I always kind of assumed it was a demo but never got actual confirmation)
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,Confuzet,5,Sat Jul 18 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to not think about it too much and wait for their direct where they have ""a lot more to unveil"" I'm definitely gonna be disappointed if the roster we've seen is everything. Because it's a lot less content than NSMBU so far."
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,Confuzet,3,Sat Jul 18 09:47:27 2015 UTC,"There's more the roster than what we can immediately see. We really won't know all it has to offer until we can actually sit and experiment with it, and see what can be done with that"
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,Confuzet,2,Sat Jul 18 10:14:55 2015 UTC,"Well yeah that too but the direct should clear up everything for the most part too. I'm not entirely sure there's more elements though, and I hope there's more than just a few more."
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,Confuzet,3,Sat Jul 18 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"I'm quite sure there will be. I mean, think about how much it changes and how much more robust it's been every time we've seen it? It's always been significant. As I said, I don't think anything is truly presentable unless it's completely stable and reliable, which would exclude a lot of stuff that they've probably ironed / will iron out in the meantime."
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,Confuzet,3,Sat Jul 18 12:09:50 2015 UTC,"I just think they made a special build for E3 and stuff and kept the final build with much more content for the launch. That's my hunch for now since again they ""have a lot more to unveil"". But I think the games gone gold a while ago. It's not uncommon though to make a special E3 build and since the game was originally planned for the first half of 2015 I think it's likely the game was finished around that time, while they decided to make an E3 version and release the game close to the 30th anniversary."
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,Confuzet,3,Sat Jul 18 12:13:16 2015 UTC,"If it is truly robust, that'd mean so much more bug-fixing and general scrutiny from the play-testers. It'd be a pretty lengthy process. It's funny, even the UI has changed from when we seen it in that one direct."
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,UM3000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:17:47 2015 UTC,When is it truly robust? If they had two pages instead of the one we've seen now they'd still not have 50% of the content that NSMBU has.
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,VerticalSnoop,3,Sat Jul 18 12:29:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's already robust. I'm not comparing it to NSMB. U, it's a completely different premise"
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,hylian122,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:12 2015 UTC,It is completely different. That doesn't mean you can't compare the content though. The amount is very comparable if you ask me. That one page of elements won't last people all that long before everything has been done. I would've hoped to see nearly as much content as NSMBU if you want there to be longevity.  Right now you basically trade in heaps of content for the ability to combine things more and the ability to create your own level. I'd hope you wouldn't be trading in content. It'd be nice if you essentially had the level creation and element combining on top of it.  You see where I'm coming from? I really don't think they're that incomparable. SMM even literally has content from NSMBU.  I would want this to be a game for the ages you know? That's what I once kinda thought it would be. Not a novelty that wears off as fast as most games do.
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,UM3000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:59:11 2015 UTC,It has plenty to offer. You just have your expectations a little too high. ;P
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,UM3000,3,Sat Jul 18 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"We need slopes to make unique levels, though."
MarioMaker,3dpqvn,landi_kong,5,Sat Jul 18 10:28:04 2015 UTC,"You don't need slopes :') Super Mario Bros. is an amazing, well-designed game and that doesn't have any? If it's any consolation, the rail sort of indicates that they have implemented something that can go diagonal, so it's not a totally lost-cause or anything"
MarioMaker,3dpk63,UM3000,4,Sat Jul 18 05:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've seen loadtimes of 9 seconds for the first time load and then 6 seconds when they died. Even in the tiniest level. People were saying it loads every style of the game even though it was play mode and they were playing SMB1. Maybe this is just a sign that the E3 version isn't nearly the final version of the game.   But if this is going to be in the final game I'd say it's pretty damn bad. That'd be disappointing especially since I know how they hate loadtimes over at Nintendo, what with their reluctance to move on to disc based consoles."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Confuzet,2,Sat Jul 18 09:40:41 2015 UTC,"We can only hope. Whether or not, I'm still getting the game. :)"
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Confuzet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:21:35 2015 UTC,I already pre-ordered the Amiibo included version.
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Confuzet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:40:15 2015 UTC,Lucky! I bet the amiibos aren't going to last too long. :P
MarioMaker,3dpk63,MightyArtio,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:18 2015 UTC,There's no knowing really. They might consistently keep producing them like the other main line Amiibo.
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Meis_Triumph,3,Sun Jul 19 09:56:14 2015 UTC,"How bad it is depends on what it's loading. If it's loading a very long level with a huge number of objects, it's not that bad. If it's loading a tiny barren level and it still takes that long, it's pretty bad."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,VerticalSnoop,2,Sat Jul 18 08:17:36 2015 UTC,"Well, this level is really short: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TaGYIC3JiEk  It's still 6 seconds. Hopefully this only applies to the SDCC Demo."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,hylian122,3,Sat Jul 18 08:30:03 2015 UTC,"If you're dying a lot, could be a nice cool-down period."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Confuzet,2,Sat Jul 18 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"In most Mario games that are even bigger than Mario Maker, as soon as you die there's little to no load times inbetween, and even if there is there's something to look at - It throws you right into the action. There's not much of an excuse for Mario Maker when it's pretty small in comparison to, per se, NSMBU."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Wesai,3,Sat Jul 18 10:31:01 2015 UTC,"Except that most levels come from online, not the disc."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Scapetti,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:27:06 2015 UTC,"The only thing you download is the location of elements, which might be a very small file size, like kilobytes? Even if it was a substantial size there should be no wait time on deaths beyond a second."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,Scapetti,3,Sat Jul 18 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you are streaming only the location of things, not the actual sprites themselves. That by itself should EASILY be allocated on Wii U's RAM without even being dumped once you change levels so you could come back to it if you feel like.  This is not an excuse, Nintendo needs to improve those loading times. Even DKCTF had no loading times if you died, and that is a game known for having very long loading times when entering in the stages.  I don't know if we will have another Direct, but I do feel like they will improve that aspect of the game before mass production."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,EveMK89,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"There are no load times, it's near instant... in other Mario games you would usually see the number of lives appear during that ""load time"". Why would they design it so that it has to load the level again every time you die? If you die when you are testing out your level you can go straight back to the maker instantly at any point."
MarioMaker,3dpk63,EveMK89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:39:38 2015 UTC,"I mean when you play online levels, not your own levels. :P"
MarioMaker,3dpk63,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 23:23:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I still think it is to do with the lives screen when you get killed but I guess it could depend on your internet speed. I just can't see why they would reload the stages from the internet whenever you get killed, surely it won't take up too much of the cache, Nintendo are smarter than that."
MarioMaker,3dniwp,VerticalSnoop,7,Fri Jul 17 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"So while I'm here, here's the things I had in mind for a handheld version:   The modes in the game, rather than Mario 1, 3, World and NSMBU, would be Super Mario Bros. DX, Super Mario Land, Super Mario Land 2 and the original New Super Mario Bros. In editing mode, the bottom screen's used for editing and the top screen has a general overview of the stage. In gameplay mode, the top screen's for gameplay while the bottom screen (while in NSMB mode) shows the HUD and the Item Reserve. The boss characters, along with Bowser and Jr., also include Wario and Tatanga. The gameplay mode's engine is mainly based on NSMB, like how the Wii U version's is based on NSMBU."
MarioMaker,3dniwp,ptatoface,2,Fri Jul 17 19:23:42 2015 UTC,Why the original NSMB? Isn't it just a lower resolution of the same sprites?
MarioMaker,3dniwp,ptatoface,2,Sat Jul 18 05:49:42 2015 UTC,What do you mean?
MarioMaker,3dniwp,Joshers744,2,Sat Jul 18 10:15:42 2015 UTC,"All of the Mario games that are used as pallets in SMM have a unique style with unique mechanics. The original New Super Mario Bros. doesn't have either of those, because New Super Mario Bros. U has the same style (but with higher resolution graphics) and has the same mechanics."
MarioMaker,3dniwp,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"I chose NSMB because that and NSMB2 were the only 2D handheld platformers that could fit in with the Gameboy games's gameplay.  Now that I think about it, though, I guess NSMB2 would've been a better choice since it had more unique mechanics than the original. That or maybe the Mario Advance games."
MarioMaker,3dq19i,swiftweed89,5,Sat Jul 18 09:30:43 2015 UTC,This one and Cap'n Big Dry Bones are some of my favourite levels because of how much they feel like actual levels.
MarioMaker,3dq19i,RotomGuy,3,Sat Jul 18 10:43:56 2015 UTC,"I think most of the levels we've seen have been trying to say ""Oh wow look at all the crazy stuff you can do!

MarioMaker,3dq19i,Confuzet,2,Sat Jul 18 09:50:09 2015 UTC,---{  Let's do this
MarioMaker,3do48e,Confuzet,4,Fri Jul 17 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, this level. Y'know I've seen at least one request for non-teleporting Magikoopa's? Should be simple enough to implement with a shake-shake-shake"
MarioMaker,3do48e,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 21:41:03 2015 UTC,"Glad Magikoopas are in the game. They've even been used in the main series for some interesting puzzles, and compared to most regular enemies they're actually pretty tough to beat especially without fire."
MarioMaker,3do48e,HUGE_HOG,2,Fri Jul 17 21:56:08 2015 UTC,That music!!!
MarioMaker,3do48e,UnidentifiedFlop,2,Sat Jul 18 05:32:51 2015 UTC,"[Obligatory ""Magikoopa shoots Playstation symbols"" joke]"
MarioMaker,3do48e,VerticalSnoop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:33:36 2015 UTC,It's playstation that uses magical symbols because Magikoopa existed first.
MarioMaker,3do44b,Videoboysayscube,6,Fri Jul 17 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"I don't mind it. Super Mario Bros 3 had no checkpoints, levels were shorter but presented a set theme that required you to learn and then utilise certain skills.   Also, checkpoints could be used for trolling. You could place it over a pit so that you die every time you spawn, with no option but to quit the level which would severely ruin 10/100 Mario mode. The creator would still be able to 'complete' the level and upload it by either avoiding the checkpoint completely or beating the level in one try."
MarioMaker,3do44b,HUGE_HOG,2,Fri Jul 17 22:06:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's a cheap excuse to not have them in. There could be a very simple algorithm that prevents Makers from placing checkpoints above pits. :/"
MarioMaker,3do44b,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 07:16:29 2015 UTC,"It could be abused in plenty of ways. You could put a star just before the checkpoint, followed by thousands of Hammer Bros - the first time you just run through the checkpoint and kill them all because you're invincible, but upon every respawn (as small Mario) you'd just get massacred.  Checkpoints could be placed over prisons that drop you into a non-fatal hole upon respawn that you can't escape from (like a big U-shape), leaving you to either quit or run down the clock."
MarioMaker,3do44b,HUGE_HOG,3,Sat Jul 18 09:03:20 2015 UTC,"Well in that case, the level doesn't get starred and the maker is unable to make more levels. They've already got a solution for trolls :/ This isn't exclusive to checkpoints."
MarioMaker,3do44b,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 09:05:48 2015 UTC,"If they added checkpoints, I'd imagine they'd work like either when you press play with mario in air, as in, create blocks that last as long as mario is over them, or that it automatically create solid blocks under it so that you can't fall, that would solve the trolling problem  Oh and keep only 1 checkpoint max per level"
MarioMaker,3do44b,insanesana,2,Sun Jul 19 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"There are other ways they could be used for trolling, check my other comment  They're obviously not in the game because there are too many ifs and buts involved, the easiest way to prevent checkpoint abuse is just no checkpoints"
MarioMaker,3do44b,HUGE_HOG,3,Sun Jul 19 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"The idea I had to deal with no checkpoints (if this is even the case, just because we haven't seen it yet, doesn't mean it won't be in. they have ""a lot more to unveil""). But in the case of not having checkpoints I would design my levels in such a way that the difficulty goes up and then down once you go beyond halfway into the stage. That way you are not likely to die a cheap death close to the end."
MarioMaker,3do44b,Confuzet,3,Fri Jul 17 21:23:08 2015 UTC,"I liked what the Treehouse guys did with the levels they created for the Nintendo World Championships...  They actually specifically mentioned a lack of checkpoints during the design iteration.    Their solution was surprisingly elegant - one-way walls.  They talk about how there are two different types of difficulty:  technical difficulty, and platforming difficulty.  One-way walls don't really help in the technical heavy levels.  You're likely going to be thrown at a lot of enemies, and you're going to die quite a bit before you're able to get past it.  And that's okay on those types of levels.  Repeat iteration helps you beat them.  You need that.    On the platfoming difficult levels, the one-way walls act as checkpoints.  After a series of difficult leaps, wall jumps, air stalls, etc. you reach a ""safe area"" just past a one-way wall that you can't die, and can't go back and lose progress.    Example, the NWC4 Mario Maker level."
MarioMaker,3do44b,Donkeyshlopter,2,Sat Jul 18 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"I think Makers might have consciously implement this 'one-way wall mentality' into their own level-design if checkpoints are not in, at least for the more acrobatic stages."
MarioMaker,3do44b,EveMK89,2,Sat Jul 18 07:15:06 2015 UTC,"I think that the checkpoint flag should become available only after your level exceeds a certain amount of screens. Checkpoints on a shorter level seem a little arbitrary, huh? It's a very feasible thing to include, if you ask me. It might have already been implemented, but excluded from the SDCC build 'cos instability (as can be said for a lot of other things, I imagine.)"
MarioMaker,3dnwzp,EveMK89,5,Fri Jul 17 20:24:36 2015 UTC,It would also be cool to have those giant pipes from Super Mario World that you launch out of.
MarioMaker,3dnwzp,VerticalSnoop,3,Fri Jul 17 21:30:51 2015 UTC,One of the first things I'm gonna' do is find a way to emulate those with trampolines and conveyor belts.
MarioMaker,3dnwzp,HUGE_HOG,5,Fri Jul 17 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like infoblocks would rarely be used for info, people would put them in asshole positions so that it popped up and said ""ayyy lmao"" just before you fall into the hole that it just stopped you from clearing...  My wish list:    The ability to upload an entire world/series of worlds so that people can play through them in continuity. A world map would also be amazing even if it was a linear one like in Mario 3D Land that still allowed you to include Toad houses etc.  More bosses. The 7 Koopalings are basically the same in SMB3 with a few differences in their attack patterns, even just this would be fine. Most of all, more variety in the settings. More environments such as ice and desert, palette swaps like the SMB nighttime overworld and Choco Island from SMW, and the ability to choose different music for the stages - even if it was just a few scenes that had alternative options, for example the SMW and SMB3 overworlds should be able to use the athletic theme as well as the regular music."
MarioMaker,3dnwzp,HUGE_HOG,2,Fri Jul 17 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of those are very important, to be honest. I'm especially not into the idea of worlds after how much has already been put into keeping the level system clean and efficient. If that is a thing, I suspect it'll be accessed via profile pages. The Koopalings are not necessary, and I think they might be really tough to implement based on their appearances being so inconsistent. Choosing music would be a neat feature but by no means is it mandatory or even that important."
MarioMaker,3dnwzp,HUGE_HOG,3,Fri Jul 17 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"But it's a wishlist, I get that. I'm just talking about bare-essentials here :]"
MarioMaker,3dnwzp,HUGE_HOG,3,Fri Jul 17 22:32:43 2015 UTC,"Bare essentials? Hm, fair enough!   This prick"

MarioMaker,3dncl1,Beed28,3,Fri Jul 17 17:52:36 2015 UTC,Glad to see the devil's a fan of making Mario levels too.
MarioMaker,3dncl1,VerticalSnoop,2,Fri Jul 17 19:26:57 2015 UTC,"That ending. Felt like I was watching Game of Thrones or something.  I like this though, it's tricky without being 'bullshit' hard. I like levels that take a couple of attempts to get your head around."
MarioMaker,3dncl1,HUGE_HOG,2,Fri Jul 17 22:50:42 2015 UTC,I hate auto-scrolling levels.    Instant anxiety.  Sheesh.

MarioMaker,3dmxx7,hylian122,3,Fri Jul 17 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"The simplicity of SMB has always appealed to me, but I think certain themes' mechanics will better compliment certain level-types. SMW immediately strikes me as something that'd have an emphasis on Hard Hat levels (being able to apply them manually, and all) while NSMB. U is better suited to acrobatic levels. Personally, I'd like to make levels that'd reward the player for their (usually unwarranted) curiosity. You can blame Woolly World for that, yeesh. Remote platforms... Vacant spaces... All things that should be rewarded! I do wish hidden tunnels were a thing, too... Y'know, from the NSMB. series?"
MarioMaker,3dmxx7,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"When I've created levels in games like Mario Vs. Donkey Kong Tipping Stars, I catch myself trying to theme my levels after something else, such as something from a movie or a past Mario level in some way. Several times though, I've gotten so caught up in the theming the level loses some of it's fun factor, and some don't get the reference anyway. I now know while references towards other games/media are cool, you can't let that force you to make a stinker."
MarioMaker,3dnpuu,EveMK89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:05 2015 UTC,Great way of adding some unpredictability/additional timing to an otherwise familiar obstacle
MarioMaker,3dmlet,EveMK89,3,Fri Jul 17 14:24:18 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome. I do like how when you die in a level, you can see where everyone else died around you. I wonder if, as the creator of the level, you'll be able to get kind of a master sheet that shows where everyone died when they played your level. Would be cool to see if a certain area is too hard or too easy."
MarioMaker,3dmlet,LostMarioMaker,3,Fri Jul 17 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"On that note, here's another thing I'd love to see... Infoblocks/Signs! I feel like the creator should be given the opportunity to give their own tips in their own levels that players are assured to see... But that's for another thread."
MarioMaker,3dmlet,Black_Salsa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:06:29 2015 UTC,"I had that thought too. When you create a level, you know it inside and out, so parts that can cause minor to major problems may not be apparent to you unless someone else plays it."
MarioMaker,3dmlet,hylian122,3,Fri Jul 17 15:39:38 2015 UTC,That would let us set up a big play testing community here. Someone to come in and make sure that your level achieves what you wanted it to achieve even for those who don't have it memorized.
MarioMaker,3dmlet,Black_Salsa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"I'd love that, I hope this functionality is in the game. It would suck to upload your level, having people giving you tips, then upload another version of the same level, and so on. Especially when you only have 10 slots available for uploads in the beginning. You'd need to remove other levels you've uploaded and it could become messy."
MarioMaker,3dnwiy,RotomGuy,2,Fri Jul 17 20:20:55 2015 UTC,"Bulls-eye bills were actually named before as they appeared in older games, but I hope some enemy variations have unique names as well, would make the robot saying it be funny"

MarioMaker,3dmyfv,Joshers744,5,Fri Jul 17 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"I think the featured tab makes this less of a concern, considering those are hand-picked by Nintendo. Additionally, there isn't exactly an in-game currency as such. The only real incentive to make these kinds of levels are for the 100/10 Mario Challenges, but that'd only work under the assumption that everyone would make quick-to-beat levels with them (Which I don't think will be the case - its core demographic is indebted, veteran Mario fans after all!)."
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:34 2015 UTC,That and this game should be a bit more popular. I think that was part of the problem with MvsDK:TS was that it was very hard to unlock everything because your levels would hardly get played sometimes. Now it's even slower.   It is good to know about that featured tab though. I've tried to keep up but it's hard to watch videos on my lunch while at work since most things are blocked.
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:17 2015 UTC,"I think the core demographic is a big part of it though, because like. Remember, a users publish-limit will only increase if their levels have received positive reception. I can't see this being the case for quick-to-beat levels, especially seeing as 1. You don't actually earn anything for clearing a level via Course World's Courses and 2. I don't think you can 'star' (+1) a level directly from Mario Challenge. Realistically, I don't see a resurgence of sucky players flocking to these kinds of levels."
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,InspectorSpaceman,2,Fri Jul 17 16:42:49 2015 UTC,There is a currency system in place however.  Creators seem to receive medals (granted we don't know how they are earned yet) that dictate how many stages you can upload to course world.  What we do know is that you can earn up to 10 medals (most likely) and that you begin with a 10 stage limit.  This leads us to believe 10 medals will take you to 100 levels uploaded.
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"That's not a currency system as such, it's much of a reputation system. Medals are earned when a player 'stars' your level - medals are earned in increments of 5 stars."
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,MightyArtio,3,Fri Jul 17 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"As long as we don't earn anything through playing stages, we wont say those non-levels. The closest we'll likely get is a 1up sea if 1up's do replenish your lives in 100 Mario challenge."
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,Lost_dwarf,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:34 2015 UTC,Thank god for the 3 1up limit per stage
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,HUGE_HOG,3,Fri Jul 17 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"Also you can't exceed 10/100 lives in the respective challenge modes, so you can't farm your way to like 400 lives"
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,MightyArtio,5,Fri Jul 17 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this since I don't even remember where I heard this, but I believe they do replenish your lives in the challenge, but you can only earn up to three in one level. Again that could all be rumor for all I know."
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,Lost_dwarf,3,Fri Jul 17 16:33:27 2015 UTC,I hope the 1up limit is true but wouldn't lining the stage with blasters that launch coins be a work around of that limit?
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,MightyArtio,4,Fri Jul 17 16:54:30 2015 UTC,I found a screenshot that shows the 3 1up's you can earn.  http://www.myfanaticsgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mario-Maker-Wii-U-pic7.jpg
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,hylian122,4,Fri Jul 17 17:56:24 2015 UTC,Cool. This could double as a Star Coin substitute. Hide 3 1ups in your level to encourage exploration.
MarioMaker,3dmyfv,insanesana,3,Fri Jul 17 18:45:15 2015 UTC,Oh nice! I was wondering where that idea came from.
MarioMaker,3dl445,Lost_dwarf,7,Fri Jul 17 03:43:14 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to share a little project that I did today.  I made a world map for a Mario Maker project I'm going to do once the game is released.

I know we've seen some video of courses organized as 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-1, 2-2, etc, but I've been unclear on exactly what that is. Do we know yet?

MarioMaker,3dlewz,Sublimedub42,3,Fri Jul 17 05:34:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. There was a video ( I'll try to find it it's 2:15am, I'm too lazy for this ) where the guy put a Goomba in a Mystery Block, then changes his mind and put a Bob-omb in it instead. He dragged the Bob-omb over the Mystery Block that originally contained the Goomba, and once he played the level, the Bob-omb came out and the block turned brown, indicating that there was nothing else inside."
MarioMaker,3dlewz,Black_Salsa,2,Fri Jul 17 05:57:49 2015 UTC,Was it a normal size mystery block? I think it depends on whether or not you can change the size of the block.

MarioMaker,3dlewz,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"From the footage I have seen from the Nintendo Treehouse, it looks like you can only store one item per block."
MarioMaker,3djb9i,MrStickventuresYT,6,Thu Jul 16 18:57:35 2015 UTC,"Good that the flying mechanics are still the same, someone could make an entire level based on flying around as cape mario, and having to adjust the height you go, truly a level for people who know how to mess with it"
MarioMaker,3djb9i,insanesana,5,Thu Jul 16 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"They look a little improved, actually, at least in terms of animation. Mario's Raccoon flying animation seemed really janky in the Game Awards 2014 trailer, so it's nice to see them more game accurate looking."
MarioMaker,3djb9i,hylian122,3,Thu Jul 16 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"That would be fun, though I don't think I could handle it right away. I've been replaying World and noticed that flying is something I never totally mastered. I've been trying to work on it."
MarioMaker,3djb9i,titcriss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"Dude, I don't even know how to work the cape yet lol after all these years, still. I'm still a Pro at Mario can't lie."
MarioMaker,3djb9i,Joshers744,2,Thu Jul 16 19:06:01 2015 UTC,Work on it lol. Practice for 10 minutes and you should understand pretty fast. The first level in SMW which gives you a cape has a bonus place for training in which you try to get all the coins.
MarioMaker,3djf9q,Gaminguy010,5,Thu Jul 16 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"Considering there are at least 90 ""Mystery Mushroom"" costumes now...  It's possible it was moved into that section."
MarioMaker,3djf9q,InspectorSpaceman,3,Fri Jul 17 00:15:09 2015 UTC,"There is a possibility it was removed, knowing that many stuff from the 2014 build was completely reworked for the newest one, but it can be still hidden in as an easter egg Tho I heard the probability of one coming from a normal mushroom was pretty low, so maybe no one was lucky enough to get it during the E3"
MarioMaker,3djf9q,insanesana,3,Thu Jul 16 19:49:16 2015 UTC,"It was really only trying to get that signature ""nintendo-weirdness"" in there, which was replaced by the much funner amiibo features this e3.. I think it's removed."
MarioMaker,3djf9q,ReccuringExtra,2,Thu Jul 16 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been mentioned, but there's a possibility it comes from shaking a regular Mushroom."
MarioMaker,3djf9q,RotomGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 20:16:43 2015 UTC,"The Luigi Mushroom is technically an easter egg, and based on all the footage I've seen I think eater eggs have been disabled in public demos."
MarioMaker,3djf9q,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 14:31:41 2015 UTC,It seems to be removed. Probably because they realised what a stupid idea it was.
MarioMaker,3djf9q,MightyArtio,3,Thu Jul 16 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah not the best... It felt like an early attempt to say, ""Things are the same but different!"", replaced with amiibo and fun."
MarioMaker,3djf9q,hylian122,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:16:57 2015 UTC,Well a Luigi amiibo would now render it useless
MarioMaker,3djf9q,Bad_as_Taco87,3,Thu Jul 16 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't though, would it? Costumes are just cosmetic, and the Luigi 'shroom had unique properties."
MarioMaker,3diflq,MrStickventuresYT,3,Thu Jul 16 15:06:24 2015 UTC,You beat me to it!  I wonder if the Blue Skull Rafts (ones that don't crumble) can only be placed on rails.
MarioMaker,3diflq,RotomGuy,3,Thu Jul 16 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, they just go horizontally forever if you don't put them on rails, you can see one in the adventure of link map   https://youtu.be/R04WX4dT1jc at around 50 seconds"
MarioMaker,3diflq,insanesana,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:12 2015 UTC,That's really cool to see all those old sprites used in such a unique way.
MarioMaker,3diflq,NuIIatrum,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"Cool. I'd like to see more of Bowser Jr. From the very brief glimpse here he looks like regular Bowser, just a bit shorter."
MarioMaker,3diflq,LostMarioMaker,3,Thu Jul 16 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"Tidbit about Bowser Jr./Bowser - While Bowser Jr. flings Koopa Shells when piloting the Koopa Clown Car, Bowser will fling Bob-omb's instead."
MarioMaker,3diflq,EveMK89,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:59 2015 UTC,Probably a shaken Bowser.
MarioMaker,3di9v0,Tatebeatz,5,Thu Jul 16 14:20:18 2015 UTC,"If you unlock stuff by playing through a nintendo-created campaign, that could be kinda fun in my opinion.  They could make some stuff really challenging to unlock."
MarioMaker,3di9v0,ShawnisMaximus,7,Thu Jul 16 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"Where's the video they were referring to? They didn't link it. Anyway, I'm alright with some unlockables. As someone else said, there's no way it'll be anything major, and who doesn't like unlocking stuff? It could be a badge of honor to put a piece of locked content in your level."
MarioMaker,3di9v0,jawbit,4,Thu Jul 16 16:55:50 2015 UTC,Even if it was decorative background pieces. Like statues or fountains. Those would be awesome to unlock!
MarioMaker,3di9v0,Roarkewa,3,Thu Jul 16 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with this. Mainly because I don't think any major feature will be locked ( the costumes for example ). It might be aesthetic stuff. Plus, I like unlocking things in games !"
MarioMaker,3di9v0,Black_Salsa,3,Thu Jul 16 14:42:31 2015 UTC,I heard you would be able to unlock the amiibo costumes whose retrospective amiibo you don't have by clearing the 100-Mario challenge each time. Maybe it's that?
MarioMaker,3di9v0,Beed28,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my bet is that it's limited to that, but sometimes you never know with Nintendo!"
MarioMaker,3di9v0,cripplingSeann,3,Thu Jul 16 14:58:53 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if they're going to add new features to the game gradually over time sort of like what they've been doing with Splatoon.  Maybe sometime down the road we'll be able to make games in the style of Mario 2?
MarioMaker,3di9v0,UM3000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sorta doubtful on that. Compared to the other Marios that are in Mario Maker, SMB2 is just so different."
MarioMaker,3di9v0,hylian122,2,Fri Jul 17 07:38:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's a little odd considering this is designed primarily for creation. But I guess as long as it's easy and fun (like playing the included levels), I won't complain. I don't really approve, but I'll deal. I'm going to play them all, anyway."
MarioMaker,3di9v0,HUGE_HOG,2,Thu Jul 16 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"I'm all for unlocking stuff, especially if it adds some challenge and replayability. Getting all the characters in Mario Kart 8 and Sm4sh was way too easy, took like two days apiece and I unlocked everyone by just playing the game, not going out of my way or anything."
MarioMaker,3di9v0,VerticalSnoop,2,Thu Jul 16 16:11:06 2015 UTC,I'll be okay with this as long  as the unlocking methods don't involve just playing the game. It'd be cool if you got them through the 100 Mario Challenge or by beating certain Nintendo-made stages.
MarioMaker,3di9v0,Joshers744,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"Hm. I'm ok with this, as long as it doesn't cause people to flood the servers with junk levels just to unlock stuff. Just brought something like this up in a post I made: https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioMaker/comments/3dmyfv/my_concern_for_the_super_mario_maker_community/"
MarioMaker,3dhy00,Dustfromthestars,4,Thu Jul 16 12:31:17 2015 UTC,"They make neat collectibles since Star Coins aren't present.  And yeah, they're also handy in the 10/100 Mario Challenge."
MarioMaker,3dhy00,RotomGuy,3,Thu Jul 16 12:32:04 2015 UTC,"So instead of giving you an extra life, you just collect them in your overall stats or something?"
MarioMaker,3dhy00,Black_Salsa,6,Thu Jul 16 12:34:16 2015 UTC,"In addition to what RotomGuy said, I've noticed that you can only gain 3 additional lives per level you play in the 100 Mario Challenge. Seems fair if you stumble upon a level that has ten thousands of them."
MarioMaker,3dhy00,RotomGuy,6,Thu Jul 16 13:01:02 2015 UTC,"Outside of the 10/100 Mario challenge, they just contribute to your score, so they're pretty useless, functionally.  Inside the 10/100 Mario challenge, they give you another Mario, provided you aren't already at the maximum. (10/100)"
MarioMaker,3dhy00,hylian122,3,Thu Jul 16 12:36:35 2015 UTC,"Oh it maxes out? I was wondering how that was going to work.  1-Ups will be an even bigger variable in the difficulty of the the 10/0 Mario Challenge than the difficulty of the stages chosen. If you play one round and happen to get a stage that just throws lives at you right as you're about to lose you're last few, and then another that just so happens to only have a total of 6 lives in all the stages chosen, you're going to have a very different experience.  Maybe they'll have a system built in to choose stages based on the average number of 1-ups people obtain while completing them."
MarioMaker,3dhy00,Confuzet,2,Thu Jul 16 13:01:03 2015 UTC,Are you sure about that? I was under the impression the entire point of the 100 Mario challenge was to give you 100 lives and no more than that.
MarioMaker,3dhy00,RotomGuy,5,Thu Jul 16 13:30:06 2015 UTC,"It was somewhere in the Treehouse, I believe. They were discussing how coins give you a 1-up in the challenge if you collect 100, then they said ""of course, 1-up mushrooms work too."""
MarioMaker,3dhy00,Confuzet,2,Thu Jul 16 13:55:25 2015 UTC,Oh that is rather odd then.. I mean because they call it a challenge and everything. Perhaps they call it that because once you lose all lives you start from scratch?
MarioMaker,3dhy00,landi_kong,3,Thu Jul 16 14:02:34 2015 UTC,Can confirm. 1-Ups and coins absolutely work for the 100 Mario challenge.
MarioMaker,3dhy00,Alexander12476,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"That was my thought.  Rather than have Star Coins, you could hide 3 1-up mushrooms in the level.  To truly complete the level you'd have to complete the level and find all 3 1-up mushrooms."
MarioMaker,3dhy00,LostMarioMaker,2,Sun Jul 19 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering -- we saw the one screen where you could organize 4 levels in a row to make a little world. I'm wondering if you can start people at the beginning of that world with 5 lives, and then they have to try to get through the whole thing. In that case, 1-Ups would have a point. Which would be cool."
MarioMaker,3dit2n,Confuzet,2,Thu Jul 16 16:46:03 2015 UTC,Looks as if you can add a super mushroom to the fireballs as well. Love that!
MarioMaker,3dit2n,Libers,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"The playing gave me cancer, but at least Bowser looks cuter than ever."
MarioMaker,3dgrzo,Lost_dwarf,7,Thu Jul 16 03:44:08 2015 UTC,Neat how some of the themes actually have a concrete impact on the level.   Underwater theme makes the level...uh...underwater Castle theme changes the flagpole into the axe drop Airship theme causes the screen sway effect
MarioMaker,3dgrzo,jawbit,3,Thu Jul 16 04:09:17 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the castle also add lava to the base of the level? Or am I imagining it?   Also, good catch on the Airship sway effect. I totally overlooked it."
MarioMaker,3dgrzo,Roarkewa,2,Thu Jul 16 12:43:51 2015 UTC,"The axe drop is a separate asset, IIRC."
MarioMaker,3dgrzo,RotomGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 12:48:57 2015 UTC,"Is it? I've never seen it outside a castle level, nor have I ever seen a flagpole at the end of a castle level. Could be wrong though."
MarioMaker,3dgrzo,jawbit,3,Thu Jul 16 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"Nah you're right, castles automatically end with a bridge and an axe regardless of whether or not you place a boss on the bridge"
MarioMaker,3dgrzo,HUGE_HOG,4,Thu Jul 16 13:35:52 2015 UTC,"Whoa! The Airship theme without a ""ship"" makes it feel like some sort of massive floating fortress. I'll have to play around with that."
MarioMaker,3dgrzo,hylian122,3,Thu Jul 16 13:07:22 2015 UTC,Really digging the SMB airship theme.
MarioMaker,3dgayd,Lost_dwarf,10,Thu Jul 16 01:17:53 2015 UTC,"I like the level concept, though I think the execution could've been better. Could've been a really cool maze-type level.   But man, is it just me, or do a lot of the people showcasing these levels really suuuuck at Mario?"
MarioMaker,3dgayd,LostMarioMaker,3,Thu Jul 16 02:14:52 2015 UTC,I'm convinced they're playing bad on purpose.
MarioMaker,3dgayd,VerticalSnoop,2,Thu Jul 16 11:30:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I sat here and watched it with my wife who's only been playing Mario since we got married a couple of years ago. She thought he was terrible.   It's always nice to see a stage I haven't seen  though.
MarioMaker,3dgayd,hylian122,5,Thu Jul 16 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"I wonder if holding ↓ on the white block makes you fall behind it like in SMB3 and if it can be used as part of the stage.  For example, an impossible series of enemies and you must go into the background to bypass them."
MarioMaker,3dgayd,MightyArtio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:32:47 2015 UTC,Wasn't that only on one specific block in SMB3?
MarioMaker,3dgayd,Confuzet,5,Thu Jul 16 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"Nope, every white block. It was useless except that one time but you could do it with any white block."
MarioMaker,3dgayd,MightyArtio,4,Thu Jul 16 15:54:17 2015 UTC,This appears to be the first time SMB3 colored squares are being used. Yes?
MarioMaker,3dgayd,NihlusKryik,3,Thu Jul 16 06:03:13 2015 UTC,"This concept has potential, but execution was messy here.  I did giggle when he plummeted off the edge in the first few seconds."
MarioMaker,3dg62w,MrStickventuresYT,2,Thu Jul 16 00:36:13 2015 UTC,Ths is all I could find but it's just a few seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o-CG3Mk2ZY
MarioMaker,3dg62w,MightyArtio,3,Thu Jul 16 07:52:38 2015 UTC,Thanks m9! It sound so epic...
