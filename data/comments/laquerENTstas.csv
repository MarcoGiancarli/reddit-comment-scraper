I'll smoke, apply the acrylics (this takes me forever), smoke again and file (also takes me all of eternity)   I've glued myself together pretty much every time I work with nail glue. I swear there's a leak in the bottle lol"
laquerENTstas,3c3tl4,Unicornucopias,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:33:32 2015 UTC,"that is so cute!   i have a question about those stickers. first  of all, where did you get them because they are adorable? XD and secondly, at what point did you apply them? i put them on after using a quick dry top coat once and it did not go well, the sticker seemed to sink into the polish. yesterday i applied it with a little gemstone glue on top of dry polish. the second method worked about 100x better."
laquerENTstas,3c3tl4,oph1uchus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:02:03 2015 UTC,"Hi! I got these stickers at a discount store called Family Dollar. I put them on post polish and pre top coat, and while they may look nice in the pic, they peeled up by the second day so I have no advice for you unfortunately haha."
laquerENTstas,3c3tl4,oph1uchus,2,Sun Jul 12 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"i have a Family Dollar pretty close to my house, i'll have to see if they have them! thank you."
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,Squishered,3,Thu Jul 2 03:21:56 2015 UTC,"Do you use a cuticle oil? I've been slathering my nails with olive oil and they look sooooo much better. Generally, I try to repaint my nails as soon as they start to chip, which is anywhere from 3-7 days, but I've been slacking lately. Also, acetone is better for removing polish."
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,slightlyturnedoff,2,Thu Jul 2 03:47:51 2015 UTC,I was under the (potentially super wrong) impression that acetone was harsh on the nails. I use coconut oil infrequently because I tend to wash my hands a lot due to frequent cooking and baking. I do use cerave lotion in a daily basis too.
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,slightlyturnedoff,3,Thu Jul 2 03:59:32 2015 UTC,"Not really. Non-acetone remover is meant for nail enhancements with polish over them. Acetone breaks down acrylic and gel, which is why you would use non-acetone to remove polish over acrylic. As long as you're moisturizing often, any drying will be negated. Definitely bump up your lubricating. Treat those cuticles right :)"
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,slightlyturnedoff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:02:30 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I definitely will do my best to lube the hands more often and I'll go buy some new polish remover as well. Thanks so much for the info!! <3 :)
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,Lilusa,2,Thu Jul 2 04:29:17 2015 UTC,No problem :) Hope it helps!
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,Lilusa,3,Thu Jul 2 04:32:24 2015 UTC,"I do mine every week.  If my nails start to look a bit dry, then i don't repaint for a day or two.  Moisturizing is key.  Also, using a high quality glass or crystal nail file will help.    I haven't tried it but supposedly pre natal vitamins are great for your nails."
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,BlueTheBetta,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:27:20 2015 UTC,"I've wondered about the nail file... So, this might be a personal issue but I'm super texturally sensitive and those have been worse than nails on glass for me. Do I just need to suck it up? Ugh. Hahaha I hope it's not too ridiculous to say out loud. I don't even like running my hands on rough textures... Stucco walls are the enemy."
laquerENTstas,3btz7e,FreakyJax,2,Thu Jul 2 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"glass or crystal files are actually pretty smooth to the touch.  They have a very fine grain.  It doesn't feel rough on my nail either.  I use this one, for example: http://www.sephora.com/crystal-nail-file-P310307"

For nail, skin, and hair health and strength you will want to be sure you're getting enough protein and ""good"" fats. Hemp oil and seed hearts have a complete lipid profile and avocado is wonderful for healthy nails. You will want nails that have flexibility to them because that will let them take a beating without breaking but you also want to be sure it is a thick healthy nail plate that is flexing. That will only begin at the matrix, inside the finger. Eat good things and your nails will get a great start."

laquerENTstas,2xxqom,yeoldhat,4,Wed Mar 4 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"Sinful Colors- Green Ocean, Sinful Colors- Endless Blue (accent nail, LOVE this blue), Sinful Colors- Black on Black on the other nails and Essie- Sparkle on Top..   Green Ocean is so pretty over everything i've tried it with so far. i'm tempted to pick up another bottle because i like it so much. it doesn't have gigantic flakies that stick up (even with top coat over them) like the Revlon Moon Candy ones i got from the Dollar Tree."
laquerENTstas,2xxqom,yeoldhat,2,Wed Mar 4 21:32:36 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm going to check it out

They were super duper easy to apply and were really forgiving when I messed up and closed one in on itself. I absolutely love them. A friend sent me 12 packs of them because he funded the kickstarter to support this awesome company.  Their kickstarter products haven't been released yet, though. Backer rewards just went out this week so I got mine early."
laquerENTstas,2xax8n,Lorcian,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:31:55 2015 UTC,I've sen these but I'm picky about wraps.   How thin are they? I found I prefer thinner ones to thicker.
laquerENTstas,2xax8n,Lorcian,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:30:26 2015 UTC,These ones are thick. They actually feel a bit like static clings. They seem like they can take a beating. These ones glow in the dark. The pinky and thumb has a glow in the dark smiley face like the Sherlock wallpaper. I honestly couldn't have asked for better nail wraps!
laquerENTstas,2xax8n,izaobet,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:34:12 2015 UTC,Maybe I'll give them a try once they're released. Though purely dependant on pricing to ship to the UK.
