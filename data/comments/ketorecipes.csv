ketorecipes,3e2thf,GypsyBagelhands,12,Tue Jul 21 15:02:17 2015 UTC,"Atomic Buffalo Turds  Ingredients:  15-20 jalapenos  1 lb cream cheese, softened  1lb “hot” pork sausage, cooked and crumbled  2 cups medium or sharp cheddar cheese  (optional, cayenne, mustard powder, dry rub, Worcestershire sauce, etc)  1-2lbs bacon (at least 1 strip per jalapeno half)  Toothpicks  Instructions  Cut your jalapenos in half lengthwise.  Use a knife or melon baller to remove the stem end and white membrane/seeds.  Combine your cream cheese, sausage, and cheddar, and optional additional fillings  Using a spoon, piping bag, or dishing scoop, transfer your mixture into the jalapeno halves and mold into a smooth mound shape  Wrap your jalapeno in bacon, trying to cover as much of the cheese mixture as possible.  This takes a little bit of futzing, but I managed to make it work by starting in the middle and kind of criss-crossing the bacon, then securing the ends with a toothpick.  Heat up your grill.  If you are using a gas grill, have half of it heated up to high heat, and half to low.  If you run a charcoal grill (they will always taste better on charcoal) make a 2 zone fire with a big pile of coals on one side, and a scant coating of them on the other.  Cook jalapenos over low heat until the bacon is starting to look “done” and the jalapenos themselves appear to be cooking through(don’t worry about a little of the cream cheese leaking out, it happens).  Once you’ve gotten there, transfer them to the high heat side and allow to brown and crisp.  As long as they don’t get totally charred, the bacon will remain chewy and moist where it contacts the filling/jalapeno.

ketorecipes,3e2thf,critterofthewood,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"If you start the wrap lengthwise (illustrated here) and then tuck the loose end in, they won't leak much, and you won't need toothpicks, either. I was skeptical about this method, but I tried it this weekend and it works."

ketorecipes,3e0icw,Mishtal,21,Tue Jul 21 00:42:27 2015 UTC,"I love these but I had to alter the process.  Even when you cook these bastards for 2 hours, the bacon is still well...not how I like it.  So I now pre cook my bacon, not all the way, and then apply before placing into oven.  If you like your bacon more crispy and not flimsy or under cooked, then try this."
ketorecipes,3e0icw,malicesin,5,Tue Jul 21 03:46:34 2015 UTC,Baste the bacon with butter a few times during cooking! Works for me..

ketorecipes,3dyp4d,squishybloo,5,Mon Jul 20 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest getting a good (descaled oh god so important - you don't scales stuck in the back of your mouth) salmon or arctic char, and trying it!  You just need to make sure you've got a really hot pan with a lot of oil in it.  Put the fillet skin down first and cook it for maybe 3-5 minutes until it's half cooked through.  Then take it out of the pan, carefully peel the skin off - it should be stiff from the frying - and put both the skin and the fish back in the pan.  Fish should be raw side down of course to finish cooking.    You end up with stiff crispy skin something like this if you do it right - and it's SO TASTY!"

My only suggestions would be learning how to use a slow-cooker, and maybe more chicken dishes. My basic chicken dishes all incorporate a delicious tretrad of boneless chicken thighs (frozen for convenience), your veggie(s) of choice, fats (butter mostly), and heavy cream. Thaw the chicken, pat it with salt and pepper. Cook on high heat in butter for about 3 minutes on each side to get a nice brown edge. Add the veggies, let them get started. Cover with cream and a bit of broth, then let it simmer on super low heat for about 25 minutes. Boom. Perfectly done, juicy chicken and veggies. It's a one-pot wonder."

Similarly if you like bacon less crispy or whatever, cook the bacon for less time.  edit: if you're into cauliflower, one of my favorite way to have it was tossed in evo, s&p and garlic, roasted at 400 for ~20 minutes, cool it, toss with chopped kalamata olives and some lemon juice. Great for a cold salad to take to work or whatever, I usually ate it with leftover chicken breast. I bet it would be great with bacon as well but I've never tried it."

I think a good part of it is to ""dry"" it as much as possible by draining properly and then blend it in a blender. Doing it by hand using a fork or potato masher seems to leave chunks and not do the same result as mashing potatoes.   Edit: also, that cauliflower recipe has 3.2g carbs per serving and 12g of fat."
ketorecipes,3dvktt,efie45,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"It's delicious the way I make it, so no texture problems. But I put in cauliflower (which has 22+ net carbs in a large head), half and half or cream cheese (4 carbs), and cheddar (2-3 carbs). All of the sudden, the recipe has 30 carbs, and dividing into 4 servings, that's still more than I want to spend."

ketorecipes,3dvktt,Aero_,4,Mon Jul 20 01:15:24 2015 UTC,I also mash turnips. The flavor is more intense though
ketorecipes,3dvktt,RandyTheFool,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:47:18 2015 UTC,I believe turnips aren't technically keto because they're a root vegetable and therefore contain too much starch.  although turnip fries or rutabaga fries are good.

It's like when people were like ""Mash Daikon, tastes just like taters"" Mashed Daikon tastes like cauliflower.   Maybe it's just me being a super taster (that's an actual thing, not me being an entitled twatmonkey), but I have never so far tasted anything that tasted like potatoes, mashed or otherwise."
ketorecipes,3dvktt,deusxanime,6,Mon Jul 20 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"The closest thing to potato taste is Rutabaga, but it's still half the carb count as a similar quantity of potatoes."

But my girlfriend told me later to ""never do that again"".   Never understood why it keeps getting compared to mashed potatoes. Because you mash it and it's white?"
ketorecipes,3dvktt,DrunkleDick,4,Mon Jul 20 06:18:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you messed up when making it. It shouldn't be runny or soggy. Cauliflower takes on the flavor of other stuff really well, so if you added ingredients to it, you can make it taste like what ever. Obviously, it does not taste exactly like potatoes, but when you doctor it up and make it correctly, it's pretty good.   My favorite is making loaded potatoes with it. Adding some ranch, bacon, cheddar cheese, and scallions."

Now I'm not deriding the taste of cauliflower, but people on this sub like to write things like ""Just like mashed potatoes"" ""Just like bread"" ""Just like rice"" for things that are nothing like them.   I get it that the mash isn't that bad, and it's not! I agree! This is definitely one of my preferred ways to consume cauliflower if I feel in the mood for it, but the truth is really straightforward.  It's nothing like mashed potatoes. It's even lacking in the consistency department. Maybe next time you're around some really nice mashed potato, try a half spoonful, and realise the gulf of difference. :)"
ketorecipes,3dvktt,BaneWilliams,3,Mon Jul 20 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"For better consistency try steaming the cauliflower, it should help keep it thicker. Also try not processing as much and use a mixer while incorporating a lot of air.   I'm no expert, but doing this should help out in the consistency department. At least close enough to be considered something like mashed potatoes."

ketorecipes,3dvktt,bigcitylights1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:12 2015 UTC,"It's very close in consistency if done correctly.

If you all cannot taste the difference then I have no idea what is going on in your taste buds. Mashed cauliflower has a ..... <drum roll> cauliflower taste. No matter how much stuff you put in it it will still taste of what it is made of.

Salt it for a while and remove the resulting liquid. 450-475°F oven. Get some butter/evoo in pans, put the eggplant on there. Roast 10-15 min, flip, and another 10-15 min. Gets them cooked very nicely and perfect for ""noodle"" layers in a lasagna, without the need for breading.  I layer this with homemade tomato sauce, meat, herbs, and cheese(s) (mozz/parm/prov, though I haven't tried ricotta). My non-keto family enjoys it quite a lot."

If you don't salt it though, there's some bitter compounds that remain in the eggplant through to the final product. Salting it (arrange slices in a colander, sprinkle with salt, wait at least half an hour, rinse the pieces off if you don't want that much salt, then pat dry with paper towels) will help pull those compounds out."

Mozzarella Cheese Chives Salt & Pepper Garlic   Method:  In a saucepan fry the garlic in butter or olive oil for a bit.  Add cream and chives.  Add the Tasty cheese and let it melt.  You don't want to use too much cream, the sauce should be as thick as possible - if it's runny it will ruin the end product.  Add salt and pepper too taste.  Doesn't need too much salt due to the cheese.  Steam or boil the cauliflower until tender.  I tend to put in a microwave safe container with a cm of water and lid on but with a corner up for ~4mins.  Pat it as dry as possible with paper towels and put into a reasonably deep oven dish.  Pour the creamy sauce evenly over the cauliflower.  Cover with grated Mozzarella.

ketorecipes,3dvo7q,elitemrp,2,Sun Jul 19 22:31:16 2015 UTC,"I live in RI and love clam cakes (in fact if you were on totalfark in the early 2000s you may remember what happened when someone stole my goddamn clamcakes!)  What are clam cakes? See this wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam_cake  But basically its a ball of dough with clam pieces in it and then it's deep fried and it's great dipped in chowder.  Anyway this weekend right near my house was the annual quahog festival where they sell clamcakes, chowder, fish & chips, etc so I had a craving and decided to make some low carb clam cakes to have with low carb chowder.  The chowder is from this recipe: http://peaceloveandlowcarb.com/2012/09/crock-pot-clam-chowder.html I made the chowder last month and I vaccuum sealed and froze the leftovers into single serving bags so I just microwaved a bag in a bowl for ~3 minutes.  As for the clam cakes here's the recipe (based on http://peaceloveandlowcarb.com/2012/09/crock-pot-clam-chowder.html):  Ingredients - Makes 1 Dozen (2 per serving, serves 6)   1.5 cups (144g) Carbquik 1.5 tsp salt 1.5 tsp black pepper 2 large eggs, beaten 1/2 cup almond milk 6.5 oz can of minced clams (I used Bumblebee brand), drained. 1/4 cup dried minced onions/onion flakes Oil to fry (I used refined coconut oil)   Instructions  Heat deep fryer to 325F  In a bowl add the dry ingredients. Beat the eggs and add along with the clams and almond milk. Mix until everything is incorporated and doughy. Use an ice cream scoop to drop the dough into the fryer. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes (rotate during cooking if you have a small fryer like I do). Remove from the oil and place on a rack. Serve hot.  Store leftovers (if any) in a paper lunch bag in the fridge and can be reheated in the microwave for 30-45 seconds.  Macros  115 Calories  6g fat  9g protein  5g net carbs (16g - 11g fiber)  (This doesn't include any oil from frying. I added 1/4 tsp coconut oil to MFP when adding to my diary.)  Notes  Next time I'll probably buy fresh minced clams as the Bumblee brand is 3g carbs per serving (although probably less since it's drained) which would cut down about 1.5g carbs per serving. I'd also probably substitute the almond milk with 1/4 cup clam juice instead to up the clam flavor and I'd cut the minced onions in half or omit as the clam cakes I always had never really had an onion flavor. I also may try adding a tbsp of xanthan gum to see if it makes the dough more chewy.

I liked it but not sure how biscuits or pancakes would taste since this had the clams and onions which changed the flavor.  Since it seems a lot of people use I'd say it's probably good. I'll have to try biscuits next week (unsure about trying pancakes since I love the cream cheese pancake recipe)

I wish I could give you a good recommendation as good cookbooks are precious.  Sadly, I haven't bought a keto specific recipe book.  When I get bored with what I'm eating this subreddit is great and so are other recipe sites."

ketorecipes,3dvhtx,CasualNerdAU,2,Sun Jul 19 22:47:45 2015 UTC,Sometimes called blood pudding. It's a spiced sausage made of pig's blood. Very tasty and often has wood spices like cinnamon. If you find one made without carb filler it's brilliant keto food.

ketorecipes,3dsfbv,daetara,2,Sun Jul 19 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"Some people like to put the crust in the oven for a few minutes on its own before adding the ingredients on top, the same way you would do with a pie - like a blind bake. It's not necessary at all, it's personal taste. If you do this you'd want to lay a sheet pan on top of it, too, something with a little weight to help it keep it's shape, otherwise it will shrink up in you. It does make it extra crispy, you just need to make sure you get the timing right so you don't burn it is all.   As long as you use a pizza stone, though, and high heat, for most doughs you should be ok getting a decently crisp crust. You can pick them up practically anywhere from Bed Bath and Beyond to Walmart.   Edit: correcting autocorrect"

My recipe is   2 oz cc, 2 eggs and 2tbsp almond flour. Since you're substituting coconut flour, I would guess using less (like 1 tbsp) would work.

It is said that a deck of cards serving size is roughly 3 ounces of meat, and I'm thinking that, judging by the size of the plate, asparagus, and fork, that the steak isn't as big as 6 (18 ounces) decks of cards.

To make riced cauliflower, chop up the head of the cauliflower, put those bits into a food processor. If you don't have a food processor a box grater or ricer will work. Pour the processed bits in a microwave safe bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave 8 minutes.   1 cup riced cauliflower   1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese   1 tsp dried oregano (or Italian seasoning would work here, too)  1/2 tsp garlic powder  (I didn't have any so I used onion powder)  1 tsp minced garlic   1 egg   Mix ingredients together and pour onto greased cookie sheet. Spread out into a crust shape. Mine was about 8"" but you might be able to go thinner. Brush with olive oil. Bake at 450° for 15 minutes. Take crust out of the oven and put on toppings. In the video, they use mozzarella, sundried tomatoes, olives, and artichoke hearts. Put back into the oven under the broiler for 3-4 minutes.

Last time I made Beer Can Burgers so I figured the next logical step was to make Beer Can Chicken! If you've never heard of it before, the idea is to cook the chicken slowly over indirect heat on top of an aluminum can of beer. The beer steams the chicken from the inside as it cooks! Note that you can use any beer, this particular one someone left at my house so this seemed to be a good way to get rid of it.  It would also work with a lower carb beer like Michelob ultra or Miller 64.

The cocoa doesn't mix well so I took the mixer to it again and it never regained any structure. So I cooked the batter as a chocolate crepe instead. ;-) It's very flexible, almost with the texture of injera, and I look forward to using it as a delivery mechanism for whipping cream or low-carb jam or ... anyways, if you figure out how to do this and maintain a ""puff"" instead of having it all collapse, I'd love to hear about it!  Now, the savory puffs turned out just fine! For half of them, I fine-sliced some jalapenos and laid them on the puffs while the first side was cooking, and then they cooked into the other side after flipping.

ketorecipes,3dk7g1,ren410,3,Thu Jul 16 22:56:15 2015 UTC,"There is a nice recipe out there, but unfortunately I'm not a BBQ fan..    Here's mine:     Pound of ground beef.   Packet of taco seasoning.   To tbsp salsa.   1/2 cup shredded cheddar.   Squirt of mustard.   1 egg.    5 crushed pork rinds.       Mush that shit together and wrap it around half-cut cream cheese-stuffed jalapeños.   Grill til content and top w sour cream.     ;)"
ketorecipes,3dk7g1,apwessen,6,Thu Jul 16 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"This sounds awesome. Careful on the taco mix though, some brands have sugar in them."
ketorecipes,3dk7g1,JordanFox2,3,Fri Jul 17 02:56:19 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I never buy store bought taco seasoning anymore. I use a version I found on alton brown's website and just leave out the corn starch.   2 tablespoons chili powder 1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds, freshly toasted and ground 2 teaspoons cornstarch 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons hot smoked paprika 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper"
ketorecipes,3dk7g1,barking-chicken,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:15:48 2015 UTC,"Its a negligible carb difference, but I'm commenting in case some people have a problem with cornstarch (there are allergies to it). You can use about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum instead of the cornstarch.  The entire point of the cornstarch is to slightly thicken the sauce that the taco meat is in and xanthan gum will do the same thing."
ketorecipes,3dk7g1,JordanFox2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't pay attention, but now that I think about it the packet DOES have thickening properties compared to when I make it myself.  I bet we could achieve an even better texture and make it more Keto by tossing all these spices on the meat with a nice hunk of good butter and let it cook down a little.     Drool."

ketorecipes,3dilf9,teach_math,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:05:23 2015 UTC,So did I!
ketorecipes,3dilf9,glompz,3,Fri Jul 17 01:44:24 2015 UTC,"The whole thing is about 12 carbs.   2, 8"" low-carb soft tortillas  2 cups of Fiesta blend shredded cheese  1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese  13 Pepperoni  Garlic powder  Cumin  Onion powder  Italian seasoning  I laid down the first tortilla (the ones i found were 5 net carbs a piece) and spread on 1 1/2 cups of the Fiesta blend cheese, and added the seasonings to taste. Next layer was the pepperoni, then the other 1/2 cup of the Fiesta blend and the Parmesan cheese. Placed the other tortilla on top and microwaved for about 35 seconds and sliced into 8 triangles, then microwaved for another 30 seconds. That was it!   Even my boyfriend loved it!   Edit : oh, and this was so filling i couldn't actually eat the whole thing - it tasted so good i chowed down on 5 of the triangles, but i really had to force that fifth one down."
ketorecipes,3dilf9,dmgctrl,4,Thu Jul 16 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"I do that from time to time, except for microwaving - it makes the tortillas taste like cardboard, and no wonder, with fiber content that high (this is true for Maria & Ricardo's and Joseph's Bakery brands of low-carb tortillas anyway). There are softer ones that might work with a microwave, but they usually carby (even though marketed as ""low carb"").  I'd just use a frying pan and a little of olive oil (good quality olive oil spray works well too), warm them up on both sides, fill with whatever you fancy, and then put one of another."
ketorecipes,3dilf9,just_real_quick,4,Thu Jul 16 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"Hear me out on this. Mayo. Slather 1 side of the tortilla in mayo. Throw that face down on the Pan. When you hear it sizzling flip it. Now toss the cheese and toppings on. Fold in half. Let sit for a minute or 2, then flip and brown other side.  The hot mayo on the inside helps conduct the heat to the cheese. Then the left over mayo in the pan cooks the quesadilla to a nice crunchy brown.   ((Though this is kinda the wrong sub for this, it is how you make AMAZING grilled cheese sandwiches also))"

ketorecipes,3dilf9,Tiller332,2,Fri Jul 17 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"I was reading this like, Who are you people that you put quesadillas into the microwave? It makes them floppy and soggy, and it's just as easy to fry them crispy in a pan on the stove.  I put all my toppings on one tortilla, make sure there is ample cheese on the top and bottom so the insides stick, then place it in a pan with a little oil. Flip when crispy."
ketorecipes,3dilf9,wormring,3,Thu Jul 16 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"Well, my boss won't spring for a stove in my office, but there is a microwave in the break room. If I was at home I might do it a little differently, but for on the go, this works just fine, and really is totally delicious :)  But I've never had a problem with these particular tortillas getting soggy, anyway - and that's also the other other reason I break up the microwave time, just in case.   Edit: on > in"
ketorecipes,3dilf9,glompz,2,Thu Jul 16 19:55:13 2015 UTC,Those are the most delicious tortillas.. I even prefer them to regular. They're SO soft... like someone peeled the skin right off of a baby. I want to use whatever beauty products those tortillas are using.
ketorecipes,3dilf9,Synacku,3,Fri Jul 17 00:10:30 2015 UTC,That is the creepiest way to decribe them but oh so accurate. I've also converted many family members over to those due to the texture.

ketorecipes,3dilf9,Vivicurl,3,Thu Jul 16 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"I reckon that warming the tortillas up on a pan sprayed with olive oil, putting in the toppings, and then putting it in the oven on a paper sheet would work best - but would certainly take time.

ketorecipes,3dilf9,dyelaf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I've always called them! I add a tiny bit of sauce to the bottom tortilla when it's in the pan (Rao's sauce with very few carbs) to add flavor and seasoning, then top with cheese, garlic and the top tortilla. Mmm mmm good."
ketorecipes,3dilf9,pooltable,2,Thu Jul 16 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the seasoning is my favorite part! Well, ok, maybe it's the pepperoni ;-) but adding the seasoning really does take it to another level!   Even when i just do cheese quesadillas i always add a good amount of cumin to the cheeses and a dash of onion salt."
ketorecipes,3dilf9,tchoob,4,Thu Jul 16 16:55:23 2015 UTC,I call these Tortizzas
ketorecipes,3dilf9,glompz,2,Thu Jul 16 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"When I do this, I do them folded over:   I put down two low-carb tortillas, then put my spices on them -- usually smoked paprika and Italian seasoning. I used to use the Mission brand tortillas, but lately have been using the Ole tomato basil ones. I add slices of cheese to half of the tortilla, on one side. Usually provolone, Colby Jack, and Pepper Jack. Ripping them up as necessary to get everything to fit right. I'll add whatever fillings I want -- onions, pepper rings, bacon bits, pepperonis. Whatever suits me at the time. Even deli meat like ham, turkey, corned beef, or pastrami. Fold them over and put them side by side on the plate. Before putting them in the microwave, cover with a damp paper towel. This helps keep the top and edges of the tortillas soft. If I don't do this, parts of the tortilla can become hard as a rock after they've been out of the microwave a while.  Depending on the amount of fillings, in the microwave for 60-90 seconds. I usually cover with a dome in the microwave as well, so the steam is contained in a small area and keeps things moister. Cut into sections after removing.   Yum."
ketorecipes,3dilf9,critpickle,2,Thu Jul 16 17:20:32 2015 UTC,Where does one find low carb tortillas? I haven't seen them at my stores.
ketorecipes,3dilf9,glompz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"All of the local grocery stores here in Phoenix -- Fry's, Albertson's, WalMart -- carry at least one brand. They all had Mission Carb Balance at one point, but now WalMart has the Ole brand. Every once in a while, I might find La Banderito brand. Here, it's usually one or two spots on the shelf out of about thirty, so I sometimes need to search.  Both Amazon and WalMart will ship them out, although Amazon's are very high priced. Mostly multi-packs. For example:  http://www.walmart.com/ip/27617770  http://www.walmart.com/ip/17804128  As a substitute, I sometimes use low carb Lavash Bread from Netrition:  http://www2.netrition.com/josephs_bakery_lavash_bread.html  They also have a low carb tortilla, but I've not tried the brand:  http://www2.netrition.com/low_carb_tortillas_page.html"

It's just cream cheese, parm cheese, mozzarella, egg and some spices.  Although I personally use fresh garlic I mince rather than powder.  It takes some work to get the crust crispy and crusty tasting, but totally worth the effort.  She says it's about 3 total carbs a serving including although that really depends on your cheese you can get (and don't forget what toppings you want to put on top).  If I can find my post from back when I made them myself I'll update with my count.  I make my own sauce to avoid pre-made sauce carbs; just like I grate my own cheese.  I also like to divide the crust up and make personal little tiny pizzas using a muffin-top pan.  The recipe makes 6 of them really easily and two fills me up quite well."
